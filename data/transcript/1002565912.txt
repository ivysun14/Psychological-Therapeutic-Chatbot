<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You working hard today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A full day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] who has had problems even worse than yours, when she doesn't go to meetings, uh, and she can come in and say, you know, I need to go to meetings, you know.  It gives her something that she doesn't get anywhere else.  Honestly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait.  She can come in and say she needs to go to meetings?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She doesn't go and then she goes, you know, I think I probably need to go to meetings.  That's probably part of my problem.  That and she don't take her medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she doesn't take her meds?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You've learned that, uh, kind of the hard way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The light bothering you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [PHYSICIAN NAME] I scratched my eye like probably close to a month ago, and it still hasn't healed up.  You can still see the scratch on my pupil, but it's well cleared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you get it looked at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I've been to the doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you get treated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not an ophthalmologist, just a family practitioner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] or whatever.  She gave me drops and she gave me hydrocodone for the pain, but I don't, only took one of those and it knocked me out and I didn't really like that, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She gave you pain medicine for your eye?  Eyes could be pretty painful when they hurt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it hurt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's one of the worse pains.  I understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Still get pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're, you're done taking them I assume.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got just one left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, way back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, when I first had it, when it was painful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And because I couldn't work.  So [INAUDIBLE] I mean any kind of light or anything, and light still bothers it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't you patch it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did that, but I mean shouldn't it be getting better?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, it should be.  Why don't you, you need to go to an eye doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you get you one?  Do you have one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I used to go to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] a long time ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he still in practice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can get you to see somebody today if you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] do too well without your vision.  Is it blurry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I just open this eye, yeah it's blurry.  I mean you can see the scratch on my pupil.  Like shine a light on it.  Can you see it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's kind of a funky out there to the side, that side, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you hit it with, a branch?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wasn't at work.  Honestly, it was, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In a bar fight, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not anymore.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those days are gone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was washing my Mom's, me and my father were waxing my Mom's car and I got sand and dirt in it somehow and tried to rub it out.  Obviously it just progressed from there on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you want me to, I'll be glad to get you to see somebody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My Mom said that she was going to [INAUDIBLE], I asked her this morning before I left if she would call the eye doctor for me, and she said well let's call the family practitioner first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You have insurance, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  But I mean I want my eye to get better.  I can pay for that.  I'll pay for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That sun will kill me [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, get a patch.  Did you get one of those that you strap around like a pirate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can get it in the drugstore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, stop by the drugstore and get one on the way, keep stuff out of it so you don't hurt it any worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Right, like when I'm working.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And keep it, uh, keep the sun out of it so it doesn't bother you so much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I think it was a week or two ago, I had, um, I kind of went off the handle a little bit.  I had a dentist's appointment and it was supposed to be, uh, I got there at like 8:10.  My Mom told me it was at 8:10.  It wasn't until 8:50, and so I went there and asked the woman [INAUDIBLE] she got smart with it, and then I asked her why she was being a smart ass, and I shouldn't have done that, and then me and her got arguing and she really, I really got upset and, you know, the whole time the woman was cleaning my teeth, I was, you know, she was trying to talk to me, and I, I was upset and crying and stuff.  I couldn't, it was, it was bad.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you have a bad morning before you went there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you kind of having a bad morning before you went there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, not that I can remember.  I don't know what, and lately everything, a lot, just I'm just really on edge a lot lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you taking your medicine just like before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm, I don't miss it at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When do you do, the evening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, what time of day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Whenever I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?  There's no particular time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't mean a lot, during the morning hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you eat breakfast?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do usually eat some breakfast, yeah.  Um, sometimes I'll skip it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you have anything today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] biscuits my Mom made yesterday.  I heated those up, but, um, uh, I usually don't eat a lot at lunch because I'm working, but you know, after lunch, okay, after lunch my Mom, when I get home from work, I usually eat home with my parents [INAUDIBLE] then we'll go out after meetings and eat something else.  And then usually at night, um, I get up and snack on something, 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, you know, something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, uh, pretty much routine?  Wake up at 2:00 or 3:00 and go eat something?  How's your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're busy I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were looking to get into some irrigation stuff and some different things.  Did that ever pan out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No time to start it up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, if I had other people that I could trust, you know, to do the lawn maintenance and what not, maybe I could do that, but I can't even handle really what's on my plate right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, maybe this winter when things slow down a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well that won't be until January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I mean that's kind how you have to look at things, but you really haven't planned ahead like that, you know, so much in terms of looking into what you're going to do next.  [INAUDIBLE].  Why don't you turn that light out right there?  That might help you a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's not that.  It's the fan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the breeze.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll turn it off.  You ought to have a patch on there.  That'd help you a lot, wouldn't it?  Just that, I'll see if I got one back there to give you.  I had me one in this first aid kit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's [INAUDIBLE] in duct tape.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well [INAUDIBLE] I know how to do this a little bit.  Close your eye.  [INAUDIBLE] but it'll get you through until you go get a patch for yourself.  Did they put a pressure dressing on there in the first place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pressure dressing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, like put something like I'm doing like put a little pressure on there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, she did put something on there.  I guess—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like, like, uh, this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, yep, and then I had to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it any better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  I mean I have to get, keep, you know, go get some patches and keep doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, just get one of those black pirate patches to stick on there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's fine now that you turned [INAUDIBLE].  I can't sleep with my fan on or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't sleep your eyes open.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I would [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well what's wrong with me.  I'm not happy about, you know, my stomach, you know, my belts won't fit.  I'm not used to that.  I've never had this problem.  I guess it's all from [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't accept it.  Do something about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Man, I know.  I, you know, I've been talking to my Mom about it, I really have and asking her about, you know, I even looked at the Atkins diet and, but that's, you know, it wouldn't be bad, but, and you can eat a lot on that diet, but cholesterol, you know, I want to do something that's healthy for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've even got her to get yogurt for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do, uh, what about Weight Watchers, have you done that before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you ought to do.  You don't mind going to meetings.  They have a meeting a week you go to.  It's real short.  You weigh in and they'll give you some education and the thing about Weight Watchers is that they don't, it's not a funky diet.  You eat normal food.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They teach you how to change your eating habits, and the thing that, even women, um, uh, who are better at it than we are, don't do a great job in knowing how many calories are in certain foods, and so they end up like, uh, eating small amounts of stuff, but they don't realize how many calories sometimes is in the small amount.  It's like [INAUDIBLE].  That could be about, I don't know.  Those two are probably half of your daily allowance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only because, um, of what's in them.  Whereas you could have eaten other things and getting fuller and not wanting to eat the rest of the day, but they do a thing that's pretty simple and once you learn, it's, uh, it's a point system basically.  You learn that, I mean you want to eat certain foods.  Most of us have a, have a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you could learn how many points are in each of those things, like a piece of bread has this many points, and you're allowed so many points a day, you lose weight, but, but you don't have to eat funky foods, and you don't have to like eat all fat or all something else, you know.  Some of those, those are just the weight lose programs I would not do like physician's weight loss.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, 20 years ago, I, I worked with that when I was in school on the side earning some extra money and I did the physicals and I'd seen the same people come in over the course of a year and lose a bunch of weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like this and they'd gain it all back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Gain it all back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Come back in and that's what they counted on.  [INAUDIBLE] people keep coming back for the same thing, you know.  That's not what you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Crash diets never works, not long term anyway, but Weight Watchers is good, and it doesn't cost as much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is your Mom on some kind of diet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you now, she has been in the past, uh, and she, she, uh, she doesn't follow anything, but she, she's pretty much got it figured out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With the certain types of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Same thing, yeah.  We all eat certain foods, you know, and certain amounts of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Drink a lot of water.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, she does that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I, I try to do as much as I can.  You know, I don't drink, um, I might, may sometimes drink two sodas a day at the most.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes not even but one, and, and it's not every day that I do drink one.  So, um, it's like I'm storing it, storing it a lot and it's, you know, I'm, I'm pretty active.  I mean I don't still too, too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes too maybe you eat when you're bored or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.  Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the kind of food that you tend to eat is going to be sweets.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because carbohydrates have that effect on us.  They make us feel good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, they increase dopamine in our brains, and the things that, there are certain things that, uh, increase dopamine.  Dopamine is the, is the pleasure chemical in our brains like the feel good chemical.  So you can increase dopamine in your brain by, uh, having sex, by using marijuana and cocaine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh those are—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] but it does that.  So do carbohydrates though.  Carbohydrates increase our dopamine.  That's why, you know when people are sad when they're at a funeral.  What are people bringing to the house, food.  A lot of times it's desserts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you're tired you're going to eat stuff that's, uh, chocolate maybe, that's stimulating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So now my Mom's got where we don't, I asked her not, don't buy stuff like that anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I'll get it figured out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you buy stuff at the, you go through the drive throughs though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not, no, but now when we go out to eat after meetings—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pizza and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we go, you know, you know, um, uh, Ruby Tuesday's, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things like that.  It's the same, I don't think [INAUDIBLE] was really that good if you ask me unless it's good because I don't.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you go from, uh, kicking one addiction to another to another.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's next, gambling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't like stuff like that, no.  Sex is always something, is an option for me.  That's, but now I guess I've kind of scared all the girls off.  All of them know about me now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They do?  What do you they know about you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, know I'm mean as a snake, crazy.  [INAUDIBLE] the, uh, the last girl that I was seeing, you know, I tell you, it, when I, when I saw that she didn't want to be with me anymore, it was like I had to make her feel bad by saying something bad about her to make me feel good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's pretty sad, but that's what I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what a lot of people do.  That's why people [INAUDIBLE] people, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Put people down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like bullying her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like bullying—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bullying her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somebody gets something, you go like yeah, but, you know, [INAUDIBLE] something good happens to them, we'll go yeah, but they'll, they'll screw it up or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean she was a really sweet girl.  I mean she just didn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you talk to her still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you see her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  She, she was, she was a, um, um, somebody I met at the meetings and, uh, she worked at the emergency room, and I would go up there and see her, and, uh, on her breaks, stuff like that, and, uh, she, she, she's not, she doesn't work at the emergency, she, um, is a surgeon's assistant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like plastic surgery and stuff like that, and, um, I forget what I was going to say before that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She work out in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean she's working with my neighbor, [INAUDIBLE] some other people that I knew, but I mean she, she was a really good girl.  I mean she just, it was me, not getting what I wanted.  So, but anyway, I, she, she, uh, quit coming for a while, and, uh, now she's back, but she, she doesn't come to the meetings that I go to.  She ain't going to come—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's avoiding you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, you know, it will make her feel uncomfortable.  She, she's kind of soft spoken.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you ever apologize to her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I didn't make amends to her, not, not yet.  No, I don't want to, cause like in the past, her boyfriends, you know, they beat her up.  When she first got here, she, she came with a black guy because her boyfriend was abusing her and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So why wouldn't you apologize?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I didn't have a chance to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I don't see her.  I don't call her up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think it, I mean yeah, I, I would like to apologize to her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because it bothers you, that's why.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It bothers you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does bother you because I did all that stuff to her that I said.  What bothers me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you mistreated her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, just apologize.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really don't have her number anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh man, listen to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I, I don't think I do.  I really don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know where she lives?  You could mail her a letter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could apologize.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you think it's necessary?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For you, you tell me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I just, maybe when the time is right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When is it right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It isn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's kind of like, uh, somebody does something or gives you something that you forget to thank them, you know.  You probably get—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] a certain window, but if you forget within that window, [INAUDIBLE] too late to thank them.  What would you want, reverse the situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What situation?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somebody is mean to you and a year later they apologize, would it better than nothing?  That's, that's one of your steps, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I don't want to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that, isn't that part of your recovery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Making amends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what, yeah.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No matter how long ago it was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I don't want her to think I'm trying to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Weasel back in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That and I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't want her to call the police on me or nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She, she can call the police and if they see a letter that says you're apologizing, what are they going to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did I tell you I'm on probation and all that stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's all done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm trying to get, I, I don't mean to get off the subject, but I see where you're coming from, yeah.  I, I've been thinking about how I could go about doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know how to do that.  You know how to apologize.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do, but how do you get there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One sentence, I'm sorry the way I treated you period.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's a beautiful girl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then walk away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's really sweet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But don't get into anything else.  Just sorry the way I treated you period, and move on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know one thing that was bad about her that I, I didn't really, it didn't really bother me was that she had a 2 year old son [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's, that's tough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's sure tough.  A single parent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretty hard.  She got family here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  They help her out.  That's good.  She's got good family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does she live with them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She lives right behind them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So look, you're not doing it so, even so much for her, you're doing it for yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're pretty hard on yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Part of, part of the making your amends.  Isn't, isn't there some advice in there where you forgive yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you make mistakes, but you're not a bad person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I try not to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all you can do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] do is try.  Uh, I'll look at your medicines because you tend to get depressed, there are other medicines.  You've never been on Lamictal, remember that drug?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's one thing [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've heard of that drug?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You would take it in addition to what you're taking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mood swings and depression.  It's got an indication for bipolar depression and maybe it'll replace your Depakote if we were able to replace your Depakote.  You may end up just taking both of them.  Perhaps you could get by with a lower dose of Depakote because Depakote, um, some people it can increase appetite.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's what's happening to you because you've been on it for forever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's been more research, but it might help your depression more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That goes, I think the irritability stuff you're talking about too is part of your depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You think so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This idea of building a place on your parent's property, does that excite you or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, yeah.  I mean that's, that's the only thing I, I can afford.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but that doesn't answer my question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Yeah, it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It does.  I mean I'm, I'm glad to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or have your own place someplace else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean yeah, that would be good.  I would like to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't afford that.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you can afford, find somewhere else of something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't like that.  No, but, uh, it's too late now.  We've already got the pad.  I'm getting, I'm almost getting the pad with all the dirt and, uh, built up and all the stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's not, I'm just asking because you said when you first came in I'm not sure that's what's stressing me out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right because, well, what I meant by that is, is a lot of, my Dad asked me something [INAUDIBLE] and I told him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean to go out there and work on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Work on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's, what's he ask you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, he asked me now do you want, you know, a window here or a window there [INAUDIBLE] want sliding glass doors for my deck, and I just keep telling him I want the cheapest thing, whatever's cheapest, you know.  I just, I really enjoy me and, you know, um, I remember what I was going to tell you [INAUDIBLE].  Um, I really enjoy, uh, you know, like having cookouts and stuff like that and maybe I'll have just a small deck on it, you know, just a small deck on the front of it, and, uh, and it's, it's hidden from their view because it's behind my mother's barn and it's not that big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you have a view of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In, in the wintertime, it's in the woods with the trees, but in the wintertime when the leaves fall, the lake's right there, but I mean [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But the lake is right there and it's like, it's pretty.  You could even see it from our house and I'm closer, um, where I'll be.  So it, it just aggravates me that it's taking so long, and they've been, I mean we've been talking about this and planning this for a year now or more, and I mean I can remember we got, it's just going to be like a Hoover building, a metal structure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you can make apartments out of them fairly simply, and the other, I've got, my Mom's got a barn that's enclosed and I've got a shed just, with just a roof, and those guys built my Mom's barn in a couple of days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I just don't understand.  It's taking so damned long.  It just aggravates me so bad.  I mean it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well is that partly you because you can't decide what you want?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean it's like, it's on me right now because I've got to, um, get the dirt, and level it and all that stuff like that and my Dad tries to save as much money as he can [INAUDIBLE] I understand that but, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME] we, he helped me get a loan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, for the, because I paid off my truck and he got me, um, the amount of money that he borrowed it'll be about the same payments that my truck would be, you know, $300 or $400 a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So with him knowing that, I just don't understand why [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know.  Well I guess I just, you know, go ahead with, with what, um, needed to be done, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess he would say the same thing about you, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.  It goes both ways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why aren't you out there doing what you need to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME] I'm working all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm just saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He wouldn't be asking you if he didn't think that you could do more I guess, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And I've had my friend come over there and help me get it leveled and stuff like that because he's, he's good at doing, you know, stuff like that, and he, he's like a jack of all trades and, uh, yesterday I spent all day tilling up the garden [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're set on your medicines?  You got enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, right now, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll think about the Lamictal.  I'll give you some information on it, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we'd all be taking that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.</p>

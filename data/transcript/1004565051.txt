<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where do we start today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess - trying to think of a few different things - I'm still trying to figure out the job stuff. I think - I ended up applying for something Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I haven't done - and part of that is today, Monday, is when things update except things haven't been updated today yet. So, sometimes things don't actually update on Monday even though they're supposed to. Or it could be that there's no new jobs and stuff. And I talked to my mom on Friday and she said again that she wasn't planning the event and it happened five months. And since I'm not doing music stuff now this summer I should consider applying to the temp agency. And I'm just not sure if that's a good idea or a bad idea or what or if it's a better idea to look at non-library before applying to a temp agency. I mean I guess there's nothing saying I can't do both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think there's one right answer here. You just need to focus your time somehow and decided what, how to use the time you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I'm just kind of afraid that I'll - well I guess I can always send in my application. If they don't have anything, they don't have anything for me which I'm sort of expecting is the case. That I'll never hear back from them, which is kind of what happened the last time. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was the last time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fall 2009. Actually maybe Summer 2009. The semester before I started school stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know - so you've done this before. What's the process for applying to the temp agency?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go to their website and fill out their form. And that's what I did. And then a person I think a couple weeks later called me and asked me some more questions; said she'd call me if she had anything. And then I never heard from them again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So certainly wouldn't be much different than what you're doing what now in the application part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I guess my mom says that they also post jobs on their website and that I should be applying to those but I haven't really looked at their website to see if that's the case and then which one of those to apply for. And I don't even know how much they'd be paying. What if they're paying $8 an hour for temping and it's not worth my time? I don't even know what the minimum wage is here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that seems like something you need to figure - actually go onto the website and find out before you rule it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is that the website it probably won't tell me how much they pay. I'm guessing. It just seems a lot of the time people don't say how much they're paying for something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it might be different depending on what placement you got as well. So there are some unknowns here. You can't pretend to know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like really frustrating because I just can't get a job in the end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really want your career job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My career job...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have that right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't even know if I can get a non-career job if I tried applying for these administrative assistant positions. And then if I do one of those, okay so what if I get one and it's 35 hours a week and whatever I'm doing I'll be administrative stuff ever and then I can't, if I did then get an interview later for an archive position or something like that I couldn't just leave. [00:04:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you could. Lots of people do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. In that case then, I probably...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lots of people look for jobs while they have the job that's not their dream job. And you can leave. There's no contract holding you to forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sometimes there's a contract holding to you for a year or whatever and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most positions are work-at-will and fire-at-will because that protects the company as well. And academic jobs often have a contract to sign on for the academic year. And if you work in a library that's related to a university that might be the case. But I wouldn't assume that that's the case for those other types of positions that you might look at. You certainly can't rule it out without knowing, not for sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But there's no way to know until you have an interview or something and then if you ask in the interview you'll look bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But see you would, you would ask at the offer, right, because the goal here is to get a job and the steps that you need to go through are apply, do well at the interview, get the offer. Once you get the offer that's when you can ask those kinds of questions and up until that time you're not committing to anything. And once you have the offer they're not going to rescind it based on the fact that you're asking questions. So I think it's important not to rule things out and not to cut yourself out of an opportunity before you actually know that there really is a problem. You will feel better when you have a little bit more independence and you're not going to have that kind of independence without an income. And you're going to feel very tied because you're reliant upon your parents for money. [00:06:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I'm feeling a little bit less bad about that now because this past, a week ago, last Sunday they finally sold the old house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They closed so that means they're no longer paying for two houses. And so they could use - and they sold the old house for more than they bought the new house for so they can completely pay off the mortgage and be done with it and still have some money left over. So now they have a savings and their expenses are way less than what they'd be making. So I cannot actually have to worry about feeling as guilty about being supported by them. They probably - they still want me to get a job but I'm less concerned about them now because they actually can afford to support me because they sold the house. They were also paying the property taxes on the house because they were renting it before and I guess the amount of property tax was more than they were charging in rent. So they're sort of almost [inaudible at 00:07:45] about that. But now that they sold the house they can now have more money for things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure that's really for them as well as for you. [00:08:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I still, I just don't know. There must be some job out there that I'm qualified for that would actually want to hire me but I'm having so much trouble finding it and it's really overwhelming. And okay I can search Yale for all their administrative assistant positions but then do I search all the other universities, how often do I search them, do I apply for everything that I'm remotely qualified for? I'm just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many hours a day are you spending doing jobs search related stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that many. I'm spending a couple hours a week, not including the writing of cover letters.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you include that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe more. Well maybe I don't know about six hours a week I think, which is not that much time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a lot of other time. So I mean there's two ways to look at that, adding up the time and looking at what you're spending doing it. If you're spending six hours a week right now looking for a job, there's no prohibition there against being able to work part-time and still have six hours left over to continue to look for work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I could find something part time as opposed to something full time, which I don't know if I can. I'm looking - definitely I applied to a lot of part-time jobs in my field. I haven't really applied to any part-time jobs not in my field, so I don't actually know if that would actually be the case. What if I got - what if the only things that are available are things that are 35 to 40 hours a week? [00:10:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you'd spend 1-1/4 hours after work at night and you'd still have six hours to apply for jobs. And if you only did it Monday through Thursday and spent 1-1/2 hours a couple nights a week and an hour on the other nights and still have time to put in the amount of time you're putting in now. The other way of looking at it is if you're spending six hours a week give or take looking for jobs now, you could double that or triple that and still have time to play. And you might get to success a little faster.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, but there's a certain point in which I'm looking for more jobs and I spend more time and more jobs don't materialize. So if I were spending - I think the difference between spending 10 and 40 hours a week searching for jobs, I think I'd have the same amount of success at 10 that I would at 40 because I don't think there are all these tons and tons and tons of jobs that I'm missing. But I mean right now of course it figures a completely even if I'm not sure of what the real amount is because it's like a little bit here, a little bit there and then I write a cover letter. But if just sort of basing it on the fact that it takes me about an hour or so to write a cover letter and I wrote three cover letters last week and then spent more time on the websites looking at the ads and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's probably a pretty good estimate. And it doesn't have to be exact for the purposes of figuring out where you could fit that in if you were working another job or where you could add a little bit more to expand the search. You said you kind of looked through Yale for non - for administrative type jobs but not the other universities. There's lots of universities around here so if you're looking at Yale why not the other universities? I mean there are lots of fairly accessible universities around here if you're opening yourself up to that search already. [00:12:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those other ones are less big than Yale so I probably shouldn't be checking them as often anyways because they're probably not posting nearly as many jobs. Because - like Brown for example is tiny compared to Yale. Their library, they share it with whatever that theological school that's near them. They don't even have their own library they're that small. So, yes, so I could check the Yale site every day or something, but schools like Brown are probably, if I check once a week, they may not update it that often. They may not have any jobs to begin with. I guess for me to be seeing stuff like that maybe. And maybe I'd like a better chance at those.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you might not spend time checking them every day but certainly giving them some time. These people do work there. And there are lots of colleges around. Even things that are accessible to your bus, which makes it easier for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it's on the line and then you have to walk a bit. It's not quite as accessible as you think. I could still apply but it would be - I'd probably want a car if I were working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not that far. [00:14:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it depends on what - I guess if I had my own office or desk then it would - I'm always thinking about this as like carrying a backpack with all my stuff in it ever. When really if I have an office...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're convincing yourself out of a job that you don't even know exists.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I've applied for things at other schools. I applied for the research librarian thing there that I like and almost qualified for maybe. I just haven't looked at their administrative assistant jobs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it's not your ideal plan, but your ideal plan is not looking for jobs for five or six months either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And having a job that you settle for for now doesn't mean it has to be the job that you have forever and that you have to give up on Plan A. It just means you're just taking something in its place for now because that might be the only thing available to you now. Holding out hope for the better thing or the thing that you're imagining can still be there; doesn't mean that it can't be there as a hope.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm just worried about also like a full-time job in something that I'm not thrilled to have sucking my soul out and not even having the energy to search for the [inaudible at 00:15:43], you know, having the energy to do anything, I'm running out of time. If it's 40 hours a week - I'd much prefer looking for part-time jobs out of my field than full-time ones, especially 20 hours a week. I feel like there are less of those. I just, I don't know. There's a part of me that thinks I'm completely unhireable. And I don't even know if I have any interview clothes so I don't know what happened if I did get an interview. I don't think my interview clothes fit any more. I don't even know what I'm going to wear for that informational interview thing I have on Wednesday. I assume I should be dressed up for it but I don't know how dressed up I would be. Now that it's summer, I can't just wear corduroys and a sweater.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you wear if you went to work there? [00:16:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I went to work there? I'm not sure. If it's an archivist job then I might be enough out of the public that I could wear something like what I'm wearing right now and get away with it. I don't know what the dress code is though. But I feel like it should be slightly nicer. Like I'd be wearing my boots and not my sandals. I don't wear that [inaudible at 00:17:20] blouse - but I don't have the money to go shopping for clothing and the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Generally people try to dress one step dressier when they're meeting someone than they would if they already knew that person for a work setting. So it might be, I mean with the expectation and hope that you're going to have interviews to go on, it might be worthwhile to invest in one outfit that would be appropriate. Most things that you're applying for, the same kind of outfit would work for your interviews because you are applying for things that are related. So getting something a little more dressier than what you're wearing now, hopefully for the informational interview that you have on Wednesday and then with the hope that you're going to repeat that outfit on lots of interviews. It's probably a good investment. [00:18:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I bought a pair of pants in January, or December, that I haven't worn yet, but I don't even know if they still fit anymore and I'm thinking oh no after I gained all this weight and now if those pants don't fit me. Those I didn't spend that much money on because, or any money on because my grandma did, but my grandma probably spent a bunch of money on them. I'd feel bad getting more clothes and if it's all because I've gained weight then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you do need something to wear to meet people for interviews. You can't do anything about - if you've gained weight and the previous outfits don't fit you can't do anything about that immediately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know if I have time to go clothes shopping in the next day or two, or next day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you doing the rest of the day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to dye yarn except the other thing is it also requires transportation there and stuff. And also, it's too late. It's too late because I'm also too short for my own good. So any nice clothing that I'd be getting, any pants, would need to be hemmed because even petite pants are too long for me. And because they're stupid, for some reason the petite sizes they make the waist smaller even though what petite sizes should be is the same - like a 12 should be a 12 waistband; it'd just be shorter. But I'm pretty sure, yes I'm pretty sure I've got to get things hemmed. And I don't have a sewing machine or the ability to do that. It is too late, I think. I can see if I have a skirt that fits and isn't that bad. [00:20:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't have enough time to get something altered for Wednesday but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be preparing for the future.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like if I ask my mom for money for clothes she'll get annoyed at me because she offered me that bribe to her clothes if I lost weight and I haven't lost weight. I mean I told her that I didn't want that as an incentive because it was stupid and I'd rather have the incentive of wanting to lose weight and I'd rather be happy with my weight as it is than to try to lose weight just for new clothes. But yes, it really feels like with my mom, she'll gladly pay for clothes if it's because I've lost weight but if I've gained weight then she's like you've gained weight. And she'll still pay for it but less enthusiastically. And I can't magically lose weight between now and Wednesday. That's the other thing that I'm worried about my weight a little. I know I'm not doing much about it because all the dieting, especially if I go out to eat, I can't really count the calories if I don't know the calories. And I have no way of knowing the calories.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, going out to eat is hard because you don't know exactly what they're putting in things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Like how much oil and how much whatever, so. My whole only eating when I was hungry thing isn't really working so well any more. I might end up walking home from here but - and I did do a little bit of walking yesterday and I did a little bit of walking on Saturday but it's not really adding up fast enough. So now I have all this guilt about having gained weight because I don't have clothes that fit for my informational interview. And for all I know the pants that I got in January still will fit because these pants fit and I got them in November. So I might be okay. I just have to try to walk. [00:22:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you might take some time to go through your wardrobe and have that kind of stuff figured out, what fits, what you would wear, both for this thing on Wednesday but also for things that you might get in the future so it's not something that's kind of preventing you or feeling like a sort of scary what if that you're not prepared for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't want to have to try to go out to the galleria. Take the bus all the way out there and wait for the bus and take the bus all the way back and have all my heavy bags of clothes and stuff and spend money that I don't have on clothing or ask my mom for clothing. But at there she should support this because it's clothing for job interviews. And it's not I frivolously spend money on clothing all the time. But at the same time I fear that I'm going to get yelled at or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do need something appropriate to wear so you present well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How can I do that without incurring guilt or something? My guess is to use my credit card that my parents pay for and not say anything and if they ask about it be like yes I got enough for a job interview. But I try to avoid using my credit card for most things. I only use it for medicines and groceries but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like going through your wardrobe is the first step, figuring out what you really have and what you really need. And then if you really need a new outfit for an interview, sounds like a good investment. [00:24:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess something is that the weather - like I could deal with wearing a light sweater for a couple of hours. It wouldn't kill me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wouldn't kill you but it also might not have you present the best possible because it's a little out of place to be wearing a sweater in mid May.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The problem is that nice blouses are more fitted and stuff and I just don't have any nice blouses. Maybe it's out of place but then again, there also used to be a time when I didn't even wear short sleeves and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you start wearing short sleeves?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Junior year of college. I mean there was - when I was in that Orthodox place there was a point where I wasn't wearing short sleeves and stuff. And so that was a long time ago but if there's a possibility that I could be someone who doesn't wear short sleeves. And it's not like a super duper heavy fuzzy sweater; it's a light sweater. Or I could get cold easily. I have my sweatshirt with me because I could get cold easily slash (ph) Sydney saying super duper air condition. And archives are usually climate controlled. So it wouldn't be the most preposterous thing in the world for me to be wearing long sleeves if it were a lighter sweater or if it were a cardigan over a tank top, a personal thing. [00:26:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So check what you got. Sounds like that would help you if you could find something that would work, it sounds like that would help you feel better or at least know that you had gone through and tried to find something that worked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, now that I think about it, yes I do have some long sleeved shirts that I could wear one of them. But they have a weird neckline so. No matter what it's going to be a compromise of some sort because, I don't know. In the summer I never usually wear - and when I was applying for jobs that summer before library school was up I was, when I did have those interviews I ended up wearing my suit because I thought that I should be that dressed up, which I probably shouldn't have been in retrospect. Suit has long sleeves. Yes, I don't really have that many nice shirts and then I don't even know how nice of a short sleeved shirt I would be wearing if I was to wear one. Mentally going through my wardrobe in my head. Nothing feels - a lot of things would be something buttoned down, would it be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be. Usually business casual, a buttoned down shirt fits for that description.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like so out of my style anyways, it's something - I think the reason I don't have them is because it's not something I would wear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not what you would choose but part of the interviewing game is kind of playing a little bit of the I guess the somewhat conservative impression until you know what they're like. And then you don't have to do that forever, but people tend to reign in personality and do something a little more conservative than what they would typically would do when they're first meeting someone or when they're first presenting for something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's so annoying because I've had things that were more formal than that for summer, like a dress but I can't wear a dress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could depending upon how fancy of a dress it is. You can't wear a dress that you would wear to a wedding, but if you have a more casual dress. It sounds to me like - you said a suit felt too formal. [00:28:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the library's not usually a formal workplace. It's not like you're going to work in a law office where...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's why really informal dress isn't so really formal. I don't really - I have this prom dress that's nice but it's not the kind of thing you would wear to work. It would be like a nice summer dress you might wear outside. Or I have this other one that's really nice but I guess it's something I could wear to a less formal wedding, so it's still too formal for, yes. So I have not formal at all and too formal and it's the in-between that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's hard and it sounds like that's what you feel would be a best fit for the kinds of places you're applying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I assume. I assume I can't get away with wearing my nice Nordstrom's dress to a job interview. Just - it's just so outside my style, the whole business casual or business formal thing. They're so outside of what I would ever wear that means I don't just have those clothes like other people do because there are people who might dress like that for library school. I certainly was never one of them. I mean maybe they dressed that way because they had a job before their class or after their class and that's how they went to work. But I mean I think it's also the way some people dress all the time and I don't. I have something more nicely cut t-shirts with cap sleeves but I don't know if that would be something that would work or if it's not enough. [00:30:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have - I mean, again this is one of those things where I think that we're past the era of having strict rules about it. There's a little bit more leeway but, so it's a mixture of what you think is expected of you by others and what's comfortable for you. There's some general guidelines that you can pay attention to and usually people avoid wearing things with writing on them, slogans...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Found I could [inaudible at 00:31:25]. Only recently do I have t-shirts that actually have things on them but I have a ton of t-shirts that have absolutely nothing on them. But they're still t-shirts and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, they're pretty casual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels casual. It really sucks because if I was working inside an archive, I probably could get away with all the dirty (ph) t-shirts ever. I could probably dye my hair crazy colors too for that matter...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Once you have the job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Once I have the job. But before I have the job...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before you have the job then a little bit more game playing. [00:32:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My best bet might be the out-of-season sweater versus if I don't have the time to go to the store and get something nice, or rather the ability to get to the store. I could call Sydney and see if he would want to go shopping with me so I could have something to wear. But that might be relying on him and I'm guessing that I would probably not be up for anything if I call him now. So I can't really guarantee it. And it seems even sillier to take a cab to the mall and back. I guess I just also hate going to the mall because sometimes I go in there and there isn't even anything that I would want to wear there because my style is so out of place slash also lots of stores that should be selling things that have gone towards the more cashy side and I can no longer go there and expect to find something that would work. I'm not even sure where professional people go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you ever shop online?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay if I work off of Wednesday...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Work off from Wednesday but there's also the hope that you're going to have interviews past Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like shopping - the problem is because then I'd try things on and I'd have to return them if they don't fit. And if I don't know my size especially with a fitted shirt, I don't want to do that online because then I'd have to check the return policies and then I have to make a trip to the post office instead, which is about as annoying as going to the store once, trying on something and getting a bazillion of them. Which is what I usually do is find something I like and get it in all the different colors that work and I don't have to think about it too much. I think what kind of things do I have hidden in my closet that would - I think I'll probably get away with a skirt for tomorrow or Wednesday and then if not... [00:34:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well see what you have - there's two things. There's planning for Wednesday, which there's not a lot of time before then. You have the rest of today and tomorrow and that's it. But there's also planning for the eventuality that you're going to have another interview later than that and you don't want to be in the same space where it's Monday afternoon and you have an interview in a day and a half and you're not sure if you have anything appropriate. So it's coming into the rest of spring and summer; hopefully there'll be more interviews. Planning a time to go out and get something that will be your go-to outfit so you won't have this worry next time around. And then spending some time in your closet today coming up with something to wear for Wednesday that you feel as good about as possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I feel like one outfit would be enough and I'm pretty sure most places I could get away with a more casual dress code. I would obviously ask at the interview what their dress code is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And right now we're at the getting a job part. And once you have the job you can worry about the details of that. But that first impression that you make in person probably counts for something. And if you feel confident because it fits well, you will feel better than if you're wearing something that you're uncomfortable in. And if you feel comfortable because you're sort of fitting in with the expectation, then it would be better than worrying that you're somehow sending the wrong signal. And once you have the job and they know you, you can wear things that are more reflective of who you are. But they don't know that yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And this isn't even a job interview. It's an informational interview so I probably could just get away with the long sleeve shirt with the - it's semi-formal and whatever because it's an informational interview and not job interview. And I don't think whatever impression I make - it's still more conservative than what I might otherwise wear and it's not like she's going to be like oh well, she wasn't wearing the nicest pants ever. If she even talks to the people, Officer's Committee, I doubt it's going to be about what I'm wearing if I'm not wearing something ridiculous as long as I'm wearing something neutral. [00:36:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They might be more like oh wow she's really, sounds really inspired and hard-working; you should totally consider her for this position would be more what the one would say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the most that - I mean it's unlikely that she's going to be talking about what you're wearing. You want to send a message from what you're wearing that you care. So you want to look neat and you want to look clean, and you want to look like you care about meeting her and the position. I know it's not a specific position but clearly you're going to her because you're interested in getting a job in the field. So you just don't want to - you don't want there to be any reason for her to think you're not serious about wanting to work in the field.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I should dress as nicely as if it were a job interview or can I do it like a step down from that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you have to interpret that for what it means for you. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not a very helpful answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's what message do you want to send.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess the question is if it were a step down from job interview clothing is that the message...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that make it seem less important?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, or would they be like oh that's what I normally wear to work. Okay I'm not thinking anything of this at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think if it's what somebody else would normally wear for that same position or for a position that's equal to what you would be looking for, that probably would be fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that's what I was thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think if it's less casual than that then you wonder did she put any thought into what she was doing today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I'll probably wear a skirt and a long sleeved shirt and not worry about trying to go shopping in the next day or so. But, yes, this will really allow me to - this is why I don't want to do corporate in general like a Yale job as an office assistant. I probably would have to dress nicer and I'd really hate that I'll have to spend money on these clothes that I don't feel comfortable in and wear them on a daily basis. And then they're dry clean only and I'd actually have to take them to the dry cleaners or something. And that's why I'm so - you're allowed to avoid wanting to - I'd much rather have an archives job where I'm [inaudible at 00:39:40] and not interacting with anyone outside of the company and can wear something more laid back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's definitely Plan A and hopefully you'll get there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems so ridiculous that it should matter what I'm wearing beyond a certain point. I don't want to - it's just so not my style and I'm dressing older than I am and then I feel ridiculous dressing older than I am because I look weird trying to be an adult or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are an adult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay trying to be more of an adult, an older adult. Like when I was wearing that suit, I did not look like me. [00:40:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not what you wear on a regular basis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, again I don't want to throw away the nicer shorts and shirts that I have. If I did, it was because they weren't fitting me that well any more. They were actually get old and worn out and not nice any more. If I got rid of them it was for a reason. I'm just trying to mentally picture what I still have in my wardrobe, if anything, would even remotely work. And I'm just thinking that nothing - but if I wear a dress it would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would feel uncomfortable in the dresses?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, if I was wearing a summer dress - it's a really nice dress and I really like it and it's not casual per se, but it's nice but it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't you ask your housemates for some real life opinions where they can actually see what you're talking about? And get some feedback from people what they would - think that's something you'd feel comfortable doing? Just asking...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe because of - but then I'd go home and they'd say no, none of these work and then I don't have anything to wear and then I'm screwed anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay so you asked the question what would work best because it sounds like you need to pick something from your wardrobe; you don't feel like you have time to go out and get something different. So don't ask them do any of these work, because then they can say no, none of them work. Ask them these are my options... [00:42:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I'll have to try everything on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes you might actually have to do some work to get ready for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is more work than possibly going to the store and getting something else if anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then pick one. You have to do some work here. You have to either pick something out of your wardrobe or you have to go shopping. You can't get out of both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It also seems having a housemate around that would have the time to look at me changing would probably seem gross...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want this to be impossible? You're working really hard to make it as impossible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not just always there. Some of them are, but maybe I can theoretically borrow something from Rebecca (ph) because she's possibly my size but sort of. I don't think I could just do that. I don't think anything works. There's no good answer to this. I could super-duper overdress and that would be a horrible idea. I could overdress somewhat. I could under dress, or I could go out and buy something else. That doesn't sound like my housemates necessarily have the best opinions, either because most of them aren't working for corporate things anyways. Naomi is a programmer and can wear pretty much whatever she wants to wear, again Aaron is a librarian and has, also she has this baby, and Aimee's unemployed. And Rebecca's going to be at work until later anyways. And then she's going out to dance, so that's actually not - I don't think that any of them are really qualified to give me a good answer for this because none of them are doing what I'm doing right now. [00:44:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lee is a librarian?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes but he's so librarian - but this is not for library things in general. This is going to be what I wear to a job interview. Also Aaron is male. So he's like - and I guess he has to dress up more in the lab in school and now they [ran off] (ph) they could dress up slightly less but I think he's going to tell me that none of them work if I asked him. I think that - yes. The best answer I look at is either none of them work or oh they're all fine and - sorry, turn off the sound. And it isn't even a real phone call anyways. Actually, turn - sorry about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Usually I'm really good at remembering to turn on my silent and for some reason I didn't today. But, I think the best bet is to go out and find a shirt somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's interesting because where you started was that would be the worst thing to have to do. I'm sure the easier...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but the other options are even worse. I don't know - I guess I could stop by the thrift store which is right over here and if I find something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...there that fits - considering that's where I've gotten some of my nicer new light shirts that I've really, really liked anyways, I'm more likely to find something there than at the mall and then I don't have to go to the mall because I can just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That would be one way to reduce some of the hassle from the idea of going on a shopping expedition. That's just half a block away really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That would be probably my best bet I think because otherwise I'd have to go on some shopping expedition and I don't want to do that and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are the clerks there at all helpful? I mean I see a lot of clothes they might have a little advice. [00:46:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I never really think of asking the clerks. I just usually look for what I think looks nice and try things on and then get them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I know that they don't have an expertise in what you're applying for but they do see a lot of clothes so they have a - sometimes that just gives you a perspective on what level of formality different items kind of fit for. So you can sort of, you could say hey I'm looking to go on an informational interview and applying for these types of jobs; would this fit? And they might know, they might have some useful feedback, a helpful idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Of course this also depends on what they have in stock.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. They may not have anything that fits for what you need right now. Or they might but at least it's not a big trek out of your way or a lot of time expended to find out since it is right there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or a lot of money expended because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if they don't have anything good it'll be free.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yes. But if they did have something good it wouldn't be that expensive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It'll be reasonable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because everything I've got there has been reasonable and I've liked everything I've gotten there pretty much. So I probably could do that, though that doesn't solve the pants situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there still also a second hand store? There used to be one on the Square too that was right off the red line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there's the Goodwill Store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought there was...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh there's another one - oh you're right. I think it has...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's one across the street. I don't remember the name of it but I thought I... [00:48:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is but then I'd have to go out to Wareham.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I was just thinking it's on the red line; it's just a couple stops away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, in the wrong direction though because I'd be taking the expedition up there to Wareham as opposed to and then I have my stuff. So, yes there is; I don't know if I have time to go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well keep your fingers crossed for this one over here for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. They probably will have something. I don't think I've ever gone in there and - like gone in there looking to buy something and not found anything. Sometimes I might just go to browse and not find anything that jumps out at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when you're a little more motivated...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, then I'm usually able to find something because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well hopefully with the timing of people having finished classes maybe people are cleaning out their dorms and bringing stuff in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's true. But they don't just bring everything in. It's nicer; it's not just like dumping anything. You make an appointment and bring in the clothes and they decide what they want or don't want, so - at least for the thrift store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This might be a good time when they actually have a lot to choose from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They might. They usually have a pretty good selection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know at the beginning of this session you mentioned that there were a couple of things you were deciding between to talk about and I want to make sure you have time to talk about other things too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's just the whole situation with Sydney, and his libido still isn't back yet. I mean I haven't been asking him about it or anything but he said if his libido was back he would let me know. And now just like worrying if - because he had - worrying you're like what if he wasn't actually sexually attracted to me, if he had just been thinking that he was or something and I was just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was thinking this or you were thinking this? [00:50:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was thinking this out loud to me. Not that he thought he was and for what if he, he had convinced himself that he was sort of thing. And I was like after an issue that's your depression talking. But then that got me worried and - I mean before he lost his libido, we had chemistry and stuff so I don't think that it just, you know, but I'm worrying what if his libido hasn't come back because of me and now I'm kind of worried about that. [00:50:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that makes you feel really insecure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I kind of wish he hadn't told - because on one hand you should be able to tell me anything. I don't want tell him don't tell me things but on the other hand then he made me worried and I do not need that. So that wasn't really fair to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he finding himself attracted to other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. As far as I know. So, I think it's just the whole depression includes a lack of enjoyment of things I think he would otherwise enjoy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Libido changes are very often associated with depression. It's one of the symptoms. I mean it's a withdrawal from lots of types of enjoyment. Is he able to be affectionate even though he's not necessarily interested in sex? There's a difference between affection and sex.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He'll give me lots of hugs though even he's been less into cuddling than he was before so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a real loss for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm kind of going crazy but I don't want to burden him with that because he already feels bad enough as it is and he's trying to deal with his stressful things in his life so I don't want to make things worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean you're kind of going crazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's just I really want to be able to make out with him and stuff. It makes me worried that what if it isn't, is something that has to do with me? And I'm worried that he won't get his libido back ever and, so I try not to think about these things. But it's hard to never think about these things. [00:52:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know how he feels about the loss of libido? Is he concerned about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has he talked to his doctor about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so, yes, without...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They switched to the Wellbutrin...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that [inaudible at 00:52:31] precipitated by hoping there would be fewer sexual side effects and it hasn't really helped.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it hasn't really helped. It kind of did and then it didn't. And I'm wondering, or maybe if this will also permanently kill his libido or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's not a lot of evidence that suggests that the sexual side effects stick around once the medication has been stopped. Has he stopped the Zoloft or just add in the Wellbutrin?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He stopped the Zoloft.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how long ago was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At this point it was probably like a few weeks ago at least, not almost a month. I guess I can do this by - there hasn't been anything. Yes, it's been almost a month at this point I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not a super long time in terms of thinking about side effects being completely gone. There's still some hope that with a few more weeks out that if it's the side effect of the medication that that could still rebound a little bit more. If it's a side effect of the depression then it doesn't matter how many weeks out we are that he's off from Zoloft, that's not going to change it because it's going to not be resolved until some of the other symptoms of depression are resolved as well. I mean you don't really know if the decrease in libido is a side effect of the med or a side effect of the depression.</p>

<p>You kind of, you have to do this experiment of going off Zoloft and maybe waiting. And it's been a while but there are cases where it takes longer than that for it to completely resolve. There have been a few documented cases that I actually just saw just through a discussion group that I'm in where some people have reported sort of ongoing sexual side effects long after the medication has been stopped. But there are very few. I mean it seems like the typical response is that people go off the medication and the libido rebounds. [00:54:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He wasn't even on the Zoloft for that long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For very long at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was on for a couple of weeks and then he was realizing that it was making him worse and stuff, then he stopped and went on...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems unlikely that it's resulting from the medication.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm assuming those cases were to [inaudible at 00:55:03] side effects would wear off were also people who had taken the Zoloft for a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Long-time of use.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And as I said very few cases. It's like those are the known I think get reported amongst the thousands of people who have used the medication.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but there's also very few people who are not able to take SSRIs and I am one of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Doesn't mean they don't exist but it's not what you bet on because it's not what happens most frequently. And there's no relation between what happened to you and what happens to Sydney.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean he's also still feeling depressed. I mean he's at least now finally day-shifted himself, sort of not waking up really early but now that he can at least take the two pills and the whole thing gets - he has in 10 days an appointment with his psychiatrist and that he'll, if he's going to increase it to 300 milligrams of Wellbutrin then he could just take the XL, which comes in 300 milligrams and that way he only has to take it once a day. I told him when he talks to his psychiatrist to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've lots of good questions to ask. [00:56:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Find a solution that involves taking a pill once a day and not multiple times a day because he has problems...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He has problems remembering to take it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I don't know if that would actually happen but maybe it will and maybe the higher doses will alleviate. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's definitely a frustrating problem for both of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't want to break up with him over it. We already tried breaking up and failed miserably and we were both miserable when we broke up and I'm less miserable but it seems like untenable (ph) is a long-term thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know that it's going to be a long-term thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if he wants it to be - if he really wants it to be resolved as well then if it turns out to be a long-term thing then there are other approaches. But right now it sounds like really focusing on finding ways to resolve the depression is most important. And he's got lots of symptoms of depression that are present right now. And it sounds like the sleep is getting a little bit better but he's also experiencing some mood swings. It sounds like from what you're reporting he was feeling pretty overwhelmed by sort of small things that you were asking him do like making love which is a sign of depression. And this change too is a sign of depression so it seems like it fits right in line with how...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it's changed so much as I've stopped asking him about small things to do so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but there was a change from where he was when he was feeling good, right? Like normally that wouldn't have been a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so the fact that it is makes me think that he's still really affected by this depressive episode.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, he probably is considering he still even has suicidal feelings sometimes and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a big marker. And if you're thinking of - if you're having suicidal feelings sometimes, sex is the last thing that people are usually interested in. Preserving your life comes way above having sexual interactions with people in terms of needs. Safety's always first.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it just shows you kind of where he is right now. Which doesn't make it easier for you to sit with because you're not feeling that way and you want to be engaged in a full relationship with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just worry about a full relationship with him or whether we possibly would have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't predict that just yet. [00:58:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes but how long do I wait until I decide to give up or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See how you feel. I mean it's okay for you to decide that this is too hard. I was going to do a check on our time so I won't go over. Yes, it is actually time to go. Good sense of the hour. So next week what have we planned for since Monday's a holiday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I put Tuesday already?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think we planned for Tuesday at...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We did, at 2:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 2:30; let's see what my...[00:59:32]</p>

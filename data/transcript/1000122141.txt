<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 5</p>

<p>CLIENT: All set? I got all sorts of goofy things this time. I've made several observations. Where do I start? The first thing is you probably are aware of whether it's a circumstance or its you, there is a tremendous power you have over my life right now. I don't know whether its. Since Monday I've been thinking about Thursday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Spending a lot of time on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily. I might not come up with anything. I might come up with two minutes worth of stuff. Nevertheless, there's some power there. Secondly I've almost decided to open up an entire new branch of everything. That is the relationship with my roommates. I didn't think it fit in but it seems to. But I'm not prepared for that today because I just haven't thought about it that much. Since last time, I talked to June after that Monday, I guess I called her up on the phone and we talked about me in general. Last night I went over to her house and we talked about me in general. I told you before I was 90 percent honest a couple of weeks ago or two weeks ago or something. Well I went to 99 percent last night. [0:01:26.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And forty four hundredths. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no. The last one percent is not really an important percent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The mood was all taken care of and it just would've made everything more severe. Yeah, it's all over. I was honest enough to tell her the truth. She very rationally took that and we talked all night. So if I fall asleep that's what it's about. She gave me time to get home to make some notes. The last one percent would've been the crowning blow but I think it wouldn't have made me more honest with her. It wouldn't have accomplished, for me, anything and the only thing it would've done for her would have been maybe to have hurt her more. That was to tell her to the extent of which she had become a joke amongst us. I also became quite aware that I don't really like the people that I'm around. I think I told you that she said, and I kind of agree, that I surround myself with people that I consider inferiors in the things that I value. Well the more I think of it the more I think of the people that I am surrounded with now who I just don't really like. One or two exceptions. Because of those one or two exceptions I wanted to talk maybe next time, maybe this time if I feel like it, about roommates. But last night was definitely important. Very important and very very honest night. I don't think I was dishonest in leaving that one percent out. Now the affect of it, before I tell you what transpired, is for me about as minimal as unfortunately as I expected. [0:03:35.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About as what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Minimal. I'm not really depressed. I don't feel that much better about it; that much worse about it. It's just that now knowing what I felt she knows it too. She was really zapped by it. I mean really zapped. She's not the type that would cry. She's taking a trip to Maryland next week. Sunday she's going to Maryland. She's going to go for a week and she said, "Maybe I'll stay." Wow. She's 32 years old. She's got a job. Today she intimated that she's making $20,000.00. She wouldn't have any reason to lie. She's a well established pharmacist in a hospital here. In a big hospital and she's got a real good thing going for her and she's thinking of dropping out. So I think the most important thing that I feel is remorse that I've done this to her. I don't think it's going to happen so it's not real deep. [0:04:41.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think its going to happen. Oh I see. You don't think she's really going to drop out. She's going to pick herself up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the funny thing about it is she was completely honest with me and when she said that. She has family there that she enjoys. I think she was really honestly contemplating it. So but I hope saner heads will prevail. I asked her when I left if it's at all possible for us to continue talking because I don't think we're all talked out. And she said, "Yeah, call me." We made a date. Saturday night I'm going to call her and we'll talk for a while. But as far as anything else, I think it's pretty much caput. Well that's how I feel about it. Now what happened is kind of funny. Having a big talk like this and I'm sitting here taking notes. I had to and she said, "Alright fine." It didn't bother her at all. Before I go on with that. [0:05:44.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well explain to me before you go into all that why it is you want to tell me what happened. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well first of all many of the observations were not made between us but were made about me. You'll see that when I start to make them. It was a talk about me and lying basically with very little about us. [0:06:04.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The one or two things I think that come up don't fit in at all. Well first of all the reason it happened is because I guess I'm coming in here sounding like an entirely different problem but it's not. Because last night was really about me. Well for example, we didn't start talking about us until about two or three in the morning. That's when I went that last nine percent. But until then it was all about me. So it was a lot of time. And it's about lying. The whole talk was about lying and honesty. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. What I want to get straight is why you're telling it to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really an odd question. I've told you everything. Why shouldn't I tell you this? This is important. It's about me and it's about how I look at life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So it's like telling me more about you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This is about me it's not like I had this big affair and now I'm telling you about it. That's not it. This is just the circumstances around the way I found out a lot about myself. Maybe you're going to hear the same stuff over and over again. But a lot of it... [0:07:14.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's giving me all kinds of information about you so I'll really understand you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm really amazed at this question of yours because it seems to me as though this is no different than any other thing I've told you about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. The reason I'm asking is I'm trying to figure out is how does it help you to tell me this? That's what I want to get straight. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we're discussing me. I mean if you weren't here I could just do all this stuff by myself and sit home, but you are here. You're the one with whom I'm discussing me in hopes of helping me. This is me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So you're laying it out for me. [0:08:02.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Excuse me for asking the question. Why would this be any different than any other thing that I've tried to bring up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think this is different because it's something that you already know about yourself. That you have all written out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. I told notes last time before. There are about three or four things on here, observations that she made, that I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you want to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I want to talk about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes it very clear to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This isn't like something that I wrote down all she said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. Ok. I... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have eight or nine ideas here and eight or nine things she pointed out. I think two of which have to do with our relationship and all the rest have to do with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. See what I didn't want to be is like a computer into which information about you gets just fed in. See what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. Indeed. As a matter of fact, there are one or two major incites. I really think I hit on something ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Go ahead. [0:09:01.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In other words the nature of this information is not much for the moment that we're talking about. There is one major I think synthesis. Alright. One analogy we used, you'll have to forgive me for using analogies continually. In high school I had English teachers that liked me. I was using paper so I keep writing notes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were kind of doing them...</p>

<p>CLIENT: However we hit across one that rather worked in talking about things because then we could make reference to analogies much easier rather than in reference to myself. That is the fact that I had myself and around myself, I built fences. Because I was so insistent upon keeping good fences and protecting myself, protecting my house inside this fence, I spent all my time mending the fences and never inside the house. To the point of actually tearing the lumber out of the house to build the fences. Ok. So now I've been alone for a while and I haven't had to tend the fences. There's no reason to. There's no real interaction lately. So I come back and the house is gone and all I've got left is the fences. Ok. That's an analogy that might come in handy. [0:10:18.0]</p>

<p>Now three things that we've talked about and something that June really sort of made fit all together; three pieces that seem to fit together. Number one if you'll remember my father and his temper. Now he has a temper and I've seen it and I don't. I have just the opposite. I can reasonably mad and won't be. Now there are exceptions to this. The one or two times maybe in a year when I get mad at someone and lose my temper, I really am vehement. I really rant and rave. I lost all reason and all sense. So that's a trait. Possessor of that trait; my father and myself. Well my father does, he loses it. What I do, I do just the opposite. I control it beyond any reasonable extent. Ok. Now let's take another thing. Let's take my mother. She never admits a mistake. I had that quality for a while. I saw it. I didn't like it so what do I do, if I am right and I'm arguing with someone and they're wrong, to avoid the argument sometimes I'll admit I'm wrong when I'm not wrong. Just the opposite. [0:11:35.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But with the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Now both of those things are dishonest. If I were really honest, these few times where I deserve to be mad, to be irate at someone, I should be that way. That'd be the honest thing to do. Certainly not often but there are times when you should be mad and there are times when I should've been mad. There are times when I should argue if I'm right but I don't. So it's counteracting these two traits that I see in myself that I saw in my parents. Now let's take a trait that only I have or at least only I seem to have. That is the building of the fences. So what did we talk about last time? We talked about going inward and not interacting. That is just now is a trait in my father and my mother trait in me, both of which I'm thinking about my reaction to. My reaction will be just the opposite. Right? And it's dishonest. For me to be inward is to be dishonest. Now I think that's important and therefore I cannot really say that that's the answer to all of this. That living alone... [0:12:41.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That staying away from people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's not the answer. That's as dishonest as what I'm doing now. Now that I've gotten that out; it's alright if I bring up things that June said right? Ok. I just wanted to point that out. That I thought was really cool. She noticed that and it's true. It really is. So what is that I talk about fence building now that we see a similarity in my life? Why I behave the way I do. Maybe the reason that I'm disturbed about the fences might just be the fact that I don't build them as good as I can. In other words, I make these mistakes at times. You see I was getting along fine all the way through college and everything when I wouldn't be disturbed by how I would behave with groups. But when I realized these fences exist, then I was disturbed and I have been disturbed lately. So maybe it's just that I'm not as good at lying as I used to be. [0:13:39.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe what you want to do is get better at lying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Alright. Now that might be the case but I don't like that at all. It just doesn't appeal to my rational self. It doesn't make sense. That could be the case. Had I been better at lying, I probably wouldn't be here. I'm certain my life would be much worse. Maybe not the way I would feel about it, but certainly if I look back on it when I'm 94 years old and say, "Wow what a rotten life." So what does this leave me with? Maybe the following. Maybe a realization that there is no house inside those fences that I am only fences. That if I want to develop a lasting relationship with someone, they're going to have to realize that. That for instance, if I'm with someone in a new encounter and I project some image, I get to know that person. I should explain that to that person. That I am this way. That what you see is not necessarily all sides of me. Then take that person with me to another encounter. [0:14:45.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Show them more sides.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. June has seen other sides. That's why she is such a great observer of my character. She has been with me in different circles of friends. And maybe that's the answer. Maybe the answer is to say alright you lie. It's a benign sort of lie. It's not so much lying as avoiding telling the truth of your feelings. But now maybe there is no truth of my feelings. There is no house inside the perimeter. So the truth is the fence. [0:15:19.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't get that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact that I don't have a self. I haven't every analyzed myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've torn down anything that was there. Maybe I never built it. But I've continually built these fences around and now just to realize that might be truth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm certain there are people with just tremendous Oedipus's. I know four or five people that I think I really know and they are not pretentious at all. They're just honest all the way across the board. They can be that way. Maybe I'm just a tremendous fence builder. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you're just a pretender. [0:16:02.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That indeed could be honesty. There's only one thing wrong with that and that's to be honest with everyone I'd have to show them all parts of me. So I would have the choice then of leaving a person at a certain point in my life and that part of behavior. Leave them with my parents. Leave them with my circle of older friends. Leave them with my neighbors or to take that person completely into my confidence and say, "Look I behave all sorts of different ways." Because I've done this for so long, I think maybe it's the only hope. That there is no possible way for me to behave differently if this is the way I behave. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I see what you're saying. Yeah. What makes sense is to accept the fact that you really have no self. [0:17:07.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. That's what I'm saying but does it make sense to do that? I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean makes sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it a viable thing for a person? You see it's quite a paradox </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't figure this out. Its like many people if they said I have no self, would be totally upset by that. Now you seem to be totally unupset by that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No you see here, let me explain. It's really I read an article the other day on paradoxes but this seems to be a... There's a really good physics analogy here but I don't want to bore you. It would take too long to describe. Can't I just talk without analogies? What is a self? How does one behave? If I just simply don't behave as a self and I only behave as an interacting self, then that is the self. [0:18:16.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you're saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The lack there of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see what you're saying. Yeah. Stop looking for something else. Stop trying to create something extra in itself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is nothing. It's just by the way I have lived my entire life up to now. There is nothing that is just me. There is only me. Me is the ability to assimilate into the group that I am in and to behave. So maybe it is to just get better at that. To be more perceptive to people, to see what they like and to realize when I can't do something just not to do it. For instance, remember the photo book with the girl at the airport. At that point, not lying about that... See I still have to lie. [0:19:07.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you have to lie now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see to develop and interest in that book to please her. That interest would not be mine. That interest would be the fact that she is interested. Well anyhow that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. Would that be a fence then? Would that be part of the fence to pretend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You see because it's apart from me. It's not what I feel about anything. There are so few people in the world capable of original thought. I just don't think I'm one of them. Is that a crime? Is that horrible to realize that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow I think there's something about the words you're using is confusing me because it's almost funny. I can't help laughing. There's something about the way you're putting it. It's like somebody coming in and saying, "I'm nothing, I'm just nothing." That's fine. Now wait, I'm explaining it to you then you explain to me what I'm missing here. It's like somebody saying, "I'm nothing and that's really great." "I've just discovered that I'm absolutely nothing except a bunch of pretenses." "Isn't that marvelous or is that ok?" You see that what it sounds like to me. Of course, you obviously mean something different by that. [0:20:44.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I just don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe its something about it's a relief to find out that you're not some huge thing that maybe you thought you were. Maybe it's that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I think it's a joy in knowledge. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think that's it's a distasteful joy in knowledge. It really isn't. Now you make look at this as being something horrible. [0:21:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I haven't thought about it like for one day now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No. No. See I realize that it isn't something horrible to you and so it's obvious that just the words don't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To you. Qualified though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. It's not even horrible to me. See no look.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah come on now. It's got to be. You talk about selves a lot?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't it seem bad to you if someone says, "Oh boy I'm nothing." It doesn't ring true uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disturbing true. There's something very strange about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Are you finished because I want to pursue something? I'm just hanging on saying, "Your turn, my turn." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see I have known very very few really honest people that at any one given time say what is in them because they have put that thing in there. That's why we have newspaper columnists for politics. [0:22:06.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait you have very few people that say what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You see you're just regurgitating what other people say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The amount of original thinking in the universe is negligible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Practically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah practically nil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I see that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. It's the same thing with interaction. You see I may contend that 99.999 percent of the people are like me; are just pretentious. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And haven't really figured themselves out and indeed have no selves. Well maybe I'm one of the few that realizes this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can take some joy in that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you've realized it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That may be not right but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I see what you're saying. [0:23:05.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why there can be joy in it. You see if it's a malady that afflicts everyone and I am one of the few that just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a joy of being one of the people who discovered it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it right that you were amused at the fact that this is something that when someone comes in to your office and says, "I have no self." and says it with a glee in his voice; that you find disturbing? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I do not find it disturbing. I find it amusing because it's the same way that I would feel, that you might feel, if somebody came to you and said to you, "I have just discovered that I'm an absolute nincompoop." "I don't anything about physics." "I just don't know anything." "I'm a total nincompoop and I have just discovered that; isn't that wonderful that I've discovered that." See I'm explaining that to you. So 'm not disturbed but it's... [0:24:01.2] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Has anyone every come in and said, "Wow I have no self and isn't that groovy."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I didn't think so. I could see where you'd think yeah that would be amusing. Me I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But wait. I see what you're saying now because I see what you're saying is like look all these people think they have uniqueness, individuality, creative thinking, but really for me to discover that I don't is really a discovery. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Realizing my limitation of not being able to have to be a real self, a well examined self, defines itself in itself. You see maybe we're using the word self wrongly here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because my idea of self is a self motivating self. That is my motivations are mine and mine alone. I feel someway because I alone feel that way. Well that isn't the case you see. [0:25:09.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I see what you mean but there's kind of a freedom in realizing that you don't have to pretend that actually. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I once thought I had my life down to what I call the first principles approach. I hate to do it this way because it's so like geometry but geometry is definitions, its postulates and everything. When you get beyond the definitions like five Euclidean postulates exist for our natural world. We just assume they exist. I cannot be proven or disproven. Well what about a life? Shouldn't a life have a well developed principle that you can't prove it or disprove it? But once you develop those principles in your own mind, then your life should be consistent about those principles. Right? I mean if that's the way...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If that's the way that you want to set it up. Yes. Right. Right. [0:25:58.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that for a while seemed like really groovy. Self consistent approach that's fine. But the problem with that is who determines what those principles are. You see and you don't. One doesn't I don't think. I think very few people do for themselves. It's everyone else. What they read and what they hear and how they interact. That's what determines those principles and therefore those principles and most people don't have the first principles approach. That is to say any given action is alright based on this principle. They haven't got their lives that well ordered. However, there was a point where I thought I did. And I had these principles well defined and I said that was because which is kind of comforting. But now I'm at the point of saying, "What are these principles?" They are not determined by me and indeed they may change from encounter to encounter. So now the problem is what does one do? [0:27:03.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knowing that what do you do? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean do I just practice lying? Will this change my feeling about the big number one that I came in here for, not liking myself? The distaste for myself after an interaction where I've lied. What'll it do to that? Will that problem ever go away? I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or should you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or should I realize when I start to get to that point in a relationship or an encounter, that that's the point where you can't build a fence so don't try. The analogy falls down here so let's forget the analogy. Maybe I should when I get to that point not continue to lie and let a nonentity project itself rather than a false entity. Rather than turning myself into an entity all of the time, to keep on lying. When I see a point, when I'm lying in such a way that's completely distasteful to me, to these first principles perhaps, then is the point to stop lying. So it's sort of a happy medium between realizing that I'm going to lie and I'm going to interact and that way and my social encounters will be such that they won't be me projecting but what those people want to see until it gets to the point where I'm reacting in such a way that I will later regret. That's the point that I stop lying. Not stop lying by telling the truth but stop lying when I stop talking. That's it. [0:28:49.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that is the truth at that point to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's all very confusing isn't it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see I come in here and I think well I've got something figured out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You leave and nothings figured out. [0:29:08.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. Yeah sometimes. And then sometimes a heck of a lot happens between Monday and Thursday. Is it going to be definitely Thursday all of the time now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. Because that extra day really helps. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ok what I'm not clear about here is you're talking about there's nothing of you like what you take in what you leave etcetera, etcetera, really. Is that what you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very nearly. Very very nearly. For all practical purposes, yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Then you're saying the way I act in situations is that I act the way people want me to to please them and that's lying. Ok. So it's almost like saying there's only two ways I can act. One of them is to please other people and lie and the other one is I guess is to do nothing. [0:30:02.9] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. To not interact. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like those are the only two possibilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see the only reason I came in here was when the lying started to break down and I couldn't do it because I got to a point where a lie would be distasteful to me. I wasn't good at it as some point. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like maybe both of those things were getting to be true. Like you weren't doing it too well and also the distastefulness, what's that like? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'd just walk out of an encounter knocking my head against the wall for being such an ass. Really hating the way I behaved and saying at that time, "That's not me." realizing now that there is no me to project. Oh wow. Doesn't make any sense at all does it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the sense it makes is something about well I think there's a difference in like you're saying you've been trying to please them or the only alternative is to do nothing. What about the alternative? It sounds like what was distasteful to you was that you were never doing anything to please yourself in that situation. [0:31:21.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think the more I look at it I think it's just not being good at it. It was only when I wasn't good at it I didn't like it. And I would walk away and would be mad because they would see that I'd be lying which is really egocentric. I'm getting along fine as long as I can fool them but the minute that I can't fool them... [0:32:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you be happy right now if suddenly you really knew that you could be an excellent liar and fool them all? Would that be satisfying? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It may be satisfying if I were to realize that that would be me. That I would an excellent lair and that was life. That would be it. That was everything that existed to me. If I ever got really honest with someone, I would explain that to them. They would understand it and once they saw all sides of me they'd say, "Wow you're a great liar." I really hate to use lying in this sense. But I could see where that would be not displeasing to me. Because there's nothing really bad about that to please people that you're with. I would say that most people that I know like me. There's very few people that really don't and it's not because necessarily I've spoken what I felt about them but that I've spoken they like to hear. Sometimes things are very important to my nature whatever my nature is. Is that so bad? I mean... [0:33:17.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's really wrong with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. As long as I'm never going to get caught balancing one side against the other. I mean I've got some friends that are like super radicals that think I'm right on the border of joining SDS and I have some redneck uncles that think I'm abhorred with campus violence. Now if those two ever met me together, I think they'd almost kill either other. They're both vehement and both violent and yet I can get along with either one. Both of them realize that I'm not quite where they are. So the only thing wrong with behaving that way is the fear of getting caught, balancing one side against the other. [0:34:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So if there were no fear you would really be very happy to live that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really hard. I can't answer that. I can't. I would say it doesn't seem to be an impossibility. You find that particularly distasteful don't you? I mean I just have that feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have the feeling that I find it distasteful. Tell me what...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know it seems like you saying wow here's a guy that's willing to lie the rest of his life away; to base his life on lies. Let's see if he really means it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like what you're saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe it's just because we've used the word lie has so many bad connotations. You see I'm right now interested in the paradox and trying to resolve the paradox. If a fa�ade can be a self; if the fact that I reflect what you want to see is me. In that sense, then we're using the word lie wrongly and it's not a lie, it's the truth. The most important thing to me is to be pleasing in your eyes; therefore, I behave this way. That is the truth. Now when I'm with someone else that same truth still prevails. The important thing to me is to be pleasing in your eyes, therefore I behave this way. That is the truth. Now just because those two behaviors are different, that might be the truth rather than a lie. So I could see but I don't know. I've got to think a lot more. But I could see where yeah, yeah, I could live that way. The fear is it would be an unusual way to live. No, it wouldn't be unusual to live, it would be an unusual way to live and recognize it and admit it and not to be displeased about it. [0:36:02.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you've said then is, "I'm a person to whom it is very important to please everyone or almost everyone that I am with and that is the truth and therefore I am going to act in such a way to always do that." That in a sense is living out the way that I really am. Although it's a lie in the sense that they might think that I feel certain ways that I don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. In fact this will constitute lying. I will have to say to my uncle, "Well I'm not sure whether I'm voting for Nixon or not." And I will have to say to other people that I'm going to vote for Gregory and that's hardly an extreme case but that's just one. It will involve that kind of lie but ultimately maybe that is the truth about me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The truth is that... [0:37:02.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I am most concerned with pleasing. One of these first principles that I had and I don't know that it's a bad first principle. I think if I brought up my kids its one thing I'd try and bring them up with. A standard for one's existence can be what if everyone behaved that way. Just visualize the world. Just take a minute and visualize the world where everyone behaved that way. What would happen? If what you see is a pleasing world behave that way, if its not don't behave that way. Now what would such a world be like? It's strange. You know it's really strange. It's hard to image anyone but me behaving that way but I don't think it would be a bad world. I think if one had to say is it an honest or a dishonest world, I think one would say it is an honestly admitting lies. Honestly admitting dishonesty. So in a sense it's a very honest world built on lies if everyone were that way. Fortunately everyone isn't so we don't have that paradox. I think it's a paradox. Now the problem is what makes me think that I'm going to now be either better at lying or I'm going to be comfortable in this type of life. I don't know. There's one real problem here and I'm not interacting lately and I can't test these premises which is sad. Another sad part of we've got to hurry, we've got to get done by June and I've got this test. This is so ominous. [0:39:03.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too many things. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My basic life is concerned with now is I study 90 percent of the time and the other 10 percent of the time I sit there thinking about what I'm going to say when I come in here which gives me no time to interact. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're very crowded now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That makes it hard. No let's make it 90 and 9 percent and I spend 1 percent of the time doing cross word puzzles which of late I have gotten in to. I don't know why I mentioned that. I don't know how I feel 100 percent about it. I have to use this principle of what if the whole world were that way. Although it's hard to realize in this case. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd have to think about it more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh gees, I come up with all these great physics analogies that I'd have two minutes explaining and then I'd lose all of its immediacy. [0:40:02.4] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. That's right. It's hard to visualize an electromagnetic world with only one kind of charge because we have a world with two kinds of charge. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How would everything act if everything were repulsive? That's similar because you're interacting against someone rather than with someone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Against them...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What this person has and what I have is I'm setting up a defense. If everyone set up a defense against each other we'd never get close. We would interact only against each other rather than with. I would see what you want and you'd see what I want. And oh wow there would be nothing left would there? There would be... [0:41:02.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well part of what you're saying...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why I should try to conceive of a world like this because all I'm worried about is the world with one person like that in it and that's me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like one consequence it has for you is it separates you from people. That you can never really be close to people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The other analogy that I thought of, I might as well say it, a hollow sphere of charge from an exterior point its impossible to tell if that's a sphere or all of that charge is concentrated at the origin; the center of that sphere. So that's what I was going to use earlier. That that is myself. Maybe that sphere is indeed me and from the outside that is exactly what it looks like. There's no way of knowing. It's just when you get inside that sphere that you see no charge. You see no charge at all inside the sphere. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you never can tell that from the outside. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You never know. So maybe that is the self. That's why when I thought of that analogy, and I think it's a good one; it's not too bad thinking about... [0:42:08.4]</p>

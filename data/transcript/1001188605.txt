<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>ANDREAS: When Lori was eleven years old, she fell into a wasp's nest and was stung hundreds of times. Her whole body swelled up so much that her rings had to be cut off. None of her clothes fit, so for several days she had to wear her father's bathrobe. Since then, she had a severe phobia of bees. As she put it, "If a bee is in the house, <i>I'm not!</i>" If a bee got in her car, she had to pull over, stop, open the doors, and wait until the bee left. She also avoided flower beds because of the likelihood of bees. A participant in one of our phobia workshops knew of Lori's phobia, and asked her if she wanted to be a demonstration person.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Since many of the examples in this book are partially summarized for your convenience, we offer a complete verbatim transcript of this session. Some readers may want to skim through the following transcript; those who are interested in the details of a complete session can enjoy the opportunity to read through it more carefully. This session is also included in our videotape "The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure (1).</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Lori, whom I hadn't met before, had walked into the room a few minutes before I asked her to join me at the front. In order to emphasize the method, I did not tell the group what Lori's phobia was about. The method will work with most specific phobias, regardless of what the person is phobic of. I began with some "small talk" to gain rapport.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Lori, I haven't spoken to you at all" 
 
<p>LORI: "No."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "You talked with Michael, I guess."</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmm."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "I don't know what kind of outrageous promises he's made." (smiling)</p>
 
<p>LORI: (laughing) "I won't tell you. I won't tell you what he promised."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Anyway, you have a phobia, which we won't tell them (the group) about, OK.?"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "And, it's a very specific thing, right?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmm."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Is it just one thing, or is it kind of a class of things?"</p>

<p>LORI: "It's one thing."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Just one. OK. And what I'd like you to do first-Well, think of it right now. If one of these were flying around right now. ...."</p>

<p>LORI: "Ohhh!" (She rolls her head around in a counter- clockwise circle, laughing tensely.)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: Now that I have seen Lori's phobic response, later I will be able to recognize when her response is different. Now, however, I need to get her <i>out</i> of this state before proceeding with the technique. I do this with specific instructions, distracting, reassuring, and asking her about her friend Michael.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "This is what we call a 'pretest.' That's fine; come back. (Lori is still laughing nervously).... Look at the people here.... Look at me.... Hold my hand."</p>

<p>LORI: "Thank you.... OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "We're not going to do stuff like that, right? OK."</p>

<p>LORI: "OK. Whew!"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Now look out at the folks here. How is it just being in front of these folks?" (Lori looks out at the group.) "Is that a little nervous-making too?" (Lori breathes out strongly, and says, "Not bad.") "Is that OK?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Yeah, that's fine."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. You've got a friend over there, right?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Yeah."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "He's got a nice smile."</p>

<p>LORI: "He sure does. He's a great friend."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Yeah, good."</p>

<p>Now Lori is back to a pleasant normal state, so I can begin the method.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Now what I'd like you to do first, before we do anything-the whole procedure by the way is very simple, and you won't have to feel bad and stuff like that. But we need to make a few preparations. What I'd like you to do first, is imagine being in a movie theater."</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "And this might be easier with your eyes closed...."</p>

<p>LORI: "All right." (She closes her eyes.)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "And I want you to see a picture up on the screen, of yourself-a black and white snapshot. And it could be of the way you're sitting right now or something you do at home or at work.... Can you see a picture of yourself?" (Lori nods and says, "Umhmm.") "Is that pretty easy for you?" (LORI: "Uhhuh.") "Good."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Now I want you to leave that black-and-white picture on the screen and I want you to float out of your body that's sitting here in the chair up to the projection booth of the movie theater. Can you do that? Take a little while."...</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK, so from now on I want you to stay up in that projection booth. Can you see yourself down in the audience, there?" (Lori smiles slightly and says, "Umhmm.") "And you can also see the black-and-white picture up on the screen?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Yeah."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Of yourseIf?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Yeah."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Pretty interesting." (Lori laughs and says, "It's good.") "Do you know you could go to a workshop on 'Astral Travel' and pay $250 to learn how to do this?" (Lori laughs.)</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK, now I want you to stay up in that projection booth, and see yourself down in the audience, and see that black-and-white picture on the screen of yourself."</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmmm."</p>
 
<p>ANDREAS: "Got that?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmm."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK, I want you to stay up in that projection booth, until I tell you to do something else."</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "So you can kind of see through the glass, and there are holes in the glass so you can hear the movie, because we're going to show a movie pretty soon. What I want you to do is run a movie of yourself in one of those bad times when you used to respond to that particular thing. And run it from beginning to end, and you stay back in that projection booth. You might even put your fingers on the glass and feel the glass. Just run a whole movie, clear to the end. See yourself freaking out over there, in response to one of those situations. That's right. Take all the time you need, and just let me know when you get to the end."</p>

<p>I am watching Lori closely for any nonverbal signs that she might be falling back into the phobic response, but she remains resourceful.</p>

<p>LORI: "It's hard to get to the end."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. What makes it difficult?"</p>

<p>LORI: "It just seems to stop. The thing seems to go over and over." (Gesturing with her right hand in a circle.) "The particular incident, goes over and over and over and doesn't seem to have an end, although I know it ended."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. So it tends to go over and over and over."</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmm."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Let's speed up the movie. How many times does it have to go over and over before you can get to the end?"...</p>

<p>LORI: "Um, half a dozen."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. So let it flip through half a dozen, so it'll let you get to the end... And when I say 'end,' I mean after the whole thing happened and you're back normal again."...</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Got to the end?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmm."</p>

<p>Although I have not seen any sign of her phobic response, I want to check by asking her. "Was that fairly comfortable for you, watching that?"</p>

<p>LORI: "A little uncomfortable, but not bad."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "A little uncomfortable, but not bad. Not like the real thing."</p>

<p>LORI: "No."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Now in a minute I'm going to ask you to do something, and I don't want you to do it until I tell you to go ahead. What I want you to do is to get out of the projection booth, and out of that chair in the audience, and go into the movie at the very end, when everything's OK and comfortable. And then I want you to run the whole movie backwards, including those six times around. Have you ever seen a movie backwards, in high school or something?"
 
LORI: "Yeah."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. I'm going to have you run it backwards in <i>color</i>, and I want you to be <i>inside it</i>, so it's just like you took a real experience, only you ran it backwards in time, and I want you to do it in about a second and a half. So it will go 'Bezzzoooouuuuuurrrrrpppp,' about like that."</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Go ahead. Do that."...</p>
 
<p>Lori takes a deep breath, shudders, and then says, "Whooof!"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Did you come out on the other side all right?"
 
<p>LORI: "Yeah." (laughing)</p>
 
<p>ANDREAS: "A little weird in the middle there, eh?"</p>

<p>LORI: (shaking her head and continuing to laugh) "Ooooh."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Now I'd like you to do that a couple more times, and do it <i>faster</i>. So go into the end, right at the end, jump into it, and then go 'Bezourp,' real fast, through the whole thing."...</p>
 
<p>Most people only need to run the movie backwards once, but because of Lori's momentary discomfort, I thought it would be helpful to do it several more times. This time Lori responds much less, sighing a little at the end.</p>
 
<p>"Now do it a third time, real fast."...</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."
 
<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Was it easier the third time?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Umhmm."</p>
 
<p>ANDREAS: "OK. Now, that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>Lori opens her eyes, looking <i>very</i> skeptical, grabs the chair with both hands, shakes her head, and then starts laughing loudly. After about eight seconds of laughter, she says, <i>"I'm glad I didn't pay for this one!"</i> and continuesto laugh for another twelve seconds. Although Lori has been very willing and cooperative throughout the process, this demonstrates that she certainly has no belief in what we have been doing. Lori's skepticism is very familiar to us, Even though we have guided literally hundreds of people through this process, we are still amazed that such a simple process can have such a profound impact. My next comments are both to acknowledge her disbelief, and to allow a little time to pass before testing her response to bees again.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Fine. It's all right. We love to joke. Joking is one of the nicest ways to dissociate. Think about it. When you're joking, when you're having a humorous response to something, there's really no way to do it other than popping out for a while, looking at yourself, and sort of putting a different frame around what's happening, such that it's funny. It's a really valuable way of dissociating. We believe that dissociation is the essence of a lot of humor-not all, there are different kinds of humor, and so on. But we definitely recommend it."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Now, Lori, would you imagine now that one of these little critters-came." (gesturing with one finger, like the flight of a bee, toward Lori) Lori pauses, looks momentarily worried, then thoughtful, but does <i>not</i> go into the fear response that she demonstrated at the beginning of the session.</p>

<p>LORI: "OK."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "What's it like?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Um hay de hay." Lori is at a loss for words, and begins laughing. "Um."...</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Do you still have it (the phobia)?"</p>

<p>LORI: (Looking down, surprised.) "No!" She laughs and puts her hand on her chest.</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "This is a nice response because it looks like, 'What?' Consciously she's expecting to have this (old) response. She's had it for-how long have you had this?"</p>
 
<p>LORI: "Twenty years."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "She's had the response very, very dependably for twenty years. It's been a very unpleasant and overwhelming response. There's a very strong conscious expectation. And what you saw there, was this conscious expectation, 'Ooooh! It's going to be terrible,... What?'"</p>

<p>LORI: (laughing) "It's true."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "Now let's make it a real bad one, you know. Have one come in and land on your hand or something." (Lori looks down at her hand.) "Can you imagine that?"
 
<p>LORI: "Umhmm." She shakes her head in disbelief. "Whew!"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "What's it like?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Ummmm. .." (Neutrally, shrugging her shoulders) "It's like having one sitting on my hand."</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "That's a typical answer-is what's so funny 'It's like being in an elevator, you know.' Isn't that a mind-boggler?"</p>

<p>LORI: "Yeah,it is! Because I had that happen within the first year after the first incident, I had one land on me, Woof!"</p>

<p>ANDREAS: "And it was different, right?"</p>

<p>LORI: "<i>Yeah!</i>"(looking down at her hand again.)</p>

<p>This session took less than seven minutes, in January 1984. Lori's nonverbal response to bees in her imagination was clearly <i>very</i> different at the end of the session than it had been at the beginning. Several times during the next summer we asked if she had seen any bees, because we wanted to know what her "real world" response had been. Each time she said she hadn't seen any bees. Finally in December 1984, we took a jar with about a dozen honeybees to her house. In a videotaped follow-up interview she comfortably held the jar with bees and examined them closely. When we let several of them out of the jar, she watched them crawling on her living room window without any reaction. A bee was in her house, and this time, so was she. Now it is more than five years since the session, and Lori reports that she still hasn't noticed any bees, though she admits, "They must have been around me."</p>

<p>It's actually fairly common that people become completely oblivious to what had been the stimulus for their phobia. What used to terrorize them becomes so normal and ordinary it's not worth noticing. When we called one woman a few weeks after eliminating her elevator phobia, she realized she had ridden in several elevators without even noticing!</p>

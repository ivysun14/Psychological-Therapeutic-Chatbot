<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So it wouldn't be a regular thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, we're fine. Yeah, that's perfect. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also want to just check in with you about Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm out of the office Thursday and Friday, so that will only give us Monday of next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. Thanksgiving is next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Son of a—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Holy shit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 22nd.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. That's crazy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A week from this Thursday, in other words.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I may end up having some time on Wednesday. I'm here Wednesday. I don't know if you'd want to—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- find a second time that week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know quite yet, but I'll keep you posted on that as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [If we would meet on Thursday]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. So today is a regular time? This can be—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm still waiting to hear on that for sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I wouldn't push it if you knew it wasn't going to work on your end.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. It's perfect if you can do it. Yeah, cool. Wow, it's almost—- oh man, that's stressful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>[00:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because of the record. I'm still trying to—- I mean, it's not a big deal, but it reminds me I should probably let people know that gave money that, you know, it's the holidays and we're trying to get it done as quickly as possible. It's hard, you know, because we have to coordinate with other people. I can't do anything until I see Dave. But anyway, hopefully we'll get it done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you set a deadline for it or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well the way Kickstarter works is there's a specific—- you're telling people that I'm raising money for this and if we succeed, for whatever amount you've given, you get this and you get it—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: By a certain date.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not set in stone, of course, but I don't want to drag—- and also I want it to—- it's the holidays, the perfect time to put out a record. I mean, we don't have that much to do, but you know how it is, trying to coordinate with people. </p>

<p>[00:02:10]</p>

<p>Wow, it's next week. That's crazy. Wow. (pause) So we played a big gig on Saturday. It went really well. (pause) I had fun. (pause) We had to drive back, which sucked. But even that, it was cool. It was better than last time. We took turns driving. Somehow it went by a lot faster. </p>

<p>It was cool too, at the show—- like one thing I was thinking about is the whole time I was there, I didn't think about anything. You know what I mean? In other words, I wasn't thinking about oh, I might have a panic attack or an anxiety attack. I wasn't getting like sensory overload, weirdness. I don't know. I just really wasn't thinking about anything. I was just there, you know? It was cool.</p>

<p>[00:03:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you weren't worrying about things so much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't worrying about the show. I wasn't worrying—- yeah, yeah. While we were playing, I was a little bit—- but that wasn't me, that was all—- the crowd, there seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect. Like they were into it, but I don't know. We felt like we weren't really connecting with the crowd somehow, you know. </p>

<p>But even that, I took care of—- like at the end, the guy was like "Do you guys have time for one more song?" We were almost done with the set, so all the guys were like "Alright, let's play the last one" which is kind of like the hit, whatever, pretty catchy, whatever, song. I was like "No, let's do the one before that." (chuckles) Like this new one that's much—- it's one of the newer ones I've written. It's very raw. It's also catchy and all that, but it's much more raw and kind of emotive and stuff. It's like, fuck that, I'm not going to give these people—- they have to earn that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[00:04:12]</p>

<p>So that kind of felt good to make that call, you know? On the stage, like I'm not just going to end it on some pretty—- it's like no, let's wake them up a little bit, you know? So it was cool. (pause) And I mean, it sounded great. Everybody played great. It was awesome. It's big city stuff, you know? </p>

<p>We play with a lot of shitty bands. We play with a band called Orgasm. (laughter) So the crowd was a bit of a hodgepodge. But it was nice. The drummer and I met a couple outside. It was their five-year anniversary, so we put them on the guest list. So that was nice. It was good. Raised like 700 bucks for the storm victims. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so it was fun. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something about the couple on the outside—- </p>

<p>[00:05:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that felt really nice. We were out there and the drummer—- they were asking the door guy like "What's the music like tonight?" and Luke was like "Yeah, it's good. I'm playing tonight." They were like "Oh, what kind of music?" He's like "Ah, whatever" and they're like "Yeah, we like indie rock" so we were like "We'll put you on the guest list for your anniversary." So that was nice.</p>

<p>I don't know. I mean, it's the city—- I love that place. I don't know if I could live there, but people are just nicer. I guess because they're from all over, you know, it just brings them together. But I've always had awesome experiences there. I just love the people. You know, who does that here? </p>

<p>The couple—- and they weren't some hipster couple. They were yuppyish and they didn't—- but they were like still open, like "Yeah, it's our anniversary and we're trying to find a place to go," you know. The door guy was super fucking nice. Like everybody was nice. </p>

<p>[00:06:10]</p>

<p>We went to a bar around the corner to have beers, and the bartender was like this hipster chick who's super nice and funny. And then after her shift she came out and she's like "Oh, I missed your set but I just wanted to—-" I think she was kind of like flirting with us or something—- but still, it was natural, like it was just nice, you know. It's like we don't get—- it just sucks here that people aren't like that. Like that bartender here would be like "Why would I talk to you? I have tattoos and I'm cute." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something about finding a community that can be both cool and nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I know—- I'm sure if I lived there, I'm the type where I'd find something. I mean, there's a lot of eccentrics and whatever. It was a little insane, like there were all these hipsters and people were taking their kids around for trick-or-treating because they missed it from the storm.</p>

<p>[00:07:14]</p>

<p>So kids were like being brought into bars and little hipster shops and places they can't—- and that was awesome too. I thought that was even amazing, you know? So yeah, it's the kind of place where I think I'd like to go more often. I'm just not sure—- I don't think I could live there. Knowing myself, I think I'd be overwhelmed. </p>

<p>But yeah, you're right. I liked the fact that—- you know, nowhere is perfect. But yeah, there's something there, I think because people are just from all over and they put aside some of their coolness to just reach out to people and just be somewhat genuine, you know. Or, not genuine. I mean, people here are genuine, they're just genuinely uptight. (chuckles) Once you get to know them, they're awesome. And Stu was saying too "Dude, they're just not that interesting." The people here are just not that interesting. We're just a little more square.</p>

<p>[00:08:16]</p>

<p>This girl was telling us that she like grew up in Hawaii, she lived in fucking China, she—- you know, there were like all these random, eccentric people. But it was nice. (pause) Yesterday I saw Kelly. That was really nice. I think she—- yeah, it's going well. (chuckles) Saturday she was like "Have a great show," whatever. And then Sunday—- oh, Saturday night she was like "I wish I were there." It was really nice. And then yesterday, I was like "Hey, how are you? Do you want to get together sometime soon?" and as a joke I said "I may or may not be having some withdrawal symptoms."</p>

<p>[00:09:16]</p>

<p>And she wrote back, she's like "Oh, may or may not." She's like "Playing it cool." So it was kind of like she called me out. Oh no, she said "Non-committal withdrawal symptoms." (chuckles) I thought she was going to say "Oh, maybe Wednesday" but she's like "I get out of work at seven." It was really fun. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's at least more available.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we actually had kind of like—- we were very open. We were both like "Wow, this is kind of crazy." Went on a date like two years ago, and now we're like—- and she was like "Yeah, this is really nice. It feels really natural somehow." But this time, that thing did happen where I was like oh, she's a little—- she really isn't that skinny. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[00:10:15]</p>

<p>Like, you know, I did start noticing her humanness. But I think that was good. I like that. So I mean, I still really—- I like her a lot. But it felt good to be like okay, but I'm not—- it's not—- she's just a person. She's not—- she's beautiful, but it's not the end-all-be-all. (pause) </p>

<p>But yeah, it was just nice. I mean, I don't know, we talked about—- like we were saying how it's nice that she's an artist, and I feel like there's things I can talk to her about. Because I was telling her, I was like, my relationships have been one of three things: either someone who has just a job-job; someone who is an artist but their art sucks, and they're kind of overly-serious about their art, so then I'm totally not interested; or someone who's kind of artsy, but not really. Like they make earrings or something on the weekends or something.</p>

<p>[00:11:21]</p>

<p>So what ends up happening with the first two is they kind of just become groupies by default. I mean, in a good way. They care, but it's one-sided. There's nothing—- I have nothing to be excited about. Like "Oh, it sucks that your boss is an asshole." So it's nice to be able to also connect with someone on a deeper level about art and not feel—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does she do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She makes amazing short videos, like she made this one—- she took 16 mm film and she kind of draws on it and scrapes it and paints it and does things, then splices it with other images. Like really serious, interesting—- I don't know much about video art or whatever, but the one I saw, if I didn't know her, I would still think it was really interesting, you know.</p>

<p>[00:12:18]</p>

<p>And there's something about her. Like she's got like this—- she's fun, but she has depth somehow, you know. I can just tell there's a lot there. Yeah, she's just—- I just like that. She's interesting but she's not trying to be interesting, you know. </p>

<p>I didn't know that she was an actress. She told me that she was getting scouted and people wanted her to move to New York and kind of be in commercials or model or act or whatever. For a while she almost—- but she even decided not to do that because she's like "I know what that's like, especially if you're a girl." It's all luck and she's going to be objectified and it's kind of shady. So I respect that. She's like "No, I want to make something more substantive that's not based on random."</p>

<p>[00:13:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is her art what she's doing professionally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She works at the university.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She went to the school and now she works at the school, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and she's like a hard worker. I didn't know she works on the weekends at J. Crew on top of her full-time job, you know. She has a son. She lives with—- her brother lives with her. And that's the other thing I like. Her family seems nice. Her son seems like a cool kid. Her brother—- she's very tight with her brother and her family in South Carolina. They seem like good people, you know? I don't know. Who knows what any of this means, but for the time being, it's just really nice. </p>

<p>And I think by being the way she was, now it's helped me not worry so much about it. Over-thinking texts or, you know. Because even though I was joking with her, I was—- she was right. I was trying to—- instead of just saying "I miss you," it's like I've got to act like I miss you but I don't. I don't know. (chuckles) So when I saw her, I did tell her that I missed her. (long pause) </p>

<p>[00:14:59]</p>

<p>And maybe hopefully I'm getting to the place where things are getting a little more stable. So like when I was feeling kind of down last week, it wasn't so bad. And right now I feel better, but I'm not skipping down the street. It's just I feel pretty much the same as last week. (chuckles) It's just a little more mellow. </p>

<p>Oh, actually, I was going to tell you, you know when I left here Friday? I felt way better. That was crazy. I mean, that's happened before but not that drastically, you know. Like I literally did not think anymore the rest of the day about—- like I was feeling like I can't breathe, and it just went away. It's just really cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know how?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It went away?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. While we were talking, I just started feeling better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was a moment you even said "wow" as you were talking—- you went "Oh my God, that's—-"</p>

<p>[00:15:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just felt better. It felt nice. So I think maybe that's why it impressed me that then I never—- on Saturday—- it never came up. I didn't think about anything, you know? We were eating fucking junk food and shit, and I had like two donuts and a Big Mac. I didn't have any hypo—- you know what I mean? Because I get like that a little bit if I eat a lot of shitty food. I just didn't care. We were having a good time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It helps you know, in a way, how much of it is emotional—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- then if you could do that and also not think a thing of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also sounds like there's a way it gets inside a little bit more. That while this process and this space could be part of dismantling something, and that's going to lead to more feeling and more anxiety at times, that it also may be part of re-containing it in healthier ways that allow it to just go away for a while.</p>

<p>[00:17:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe it is kind of like going to the gym in the sense—- it's not blowing off steam, but there is something about when you can articulate things as they're happening. Not like oh, it happened last Tuesday. Then you're like oh, once I say it out loud, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another analogy for going to the gym is it's like flexing your thinking muscle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:34) to really think and feel and reflect on it, it takes work. It doesn't come naturally. People spend most of their lives finding ways to not think about the things that matter most. So it's like getting in the practice of finding a way of reorganizing your experience in a way that doesn't flood and overwhelm you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I think is kind of what you were doing Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>[00:18:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sort of realized that these things, once you actually said them, weren't really true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But because they were haunting inside without words yet, they felt true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well, it's because it's what I've always done. Like being an only kid, it's like I'm so in my head—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —- that those negative voices or whatever—- commentators—- they're just rattling around in your head, you know. So it's hard to disconnect between like that has nothing to do with what's going on out here, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like I'm going to sit there by myself and articulate things, so yeah, it makes a huge difference. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a huge difference to think by oneself versus than to think in the presence of another person. Like that's part of what—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- it's so different to have it shared and known in terms of building containers for feelings inside, and you had none of that.</p>

<p>[00:19:02]</p>

<p>And I think you were getting anxious on Thursday and Friday about "Uh oh, is this going to be making me go back into just thinking non-stop, around-the-clock again in the way that was so painful as a kid. You were so alone. So to bring it here and be less alone even—- even just have it be known helps tuck it away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And it also helps that I'm able to talk to, to be more open with, friends even, you know. I mean it makes it—- even with Kelly, we were saying, we were kind of toasting last night. We were like you know, it's a cliché, but timing is important. We just happened now, it seems—- she had some shit to sort out.</p>

<p>[00:20:02]</p>

<p>And you know, I joked with her. I was like "You know, I probably had shit to sort out too. Like you just happened to be the one to—- but it probably wasn't a good time for me anyway. I've been working on a lot of stuff, you know." The fact that I could even say that—- do you know what I mean? Like just a year or two ago, I'd feel weird or more awkward, could shut it down. Or like I had a conversation with my guitar player. He told me about his mom and dad. I did feel a little weird talking to him. I was like, I feel like I'm saying too much. But I did anyway. I just told him about my mom. I told him I come here, you know. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:20:59]</p>

<p>Because I felt like I owed him. Like I didn't want to be like that, where in the past someone like that would tell me all this shit, and I really wouldn't offer much in return. (chuckles) I would just listen. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We were talking about how it's almost impossible, it has felt, to trust that someone really wanted [to know and hear and hold it with love and care.] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that you would offer it and then never see that person again. Or like they'd just kind of somehow discount it or just wouldn't have much of an effect or something, I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like does it matter to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or that while I'm telling a story they're like "Oh, whoa, he's pretty fucked up." You know what I mean? Like there's judgment happening or something. You know, the whole like "Oh, he's weak" or something. </p>

<p>[00:22:16]</p>

<p>And it does—- like with Stu, it did happen. I felt like I was kind of stammering a little bit or like I became very conscious of things I was saying. Self-aware, you know? With Kelly, I mean although there's a lot I haven't told her, I guess maybe because it's a romantic relationship, I just feel an intimacy so I feel a little bit more—- maybe it's just that she's a girl, you know what I mean, that it's somehow easier for me. But sometimes I do with friends, I do have moments where I'm like I suddenly feel very self-aware. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like suddenly hitting on this moment where you're not sure if they really like what they're hearing or if they're judging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or if they're saying "Hey, he's talking too much. This is about me." Do you know what I mean? Like "I'm telling my story and now he's fucking making it about"—- you know, I don't know.</p>

<p>[00:23:14]</p>

<p>I know that's an old thing because that's what my mom's side does. Like you'll say "Oh, I just bought these boots" or something, and my mom or whatever will somehow immediately—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make it about them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Immediately. Immediately. My uncle will say "Oh yeah, my building has a leak" [or will talk about his business]. "Well, you know, our house, we've had this leak. I don't know when we're going to fix—- " It's like dude, shut the fuck up. The guy is just—- let him talk. Just listen. Be quiet. I think that used to really annoy my dad too. Because in that way, I'm totally my dad. I have no interest in over-sharing or comparable things. Like always having to match you, you know what I mean? "Oh, are you doing construction on your house? Well, we're going to do some." It's like who cares, you know?</p>

<p>[00:24:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting. You have your father who was sort of reserved in his sharing—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, see, he wasn't reserved. He was big-hearted. He was reserved about shit that doesn't matter. You know what I mean? If my uncle said "I have a leak"—- even if I did say it, first of all I'd wait and hear the guy. Let him talk about his life, you know. Then I would say "Yeah, we have a leak in our dining room too" and then I would share with him in the sense that I'd commiserate. "I totally hear you, man. That's annoying." But I wouldn't be like "Yeah, I don't know how we're going to fix it. It's been like that for—-" Like constantly, you know what I mean? That's just douchey, you know. It's just douchey.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was your father in that circumstance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My father, at the most he'd say—- he'd just inquire about my uncle. He'd say "Oh, so what are you going to do? That sucks. Is it expensive?" Or something like that. And then he might say "Yeah, our roof is leaking too but whatever, we'll fix it."</p>

<p>[00:25:17]</p>

<p>Or he'd say something like "You know, if you know someone good, maybe if it works out at your place—-" And then just done, let's get back to our coffee, you know what I mean? Like there's no interest in day-to-day tedium. My dad's side has no interest in that. And for my mom's side, it's all tedium. (chuckles) It's all like, you know, "These shoes are slippery. I'm going to fall on the ice. The fucking roof is leaking. What are we going to do about the mortgage?" Every fucking thing is just going to the minutiae of fucking—- (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're talking about the interest in tedium, the lack of interest in tedium. You're also bringing up something I don't think I've ever quite heard you say before in this way. How much on your mother's side the conversation gets pulled back to her or to them.</p>

<p>[00:26:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very quickly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you may grow up both with an identification with your father . You're more like him, "I'm not like my mother." But there also may be a kind of counter-identification of swearing inside yourself unconsciously not to be like her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not unconscious. It's conscious. No, no, no, it's very conscious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what it's like as a child to be the person who receives that turning back so it's all about her, right away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no seeing you. And it seems like you've sort of sworn yourself off doing that to anyone else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To an extreme.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To an extreme. Right, yeah. I totally—- that's why that day that Jess told me that, like "I don't know you" or however she said it, that's when I realized. I was like whoa, alright, now I have to come back to the middle. I went way—- It's like not wanting to seem like I'm complaining, not wanting to seem like it's all about me, you know. </p>

<p>[00:27:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that happens even here too. There are ways—- like you will come in and say "How are you? How's it going?" as though trying to sort of not be about you in a way that feels like kind of protecting you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I do mean it when I ask you. (chuckles) But I know what you mean. I try to set a light tone to just kind of ease into things or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And you can even be talking about something light-hearted in your life in a way—- how do I describe it—- it can feel like it's a casual banter conversation that doesn't really take care of you, like the inner you. Like there's sort of levels of that, and I think—- I mean, it's an odd place to talk about that happening because it's not like you're literally making it about me and asking me, but I think there are even ways that you kind of protect the inner you even in here.</p>

<p>[00:28:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's just a default mode. It doesn't matter where I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. I mean, God forbid I would feel like you were your mother. You know, I think that could come up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like "Oh, I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. I don't want to sound like—-"</p>

<p>CLIENT: By the way, I want to say it's not like I don't—- I know for a fact that on some level I'm like my mom. I know that too. Like over time I've realized that no, I'm not exactly like my dad. All of this—- my dad was a sensitive guy, but I think a lot of this over-thinking and kind of self-hatred, that's all my mom. I doubt that my dad had anything like that. He wasn't perfect. I don't mean it in that way. But I can just see him, his sister. There's something about them that's totally—- what's the word—- not self-aware. </p>

<p>[00:29:37]</p>

<p>So in that way, I do know that I'm like my mom. How intensely emotional I get about injustice and politics, that's my mom's side. My grandfather was a nut job when it came to that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Granted, you see there are parts of her in you too, and I think that's been a huge stride to recognize they're both in there. But where you're not your mother is in your self-awareness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In fact, you have been so aware of the parts of you that might be like her, that you hide it. Like making sure to always be putting the other person first. That's not what she's done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>[00:30:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? She wasn't in compensation realizing "I really want to make it about me, so I'm going to make sure that I'm constantly making it about my son."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And be masochistic. She wasn't aware of the impact of her mind on your mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have some awareness of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've always had some level, thank God, some innate level of critical thinking. Very rough and not always great, but there's always been some thinking about why I'm doing things. Even if I was really confused and not getting it, I would at least think about like why did this happen, why did I say that? Yeah, that's true. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was almost a natural—- once I got into my twenties, especially after everything, I was like, clearly I need to—- I can't just be trying to sort this out by myself, you know. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:31:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have some of that on your own without any help from her. I don't know how you could possibly have more of that without having been taught that. You were not part of the culture to be—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, she wasn't preaching and teaching self-awareness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like "I wonder why I said that to you? It probably comes from something other than me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, she's the opposite. As time has gone on and I've gotten more grounded and wiser, whatever the fuck is happening, I'll be like—- I've told them many times, her and her sister, it's like "You guys are depressed and anxious and you have insecurities. I could solve this shit in a 15 minute chat."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my one aunt, she's so fucking—- my mom is actually better. My mom could be here and you could talk to her, and at least it would be a nice conversation, you know?</p>

<p>[00:32:40]</p>

<p>My aunt is really eccentric in that way. Her issues are way deeper, unfortunately, you know. But the difference is, she's kookier but when I say those things, she's like "Oh, you're totally right." </p>

<p>My mom gets super defensive. Like she'll admit it, but only to a certain point and then she'll make it about her. She'll say "You see what I did? I take care of your grandmother. I keep this house going. I don't have your father." You know what I mean? I'll be like "That's not what I'm saying, mom. Like of course, what am I, an idiot? I get all those things." She's just very closed-off in that way to just let herself be wounded or—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fragile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fragile, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her ego is very fragile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't say to her "You're depressed and anxious."</p>

<p>[00:33:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And the more defensive she gets, she's just making the point. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm. But she doesn't see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't see that, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you see it, and that's a lonely place to be in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursday, okay. 12:50. Alright, see you later.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of what comes though of - I've been saying, "Oh, I haven't gotten sick this winter really because I've been away from the germy students and your gross germs." And now I'm getting (Pause) and they go back to their gross germs. Ooh, so, I had mentioned that Ashby and I were going to give our landlord the notice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it hopefully grasps that that meant that we had to sign it last night and then deliver it today. So I got home and (Kai 00:00:54) was looking super stressed and started talking to me so I was like, "Okay, big hugs, what's going on?" and she's like, "I just- -group therapy." (00:01:05)</p>

<p>I'm like, "Okay," and then she comes back and is like, "Okay, actually you have to sign these letters and we don't have a (inaudible 00:01:15) on it." (Pause) </p>

<p>So, we did it (Pause) and I still - like he hasn't responded to anything we've said. I mean the letters we have sent. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) So, that's weird. Like (Pause), I don't know, I feel kind of overloaded and numb on our apartment. </p>

<p>Like I'm just like, "We need to leave," and that's basically how I feel and (inaudible 00:02:03) was kind of like, "Well, what if, you know, maybe we should wait longer." (00:02:08)</p>

<p>I'm like, "I will not survive this," (Laughing) and I'm like and she thought I was saying, "I'm going to kill myself," and I'm like, "I'm not going to kill myself. I'm just saying, I will not survive this." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "We have to go." (Pause) And you know, I start e-mailing people whatever about apartments but (Pause) I don't know. (Pause) I was expecting to feel really (pause) like really scared or worried or happy or something because when we sent him our, like, security deposit, triple damages claim I was really worried and last time you'd sent him a letter about something. (00:03:03)</p>

<p>I was just like really, really scared (Pause) and I had thought like I would (inaudible 00:03:10) like go to a friend's house today, blah, blah, blah and then I was like, "No, I just want to sleep by my cell phone." </p>

<p>Partly because I don't feel so good and partially because I don't want to (sigh) have to leave, like (pause) I don't know. I'm like, "(sigh) I guess I don't feel - I still don't want to see him or confront him but, for whatever reason I'm not feeling as scared about being there. </p>

<p>And I'm not really sure if I'm - I suspect that I'm actually just, you know, sort of disassociating myself from my emotions. (00:04:02) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is okay short term, I guess. But yeah, and I also with the other thing that makes me suspect that is that I (Pause) I don't know, not forget but I keep on, yeah like kind of like half forgetting, "Oh, Friday, I'm going back to work. That's right." </p>

<p>Like Friday's (been reversed 00:04:35) and it's not really like I've been (inaudible 00:04:42) that it's a huge thing but, yeah. For whatever - I don't know, like today I took a bit of a nap in the middle of the day because I was just feeling miserable and my cat was sleeping on me so it was like perfect. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (00:05:00) </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I woke up and I felt kind of crappy because I hadn't had lunch because I slept through it and then I was thinking, "Oh God, I have to go to work in two days when I can't just lie done on the sofa with my cat? This is going to suck." (Pause)</p>

<p>And then also at physical therapy the other day, so I went to physical therapy right after therapy which is really - I've done this twice and it's a really bad idea but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I come out - well, I just, by the time I get to physical therapy, I'm tired so it's hard to do the exercises. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then also when I leave...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This wears you out? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, (Pause) I think it's mostly just like it's the end of the day and I'm always - if it wasn't winter, I'd probably be like, "Whatever." (00:06:11) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just get so tired at the end of the day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then also, like, coming here, it's dark. Going there, it's dark. I leave, it's dark. And the buses run less frequently and then I don't get to have dinner until like after eight. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, like it makes me crack up in my head a little bit so I'm like, "Therapy, then therapy," but I think it's too much back to back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was having a hard time doing a lot of the exercises, my legs were being super stiff. (00:07:03) my hip wouldn't move as much as it usually does and she, the therapist was kind of on me about how often am I doing the exercises she's assigned at home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I've been trying to do them every day but sometimes I don't. And then we were talking about - (inaudible 00 07:31) simple one of my legs just kept on, I would move it and there'd be knifing pain and she's like, "Okay, leg cramp. (inaudible 00:07:39) of your leg."</p>

<p>And she asked me what would I normally do. I was like, "I would stop and probably not continue." And she's like - we were having this discussion, like, "You have to fatigue your muscle blah, blah, blah." I'm like, "I know but that really hurt and I get what you're saying that like I should take a break and have to work until it's uncomfortable, a little bit." (00:08:06) I might not have fully expressed how much it hurt' cause it wasn't like, "Ah, it's all swollen." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, "Ow!" </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like something like that anyway and weirdly it's not just my left leg (inaudible 00:08:24). It's my right hip that's messed up. So that was all screwed but (Pause) I don't know, like, I'm not totally ready - I'm not totally comfortable with the idea of having to do, like, exercise. </p>

<p>Basically daily exercise or mostly daily exercise for my hip, period. (00:09:05) Going forward that's (inaudible 00:09:06). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And also that things like, just walking around or bicycling, the things I'm allowed to do or, like, lifting shit to move doesn't count, I guess, towards the hip exercises because if I've said they're specifically for distraction, strengthen the hip flexors and some other muscles. So, I'm ahead on my (inaudible 00:09:45) but I am here...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am being active. And she's like, "Yes, you're being active but you have to do also this part." (00:10:00) And I don't know, I'm not sure I'm really - it's not exactly that I'm resentful but I guess I am. </p>

<p>I also - I mean I just kind of want someone to, like, there to be an, "Okay, you do this for six months or a year." I really would like an ending. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is something ‘cause it's how I've kind of felt for a very long time about taking psychiatric medication. I'm like, "I don't want to have to take it all the time." </p>

<p>And then I decided no, I really do have to take it all the time and my brother had the same (Pause) like conflict, resistance to taking medication full-time. (Pause) </p>

<p>(00:11:00) I think I'm also frustrated that I can't get - I feel like the process of going back ` to work is more of me running around prodding people than I really would like it to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, in order to go back and restart it again, you have to sort of poke and prod a bunch of HR people or whomever? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there are three or four offices..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And they talk to each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (00:12:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like disability services is not disability benefits which is super confusing. And honestly I don't always remember where I sent the form. I'm like, "I don't know. I sent the form to someone." (Pause) Ah. </p>

<p>Like I do understand why there's a lot of paperwork because like, sure, like liability, whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But (sigh) it's not good at making me - my motivation to go back to work is nil, pretty low and this is not helping. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (00:13:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm sure if I wasn't getting full disability benefits I would care about more but I am (laughing) so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that means that you're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm getting my full salary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're getting your full salary, benefits and all that stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, the only thing I'm not doing is I'm not accruing vacation or sick time. (Pause) And despite the way that they often phrase things, I have six months of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Six months of vacation and sick time? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Six months of short term disability, full pay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that is available (inaudible 00:13:41). (Pause) So, huh, yeah, like it's difficult in like doing all this stuff I'm like, "I could try to kick back for a couple more weeks," but then I think, "No, I should go back to work and..." "Yeah, but...." (00:14:08)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really feel like doing all this paperwork and don't want to work in the new cube environment. I'm like, echhh. I'm sure there'll be new stupid initiatives. Although there's one thing that happened that I'm really sad I missed which was weeding out the pleasure reading collection. </p>

<p>So library's do what's called, it's called beating where you basically go through and you're like, "Okay, what books are just - we don't need this one anymore. It's old but not old enough to be interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or it's just completely out of date or people stopped checking it out. (00:15:00) And for the pleasure reading collection, it's supposed to be mostly current so there maybe a few, like, classics in there like The Victim Tollbooth. Ideally everything in there should be within the last 20 or 30 years. And it's not. But there's really pointless books in there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like mediocre white fiction or something? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like something that was popular, you know, like, his name was popular 30 years ago like whatever the big beach reading book was 20 years ago. And you're like, "Ah," and also probably another library has it and like, I don't know. (00:16:03) Then a lot of the - there's also a lot of cases where we don't have the full run of the series. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And we don't always have the full run but it's weird to have like book two and three and not book one. There's a couple instances of that. I've just been like, "Page, page, what?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ‘Cause I don't know what happened. I'm like, "I guess we messed up the order," and I missed that. And I'm sad because I've been wanting to do that for years and the ones in the library's I like, we talked a bunch about how the whole building they were in needs a leading and one hasn't happened in probably 10 or 15 years...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even 20 because there are just all these books that are like, "Why, why is this here?" (00:17:00) Especially books about - if students are doing a research papers based on other countries, cold war books aren't very useful to them necessarily or books that are like the cold war is happening right now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Things look useless. I mean it's kind of funny in a way to be like "Oh, look, that's cute." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's not worth the shelf space. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and there's a lot of really weird books about Islam that are old that are just very (Pause) inaccurate, offensive. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Strange. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (00:18:00) And I think like, "Heaven forbid someone actually uses this in a paper." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or reads it or kind of anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like especially, I was going through ‘cause I was looking for a book, someone I knew had written a book about women in Islam, like, sure they made it 10 years ago. And then I found a book about women in Islam from the' 50s. </p>

<p>I was like, "No, no, no, no." This has to like, I kind of want to just pull it off the self and be like, just make it go away. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Also (inaudible 00:18:36) like I went through the (inaudible 00:18:38) economics books, too and the books about the Negro problem. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And women's issues, the zen of feminism. I just (laughing), right. I was laughing because it's ironic and awful phrasing. Women's issues and what the problem was. (00:19:00) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Women. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This actually, so the library congress has official subject headings for things, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And they, if you want to know what section to put something under they are like, "This is it, and this is the official subject heading." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So Flutter which has been around a while so there are some weird creepy subject headings and like, the Negro problem which was there for quite a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And everyone had stopped using it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that sort of like outdated while (inaudible 00:19:40) behavior but they are still on the books but nobody cares, like that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well it's a little bit more, it's like if you look at a library record in the card catalog or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the physical one but the computer one, it will still be there sometimes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that's part of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's horrifying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like somebody could be coming in to a library and just come across that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really terrible. </p>

<p>CLIENT: On the upside, most people don't click the subject thingys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They do keyword searches now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But on the other side, you're like, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost nobody can find it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like it's weird so there are some librarians who, radical librarians who go around, like basically going through those things and being like, "Could you change that? Could you change that? Could you eliminate that? Could you stop doing whatever." </p>

<p>And I remember reading about it in library class and just thinking, "Okay, come to my workplace. It's awesome." (00:21:02) </p>

<p>We still have the books cataloged like that sometimes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's that and I missed when that online class started by a week which I didn't miss an assignment which is good. There's this thing I'm forgetting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know, (Pause) they are all things that are on my mind but the part where I actually do something is the part that I seem to forget. </p>

<p>Like, I've been thinking lately of I should, like, figure out my class, right. (inaudible 00:21:55) my class and then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, or like last night, forgetting about signing the stuff. (00:22:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Way more fun to do nothing sometimes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (Pause) And not just even doing nothing, like doing nothing plus if something, if I'm not at work and something happens that isn't what I find frustrating or whatever, I can just say, "Mm, whatever," and walk away from it. (00:23:04) </p>

<p>But I can't just get up and walk away in the middle of a workday. (Pause) So, like, excuse me, if I'm feeling really stressed or sad I can just be like, "Let's go do that." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: For awhile. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) And you know, I've been - I don't have to check in with anyone to take lunch or if anything, so not even that I have to check in. When I go back to work I'll have to check n to take lunch because I'm always like, "I'll take it when I want to," but it's the sort of people like, "Oh, you're going out to lunch." (00:24:10) </p>

<p>They're kind of commenting, I'm like, "Why are people noticing that I'm going places?" Which - the part that I'm most not wanting is I feel super stressed and stressful about Paul being like, "Oh, you took a little while at lunch," or whatever. (Pause). Because, I just super don't trust him.</p>

<p>And the other part about short term disability which is exciting is in order to return part- time, they have to ask your manager if a part-time schedule will work. (00:25:12) </p>

<p>So - and there's kind of this thing where they, "Well, if you're no longer able to perform your job function then we could just let you go." Sort of. There's this, like, (Pause) if you want to have - if you have accommodations that - yeah, basically there's this certain thing the part-time schedule.</p>

<p>The changes are somewhat due to if you are no longer able to perform your job functions, whatever your essential job functions are, then you might not necessarily return to your job in a way that's very big. </p>

<p>Again, I'm like at this point I've all ready sort of gone forward with, "I can return to work," so I can't pull back and be like, "I think I need to be out another three weeks or four months or whatever." </p>

<p>So that's a little worrying (Pause) and definitely, as I said, I would like to get laid off but right now is not when I would like to get laid off. (Pause) (00:27:01) </p>

<p>Like right now, there are a lot of other thing which are making me stressed and frustrated that aren't work so I don't know, like what my central job functions are is certainly big (inaudible 00:27:29). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My job description has changed several times (Pause) and so it's one of those things of I just, I don't fully trust the process that's going on. (00:28:00) </p>

<p>I don't really feel comfortable telling disability lead coordinator, "I don't trust my management, so." We'll worry about that. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds pretty terrifying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, yeah. It's also like in many ways I've been, "Well, whatever," and the union protections blah, blah, blah and then I'm like this for whatever reason (Pause) feels like an opportunity to get rid of the squeaky wheel which is good or I don't know. (00:29:08) </p>

<p>Again bit worried about retribution for talking, complaining about things for a while. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And usually, I'm like, "No, it's cool. I have a union job, whatever." But this is a case where one could pretend like, "Oh, it's nothing to do with your complaining, it's totally to do with something else." (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Vulnerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel really vulnerable and I also feel like talking about it to HR makes me set, like, the response will be, "Oh, you're just crazy. You're being paranoid. No one would do that." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (00:30:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did find out who my HR person currently is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's good. I would think. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. It's someone who (Pause) I had a talk with her at one point about a brief kind of like, she had invited, she had asked Karl to invite myself. Well actually Karl kind of like just said we were going to do it and then (inaudible 00:30:38).</p>

<p>To talk about how awesome our department is and how it's full of (inaudible 00:30:43) and collaboration and awesome and I wonder if like, you know, "I'm happy to talk about some things but there's this problem of this (inaudible 00:30:54)parts where I've been really frustrated and stymied and (inaudible 00:31:00) against blah, blah, blah and she basically was like, "Well, I don't really care about any of that." (00:31:09)</p>

<p>She's like, basically she's saying, "I don't care. I have bigger fish to fry to get this whole (inaudible 00:31:20)." And I'm like, "Okay, well," and was (sigh) (Pause) kind of a combination of, she didn't seem to give a shit and she didn't seem to believe me and why was I still upset about these things that probably didn't happen and didn't really matter. So there's that. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (00:32:00) Right, didn't care, didn't acknowledge the problems, weren't even there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (Pause) it was also kind of impressive in that, you know, my experience usually with HR is that they pretend to care. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's sort of how you described it. It's sort of lip service paid and they want to think of themselves as caring although when push comes to shove, they don't act that way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and you know (Pause) I guess part of why I was upset is that I was kind of like, "Could you respect me enough to be polite about it?" (00:33:10) </p>

<p>I don't know, even if she didn't care which she doesn't, I just would expect her to put forth some kind of like diplomatic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, at least something that (inaudible 00:33:36)social concern. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, "Oh, (inaudible 00:33:40) blah, blah, blah. Maybe we'll do this." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. It's just sort of my social lying at work that'd be kind of okay with it to an extent. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (00:33:55)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't get me frustrated and angry sometimes but I also, (Pause) some of that is just like, "We work together and I respect you enough to at least put forth some effort to not, I guess not because (inaudible 00:34:22) I don't know. It's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel there's some kind of acknowledgement of your humanity or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if they (inaudible 00:34:34) statement but I can't do anything about it because I have the other constraints, at least there's the sense that it does matter in some way even if just socially perhaps. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it's like, you know, you see someone and you say, "Hi, how are you doing?" Even if you hate them, that's what you do or you say, "Hello." Also that made me feel very much like, a replaceable cog in the machine. (00:35:14) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Doesn't matter, I'm not a person, yeah. (Pause) And it's, I guess, I feel to an extent (sigh) (Pause) I'm the one thing that Chet's kind of said to me is, "Well, why are you still upset about Will and all those other things, he's not here anymore?" (00:36:00)</p>

<p>I'm glad he's not here anymore but that doesn't really address any of the problems that happened. Like, there's nothing to make that not happen again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was not the only bad actor. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if there were other people who were supportive and HR responded well and all that stuff and then he left, you probably wouldn't be as upset about it anymore. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it didn't go like that at all. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, one of the sort of things that I have found in my head about - if you do something, like when you apologize to someone because you've made a mistake and it's a person or it's an organization, like you're, "I'm sorry for this, what it is I did." (00:37:03) And say what it is that you did and not just be, "I'm sorry that you're upset." </p>

<p>This is the thing that I did, I regret doing that. I'm not going to do it again and these are the things that I'm doing to make sure that doesn't happen in the future. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the - in my head, the two important parts, two of the biggest parts are acknowledging what happened and, like, "Yes, that thing did happen," and also these are the concrete actual things that I will do to make sure it doesn't happen again. It just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like, "I'm sorry I ate the brownie that you left in the fridge or on the counter. I shouldn't have done that and I wish I hadn't and you know, I will start bringing my own dessert so that I am not tempted." (00:38:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or," Next time I'll make sure to ask." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or you know, like how about we start putting brownies into containers? I just feel like, you know, "What do you mean a brownie was stolen? Right, (inaudible 00:38:35) should have happened. I mean it's all ready happened and (inaudible 00:38:38)so why would somebody do that again?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: P.S. we don't care what you think about keeping that from happening again. (00:38:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) (00:39:06) I think you're terrified of that kind of thing. How hurtful it is in a variety of levels, how helpless you are to do anything about it. </p>

<p>I think it's overwhelmingly frightening. I guess that's what you were saying is that something you're dreading usually about going back to work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't - I also hate to be nothing's changed, it's all horrible. (00:39:56) You know I hate to think that because, I'm like, on one of those days I'm like, "It's not fair for me to assume that nothing has changed in two months except how (Pause) I guess some other things. </p>

<p>Like, if I'm going in saying, "Okay, maybe we've all changed. Maybe things have happened." I don't feel like I'm getting that back, you know. (Pause) </p>

<p>I don't know, it's in the current library class I'm taking which is about ethics and my handbook was in the library or something. (00:41:07) They had us reading some essays about ethics in business and they were kind of out of date. </p>

<p>One of them was like, "(inaudible 00:41:17) was such a great example of a really ethical person." I know, I was like, "Oh, awkward." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's one of the books that should have gone off the shelf.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the professor had left it in because she was like, "Look, people can say, but. " Because all of us were like, "Hmm. What were things they were talking about, I think I read in the article that was people don't like working. People find like - whether or not you believe your workplace is ethical is hugely important. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (00:42:00) A lot of it was talking about for profit business like, things like (inaudible 00:42:05) or things like, I don't know Alaskan oil pipeline leaking or things like that and I mostly felt like, "Well, Cambridge's is this behemoth and there are problems with it but you know, there's some kind of vague standards Cambridge holds itself to in a weird way. </p>

<p>And right now I feel like my portion of Cambridge, like the library portion, I don't really have faith that anyone working above me is acting in an ethical fashion. (00:43:00)</p>

<p>I think part of it is that our union contract still hasn't been approved which is insane.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's amazing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and they've never held out like this. (Pause) Yeah, I'm at this point a feeling like, I don't, I feel like my co-workers are ethical. Like, acted in a (inaudible 00:43:31) fashion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I feel like, "Well, you know they're individual people above me who are," I'm like, "Yeah, you can." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But organizationally, I don't feel that way and part of me also thinks, "That's kind of an important thing." Like, I don't know, if we're doing all these important re-orgs that's something important but I also don't feel like there's a better way for me to convey that, than wouldn't result in negative consequences for me. (00:44:15)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, (inaudible 00:44:17). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also, I want to I get updated on stuff. So, I know that you have something midday on Thursday. I should know that probably tomorrow or Friday at the latest. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought I heard you saying Thursdays would be good for you, is that true? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, Thursdays. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I can't do the 4:30, I had hoped to be able to arrange that but I can't do that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursday any time would actually be good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Mondays are not going to work at all for February, I think we cancelled them all for February. (00:45:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and they may not work for March either? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If we were to go permanently go from Mondays midday to Thursdays midday, would that be okay? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. There's (inaudible 00:45:26). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, then I will let you know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, sounds good. Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, take care. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On your new insurance, I wasn’t sure if they’d send it to you or to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I got three claims January 2nd and 3rd rejected by the insurance saying that I had exceeded my maximum visits.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. That was from last year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That must have been from the other insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I thought I got something saying that…maybe I just didn’t look carefully. But I thought it was stuff saying…anyway. I, personally, I think I also said that you still have your deductible. So I don’t know how we could have done. Anyway, whatever. We’ll leave it be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you submit three claims on those dates to my other, to my insurance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are for dates in January?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? Oh, I’ll double check. Okay, I have your new insurance. Right. You gave it to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s the same as the other BU number. I didn’t give you it…anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. I probably got confused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s the same as the old one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It’s the same…it’s the same number. It’s the same account. It’s just a PPP now. </p>

<p>01:32</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That completely makes sense. I don’t know why I keep flubbing this, but…</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s okay. So that’s probably what that was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So then you were talking about something else?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know, really. Apparently, I don’t know [Laughter.]. So let me look in to it and then I’ll get back to you when I know what I’m talking about. I’ll do it this weekend, or [inaudible – 01:57] anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay. If they send me…so they send me checks from the end of last year, can I just like write them over to you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or do I have to deposit them and then write you another check?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can write them over to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do I do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People do that. I think…I’m not sure. You should look it up. But I think what people do is write, “Pay to the order of,” and then my name, and then they sign it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like on the back?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I’ve seen people write like for a deposit only, but that is that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s different. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it’s “Pay to the order of,” me, and then just like your signature under it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I sign it and send to the bank [inaudible – 03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I would like to do that. Hi. </p>

<p>03:22</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nice to see you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Likewise. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You don’t have an iPhone charger here, do you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have a charger that will work. Is it iPhone 5 or an older one? I don’t have one of those here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I left mine home today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I started working out because it’s nice to have my phone be dead, but it’s like a little bit [inaudible – 04:03]. I left my toothbrush there. I’m getting a package with my charger and my toothbrush. I don’t know whether to buy a new charger today or wait for the package. My electric toothbrush. Do you use an electric toothbrush? I thought so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Laughs].</p>

<p>CLIENT: They’re so cool. I just got mine. The retreat, like weekend, like all the nice relaxing like soul feeding things that are out there, like all in one weekend is really cool. [inaudible – 05:57] and I had like a couple hours before people were going to be free, so I just hopped in to a Yoga class .</p>

<p>[06:17]</p>

<p>That was cool because like you got off the plane, you got on the train, you got on the subway, it feels like you’re far away from home. And you go to this Yoga class and you’re like, oh, I’m just like in the same world. These are my people. Everybody speaks the same language. There’s no…it was really like a seamless way to change places except that on Friday at 5:30 in Los Angeles people have, that’s like hunger intensity. I need my Yoga. Like that I don’t see in Waltham or Providence. People are like really clearly had a lot to let out and let go. There’s a lot of like really loud sighing. A lot of sort of deep guttural like yelling for a couple of poses. But, I mean it was sort of led by the teacher, but you could tell that people were hanging on to it. That was the last time I came. [Pause.] And your mat is like this close to the next person’s mat. That’s the other difference. [Pause.] Unsurprising. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Talking about not much separation. Is that what you said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you’re lucky, there’s an assistant in the class. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the studio that’s closest to my house in Waltham, once a year, for like a couple of months, they have their teacher training. More like the teacher training is over and the new teacher is like get to practice and they teach community class, which is like reduced price and it’s their first or second or third class that they ever taught. And then like two or three other teachers will come and assist, which means they spend the whole class touching, [inaudible – 08:45] and it’s the best feeling ever. </p>

<p>[08:52]</p>

<p>I don’t know why I respond so strongly to it, but I guess it makes sense. That’s a little distracting for me because I spend a lot of the time watching [inaudible – 09:17] seeing when she’s going to come back around to me. </p>

<p>This last time I went when there was an assistant there, there was this pose where you’re lying flat on your back and you put like a block underneath like your tailbone, right below that. You lift your feet straight up, the pose. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like…</p>

<p>[09:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you lift your leg. Your leg’s straight up. The best, like touch, that I’ve ever had came in that class during that pose. The woman like came in front of me and made me do straight up and she like hugs my feet close to her chest. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your leg.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My legs. [inaudible – 10:20] to my legs. They were like straight up and my [inaudible – 10:26] like grabs on to my feet and like proceeds to give me a foot rub in the pose for like five minutes. I could feel like every muscle in my body just like, sigh. And it would have been like completely unknown to me that I was holding anything, any tension, because that’s a pretty supported pose as is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it’s a little; it takes a little work to hold your feet up. It’s supposed to be like a [inaudible – 11:02] pose. But it’s like this uncontrollable like sigh throughout my body. Some people don’t like it. And other people who don’t like to be touched by strangers. [Pause.]</p>

<p>The Yoga class was the beginning of the retreat. I walk outside and my brother is standing there for me. We had plans to meet my parents and my cousins at this Lebanese restaurant. And I told my parents we were going to be late, so we like popped in to this like sort of, I don’t know, like beautiful simple neighborhood bar and had like beautiful simple aged cocktails for $15 each. And my girlfriends and Maggie came and my parents showed up and we had dinner. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[13:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like I’ve been invited. </p>

<p>CLIENT: To the retreat? Yeah. That’s nice. That’s really different from some other times when it feels like I’m closing you out. Like there isn’t any room for you. [Pause.] Do you know what I mean? [Pause.]</p>

<p>I remember one time in particular I was telling you about the jazz director in high school and the jazz band. And you said that you feel like, you felt like you were…I don’t remember what you said about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I said I [inaudible – 14:35]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like there’s a way I could talk to you about something that is inviting or is not inviting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah. Sounds like, Jay, come to me [inaudible – 14:48]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible – 14:53]. Well, I had the impression that you think that you wouldn’t like to live in Los Angeles. I don’t know why I had that impression. [inaudible – 15:12]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m not going to answer. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Why not? </p>

<p>[15:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I think it would take away from whatever your fantasy about me is at the moment to get in to the realities of [inaudible – 15:58].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. This impression comes from like things in passing that you’ve said over time. [Pause.] Which I’m not interested in getting in to either. So I’m inviting you, but it’s not clear to me that like you have a love affair with Los Angeles that I do and that maybe is part of what’s like filling this with sort of wonder and words. But there is also a lot of [inaudible – 17:03] with my family. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m struck that like as I’m sort of there with you wanting me to be there. Otherwise, when I like said pick up on that feeling of your inviting me and it is what you’re feeling that you, then, imagine like how I might not really be there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it’s sort of like it’s hard to just like rest in confidence that you, that I want you to be there and that you, that it’s entirely positive for you. [Pause.] I think fear and doubt come up real fast. I think – I guess I will talk about it – like I have the impression that you want and need a lot of space and wouldn’t like the figurative not to be two inches apart. And that my, like my adventuring in Los Angeles is kind of like getting things in that I can’t really get in here because there’s so much space here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here in Waltham, or here?</p>

<p>19:38</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here in this room. But then like, I mean it goes, it all goes together. There’s more space in Waltham. It’s quieter. People’s mats are further apart. So it’s like I’m describing this like thing that really happened, but it’s also a fantasy of like how we might be together, like if there wasn’t so much goddamn space. </p>

<p>So I guess when I think of, like, how I am inviting you for, how it feels like I want to invite you, that comes up. It’s like well…like I try to bring that element here and it doesn’t really work. So I invite you, but I’m not sure that you’d come. [Pause.]</p>

<p>But it’s like, it was so easy. I was surprised at how, like really; it felt like a very seamless like slipping in to a louder more intense closer more crowded place in time. And just like that day, it’s like, I come here, and I go work on my talk for two hours. I get to talk. I go on a plane. I go to a Yoga class. I get a drink with my brother. I go to dinner with my family. And then like we go to a jazz club. And then the jazz club is incredible. This is a group that I have seen individual members, whose individual members I’ve seen play. They’re all, they all have really amazing solo careers. But then they all came together in this big band for the drummer’s something birthday celebration at the Jazz Standard, and it’s like you’re so close to everybody and there’s like a pole blocking like some of the band and it’s just like no space for like what they do, but they’re doing it. Good, and it felt really good. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[23:03] </p>

<p>Somehow I was able to find a ton of spaciousness during the concert in myself. Like maybe at an earlier time I would have been looking around or like finding it hard to take in the music as it is instead of like having it. I don’t know. My mind was very quiet. Very at ease and sort of focused, which is cool. </p>

<p>[23:58]</p>

<p>Nice day with my brother in Providence. [Pause] It was just sweet and like attentive and thoughtful. And he and [inaudible – 24:43] his girlfriend seem really happy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that’s good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really happy to be around. And he had this cool German lesbian Catholic School lawyer [inaudible – 24:59] named Kayley who’s studying, I think, some biology and gender [inaudible – 25:11]. </p>

<p>I like went to this like [inaudible – 25:21] remain by the hip [inaudible – 25:24] French brunch spot. It’s just like everything we did was really lovely. And it didn’t stop. We went home to Virginia and my mom sent me off to get a facial. And it was like lots of good cooking. My grandfather and I had these two long meditation sessions; one where we actually sat together. That was the next day. But the first one was like we sat; we just sat with each other and he had all of these questions. And he was like so eager to talk. He was like waiting for me all week. And his questions were like; I can’t sit cross legged anymore as an old man. Is that okay? </p>

<p>And like he grew up with so much, around such a strict like interpretation of Yoga in [inaudible – 26:44], which is essentially meditation and breathing. It’s not really about physical poses, though, there is an aspect of that. He sort of taught me what he had learned early on, which is like this complicated like four part breathing thing and well, you know, like you hold each part for like the same number of counts. </p>

<p>I sort of learned…I sort of learned this in my family too. But he; he was clearly like having trouble like adopting a new way of meditating with such a, seems like such an overbearing structure. So we talked about, like how he doesn’t have to do anything labored. Just be. </p>

<p>[27:46]</p>

<p>And then he started like, I like brought him a bunch of stuff and he had some stuff at home, so I, I was just reading out loud descriptions of all these things just to sort of like bring things up that were coming up for him and his, what he was listening to and what might come up when he listens to it. </p>

<p>And he started like; you have such an incredible memory. He was like, “That word. They keep using that word.” But it’s like I know words similar to it and it would be like some poly word and he would like, he would be like, “Is this the [inaudible – 28:35] word?” I’d be like seriously like Wikipedia’ing lots of things. I’m like, “Yeah, this sounds good.” And like we’d be talking about something else and he would all of a sudden be like, [inaudible – 28:51]. What does that mean? Like something that he just remembered from his like studies in history and religion. A scholar. </p>

<p>So we did a lot of like reading free Wikipedia articles and discussing what he knew. It got pretty complex pretty fast. So he’s our last [inaudible – 29:28]. [Pause.] </p>

<p>That’s pretty incredible to see him kind of alive. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He sounds [inaudible – 30:02] pretty child-like. In a sort of delicate way. </p>

<p>[30:07</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he’s not in any other. I mean he kind of is like when we come home and he hugs us, but he’s totally got this like really really hard…I mean he’s always been very curious and very gentle. But he’s always had this very grown up way about him even when he was young. Like you, like here I am. I raised my kids by myself. It’s been a lonely enough life, that kind of thing. But no, this is completely different. This feels like he’s discovered a new color or something in his like crayon box and it’s like the best color. It’s more than that. It’s like he’s discovered a crayon box. I mean he’s talking as if, like his perspective on his suffering is changing and he hasn’t even, he doesn’t like have a practice, really yet. But just a few sittings he’s done have felt so spacious or something to him. [Pause.]</p>

<p>Other parts of the retreat included a family trip to the religious center, a family trip to the gym. My parents just joined this like new, it’s like all the rave gym. It’s like these fitness centers that are integrated with the like local Vassar Hospital where you show up to the fitness center and like they do sort of a comprehensive like nutrition, like cardiovascular health, like pulse, blood pressure, that kind of thing. And then they check in on you like every so often. They have a pretty supportive like trainer system and trainers everywhere. There’s like a hot tub and a sauna and a pool and a really nice like new facilities. There are kids like everywhere; like kids just like running, running, running in circles and it’s got this really nice family vibe, but it’s very nice facility. It’s not like over the top. </p>

<p>My dad goes six days a week…for all of his chronic pain and his pre-diabetic state. He seems to be keeping him very good place.</p>

<p>[33:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My fantasy about how this…I have this fantasy about telling you about this fantasy. It’s not really coming. I think one of the ways in which I am processing this and like how deeply it feels; like I’ve dived in to this and how deeply it feels I’ve dived into meditation practice and like Buttes philosophy. And also like a little bit, the work that I do on the patient periodically [inaudible – 34:47]. There’s like some fantasy that like keeps emerging. It’s like floating around. It’s like; no I’m not a professor in my fantasy life. I am some kind of like holistic like progressive, maybe like, my [inaudible – 35:10] are like bonus oriented therapists who like maybe has a private practice or maybe like figures out some way to like reach students in some way that feels right and works and really helps people. </p>

<p>[35:44]</p>

<p>But it’s very like, it doesn’t really have a form because a lot of it is just like it’s so much to process; it’s so much to just like hold. So like one response is like well; there’s enough here to like take up an entire lifetime. But here, and like on the cushion. And like at the Meditation Center. And like in Muscopa. Like student health and student mental health. And so there’s like the only like way to deal with how much there is and how much there is for me is almost to like create some like other world where like I’m doing all of it, and maybe it’s like this world. Like maybe it’s my future. But maybe it’s just like…right now I think I spend like most of my time and most of my energy and most of my money saved in that world. </p>

<p>[37:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there is one aspect of that and I think this may relate to what you’re uncomfortable telling me where that…I think like a merger fantasy with me or fantasy about me, I mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know if it’s a merger, if the whole thing is a merger fantasy with you or if it’s like also a merger fantasy with…I don’t know. Like it’s; it’s almost simpler to like think about how it relates to how I relate to you compared to like what’s with all the like, why is meditation taking up so much space? And like is there someone there? Is there a merger fantasy with like Sammie or Lincoln? Or is there like a merger fantasy with myself when I meditate? Or maybe that’s all part of like a way to feel close to you? Like maybe I just see my practice as like another way of being with you. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems, to me, an important aspect of it and that, but I, I don’t have in my mind like the only thing. Actually, probably more complicated, at least in my mind in that there’s probably something that’s both the same and not the same about the merger fantasy with me and with the teachers at the Meditation Center, and with you. I mean there are ways that does it. But I think there are probably ways that are not. That sort of merger and feeling, like feeling very close. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[40:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There’s definitely an element of like when the fantasy makes it, makes it different and more bearable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I think there’s probably something important in your being a little worried about telling me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I share this fantasy with my mom in [inaudible – 41:02]. I think my dad was helping my grandfather at the time. And there is like so much like humor and resistance and like they just didn’t buy it. And there’s very little talk of that he’s like this and my family, and I knew that I thought that it was kind of like a different kind of way of talking. </p>

<p>There’s like, you know, my mom’s like, okay. And she’s like, so you’re going to go to school again? I’m like, I don’t know. I have a Ph.D. That’s got to help. Like maybe I can get licensed faster having a Ph.D. But I don’t really know. I don’t know about that yet. And it’s like, Henry’s like this reminds me…Henry was much more gentle and quite loving, and my mom was not as much. Henry was like, this reminds me of my [inaudible – 42:05]. And we’re like, I’m going to play saxophone in a subway instead of going to Yale. That was really useful to hear that, but that’s what was coming up for him. Because I sort of remember that time, because like Yale. Like I’m really going to go to another over the top stuffy Ivy League school and I’m really like going to like keep studying science. Really? There’s like a lot of resistance which like has a really got away. </p>

<p>[42:41]</p>

<p>But yeah, there is this like intense saxophone bus game thing. Mom was like, “No. Making money is important. Like you don’t have to make a lot, you don’t have to make money throughout your entire life, but it’s really important for children. Like children are expensive if you want to help them in every way you can.” I was like, “I can make money because I have a private practice. I can make money. I can make like $200,000 a year.” And then there was like, [inaudible – 43:24] like you might be enjoying, you might be like all about this, enjoying it like an hour a day. Like you’re enjoying like hearing from your friends in a different way and people are really opening up to you. You might be enjoying like your time in your own like practice and therapy, but like just think about like 8 hours a day, day in day out, other people’s problems. It really takes a unique kind of person that’s really different. [Pause.]</p>

<p>[44:07]</p>

<p>I think that’s a great point too. I wonder what you think about that. [Pause.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t need an answer today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop. Let me think about how to answer that. My immediate inclination is to say no, it absolutely does not take a unique person, but I don’t think that’s a good answer to your question. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you’re wrong. Um… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to finish this story which is really quick, that the last part of it, discretion was like you can do this, you can have this component of your life in a very strong and real way as, say, a professor could – because I was sort of comparing it to a professor kind of thing. And then mom was like, mom is very practical. And I was like, “Mom, don’t you like,” I was like, “It’s a fantasy that really, has a really important role to just like flush this out and think about it sort of be creative about it in my head.” And she was sort of like, “Eh.” Mom’s pretty practical. I was like don’t you ever have fantasies about spending your time differently? Like anything. And she was silent for a while and she said, “I’m sure I do, but I don’t know what they are.” </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was not pleased. I told Jeremy about it and he was like, “Oh good.” I’m not really allowed to make fun of you way back then, that’s why I didn’t do it. Like, come on people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t think the making fun of what is what you minded. I think it was more like don’t think that way reminded me of like, you ever see the New Yorker cartoon. It’s like two people talking; one on side of the other and there are all these words that like make up this one big word which is “No.” [Laughs.] And it means like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don’t think I’ve seen it. I can picture it. [Pause.]</p>

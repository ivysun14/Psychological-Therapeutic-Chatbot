<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s nice to see you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. It’s nice to see you, too. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like Gavin is busy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s peculiar that he hasn’t gotten back to me. It’s not quite like him, but I assume that means he’s busy or something. I had one other thought of someone who I’ve shared cases with and referred people to before and who also I hear good reports of and who I think is good. [00:01:02] (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it’s time that Jeremy tries people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I wouldn’t try Gavin because he hasn’t gotten back to me, but he could try this other person, who is Fern Toms in Waltham.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can send you the number and stuff if you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:02:00] Does Gavin come to mind as being a better fit, like if Jeremy were to just wait until Gavin has time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s one of those things where it’s just really hard to know. One thing I liked about Gavin for Jeremy is that Gavin is also trained as a neuro-psychologist, which means he knows a lot about ADHD and has probably seen a bunch of times some of this stuff and has struggled with that. You know, he just has a very articulated sense of that, as well, as being an analyst who has worked closely with a lot of people. Tammy is not trained as a neuro-psychologist, but she is a really good therapist. [00:03:02] She’s a good analyst. She’s very smart, and I’m sure she has seen people with ADHD before; she’s just not specialized in that kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She’s a woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, as it turns out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gavin is a man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Right. That was the other thing – you had mentioned maybe a man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he said that he might prefer to see a man, but he wasn’t really sure why or if that’s true. I think that Jeremy has bad stuff in the corners, hiding. I think he has lots of mom stuff out in the open and, somehow, all the women in his life in this role – like almost everybody has been a woman, except Brandon Miles in college. [00:04:07] Then just over the course of his troubles . . . I don’t really know what I’m talking about, but I have a hunch that has to do with Jeremy’s relationship with his dad. Maybe it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the other thing that comes to mind is that Fern, I think, can be challenging. She’s very empathic, but she’s not warm and fuzzy and supportive. She’s kind of . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I think tends to be good. (pause) [00:04:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is she a meditator?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know. Not that I know of, but I don’t know. [00:05:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You need someone who is really smart and quick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Both of them are very smart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said that to Jeremy and he said, “Allison, most therapists are very smart.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m not so sure about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I’m not sure about that either because with his track record, I don’t know. The last one, at least, was not smart about her. Okay. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jeremy wouldn’t come through Providence ever, would he? There are also a couple of people I thought of through there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you want to tell me about them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Those are both kind of more senior-type people in their 60’s and so both have done a lot of child work, so they know the ADHD stuff backwards and forwards. [00:07:11] They’re also just experienced, wonderful, very smart people. They like taking classes  (inaudible at 00:07:21) that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two people?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I can just give you their names, as well, and you guys can figure out if the geography works.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And they’re probably going to charge more?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you want to give me their names now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Riley Carver and Sirius Moby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cool names. [00:08:00] Riley Carver and Sirius Moby. Okay. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I didn’t think of them at first because they’re not in Providence and they’re probably more expensive, but they’re both pretty awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Awesome, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think Brandon and Fern are awesome, too. I just sort of know them a different way. (pause) [00:09:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyone else?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s a lot of names.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you can make the geography work, I would call the two Newton people first, but I assume that that would be difficult and I think you would be in very good hands with Fern.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  (inaudible at 00:09:22) in case the geography of all three of the people who are in it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn’t try Brandon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We’re not going to try Brandon, but I assume that he will get back to you someday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I assume so. That’s weird for him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I don’t know when he’s going to pick up the phone and call these people, so I don’t consider Brandon’s slowness to be – like we’re in a hurry so we’re going to drop him. [00:10:09] I’m in a hurry; Jeremy is not in a hurry. (both chuckle) Okay. Thanks. (long pause) [00:11:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The more I think about it, if he can make the Providence geography work with either of those two, I would try to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Riley is probably less expensive than Sirius, and not for any good reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe she’s a more reasonable person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s a very reasonable person. It’s probably like he’s a psychiatrist and they sometimes tend to charge more, where she’s a psychologist. [00:12:15] Also, he’s probably been a little more visible in some ways than she has, so there are probably a lot of wealthy people go to see him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn’t really need to charge less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It’s not like she’s cut-rate or something. She’s very good and has a very good reputation. Some of it, yeah, he can be a [blunt] (ph?) personality though, too, but he’s not arrogant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you think they charge – ballpark?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t know. I’m not sure. [00:13:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (long pause) [00:14:09] Did you know you wanted to get psychoanalyst training at the beginning? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  (inaudible at 00:14:33) (long pause) [00:15:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m thinking of  (inaudible at 00:15:43) the people. (long pause) [00:17:20] I called you on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did, but I didn’t leave a message. You didn’t know. I called you at around 9:30 in the morning because I couldn’t leave. [00:18:15] I think this has been close to happening a bunch of times before, but it has never really happened. I was paralyzed. (pause) I left here and I left the building and I felt like I was walking through sand or something, like a wall of sand. [00:19:07] I just couldn’t walk anymore. You go through a little alley and there is a little bench on the left. I started to cry a lot and I was really cold. It was like 16°. It sort of felt like I just wanted to collapse, but I walked over to the bench and I couldn’t get up for like a half hour. I didn’t want to go. (pause) I called you and I called Jeremy. Jeremy actually called me back. It took a while, but he managed to help peel me off the bench. I didn’t want to go to my lab. I didn’t want to go away from you. [00:21:02] I was cold. (long pause) [00:23:05] </p>

<p>When I turn around and look at you and you move like you do sometimes, it’s kind of a nice thing. (pause) It’s a nice connection. (long pause) [00:25:21] I’m just really glad that you didn’t know that I called, (long pause) considering  (inaudible at 00:25:49), like I could still be sitting there on the bench, stuck. (long pause) [00:26:31]  (inaudible at 00:26:32) (long pause) [00:29:06] I’ve been pretty occupied with two thoughts. One is that you weren’t here for part of today, sort of seductive thoughts about why you’re here now and the made-up fantasy. The other thought is whether you would describe yourself as challenging, like  (inaudible at 00:29:52). (pause)  (inaudible at 00:30:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would?</p>

<p>CLIENT:  (inaudible at 00:30:22) (long pause) [00:31:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you’re taken care of and maybe trying to be a bit protective of – I don’t mean that is necessarily bad or in a defensive sense – yourself. I’m looking at your posture, the way you’re sort of holding yourself and I guess I’m teasing you here a little bit, but imagine that I got back from Hawaii; I’m fine; I got here at 4:30. [00:32:24] I think you’re seeing for yourself how challenging that can be – you know, I think is being sympathetic to you – you being sympathetic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it’s hard to tell you about what happened on Monday and not hear anything from you so far, so you’re not holding me  (inaudible at 00:33:20). [00:33:23] I don’t feel like it’s in a way that leaves you out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I  (inaudible at 00:33:31).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [00:36:43] I’ve been sort of anxious the past week. (pause) It feels like being cramming or pressured has anxiety springing out of it. (pause) [00:37:37] Not really now or here. (pause) I’m starting to notice some of the same transferrential stuff that comes up here, coming up really intensely and fast in my lab work. (pause) I don’t know if it’s about Kelly only or other people or the work, just by being in the work. [00:38:46] It feels like it’s happening at all three levels and here, and that’s a lot of separation anxiety. It’s like I have a really hard time leaving labs, like it’s so intense there and it’s so many people wanting to interact with me and I am very fond of some of them and I’ve know some of them for many years. Also I’m very fond of some new people. I sort of feel like this matronly – not really matronly, but maybe like matriarch figure. [00:40:05] Both formally, for my undergrad I am. </p>

<p>The Turk, the crazy Turkish scientist, Ali is sort of taking his direction from me. We’re together in what he is doing. Joanne sort of has a very intense role for her. [00:40:59] Sometimes I feel like she is sucking my insight practices out of me for herself, like my sort of wisdom and steadiness, the tedious bits of wisdom and steadiness that I might have on any given day. I sort of feel like they go to her because she needs them and sucks them out and knows about them, so it feels a little parasitic sometimes and it’s worse because I think it’s mostly bad in an intense sense. (pause) [00:42:02] I have sort of shifted my way of being with Kelly. I’m trying to make it a lot more honest and just transparent with her about my fears and how I’m doing and she is responding really well to it. Younger graduate students are responding to me differently now. They feel like they can’t cross that line with her and it’s too scary. Three or four small things happened over the last week where I just sort of went into her office and told her what was on my mind and these things are important to the lab. [00:43:08] Sarah is very important to me. </p>

<p>It’s hard to figure out what the specific dynamics are, but the things that feel transferrential is I have the invasive thoughts of all these people all day and night. They just come right into my – I can’t do anything else. They are just there. Kurt is probably the worst. I don’t feel like I’m much of a leader for him, but he’s so intense and works so much and has so little . . . [00:44:01] I don’t know. He’s just really difficult for me right now. He doesn’t like his marriage that much and he just drinks and he binge works and he’s very sweet. (pause) He’s always there. He’s always in the space. I have a hard time leaving every day. It feels like it takes an hour to feel like my own person again after I leave, which is kind of similar to leaving here. [00:45:04] And the invasive thoughts feel very similar, like it’s not so much what the thoughts are that are invasive, but the speed and my recoiling at them. Things slow down when I meditate. I have felt a lot of spaciousness at times, but it’s really hard to get there, a place with quiet and space and focus. It’s hard to access it just walking around. (pause) [00:46:06] </p>

<p>The same thing now: there is this rotating wheel of faces and words and everybody is asking me something or are having loud conversations that are really hard to block out. I don’t know why I don’t want to let it in, but it feels like I want my privacy. When I’m not there, I don’t want it. I have those people on my mind. (pause) [00:47:03] Kelly is part of the rotating wheel, but I feel like I’m kind of in touch with her. (pause) I’m pretty nervous about my work, which is a figure, too, but she gets overshadowed by all the faces and the words and the sounds. (pause) It’s very intense. [00:48:01] (long pause) [00:49:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, so far, it seems to me that it was hard to leave on Monday because this felt so intimate and so close and that there is something parallel going on at work with Kelly, who you are being much more open with, and with these other folks who are mostly being close with you. [00:50:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit because when I showed up to work on Monday I was like weeping pretty much for a couple of minutes when I walked in the door. There was messy setback in my day that showed up over the weekend; and so to a lot of people, the weeping was about that. I don’t think I’ve cried in the lab before. That was kind of a thing. Kurt asked if wanted a hug and I said yes. [00:51:01] So not just them only being close to me, me being a little bit close to them; but mostly feeling like I need to protect myself because it takes too much time and too much energy and is so draining for me to have all the interpersonal stuff going on and try to birth a paper. That’s kind of how I feel about it. I didn’t want to leave. I thought our time on Monday was pretty difficult. [00:52:06] It did feel intimate. Then I go to my lab where it does feel like there is some parallel happening, but somehow . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, not the same. (long pause) [00:52:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My hunch is that it felt wrong to be leaving on Monday. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it did. (pause) I was paralyzed. (pause) I think there is some of that lurking around always. [00:53:59] (long pause) I don’t know when I left the building. I didn’t feel paralyzed as I was leaving the building. It was the whole time, like I couldn’t move, I couldn’t walk. [00:55:03] Or if I did, I needed to go somewhere else to have this space, a neutral space, because I was afraid how you might react or something if I stayed here, if I stayed in the living room. (pause) I thought it would be too much [of your hands] (ph?) (pause) [00:55:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would be too much in my hands to be able to deal with my not reacting well. I didn’t react well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Also, I really felt like I needed to cry a lot and that space felt so cramped to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The waiting room?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I couldn’t imagine letting out what felt like needed to come out, like I needed to be outside. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing that is striking me is how it seems like a fantasy of being born. [00:56:57] (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: You think reborn?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the office and the building are my body and you leave and you’re crying and you’re paralyzed and inconsolable for a while. We’re separate in a way that feels very wrong. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:58:01] Like sort of feeling like I needed to be shown what to do, like being – I was going to say like being out of my head, like being pointed to the nipple. Even though I can smell it I can’t get to it myself, but there was no nipple. There is just cold, hard no nipple. (long pause) [01:00:36] I sort of feel like you might want to take credit for it or something, the birth. (pause) Or that you did it to me. I guess those are pretty different, right? I’m not sure. [01:01:31] Certainly in the moment, it felt like you were doing something to me because you didn’t call me back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not like all the way. It was just sort of like it felt like a crutch. I don’t have to go to the lab because Jay might call me back. And then, when I got myself up and going to the lab, the relationship, your calling me back, shifted. It was sort of like well . . . [01:02:22] It felt more like reality, like “I didn’t leave a message” that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were sort of back in the world in a different way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) I think this is really, really hard for me because I don’t know how to connect with you in a way that I feel like I need to to feel whole. (long pause) [01:05:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I may be misunderstanding, but (long pause) it’s so disconcerting, I think. [01:06:43] I think it’s like how much you want to feel like I am really holding you very tightly and I think sometimes it does feel that way, like at times on Monday. I think. (long pause) [01:07:57] It would take some of the  (inaudible at 01:07:58) out of all of that if this were sort of more of a two-way street – if you, in a sense, had [a connect] (ph?) with me. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like it takes my identity away to not. (pause) Like in my whole life. [01:09:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you’re swallowed up? (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m taken apart and not swallowed up. (long pause) Swallowing is like sort of a union. [01:10:10] I get stretched between that and being completely taken apart and sort of strewn, like my pieces are strewn everywhere. Whole, I think the word “whole” is what I mean, not feeling that feeling, only parts. [01:10:54] (long pause) But you were saying like it first comes from how much in your hands or arms I feel sometimes. Because of that, I’m one or I need to feel like I could carry you. [01:11:57] (pause) To me it doesn’t feel always that directional. To me it feels like the feeling carrying each other is part of what I need to feel whole or like that’s what my conditioning is or that’s sort of what I’m coming here with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) [01:12:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It shows up a lot in smaller ways with other people, it occurred to me this week, what I said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that’s also feeling like me. (pause) Maybe your holding other people or your holding me is feeling like me in how I hold you, or like other people hold you and just  (inaudible at 01:13:48). (pause) [01:14:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Certainly when I hold other people I feel a lot like you these days. I can think of, during the course of my whole life, there is some critical sense of intimate connectedness that sort of compulsively has to be there to be able to move on with my life. Like the anxiety around not being whole in that way is so strong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this is part of the pre-history of the pigeon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah? [01:15:06] There is a new book about pigeons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No kidding?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It was reviewed in the New Yorker a couple of months ago. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I’m thinking about is in a little more theoretical terms, which is not how I want to be thinking about it, but it seems most clear that way, which is something like it seems like part of the way you manage the sense of separation or the specter of separation or the longing to be held and carried . . . [01:16:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT:  (inaudible at 01:16:22)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah . . . is by identifying. That helps fill the space, being like me, being like your mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. It is theoretical. [01:17:02] (pause) I think my mom does that – pretty hard core – more than me because she’s had a lifetime of it, a much longer lifetime of it. What? [It’s something.] (ph?) I think you’re right. I think you’re totally right, but when I think about what being like my mom is, to me, it’s really, really, really similar to what being like her mom is, to me. [01:18:03] It’s really, really, really, similar to being like what her mom is. There is like this recursive identifying back and back, like the same way of managing the same things. It’s weird. (pause) I don’t mean weird like this doesn’t happen to anybody, but it feels a little spooky. It feels a little eerie. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it also feels inevitable. [01:19:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, in one way, in that it’s clear that there is any other way to be, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, that’s even more than inevitable; that’s like obvious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It’s like shifting, so it’s hard to place the obviousness or inevitability, but I’m not aware of filling the space between Kelly and me by being Kelly, are you? [01:20:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I am thinking of your sort of being surprised to hear yourself refer to yourself as matronly at the lab, which I guess doesn’t necessarily mean Kelly herself, but in some kind of internal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Kelly’s got some bad things, but maybe she’s got some good things that I don’t pay as much attention to. She is the keeper of the love and the carrot, so it’s hard to be that rational, actually, or objective about her right now. [01:21:05] I don’t mean rational; I mean clear. (long pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for  (inaudible at 01:23:23)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re welcome.</p>

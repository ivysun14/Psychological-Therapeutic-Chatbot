<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  Finishing out school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yes.  It's all the activities that have to do with school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were they done last week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Exams start tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Friday last day or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It will be nice to have the behind you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  They'll be home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you'll have all that fun time together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My son and my daughter?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're at each other's throats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got to keep them busy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, my son, my, my husband will make him work because he's going to want a car and he, you know, he doesn't, he wants him to put his money into it, but it's just not the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He got to work for dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, he wanted to do something different, but I think this summer will be better than last summer.  He was working with a guy that's not with him anymore.  I don't think he enjoyed working with that guy.  That, uh, he was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He was working for dad last summer too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh, he's been working for dad ever since he was 11 or 12.  But, so, [NAME OTHER] not, [NAME OTHER] my easy one.  But, my daughter's the hard one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].  How are you going to entertain her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just really she hates to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Not sure doing what.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not about getting off [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, he, he's in an office, but what he's going to get them [INAUDIBLE] paper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No paper work she can do or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe, but not anything regular.  I don't know.  There's plenty she can do at home, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She ain't going to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but I'm just not going to take her shopping for anything until she starts doing a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is she this, now?  This -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].  [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's [INAUDIBLE].  She's making Bs and Cs and having a blast, but, you know, we've got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Chasing boys yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's had a boyfriend all year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> These are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's not mature yet.  When she matures a little bit, I, I mean last year, she had some [INAUDIBLE] already calling.  That's not good.  He's three years older.  Fortunately, she's so smart, she knew that they were trouble.  You know, she, she keeps up with it.  She looks up their stuff on MySpace.  She knows this guy, but she doesn't, and she might talk to one, but, um, I mean the best thing she ever did was one of them called, and I had already saw [INAUDIBLE] her thing because she had told me, you know, a couple of them had called and so, she wasn't looking last summer.  I looked through, just her history and some of it.  And so in the thing and one of, it was one of those boys.  And she didn't recognize the number.  I said, [NAME OTHER], I think it's [NAME OTHER].  And as soon as she saw that, she just handed the thing straight to [NAME OTHER] and that was the shortest phone conversation you ever heard in your life.  That was so funny.  But, she's smart and that's part of my problem.  She's smarter than me and she's, she thinks quicker than me.  You know, I'm tired a lot and I mean, I'm trying to [INAUDIBLE] exercises, um, I've gained 5 pounds, so [NAME OTHER] told me that you can't gain anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh he did, did he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He told -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He has decreed it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's decreed it.  Yeah, he said you can't get big, but, um, you know if I exercise, I've got a little more energy.  But, I mean she'll hit me with something and it'll be, hit, mess me up so bad that then I can't think about the rest of everything that's going on after that.  Because it's such a battle [INAUDIBLE], but, I'm just going to have to not, she's just not going to get the things she, I used to do it.  The thing that she wants to do, so she wants to go shopping.  "Uh, sorry."  That's bad, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because we need to get out.  I'm real hesitant to get out, you know?  [NAME OTHER] told me, he said, "You've got to at least get outside and swim with [NAME OTHER] everyday even though I got to get some sunshine."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It helps me.  She, uh, she said, she said the other night because we all, we were all able to get in the water.  And I got in the water and she's trying to, see, I can't swim that good.  I mean, are you surprised?  I mean I was encouraged, you know.  But, um, oh they're fish and she's like, "Mama, this is what," she's trying to help me with different things, and she did.  And she said, just like that night, she said, "You're swimming a lot better."  So, you know, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looking out for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've got to get her in a camp and I have to have time, I think I've got time.  But, it's just been one thing after the other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does she want to do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Girl camp?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It would just be a week and it won't be long enough.  That's a long summer.  Three months pretty much.  Two and a half at least.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You guys getting away as a family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We, I've got, we've got to talk about that.  I mean, we've got to go [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, have you gone down to your house a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We want to.  We've got something planned on [DATE], like the week before and the week after, but that's with a bunch of adults.  We'll have the kids a little bit at that time and then pawn them off and then have a bunch of friends.  But, that's not, that's not until the [DATE].  And, um, the, the guys are going camping with soccer, our soccer family.  Just most of the guys, just guys this time, for four or five, four days.  And then, [NAME OTHER] [NAME OTHER] are going to scuba dive for lobster.  They never did get to do that last year.  And we're trying to decide whether to make that into a week trip this time.  That's what we've done in the past [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing with your time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not budgeting it very well at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They gave me an iPod for Mother's Day.  I love music.  Well, I've been downloading music.  Probably illegal music, but we won't worry about that.  And, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you need your iPod for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just listening to music on the beach or whenever there's nothing on the radio.  That way you don't have to have CDs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do you use it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't used it as much as I download the songs.  So, I'll have them because once I use it, I'm going, I mean I've only got so many songs on there.  I'll get sick of them, so.  But, I think I've got it up now.  I got to put them on the iPod.  You know, they had to show me how to do all that though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're hooked, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, it, it's nice having your, I, I, I had told them I wanted download music, you know.  And they [INAUDIBLE] that was my daughter's idea.  It's also my birthday, so, I mean she snatched it up.  She's smart.  See, I'm in trouble and, and my, my sister in law reminds me she could do a lot better in school.  And she could.  But, as soon as you critique her on something, oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] approaching that criticism?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It is.  [NAME OTHER] a little more [INAUDIBLE].  Now, if you beat him to death, that's not, he, that's not good.  But, um, if you say something to her more than, more than once though, and she'll, she's already said, "Mama, dad," I mean, "Dad, Mama, repeats herself."  And of course, she only hears the things she doesn't want to hear.  Like if you tell her, pick up something three times, she, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.  There's a reason you repeat yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  But, if it's something real, real important and I try, I'm trying to say, "Okay you can't do that and because of blah, blah, blah, you definitely can't."  And she'll say, "Mama, you talk."  Yeah, but I would bother, I would've just said a little tiny piece of it.  She just didn't want to hear anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  And why is it that you had to tell her twice do you wonder?  Because she doesn't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Uh, she's my handful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Not really.  I mean I didn't get much sleep the night before last, but last night, when I went to sleep, I slept hard and now, I took a little 20 minute cat nap before I got here.  I feel a lot better for it, but made me run late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your medicine working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess, that's one thing, I, I tried to take the, what is it?  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah at lunch and I just forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You take it in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take it in the morning.  I, I've got the morning, I've got my old schedule down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I, when I eat dinner is when I take the, at night is when I take, um, uh, Cymbalta, both of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then in the morning when I wake up, I know I need the, to get the [INAUDIBLE] and I'll take the Levogen.  So, I got that habit, but so, but I just, I realized, you know when I had my appointment at the [INAUDIBLE].  I had a, the last few weeks done very well with the, [INAUDIBLE] during the day.  So, this week, I loaded it in there for the week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does it make a difference if you don't take it at noon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't feel.  I haven't done it enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The morning dose helps?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I, I, I don't know if it, I mean my, you might could put a placebo in there and I might think I was fine.  I don't know, but when I haven't taken it, I mean one morning I didn't and I drove to school and on my way back I thought, "You know, I'm really doing tired," and I thought, "I haven't taken my medicine."  So, I pretty much always take it before I get in the car with the kids, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does it affect your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mood seems better.  Does it seem to you?  Seem decent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think my moods are pretty good.  I mean, I, I still my self esteem is low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think my self esteem was stronger when my kids were you know this big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Less challenging?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that what it is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you have some, does your husband back you up when your daughter complains to him that you're, you know, telling her over and over the same thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's one to tell her, "You don't do this."  And he'll stick to his word.  And if she's fussing about something and if she's going to [INAUDIBLE] if, if it's back, bickering back and forth he just says, "Stop."  He's more definite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but when she says -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whining that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mom, yeah, she whining about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says, "Stop."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, he backs you up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He tells her to quit whining.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, yeah, I mean we, we, he's supportive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not really your style.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  That's not your typical mommy style either, so.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean you're going to nag her.  You're not going to let her -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we're going to have to come down on her or she's going to, you know.  And that's the thing, she's so, she's made some good friends this year.  Um, the worst part, I mean, she's in, in the accelerated classes.  We can't take her out of there.  I don't care if she makes Bs and Cs.  I mean, she needs to make better.  She can do better.  She needs to do better.  But, um, she's got to stay in there so that she's with some studious kids.  And she has one friend who would be wonderful because she's, her mother and father went to high school with us.  And daddy was a handful, but mama has got a grip on those girls.  And I always wonder if it's because her mother is dead and was alcoholic.  I, I, I mean, she, she was smart.  She got away with a lot of things in high school, but she has those girls in dance and a serious dance company where she has no free time.  So all she has is study and dance.  And if that girl were more available, she's a very good example, um.  But she's not available.  So the girls [NAME OTHER] has, her best friend she's buddied up with right now and it's like [NAME OTHER] said yesterday, "We need to get her away from her."  She's not that bad, but um, she's wide open.  Worse than [NAME OTHER].  They're nice people, but her older sister is [NAME OTHER] age and as soon as my, as soon as [NAME OTHER] mentioned the older sister, the first words out of his mouth was, "Well, she's a slut."  First thing out of his mouth.  She's got a little, she's got a boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she's got a bad reputation.  So, you know, that's just, that girl is only in a couple of accelerated classes, and I have a feeling she's not going to stay because she's not going to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hopefully her parents push her.  She hasn't done well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You said she that she's met good friends this year.  They pretty much okay though?  Your daughter's friends?  They're okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  She, well, yeah, she's made a lot of good friends.  Some of the calmer, more studious ones that I already knew were in another group.  But, she was still in the accelerated group and she, you know.  There was some, she made a lot of new friends.  Oh, she had a blast in 6th grade.  I mean, you know, I, I told them in 5th grade, put her on the front lines, you know.  I mean she, she'll fight her way through.  She, ask her if she can do something and she's never done it before, she'll say, "Yeah, I can do that."  I mean, she's, I'm glad of the way she is, but it may kill me.  I don't want it to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why are you glad the way she is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, you know, I wasn't like that.  I didn't have that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're different aren't you?  You like her being more assertive and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I didn't get any of that encouragement either.  I certainly needed it.  And I have to explain that to the kids sometimes when they want me to just jump on something that they're going to do.  I'm like, "Whoa," you know.  We went to a water park last year and I mean they're maybe good.  And they didn't do that things where you get in the tube and go, sh, straight down.  They did everything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did everything else and I, I ended up getting in a tube.  But there was one thing I would not get on and they were getting upset.  And I said, "You all say in line.  Let me just watch."  And it was fine, but, um, they don't understand.  Why I can't do this.  [INAUDIBLE] everything else [INAUDIBLE].  And they were okay after that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You guys got any trips planned besides the beach?  You thinking about doing anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We want to do that [INAUDIBLE] water park [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm not busting right this minute to get on something three or four or five stories high.  It would be fun once I do the first couple, but I have to hear my daughter, "Mom."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got to go when they'll go.  They won't be wanting to go with you much longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  Well, my son is [AGE].  [NAME OTHER] took him and two buddies snow skiing in, [INAUDIBLE] North Carolina one Saturday.  You know early in the year.  But, um, and [NAME OTHER] went.  She shouldn't have gone, but she'd just gotten over being sick, but, uh, so [NAME OTHER] said she didn't ski much.  But, um, I just thought, you know, if I see, but it's okay.  It wasn't bad.  [INAUDIBLE] those boys had [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what are you doing with yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?  Oh, trying to keep my flowers from dying.  Um, planted a few.  Got about three, three or four books to read this summer.  So, I have reading.  [NAME OTHER] first, uh, they have a book place where a boy book and a girl book, they say that the whole school has to read one.  I started reading the boy book and [NAME OTHER], because [NAME OTHER] already had it and from my sister-in-law [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Works, works at book fairs and, um, I told [NAME OTHER] I said this is fourth grade reading.  Actually, he read, he was forced to read harder stuff in fourth or fifth grade.  I said you, it's real easy.  I told my nieces who are going to grad, my niece is going to graduate.  I said read that one.  Don't get the girl book because this is last year.  The girl book was much harder.  I said get the, get the, get the other one.  You'll breeze through it.  He begged to be out of honors English.  We didn't take him out.  I'm glad because he'll have to read two books over the summer.  Otherwise, he wouldn't touch a book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The year before last when we went to, to the book store to get his books, he picked out a book on [INAUDIBLE] and that's one, that, that's the other good thing.  And last year he picked out another book, you know.  And then I bought a book, I didn't work book fairs for years.  The warehouse in South Carolina, one of them [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I forgot about it.  It was round my bir, it was around my birthday the week before and, and my sister-in-law works it, and she's really good.  And so, then, her kids have all these books and, of course, I still had the book I bought last year that I haven't read.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You going to read the books you got for yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean I will.  I started one that's kind of a great rel, uh, religious book.  Have you have heard of "The Shack"?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I got half way into it and I said okay.  I had to think about this.  So I haven't read anymore.  But I need to get it back and you know and [NAME OTHER], and, and one of them is a children's series.  And [NAME OTHER] wanted to know where the newest one was.  He wanted to read it because we, he read them all.  So, you know, I'm trying.  I, you know, my sister-in-law is being strange.  Her daughter won three awards and yet, she's contemplating whether or not she can handle all accelerated next year and all that [INAUDIBLE].  Well, she needs to make some B's and not all A's, but her mother is, anything they do, she's got to read whatever she is studying at that, she brings it home and studies it.  I mean she, studies like, uh, a college kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Efficiently.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Efficiently, but it wears, she gets exhausted.  My daughter doesn't study at all.  There needs to be a happy medium.  We've always said that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think keeping her on task, keeping her organized.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That used to be my daughter's best friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's what they got to do.  Not waste much time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, of course, I, you know, [NAME OTHER] does get, she can get stressed out with school.  But, you know, I think B's, A, not, not insisting on straight A's, but, sh, sh, that's not pressure.  She doesn't really have pressure.  If she were studying very hard and making C's, I wouldn't scream, you know.  She's not, not, she's going, they review it that's what my children do.  They review over it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Other worries?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Financially, and that will be it, but I mean we're at, we're really okay.  I mean it's not like we're struggling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Business is turning around?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Work's just off.  He's [INAUDIBLE] that he's got to get a handle on things.  And he found out a lot of money was spent.  He got the last quarter report from their last job was being wasted, thousands of dollars.  Poof, it shouldn't have gone out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was a little upset and that just, you know, it's, I know our income is less than it was, though I feel like I have reason to be concerned.  Maybe before I, before I could just play ignorant and go, "Okay."  Maybe one day, if we need to be in a care facility or assisted living somewhere, maybe we'll have a little money.  [LAUGHING]  We might not.  Maybe our, we can help our children go to college.  Now, I don't know.  [INAUDIBLE] we'll be all right.  But, I can hope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure you will be then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We don't have money just sitting for [NAME OTHER] to go to college.  It, it's not there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You seem okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hope your summer goes well.  Hope the kids don't exhaust you too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Any suggestions?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keep them busy.</p>

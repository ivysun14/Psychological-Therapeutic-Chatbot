<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, if that happens again, let me know or throw something at me in the doorway every month. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. No big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would've obviously stopped if I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not an issue, so. So trying to figure out where to start. Trying to decide between the person that I turned in to the police for carrying weapons on the bus is now stalking me and intimidating me. Yes, that's where I just literally came from. That's why I was like I just need some quiet time. He found me—I didn't know what was happening. I get tapped on the shoulder, smooshed on the side of the bus, the whole—yes. At this point if I didn't know better I would think I was just hallucinating shit but I know it's not. It was just a freaking scary situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is what you're just going through just now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I tell you about this guy that having gotten on with his friend with it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes you did. I think you did. I think you said you signaled the bus driver to stop, everybody get off the bus...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes, the police picked him up because I guess he had an ankle monitor which made it a lot easier for them to find him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was back on the bus. And of all the places he—and I wasn't looking; I was using my iPod, listening. And I got tapped on the shoulder so I slide over to the side with the glass and there he was. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he sits down next to you on the left?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes but there's all these I-have-rage-problem types of things of getting—doing this and cracking his knuckles and going—you know what I mean? Like all these slightly aggression, kind of like leaning into you, doing these little intimidation tactics bullshit things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a word. And then I just sat there and I waited until everybody got off the bus. I mean he got off the bus first; he even had the little card he was carrying on last time. And I just waited until everybody got off the bus and I couldn't see anybody else around before I got off the bus. I made sure everybody was vacated before I—including him—because I just did not want to—yes. I mean he was doing a lot of things that made you think that he might be a little paranoid, I don't know. I was just like oh God, not this now. I don't need this now. So, yes. He very deliberately—I can tell now. He did it because he recognized me and he wanted to intimidate me. [00:02:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yes, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He didn't show me anything like that but he did look very aggressive, very I-want-to-make-sure-you-know-that-I-know-who-you-are kind of behavior. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what was going on with you during the bus ride?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was pretty scared. I texted my husband briefly to let him know that—at first it was I think it is this guy, yes it is this guy. That kind of stuff. I'm kind of scared. This and that. And then there was a certain commotion coming down from that. So now when I get done with this I'm going to go try to tell the police officer that did the report and all that stuff I have to let him know that he's doing that. I mean I can't forbid him from being on the bus but there's got to be something they can—to make sure he's not intimidating people like me. Yes, it was just not one of my high points. Oh God. That's not even the scariest part of the week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, so far we're up to what? The last 45 minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. I don't know. I've got to, Friday morning we've got to drive back to Cincinnati. I'm going with some people that I knew in school. Is a un—how do I explain this? It is a little bit of a secret but it's known by several people that Sarah killed herself. Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Last time I checked they were working on making sure that this was ruled as inconclusive as to what was the cause of death and it's possible. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:04:23]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Something she took. Yes. So, because her parents will not take that well. They keep pushing off when the funeral's going to be because the body hasn't been released by the medical examiner. So now it's looking like it might be Sunday, I think. Yes. [00:04:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, you must be a wreck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and that leads to something even weirder than that. It's just been such a freaking nightmare with everything with that. I've actually— I should start on a positive note, through. I have made the executive decision that I don't want to have anything, anything—actually I should probably explain this—I don't want anything to do with any of my in-laws any more, at all. Ever. Dave's okay with that and I said and I don't want any of our children ever to—I've been trying to play this moral high ground. I'm not trying to pressure you to do one thing or the other but I just can't handle any of this any more. </p>

<p>I should probably explain to you that sometimes they do things that make me so upset that I throw up. It hasn't been that much recently but in the past. The problem is I sort of swept it under the rug because it was at the same time I was getting my gall bladder out and I had a whole bunch of other things going on so it was very easy to kind of blame it on that sort of. Like stress plus missing part of organs being—but now—and I realized that Friday night after throwing up everything I ate I just am never going to let people make me throw up ever again. And it's the most—I mean it's only usually—I mean I don't have this happen very much. It's happened a couple of times with other things but not really. I'm not like I get anxiety and I throw up kind of person. But I had a conversation with Dave's stepmother that made me so, so upset that I just wanted to have nothing to do with them ever again. And it was just so overwhelming I'm like you know what? No more; I can't handle this. [00:06:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I had called her just to give kind of give her a little bit of a heads up that a mutual friend of Dave and I had committed suicide and also that there's actually been some suicides at Dave's work over the past few months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Two of them at the Institute, and that's been over the past year, still.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two suicides at the Institute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the Institute?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the medical—it's a joint thing with the schools. That's where technically he's supposed to be. But they've had one grad student and one post-op commit suicide. And disturbingly enough my husband's being treated by the psychiatrist, at the very least from what we understand that's the first time. We were like I think that's that psychologist that was treating one of the girls that committed suicide too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of those two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of those people, yes. Yes. We haven't had that officially confirmed but he used to see her in the waiting room occasionally and she's dead now so you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So anyway, I just wanted to kind of—his stepmother is a licensed psychiatrist. She's a practicing therapy—I don't know. Something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:08:11]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that. Something that has some kind of hokey master's degree kind of that you can get through the mail or online these days, yes. And she has some other things too. But, you know, I just wanted to sort of put it on her radar because Dave's, there's a lot going on with him. I felt that they should really know this just because I don't really believe he's suicidal but I think that right now he's bleak. He is very—he has so much, he's so flat, he's zoning out. I mean so flat that nothing makes him happy, not food, not his favorite shows, he's so flat that he's really making me worried. And she said some things to me that really bothered me. </p>

<p>First of all she told me when I told her that two people in his workplace had committed suicide she said that's a really big building, honey. Okay, the whole building although it's black band [inaudible at 00:09:06] circle...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not like a...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's where he works. I mean, yes, it is a big building but that's not the building.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you're right, it's a circle. I'm just stunned that that's what she said. Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And that's one of the ways statistically, that 1 percent of the people who have appointments, is in that group is now dead because of 200 people, 2 people dead, yes. And then she sort of kind of implied that Sarah sort of made her own choices and that we have to respect them and that's sad but there's nothing that we could've done or—and I understand being told there's nothing you could've done, but more or less...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you felt like there was—I mean isn't that kind of—sometimes that kind of worry and guilt and issues doesn't sound like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean they're aware that all of us have a little bit of guilt but not the same thing. It's the oh I should have, and it's not like we ever thought we would keep anything from happening but it's regrets that you have when anybody passes away. [00:10:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I remember that you mostly were really good friends with her husband and felt really awkward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and Dave looks up to her husband and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I find out that they had bouts with infertility and—I mean this whole thing, there's a lot of things like this. And I thought you know what? And the funny thing is, is that one of the things that's really upsetting him the most is the fact that she was what he perceived to be mean to her when we were in college. It's actually now that this is all coming out and we're finding this out it's actually that she was very insecure because of lots of reasons. Like technically she was at the school across the way and just crossed the registration thing and she always felt like she was inferior to certain people. But she always liked him; she just was on guard a little bit and she didn't feel as comfortable. </p>

<p>Then he found out that, you know, because she had dated a lot of people we knew and she had actually confided in a really close mutual friend of ours that she said I love the way that Dave treats Debra. That's what I want. I want to find a relationship like that. He didn't know that. And that really upset him. He thought that she was kind of a mean girl that turned her life around, knowing that she was actually just putting her heart outside so no one could hurt her for not being as smart and knowing now that the reason why she met—she wouldn't have met but she decided to date our friend who was going to treat her right because she was sick of having all this kind of stuff happened is because she liked the way that he treated me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that just came out in the last week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because you don't break confidences on that kind of stuff. But he felt like these are things that really ought to be known. It's not like she would—she probably wouldn't have minded. [inaudible at 00:12:03]. But you don't immediately go and tell somebody that. So he mentioned—I talked a little bit about sometimes she's a little bit hostile but it really wasn't the fact that—it's more that she was just on guard or being—she was so used to being told how dumb she was. Not by any of us but people in her life that she was a little bit on guard when she was around certain people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's much for anybody. [00:12:30].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And so but yet she didn't—she knew us and we liked her but she was always a little bit—she never really felt good about herself. And knowing this and knowing now that it was an obviously long, life-long depression, never feeling like she was worthy of anything, this reflects a lot on his mood. He sees this. He—Dave's never handled—He feels like he's an imposter amongst others. A lot of people perceive him as being angry when he's just nervous or—you know what I mean? I was told I ought to tell her this stuff and she basically made me feel like crap afterwards for ever—all I wanted to do was personally put it on her radar because he pretends to be something different when he's on the phone. He just does that; it was learned behavior. </p>

<p>And I never felt—I mean I didn't tell Dave I was doing it. I did tell him immediately afterwards, because I just—it was the worst feeling I ever had. Not the worst feeling I ever had but really up in the top 10 worst feelings I had after that point. Just making me feel like either that Dave—it just felt a little bit like a tough love conversation that you'd have if somebody's a drug addict. Like oh, he needs to find his way in the world, I can't let him—you know when you can't—it was just so screwed up. And so I talked to him when it happened and I felt so sick and so—I called him, I called on the bus. I said I'm going to talk to you when I get home about this but I just wanted to let you know that I was so worried about you that I called your stepmother and she made me feel like crap. And then we talked the rest of it out and I went nothing. I mean she more or less, she kind of like made this whole thing—and then she couldn't believe we're going to Cincinnati for this and this and that. And I [inaudible at 00:14:19] dismiss that because she—many people who were not in the Greek system or don't—in tight-knit private institutions don't have this kind of thing, where... [00:14:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not that hard to understand that you're really good friends with him, whatever the institutional context. I mean that doesn't sound like her [inaudible at 00:14:46] appreciate their system. It sounds a lot more like her just being horrendous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Well I've met other people that inaudible at 00:14:52] like when I had to switch...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, [inaudible at 00:14:57] was explained to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: My friend John said I should just tell people my sister-in-law died because it's true. I mean it was my—I was involved in this fraternity; she was involved with the fraternity. It's a fraternity that's married to the public. He said just tell people your sister-in-law died; it'll be a lot easier for them to understand. And it kind of works that way but you know what I mean, it has a very close feeling towards that. But it's just—it just made me feel so freaking atrocious. And then she had to bring up work at that point and how much Dave's dad is looking forward to his new phone, along with a couple of other things. I think she was just trying to make small talk to sort of ease the way out, that kind of thing. And I was just like I was so mad at myself because you know what? They would never, literally never call me if I didn't initiate anything and I don't initiate very often at all. </p>

<p>I mean I had—being contacted by them on their own without something to trump (ph) that is very, very rare. Like if we get a speeding ticket that was somehow was delivered to their house because of something weird they might call us about that. They would definitely never call me, even if my name was on the speeding ticket. They'd call Dave to tell him that, or something like that. But there's so little—I mean I have to ask for it and I feel so stupid. I know that I want to do the right thing. I wanted to make sure that people—even if I was jumping to conclusions, which I'm not entirely, I'd rather have them concerned than not know about this kind of stuff. [00:16:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm just done. I'm really done. And the worse thing is I don't ever, ever want those people to have anything to do with our children, biological or not. One because they're so freaking flippant about the possibilities of ever having children because they're—like the whole concept of well I don't think that the people—his mother or his stepmother saying things like I don't' think it's a really good idea for you guys to adopt but I guess the people at the adoption agency will figure that out. Like—because Dave's depression. I'm like you know what? Dave, I mean, everything is like, everything—I have to occasionally feel like I have to pause and turn to other people if they're around and think did I just hear this? Is there—am I just making shit up or am I escalating this more than it needs to be? And as far as I can tell I'm not, maybe slightly but if I did I'm remembering reverse word order that makes it slightly more dramatic. But things are not like—I mean this is so freaking screwed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me like you're kind of looking around. You're trying to look at this in any way you can that might make it not true but it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it is and I'm okay with that. And I'm not sure I'll want to talk to people about it because most people don't get—I mean I tried for years, went through a lot of questions, and I've just got to get an easy story straight. Not like a lie but something that's simple and easy for people to understand because everyone wants to know. Oh, you're going to see them? When are you guys going to visit? I say never, never. [00:18:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. For what it's worth, for those who said really today but before as well seems like I read in the books to know what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has to make his own decision for the rest of it. I try not to pressure him. That's the biggest reason why I let myself be hurt over and over again is I never want to be that spouse who makes you stop talking to people. But you know what? It just—it's just that bad. It's just that bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—you know it—the whole thing is just so, I don't know. Everything about them is just so—there's something broken and disturbing and that's been haunting me for a really long time. At one point Dave—something led to another, led to another, so he decided to look up—his mother gave her house to Dave's sister when, right about the time that we got married. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Around the time you got married?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we got married. So the issue is she's having her baby and all this other stuff and so she gave it to them. In theory she was going to be paying them an amount for her rent but you know that stuff never really happens. And whatever it was it would never be the right amount.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a huge thing with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. Dave's mother moved away at that time I think she was somewhere and gave the—oh that's right, she wasn't living there and gave the house to Dave's sister. So Dave's sister's living in their childhood home for free because you make a couple small payments and then you kind of forget about it the rest of your life. But, yes so anyway she's living there and he looked up and I don't remember exactly. He explained to me what it was that led to this. I think it had something to do with the limited weather or something like that. [00:20:33]</p>

<p>And just the Google images of the house and you see almost [inaudible at 00:20:40] people—mostly—it's mostly green yards, they had a wet summer for a while—and then you see literally a brown rectangle in front of her house with all the stuff falling over in front of the house I mean and it's not even like—they just never even bothered to water the lawn the whole summer, whole summer. And you'll see that kind of brown in winter but not—yes. And that's really like definitely this broke-down, screwed up thing. Dave's dad had this special inground pool that is actually salt water—yes, I know—yes, salt water, which is super—when we called [inaudible at 00:21:23] they're going through the thing because you can't turn off the pump ever on those things, they have to be on forever. And so he's keeping them insulated or something when they actually got snow. And there's the ridiculousness of that with the ridiculousness of things like shoving (ph)—because the dishwasher's been broken for 15 years, so everyday they put a new towel underneath it to keep it from leaking. You know what I'm talking about? </p>

<p>This is the kind of sickness that's there and I just can't reconcile it. I can't handle it and I just don't want it in my life any more. Even though they're not in my life, the point is, is that they're in my head and I don't want them there any more. And I don't want to have to worry about what they're going to do to my husband or what they're going to say about me or whatever. It's just—I'm just done. I'm just really done. And I've sort of, I mean I've sort of not been entirely honest with you about the fact that if I let myself how much I can get myself really panicked and sick and everything if I get involved with thinking about the things that happened or in the past. [00:22:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what made that hard to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they make me think that I'm acting like a drama queen and therefore when does a drama queen hyperventilate over something that happened in 1998 and throwing up in a trash can over something that happened in 1998? That definitely sounds like a drama queen thing to do. That and I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think you're a drama queen. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I have nightmares—if I let myself, I will become a freaking basket case over it. And so I think that talking about it doesn't make it any better. I think talking about it just aggravates it more. And I'm not believing that it's it for all things but I think that that is—there's nothing that I can do or say—because I talked about it a lot—nothing I can do or say to make it any better and I never, ever thought that any of this behavior was okay, ever. And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think you'd be excruciatingly upset about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was very, very traumatic. I don't think I can explain this because it sounds ridiculous to say that kind of thing but if I let myself I can get myself really, really upset about the whole thing. And so I was angry that I let somebody do this to me. And I was just kind of frustrated so—more than kind of frustrated. I'm just so over all of this, I can't handle any more of it. And quite frankly the few things that my family have said that they know about and that kind of thing for what they—because they have to translate it into something that they can understand. They're not really good with dysfunction; they don't really understand it very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I see some people from families kind of like Dave's where things are really, really out of whack. And one of the things that's so tricky about it is that people who don't really have experience with families like that, I mean even before you get at them, tends to translate what they hear into terms that makes sense as far as families that they do know. So in other words like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They actually can't though, with them. They just don't get it. They don't understand at all. And that's why I don't give them a whole lot of details. They just cannot fathom—they don't think it's like—they can't translate saying oh there must be something else in the story or anything like that. They just don't get it. The only thing that they do kind of understand is why they don't, no one takes care of Dave and his family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they horrified by it? [00:26:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that they don't—I don't let them know enough of it to be horrified about it. I mean what—I think that they think that because of, they think that my parents are taking care of him therefore they don't need to take care of him. That's the only thing that they can really understand. And the idea of okay, Debra's parents got it, they're closer. They got that one. They got other kids, my parents only had one kid, that's the only thing that they can even remotely understand. I've talked with my dad about why he never did anything to do with family law or anything, any of that kind of stuff, because he just he couldn't handle it. The sheer concept of dealing with any of that kind of stuff is just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What effect has it had on him? Is it just overwhelmingly upsetting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's upsetting. He has no idea—he can't understand why in the world people would behave in the way that they did and he felt like he couldn't adequately represent clients because he couldn't be able to understand enough about their motivations. He couldn't put himself in their shoes at all. Why in the world would you ever do that? And so he just refused to have anything to do with that kind of stuff. And it just—they love Dave so much. I mean they're not always so good about it. And they actually admit, we didn't raise boys so we don't really understand what guys like for Christmas or whatever but they do just fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they don't have a first world (ph) inbound problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly, yes. And they're very funny about it, too. But it's—overall they look pretty good. They're lives—they just, and to be honest I don't really want to make them sad about it because I think they will be very upset to know that their daughter's been going through this without saying anything to them. [00:28:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess this is the thing I always say when you say things like that. Maybe they'd rather know and be there for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'll let them know that I'm under a lot of stress but I don't want to—they just don't need the details. There's certain things you can't unhear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Some things you can't unhear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine, I mean I appreciate how you're sort of keeping this from them to protect them and be supportive of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also it's one use of privacy of details.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it. I was sort of going in, I imagine they would be very helpful and supportive of you if they knew but maybe that's not so. Maybe...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They'd be awful supportive of me but they would also—I know that my mom would be very much upset that I let myself get beat, taken advantage of. Not upset with me but just upset in general, sort of troubled. And, I don't know, like I said I just—there's few people that really know about what's going on. One of the first persons we're going to pick up along the way, she says you know if you actually really understand the whole background of Dave's family, there are two different directions he could've turned out. Then of course she doesn't hold back, she's a civil engineer so she knows everything. She said he could've been in one of her kids that liked her animals and turned out to be a psycho, or he could've turned out to be completely different than everybody else in the family and very sensitive person. I'm glad he's not the psycho. But she says but for a like a couple of things he could've turned out very different and very screwed up. They—the fact that he turned out okay is apparently okay because no harm no foul. [00:30:34]</p>

<p>So, I'm just—yes. And just like this is just the beginning of all this crap. Luckily I won't have to deal with them any more because I'm just done. I'm completely done. Nothing ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, no it sounds like you're planning to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even going to have anything to do with them to tell them I'm not going talk to because why bother because they would never know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:31:00].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, why would I tell them that? I mean they don't care. Not only that, but they don't—what is different from being a strange woman than the way it is now? Before I talked to her, I talked to her probably in 2002 on the phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to tell them. It's fine; you don't owe them anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. But I'm just, like I said I'm exhausted. I need to take care of the people who make me feel good about my life. And they've never made me feel good about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's always helpful to have them the hell out of your life. And not only does that mean you won't have incidents like this any more but also that it helps get them out of your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. For the most part like I said it's not as bad as all that. Like I said, it was just really, really, really acute back in 2000, 1998, and then like I said and part of it was it was so messed up with like I said having my gallbladder removed and all this other stuff happening that I sort of dismissed a lot of it as being also partially due to the stress of this, that and the other thing. [00:32:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you're being a drama queen about this. I think you're—it's been genuinely devastating and at times really terrible for you the way they've been. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If I think about it, it can be like it's happening to me literally at that second over and over again. That's why I don't want to think about it. I mean I relive it like it's happening in front of me. I don't need that. And maybe that's—I don't know. I want to focus on the people around me that makes me feel good about myself like I said or who actually care about me. And I just feel like I'm done not wasting anything on other people like that. So that's the big things so far. There's about a million other little things that have been going on but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would you think that? We don't have to go into it if you don't want..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. It's a combination of that I'm starting to break things with steroids and also I am, because I've been off of the—because I was sick last week, I went off of the immunosuppressants and I got a big what's call rheumatoid nodule which is basically in the joint a fluid. The [inaudible at 00:33:59] system gets in there and makes a giant cyst-like thing and it's real painful. So if I let anything touch it, it hurts. Unfortunately, I don't know if it'll go away. It may be there permanently, I don't know. I've got to go see the—the ones on my feet are there but they stopped—I mean they hurt but I've stopped being bothered by them. The fact that it's right there makes—I have to keep—I have this on here so that—I turned on my shower and I had screamed bloody murder. I opened up a bottle of—I can't do much of anything else. This is supposed to help me at least until...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will protect it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Also like I said there's a little bit of a stress fracture in that finger too. So yes, good times. [00:34:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yes, like I said it's just one thing after another after another. And none of them are individually are that bad but boy. Oh I forgot to tell you also, I have no bank account. My bank had—what do you call it—a hostile takeover, yes, and, yes, and so—my bank was. And one week they took it over and so basically everyone who had free checking because you had investments with them, they just wrote you a check for what you had and just [inaudible at 00:35:29]. So I found that out Friday. Yes. So I have no checking account. Yes, tomorrow I'll have one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And back to Dave's safety it doesn't sound like you're worried he's imminently at risk but just sort of generally concerned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am concerned that—I don't think he's at risk to hurt himself now. I think that he's at risk right now for over-reflective behavior that can lead to more self-destructive behavior if that makes sense. Doing stupid things, acting out, driving too fast or whatever. Basically being reckless. Thinking, getting stuck in his own head and not seeing the world around him. Possibly with the stupid things that will bring the house down because he's thinking about this and forgets the water is on the stove, that kind of thing. I don't think he's actually at risk for hurting himself right now. But, yes. I think that especially right now, the number one reason why is because he knows, he's seeing what's happening to those survivors and...[00:36:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think he's suffering, sort of think about it, but that he would be very concerned about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean he's saying that his stress of [inaudible at 00:37:02] not even being able to be near his wife's body because of the coroner's inquest. Can't even bury her. That's a very real thing. I think that inaudible at 00:37:16] that that's—yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's still seeing a shrink a couple times a week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Twice a week, yes. So—and they've been talking about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He and your husband have been talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, he said he's been talking about it a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay good. Yes, I mean if you get I sorry [inaudible at 00:37:42] the message saying you're worried but it sounds like things are pretty clear about [inaudible at 00:37:48]. Good. And we'll stop in a minute but are you feeling like things are okay enough to go home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. The last time I saw that guy was in the [inaudible at 00:38:04] so. On top of it my husband gave me a zip car in theory somewhere in the Square to get me. But that's just mostly so we can get groceries. Ah, got a car on the way, so yes. Oh by the way, just as a quick side note, I don't know if this will make it worse or not if the guy actually asked me what happened to my finger I was actually going to tell him that I was at the range and I had a trigger accident. That could actually work either way. I've got friends that used to do things like women would read gun magazines on their metro to keep people away and it worked out well. [00:38:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I actually thought about that. I said you know it could go either way but I was thinking about that but I said if he asks that question I can always say I was at the range practicing and had a trigger accident. By the way I've never actually shot a gun. I've been around them because I [inaudible at 00:39:00]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. You shoot your textbook—they're not into shooting any real targets. You shoot your textbooks after you're done with your classes. They have a thing where you can go down there and—yes. It's more about killing your textbook. It could've been what I was worried about too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll see you later. Thank you. [00:39:29]</p>

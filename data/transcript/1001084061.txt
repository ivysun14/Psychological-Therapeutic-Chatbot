<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p><p><b>DR:</b> Anyway [NAME OTHER], tell me please what was going on here?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to try to be articulate</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Please, okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Over the years, [PATIENT NAME] has had many depressions.  He's gone for therapy for many years, the problem has been basically that he would work at getting out of a deep depression but when he got well enough to really tackle the problems, he didn't so in my mind, what I really really want to see him do is take on the responsibility of his mental and his emotional health and development.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And as a result of this, it has impacted our marriage because he's never really dealt with his anger, his rage or his ambivalence which has made intimacy difficult on many different levels.  So in my mind, this has been the longest 1 and there's 2 separate issues here, there's the metabolic imbalance and then there's the behavioral.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And in [PATIENT NAME]'s case, they're both as important as the other.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But what I can't, it was so long a time that A, he was on the couch and B, he'd begin to do something and it would seem like he's turning a corner, then boom he went back down and part of that was because he wasn't ready to make that move out, that I couldn't take on the responsibility of the whole problem and his illness by myself.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're not a therapist right, it's not your role.  You're not a doctor.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I tried everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not a doctor.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But not only that, I just couldn't be, I was everything to him but a wife.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And I couldn't urge him, help him, just like what you said, I couldn't make any impact on him wanting to get better this time so I had to save myself in terms of, I've been out of the house for about 6 weeks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And I needed to do this because I needed to heal myself and to breathe on my own and to finally say to him, I need you to, I need you, whatever you do, you're going to do for you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I didn't leave to punish him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Or as a chess move - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It was because A, I was, I couldn't take any more of the burden, I couldn't watch him, it hurt me to watch him but there was another element there, there was an incident with a knife, I think he probably told you about and he went to take up the knife and he came towards me, not for 1 second did I think that I was in danger physically.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But what he was doing was bullying me.  This was the way, he was saying.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Threatening you.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I could come home and you could find me dead any day and he was in this, he was in this space where he didn't want to live and he didn't want to die and he couldn't get off the fence and it was a threat whether I was there or I wasn't there and I, I don't want, I can't live with that threat anymore.  He had to make a decision on his own what he was going to do or not do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So my feeling though is that he, right now, I see an improvement in him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He's better than he was.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But he's fixated on my coming back in order to continue to develop -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Emotionally and mentally and my feeling is, is that right now he needs to start taking it on himself and I'll know, I'll have that feeling of him being better and more loving and kind and less judgmental.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And there will be that feeling of energy and intimacy where I'll want, I don't want to not be with him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I love this man -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But I don't know who he is anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I know I'm probably, I'm rattling because I'm trying to get a lot in, in a very short time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, you know what, you're doing a great job and hold that thought right now because I want to address a couple things here.  One of the problems has been that, I think [PATIENT NAME]'s, you know, diagnosis has been kind of up in the air and, you know, he's been called all kinds of different things and, you know, the most frequent presentation may be a depressed state but there have been times where his thoughts were not organized where he's had these, you know, bizarre odd thoughts, there's been some times when people didn't know if he was rooted in reality, I mean he's been going through a lot of stuff, okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, do you feel that he is, um, he has some control over some of these behaviors, um, or part of these behaviors or none of these behaviors?  Do you feel he's somehow playing a game or acting out or do you see him as just a victim of somebody who just got bad chemicals, bad genes, whatever and I mean what do you think about that number 1.  The next thing is, when you left the house, did you have an end game in mind.  I mean did you plan on leaving for 6 months or 6 years, did you feel that you were going to never come back or that you might come back, I mean who knows how and when things are stable enough that you're comfortable enough going back.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Let me finish, give you the first question, then we'll go to the second question.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll [INAUDIBLE] the first question [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well let me just say, before you answer, I had a patient, a woman, I was treating the husband and he was diagnosed bipolar and the wife didn't believe that or maybe believed it but that there was a lot of things in his control that he did and she said to me, you know doc, I don't really know about his diagnosis but I tell you what I think, I think there's a fine line between mental illness and just being an asshole, okay, and I said you know, you put that very well because sometimes, I've seen people beat up their wives, do all kinds of crazy things and then say well, you know, it's not me, it's my disease, it's my illness, you know, I can't be blamed for that, I can't, and they use that as an excuse, um, so I don't know how much of this is under his control, I don't know how much of it's not under his control.  I know, you know, he's had all kinds, he's been on every medication under the sun and so maybe you can fill in some gaps here and I will tell you also that although this is only my third, I saw [PATIENT NAME] for the first time, it's only been October, I saw him October 2nd and from October 2nd to the end of this month, he's made, I think, significant improvement, you know, he couldn't sit still, he was all over the place, not making sense, I mean he wasn't hearing voices, well you were, I forget now if you told me you were hearing voices or not but I mean he was out of it and he was so agitated and out of control and, you know, not knowing if he was going to be here tomorrow or not, knowing that, you know, he's got a long time he spent with you.  I'm sure there's been a lot of good and bad go down over the last few years.  I'm sure he feels, like you say, ambivalent about, you know, should he be with you, should he be not with you, should he be alive, should he be dead, there's a lot of stuff that's been going on, you know, career, financial, all kinds of stuff and you have had to deal with the brunt of the stuff.  This is not unusual but, I mean, it's when you have a child who has a disease whether it's a physical ailment or a mental illness or whatever, you know, often marriage ends over that.  You know, this is different here because he's not your child, I mean he's your husband and while you hate to walk away from 25 years of marriage or whatever, you know, you've got to protect yourself.  You can't go down the hole with him and end up having there be 2 people, you know, kind of lose their lives or be incapacitated, so I know you're trying to protect yourself.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, to answer your question</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We've been married 31 1/2 years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME] has always had a Dr. Jeckle Mr. Hyde personality.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I married Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde started coming out more and more and more over the years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> There's 2 issues here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes, he's had metabolic imbalances but the other part that, yes, I think needs to be addressed is the anger and the rage that he has and he's never, even when he was in his own home, his parents never gave him limits or boundaries.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And when I married him, stupidly, I thought, because I think it makes a difference now and I'm older now, but I thought if I gave him unconditional love that he would mature and, you know, be able to get over certain things and that we would have a wonderful marriage.  There's been love, passion but there's a side, I want to say Dr. B because I don't know how to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's fine, that's fine, that's what we want.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> There's such anger still and there are, there is a side to him that hasn't been very respectful to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Or non judgemental and there are issues in terms of his emotional development that I think could be worked on and never has been.  Nobody has made him responsible for this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Including me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Until now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> To answer your second question.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, before you answer the second question, let me tell you this from my part, I could be completely, um, oblivious or blind to this but I do not believe that [PATIENT NAME] has been at least visibly angry with me.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He may have been questioning, he may be, he has not been an angry person with me so the anger that you report, it may be directed primarily at you or people close or I don't know if it's anybody at any time.  I can tell you that in the sort time I have know [PATIENT NAME], I have not felt that he has been, you know, aggressive or angry with me.   Now whether, for whatever reason, I don't know why that is, maybe if I still work with [PATIENT NAME] in time maybe he will become angry with me, I don't know, but I'll tell you what I have done which may have been different, I have set clear boundaries with [PATIENT NAME] and I encourage [PATIENT NAME] to call me if there's a problem and we have a communication but I don't let [PATIENT NAME] run, you know, slipshod and do what he wants when he wants to do it.  I tell him that if you're going to work with me, you know, you need to at least be compliant and willing to take direction from me.  Again, I can't force him to do anything and each and every time I've seen [PATIENT NAME], I think to myself, you know what, I don't know if I'll ever see [PATIENT NAME] again, not because he's going to kill himself but because he might just say screw him, I don't need to do this or I'm going to do whatever I want, so I think [PATIENT NAME], you can jump in here [PATIENT NAME], I think I've tried to keep [PATIENT NAME] contained because I think as part of, part of [PATIENT NAME]'s growing up is to have access to anything at any time, anywhere, and he doesn't know, he doesn't know where the boundaries are, where the confines are and so he makes assumptions, he just figures this is the way it's been and so I think if [PATIENT NAME] has rules, he will  learn to play by those rules</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I agree and that's what I'm asking for.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes, he has anger.  He can get extremely sarcastic, extremely mean, okay.  In the past 2 weeks, in the past 17 days, he's had 2 rages, 2 rage incidences</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't know, obviously you didn't tell him.  There was a rage incident on Friday night, Sunday night going to my sister's house.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And he literally opened up the car door and was trying to jump out and I was on 95.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He did mention that to me.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, well that's not acceptable anymore to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's not acceptable and it should be condoned.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right, it happens.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's happening so what we need are 2 things, I would like him to really take on himself, he's always been afraid to learn, he's been afraid to get to know himself, he's not comfortable in his skin.  He can't be intimate in a way where he can like give up control.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And part of that is being angry that I'm not back in the house or whatever but it all contributes to, and then we need the marriage counseling, that's a separate issue.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> To try to change things from the way they were.  2 answer your second question, when I left the house that day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The first time you mean?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> When I left after the knife - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I just realized that I had to go, that I didn't have any plan, like I'm going to be out 2 weeks, I'm going to be out 3 months</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to be out 6months, I'm going to be out forever, I didn't have that plan, all I knew was is that I couldn't live with this, I couldn't be bullied anymore and that I had to start breathing on my own and realizing that I wasn't happy and I wasn't happy with him and he was nothing, he was paralyzed, he couldn't get off the couch.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he was vegetating.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He couldn't discipline himself, no matter what I said.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I said to him [PATIENT NAME], if you can't get a job or get a part time job, I don't care what you do, I don't care if you're a mailman, I don't care if you're in a bakery, I don't care what you do or go part time for community service.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Be out of the house 6 hours a day, I don't care what you do, I don't care, I couldn't reach him but when I left, I left for me because I couldn't take it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well maybe.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Do I want to come back?  I miss my home and everything in it so bad but I can't come back till I feel that we're starting to come together in a much more respectful kind way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Where he wants to work with me to get what we didn't have before because I'm not that person anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I can't be and I'll never go back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not a fool.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's not just being a fool.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's settling for a relationship that hasn't been kind and loving.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The way I need it.  I know he loves me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But he's got, he loves and hates me sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I agree, I agree.  Well, let me tell you this, I think [PATIENT NAME]'s brain has been chemically imbalances.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Totally for years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And all of the treatments that he's had and the medications, that also has complicated and changed his brain chemistry because he' been like an experiment.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> With people doing this, that and the other.  Now look, what I will tell you is that [PATIENT NAME] is far from his best optimal state and I think for many years of your marriage, you have been dealing with damaged goods that has been getting worse rather than getting better and so my hope is that if we can bring [PATIENT NAME] back to some kind of baseline that he is more rational and sane and not delusional and not psychotic and not angry and not depressed and not, you know, whatever, hostile and aggressive, that maybe there's a chance that you and he can rekindle some kind of connection that you had when you first met and decided that you were going to be together but the question I have is how does [PATIENT NAME] know when it's time, when it's right and how do you relay to him when you're going to, in other words, what kind of mark does he have to meet before, you know, there's not a guarantee that you're going to stay married but where are we going to start trying to get back.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't I get her to answer first and then you go ahead, you jump in.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I know that my answer is going to be different than hers.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I think that question right now for me is the crux of the problem because I have tried, you saw me the first time I was in here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you were a mess.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you put me on medication which I had horrible problems with.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To play doctor, she didn't like what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] scribed.  You prescribed 6 times the amount of Seroquel that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and she was blown away by what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did so she certainly was blown away by what you prescribed and she.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Because I was directly effected.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I was directly affected but that's why I was blown away.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So here I come to you, I do what you say, I keep saying to her, I'm doing what the doctors say so what are you yelling about this medicine because you're not a doctor, they're doctors, I do what they say and I told you that when I took the Seroquel and went out to [INAUDIBLE], we took a little vacation, I slept a lot, I slept a lot.  You put me on 6 times as much, I think 6 or 8 times as much and I don't sleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When I go to the pawnshop, I don't sleep, I don't stay there and take a nap, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I would dare say you know a lot more than [NAME OTHER] about medicine so that's why I listen to you not [NAME OTHER] but in the last 6 weeks, I think you've been right on, spot on, on what you said to [NAME OTHER] so far about me, that it's not all behavioral, like a lot of it's chemical because a lot of times, I don't remember what I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I legitimately, when [NAME OTHER] says I had a rage against my daughter, some of the things that I've been told I did, if I were a betting man, I would have said no frigging way I did that, I did not say that to my daughter, I have no recollection of it.  I do have recollection of the car incident because it got me so angry that I.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You told me that day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I knew that, I really do want to jump but my point is that it's not just me, it's everybody around us, whether [NAME OTHER] wants to here this or not, everybody that is, that is familiar with the situation and is familiar with my big leap in the last 6 weeks and how much more I've done and how much more I've tried, you know, know making dinners for [NAME OTHER] and bringing her flowers and trying to treat her nicely and the only times we have arguments are over whether she comes home but that's it, I mean I'm, it's precluding any possibility of my getting really much better because I don't have the support at home and it breaks me down when I'm home and I know she's 3 or 4 minutes away by car.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And that when, it's like the queen, when is the queen going to say, you know about enough.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But now you know, you've had it up to here, you're going to kiss my ass and I would come home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], here's 1 problem, I think you probably are a very narcissistic person with a huge ego and I think that part of her having back with you is just, is more to satisfy your own ego and needs more than anything else.  Why should she go back to a situation and lose more time out of her life.  I mean we're all going to die one day and time is precious, you know, and so I'm just saying [PATIENT NAME], it's not just about you, it's not just about her, I'm sure it's a 2 way street and there's all kinds of different complex issues in here but I think there is great potential for you to reconcile with you differences and for you to be happy and content and for her to be happy and content.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it hurts my progress when I don't have any support.  I don't have any support.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], what is she doing sitting her right now but supporting you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But that's long distance support but she's not going to come back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't need a nursemaid [PATIENT NAME], you're a grown man, you can take care of yourself.  You need, you know what, you cannot be a person, a successful happy fulfilled person if you're only 80% complete and you're looking for her to give you the other 20% to make you whole.  You've got to be 100% complete before she can come in and have a relationship and a rapport with you that's healthy and meaningful.  I think you're asking way too much of her and you have been enabled and spoiled over the years.  You need to be more independent and self reliant.  You can't count on others to do for you.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well it sounds like you are.  It sounds like you're angry because.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not angry.  I just feel like there's a point at which and it's been 6 weeks, for example, when [NAME OTHER] left she said in order for me to go back there are 3 things you have to do</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A, you have to make the decision to live rather than die.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> B, you have to get a job and stay there for 3 days and 3, I can't remember what it was.  I did those 3 things like that.  That was 6 weeks ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How do you know that you did if you can't remember what the third one is?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] knows the 3, she said them and [NAME OTHER] said you have done all those 3 but then there were 3 more things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then there were 3 more things and then there were 9 more things, then there were ten more things.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] do you know</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now it's like when my stomach tells me, well guess what, it's not helping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], you know, you know, these days, you know, irreconcilable differences is a grounds for divorce.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean that could be anything.  What does she owe you, you know, people in her shoes might have packed up and left 15 years ago.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I understand that but she has said that she wants things to work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What she wants, she may not be able to have.  Your part of the equation.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I understand and I'm working like hell.  You've seen how hard I'm working.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Look, you've made great progress okay, but I don't know what the marriage is like, I don't know what the issues are, I don't know what you've done to this woman what the problems have been but, look, it's complicated.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to look to the future not to the past.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Our marriage counselling says</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Live for today, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And worry about tomorrow</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I have said to [NAME OTHER] on numerous occasions, if you give me a chance and if you come home, why would I possibly want to repeat my behavior because if you leave the next time, it's going to be for good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], can I say something to you.  You know what, </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's very difficult for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Listen, I'm going to make a recommendation here.  I don't want to see [NAME OTHER] come back, leave, come back, leave, come back, leave.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If she leaves the next time, it'll be for good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's pointless, right.  I think that, I think that while it is very encouraging and promising, at least to me and  hopefully to you and hopefully to [NAME OTHER] that you are sane, rational, talking, thinking, I think that you've hurt this woman over the years, you just can't rub that out and say I'm sorry or can't you see, look how good I am right now, why don't you just come back and let's start all over again and play house.  I think that too much has gone under the bridge there for this to happen right now.  I think you need more time, more stability, a longer period of success and you need to be happy, you know, you're not doing this for her, you're not doing this to make a point to her, you should be doing this for yourself and you should be proud of your accomplishments because I know you've been responsible for part of this success and I think that the longer this goes on, success builds on success, actions speak louder than words.  You can tell her any kind of line you want and it's meaningless unless you back it up with your actions and so if you, you know, walk the walk as they say, she'll see it and she'll come back but until she's confident and comfortable, why should she put her, open up her guts to get, you know, destroyed again, you know, thinking that this is going to be just short lived.  I mean it's only been 6weeks that you've been apart.  I've only been working with you for 4 weeks, you know, give it time, you're not.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine.  I'm glad you disagree, we can discuss that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I understand that and I have backed up my talk with the walk.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For how long [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well but this isn't going to, this isn't going to go on for 2, 3, 4 more months, it's just, I'm telling you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's going to happen?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I will end it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You'll end what, you'll divorce her.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever happens, happens.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We've talked about divorce before.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It doesn't sound like a commitment on his end, does it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Listen [PATIENT NAME].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not going to be endless.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> First it was 3 things, then it was </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Six things, then.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], how old are you now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fifty seven.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Fifty seven], how many weeks in 57 years, she's been away 6 weeks, okay.  I mean imagine if you had to take a job somewhere and you were living, you know, across the country or we were in a war and you had to go serve your country, you know, for a year or 2.  Look, you either have a relationship or you don't, it doesn't matter that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I'm saying.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well you do have a relationship; it's just that right now things are too tox and she can't.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been toxic, they were toxic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If there's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She hasn't been there for 6 weeks, so she wouldn't know if it's toxic or not nor would you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, of course, I wouldn't know, all I know is what I've seen in the last few weeks and I think [PATIENT NAME], it's too great a leap of faith for her based on 2 weeks or 3 weeks of behavior.  In fact, how many weeks ago was it that you tried to jump out of the car.  Do you think that, do you think that helped your case or hurt your case?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I understand exactly what that was and I understand what triggered it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But why can't you control yourself a little bit better?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you might have answered that question before.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Some of it's chemical and some of it's</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's why, listen, I have not been doing therapy with [PATIENT NAME], I have been basically managing his chemicals and, you know, [PATIENT NAME] you can't do therapy if you're out of your mind, right, and so I'm trying to get you sane and rational and reasonable and then you can do therapy whether you do it with me or somebody else, I don't care frankly but I do, my job right now is to manage your medications.  I have been happy with he results thus far and I, again, I am very encouraged by this.  I think the rest of it is going to be on your shoulders to take that burden and responsibility of having some contrition in approaching this woman who has given you children, who spent the better part of her adult life with you.  You know, she's not a floor mat there, a doormat there for you to walk on at your whim and to come and go as you please.  I mean she's made a commitment to you but she has a life to live too and she wants to be a healthy human being not to be some object of your, you know, needs or desires or dictates, you know, so you've got to play, it's a 2 way street [PATIENT NAME], you can't have it your own way all the time.  I think, look, I'm very happy with what you've done so far, really I am and I hope that you guys can get together and have a great marriage, maybe better than you ever had before but, you know what, if there's too much that's gone on, if she's too angry with you, if you're too angry with her and it turns out that, you know, a year from now you're divorced, you know what, so be it.  My hope is that at least you're a better human being and a healthier person for it but, you know, I don't predict the future.  I would like to see you guys together.  If you can't be healthy together, I would wish you be healthy apart them because, you know, this is not an endless life we live here, time is short but you've got to make use of it.  Look at all time you spent on a couch doing nothing, worrying, dwelling, obsessing, you know, in your own fantasy world doing God knows what and out doing crazy harmful hurtful things, I mean look at all the time you wasted [PATIENT NAME].  So you're worried about 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, give her a break and let her feel comfortable to at least try and take a chance, you know, she's taking a gamble here that you're not going to just go back, you know, a week from now and do something silly again or chew her out or threaten her or whatever, you know, give her a break.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But what I don't think you see if that if [NAME OTHER] comes home and leaves again, it will be for good.  I am not stupid.  I am many things, stupid is not 1 of them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I realize that if she comes home, I have to walk on eggshells and have to, you know, have to behave.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], [PATIENT NAME], [PATIENT NAME], you act as if she wants you to perform for her, that's no way to live.  If you feel like you have to walk on eggshells, that's no marriage [PATIENT NAME].  You should be yourself and let her be herself and you 2 have some common ground, some common interests and it's a healthy union.  You shouldn't feel like you're trying to please her and you can't say or do certain things.  You know, there's a problem here [PATIENT NAME].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I would suggest to you that's what's happening and even her friends have seen it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's, that's why.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And talked to her about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's why it's not time for her to come back yet.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, no, I think it's time for her to reorient her thinking and let me just be me and not have to kiss her ass all the time and just be normal.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Is that a nice way to put it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's exactly what it is though.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME].  You know what - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Every time I try to do something nice, you find fault with it, let's at least be honest.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, I think you 2 make a very nice couple, you know, on the surface, I think you guys have a lot of, you probably have a nice interaction with each other potentially but, you know, [PATIENT NAME], look, you've done a lot of damage to yourself and you've done a lot of damage to her and she can't just say, oh all right, well [PATIENT NAME] told me he's taking his medicine and he's good now so I'll just come right back.  She's afraid [PATIENT NAME].  Give her some slack.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, you haven't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], you can't have it all your way.  You can't take your ball and bat and go home and say, you know, you don't want to play my way, we're not playing this game.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we're not playing much longer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's your decision.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We're not playing much longer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's your decision [PATIENT NAME]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It has to be.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It has to be.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm not playing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't mean to say it's a game.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> This is the big picture, I'm not playing a game.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I know that, it's not a game.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What would you call it?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Obviously, I'm going to [PHYSICIAN NAME] and saying to him - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I need you to work on your own mental development and emotional development so you can bring it to me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you think I haven't [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [PATIENT NAME], you're just emerging.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just worried about what you think.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> All right, I'll tell you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I asked you the question.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The essence is this, it's not what you do for me and I'm not asking you to kiss my backside, it's the, it's not what you do, it's the attitude and the energy that you bring to that and I'm saying to you, if you made me a dinner, I didn't want it to be because you want to make me happy and it pleases you to make me happy, not because, okay, I want a reward, I want you to come home because I did X, Y, and Z.  That's not the feeling that I need.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Why don't you.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I need from you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Why don't you ever call me and say I'd like to make you a dinner.  Didn't you say [PHYSICIAN NAME], it's a 2 way street?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So why is it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I've given everything I have</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm talking about the last 6 weeks.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't have anything left right now.  I'm still taking care of me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then what are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I am still, because I care.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What are you in this room for?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I have nothing left in me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If you have nothing left, what are you here for?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She obviously has a commitment here, she has a hope that maybe this can be resolved.  She cares about you, if not as a husband, as a human being, to see you healthy and happy.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, look, [PATIENT NAME], she's an attractive woman, she'll do fine, okay.  With or without you, she's going to do fine, I'm telling you right up.  You have a lot of potential, okay, but you know, you have this angry hostile streak in you that is not serving you well and I think, I'm trying my best to keep you focused.  When you called me the other day and said I have a problem with this medicine.  Look, [PATIENT NAME], if you want to go off the medicine, go off the medicine, okay, I can't, I want, you know, this is the first medicine that we've seen promise with and, you know, the list of medicines you've been on, let's try to stick with things and I want to see this through, I want to see you get better, I want to see you back on your feet, I want to see you happy and healthy.  You contribute to society, you know, I have responsibility and obligations, not just as a physician but as part of this planet we share, you know, I want it to be healthier rather than sick and unhealthy and evil.  You know, you've got a lot to offer her but, you know, I think your expectations are a little bit lofty right now and premature.  If you give her time, I think she will come around.  If you try to force the issue, you know the expression about cutting of your nose to spite your face, that's what you'll do, okay, end of story.  Okay.</p>

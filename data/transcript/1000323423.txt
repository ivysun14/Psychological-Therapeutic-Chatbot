<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) I was thinking about the fact that I was late today but then I kept thinking, I'm really thinking about that so I won't have to think about something else.  (Pause) But just in terms of my being late, it, whether or not it's something that I could have avoided.  I always feel as if I have to make a great thing about why I was late, so, so I won't be held responsible.  I guess I, I feel guilty whenever I am, no matter what.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I get the impression you uh, have been describing to me how you save stacks of things, piles of things.  I get some impression sometimes when you are silent here, it's as though you're saving a pile of something to say later.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I was thinking then was, when you, when I have uh, some idea of what it is I don't want to say, how much I should play the game (chuckle), that my mind's playing, and how much I should try to stop it.  (Pause) I think what's on my mind is the fact that I want your role to be something much more active than it really is and what I understand it should be.  And I was thi—, thinking in terms of the, uhm other incidents I mentioned before of people who are in the position of being, well I don't know exactly the word, but I looked upon them as helping me.</p>

<p>For instance the man that was my master teacher, one who was uhm at RZG and he took his role as being a little bit more than just simply getting you ready to teach.  Well, he saw this as part of his role, to ask you to really look at yourself too.  And he was highly critical of anything we did in the classroom, and, and so, then, I knew he was trying to help us and that uhm, he was really dedicated to what he was doing so I could I could accept the kind of criticism he was giving me.  But then I had to look at him in a certain way.  You know, I was describing it, of sort of a father on the one hand and on the other hand, because he approved of me basically or accepted me, I turned to him for something more than just what he, his role was in just directing me as a learning teacher.  And I think that's what I'm trying to make your role into too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, I, and I know that, just in thinking about friends of my parents when I was growing up, when I was finding it so hard to relate to people my own age or younger people, I could always relate well to the male friends of my parents and not really that well to the their wives.  And, and when I recall how I used to be with them now, I can see it was a little bit more than just kind of being like another daughter to them as far as how I was seeing it.  I was really flirting with them in a way.  Especially one man that uhm, he had a skiing lodge and uhm in PSP, and he had been in my father's class at college.  So when my sister and I were in high school my parents thought it would be good for us to go away on a skiing week during our winter vacation.  And I found this man extremely attractive and he was again somebody who responded to me and included me on things he was doing and this is something he did with everybody.  But I used to think he'd singled me out.  And I, I think really I had an awfully big crush on him, I don't know what else I could describe it as, but I certainly didn't look, like, look to him as a substitute father.  And then it got me, it sort of scared me.</p>

<p>ANALYST When was that?  What year?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, must have been uhm, I think it was my sophomore year in high school.  So I would have been 15.  Because that was the year I was so uhm happy with everything about my own life and I didn't know exactly what it was.  But I used to just, in terms of, at any year, I used to use my parents' parties as times to enjoy a party.  Because I couldn't do it with my own age group.  And this is just true about, the way I am in conversa—, and in a conversation, uhm, I need an older person who knows how to handle a conversation and, and keep it going in order to really enjoy conversation.  Because otherwise I just feel as if I can't handle it and I think that must be one reason why I would use my parents' friends and the men in particular.  Because uhm, well they would single me out and tease me and things, but they, they were the ones handling the situation.  I wasn't at all.</p>

<p>And there was something that struck me in the book I'm reading right now, "The Eighth Day" by Wilder, and it was uhm, talking about the children and the family and the fact that they all were ones who asked questions, but because their father appreciated them so much they didn't turn to introspection.  And it made me just think of the fact that I've spent so many hours and years just being introspective and I guess I just never felt my father really appreciated me or approved of me.  Well, approved of me to an extent because I used to study hard and work hard.  And of course this would really annoy me because he was always, if I'd ever complain about it, he'd always say, "Well, just keep grinding away and don't worry about it. Just keep working.  All we care about is if you're trying your best."  And I think that sophomore year when I got very poor grades, was partly in revolt against this idea of just plugging away at something.  But at college he used to send me little pamphlets, pamphlets about keeping up the work and so what if you never really got very, you know, raised to great heights, just as long as you were plugging away at it.</p>

<p>And this makes me think (chuckle) of something I thought more about after it happened.  When I was talking, I think it was the first day, about what would my job be here.  And then later on something happened and you referred back to that time and, and used the word your job.  And I, I just I, I hate that word, I think.  And the whole idea of duty and, and all that, I just, I use it I know, all the time and I think in terms of it, but if I hear it from somebody else, I, I immediately have a reaction to the word.  And the same with the word like (chuckle) piles.  I'm glad you said stacks because I hate (chuckle) that wo— use of the word too, which is the word my husband's always using.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Piles?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  (Chuckle) Because I think it has another connotation that immediately comes to my mind.  Which obviously makes me think of a comment my mother once made when we were talking about my nephews and their toilet training.  And my mother said well, to me, "You were extremely easy to train.  In fact you trained —" I think I was about a year and a half,  which surprised me.  Because I have lots of memories of times when I must have been, oh anywhere from 3 to 5, I don't know how old in times, probably all through those times when —, well, especially having dreams and urinating in the middle of the dream because I was dreaming I was going to the bathroom and being horrified when I woke up and found I'd done this.  Or else getting out of bed to go to the bathroom and not being able to make it.  And then other times being unable to urinate and having terrific pains and when I tried, and I can just, a whole series of memories of that, and then I asked her when she said this, I said "Well, I remember one time too when I must have had a bowel movement in my pants and you made me wear my pants for the rest of the day."  And she had no memory of that at all.  And I'm wondering if I just didn't dare tell her, so I was the one who just kept them on all day.</p>

<p>And then I had the humiliating experience in first grade of uhm, the teacher — we were about to go somewhere — and the teacher said, "Anybody that has to use the bathroom go now."  And uhm, I didn't, I guess, realize at that point I had to or else I had, maybe I had started to raise my hand and she at that point thought that everybody had gone so she was getting us out of the room.  And we were practicing a rhythm band so all the time we were on stage practicing I was trying to get her attention with my hand up because I (chuckle) really was getting desperate and she wouldn't call on me.  At least it seemed as if she wouldn't, I don't know whether she actually saw me.  And finally it was, people around me kept telling me things to do so I could hold on until we got to the room and, and finally it just got too much so I ran up to her at the front of the stage.  And there was everybody behind me and then the whole aud—, well, not the audience, but everybody else at the rehearsal, and, and I couldn't hold it anymore.  (chuckle) So I wet my pants right there in front of, literally, in front of everybody.  And of course she was very annoyed at me and just reprimanded me and then sent me back to the room and I had to sit there and then a neighbor came, who was a teacher in the school, to take me home.  And that again it was another humiliating experience to have her be the one.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about dreams I had at that period, when I used to also dream that I was in the bathroom or any—, or else I'd wake up finding I'd gone to the bathroom in bed.  Uhm, I used to have dreams about bees.  I don't know exactly what they were doing but I can remember actually thinking, I had the sensation of being stung by a bee.  And I used to have, I don't know that it was, I guess it must have been a dream, and this one also occurred a lot at this period, and I think came back to me once in a while after that.  Uhm, and I don't remember if there's any anything actually happening, but all I can think of is that I would see red and sort of moving shapes.  And I think I, I remember once reading an article about a child's awareness before he's born and it just made me think well, that would be the way I would remember the womb if, if it were possible, but you know, I don't know, whether that's right.  But it just was a very vivid thing and I used to hate having it but I'd cling to it, and when I was having it, it'd cling to the, keep, keeping the dream going.</p>

<p>And then later when I was, some, any time after 6, I don't know how old, but I can remember having dreams of uhm, this time involving my mother, definitely, when I'd be with her and we'd be going to a, I guess it would be an ogre's house.  And there was a fence there with a gate and she would step into the gate and then I'd close the front, close it so she would be squashed in the gate thing itself.  And that one I used to have all the time.</p>

<p>ANALYST: The other dreams you mentioned were before that or after?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, before that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhum.</p>

<p>This one of my mother and the ogre were, I know, after I was 6, because I remember we'd, we moved when I was uhm, oh, it must have been just, maybe I was 5 ½.  And I know I had those previous dreams when I was living in the house before we moved and then uhm, this one of my mother after.  And at the sa—, I think interchangeably I used to have a dream of uhm, I don't know if she were involved, but there would be Indians coming to attack the house and somehow I always ended up in the kitchen and the Indians would be shooting arrows through the kitchen door.  And that one used to come again and again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And something else just occurred to me in thinking about dreams, that I never could understand why I reacted this way.  But uhm, I imagine I was around 10 or something like that when, maybe even older, when my parents let me see an Abbott and Costello movie.  And all my friends that I went with knew that it was a comedy, but it was about a lot of dead bodies and, you know, it was to the point of being ludicrous because every time they turned around, they'd run into a dead body.  But I took it very seriously and, and I had awful nightmares for — or else I was just afraid to go upstairs and open a closet, because that was obviously where some of the dead bodies appeared.  And for about a month after that, I used to wake up at night and have to go to my parents, until they started using some medicine I had when I was car sick, which had an awful taste.  And I'm convinced it probably wasn't medicine at all, it just had an awful taste, and they'd make me have some of that.  And then I'd go back to bed.  It was supposed to settle me and uhm, they refused my going to any movies for a long time because I'd reacted this way.  But I remember being puzzled because my friends were all talking about it afterwards, and laughing, and I just saw nothing funny at all.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And the whole thing of being sick — and it's something MSCZ and I have talked about, and just in terms of my being car sick, I, I'm still not sure whether I really got car sick — now I do occasionally, nothing like I used to be —, or whether it's something that I'm doing for attention.  But he, he feels that in our family unless you're sick you just don't get attention.  And if you are sick, you, you get a certain kind of concern, maybe not real tender loving care (chuckle) as they say, but you do, there is a certain concern for you suddenly, which is lacking at any other time.  And, and I knew he feels very strongly that we all get sick just because of that.</p>

<p>And I'm sure there's something in it because I knew whenever I came home from college I used to delight in looking really tired and having, being able to say I had really had an awful lot to do and worked hard, because that's what they approved of.  And then they were very concerned about me and they'd take care of me, in effect, you know, "Wouldn't you like this?  Wouldn't you like that" kind of thing and, "Oh, you look so tired and so awful."  And so I used to love it if I could come home looking just wretched.  And it is true, again I don't know whether it's a function of just having been around young children now for a while or not, I'm not as apt to get sick as I would be otherwise.  But I used to, there were periodic times when I'd get a cold, especially when I was on vacation.  And I'm not getting that many anymore.  At least I can, if I feel as if I'm starting to, I can fight most of them off.  And it's also, now that I'm more aware of the fact that I probably do sometimes like to get sick, because then I can baby myself and get attention.  (Silence)</p>

<p>One thing I wanted to ask you, uhm, because last night when I was trying to get the elevator it didn't, it couldn't open on the 4th floor, and nothing seemed to be happening.  And I think I got impatient finally and I looked for the stairs and went down the stairs, which it turned out it was alright.  But at fi—, after I'd gone I realized that the door might be locked at the bottom and then I really got panicked.  But I, I just wondered what should happen if the door won't open.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, it should be open.  Somebody obviously made a mistake.  The elevator door should be open.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, it wouldn't open though —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes —</p>

<p>PATIENT: — it stopped several times.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, someone locked the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see.  Oh, is that what it is.  Well, do they realize that they, if I waited they'd uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, I think if there's no one else here, you just call me and I'll open it for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was surprised at the panicked feeling I had when I was in the stairway.  Because, you know, I let the door shut here, assuming that it was open.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh, I'm sorry.  You're talking about the door at the bottom of the stairway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm talking about the elevator door (chuckle) but then, because it wouldn't open here, I finally went down the stairs.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Right.  Well, that will always be open, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  But, I, but what I was so surprised at was my panicked feeling when I realized the door behind me had locked on the stairway and uhm, you know, I didn't know then if the door at the bottom would be open.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How did you feel when you noticed the elevator was locked or didn't open, before you went to the stairway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, well, I guess I felt kind of panicky too.  Because I, well, I felt sort of stupid I guess, which is why one reason why I probably didn't call you, because I, I was embarrassed to call you.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As though you had done something wrong, or implicated some way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I suppose that I should be able to handle this and therefore I felt stupid that I didn't know how to handle it.  (Pause) And I know this was something that I found very hard last year, which was my first year of teaching this age group on my own.  And the parents at the school are quite uhm, well, maybe they would have been nice to me anyway, but they, they do sort of pry with questions about "How many years have you been teaching" and this and that.  And they always feel as if they're getting the short end if they have a teacher who is in their first year, so I was very defensive about it.  And they knew I'd been at LKC longer and, and I don't know how many knew it was actually my first year with full responsibility.  But uhm, I used to be so defensive, that I couldn't admit — I pretended knowing more than I did with them.  And I'd get myself into trouble this way and uhm, I found I couldn't admit if I didn't know about something z____.  And I don't know, it was just, it was really just silly of me.  And I think maybe I was thinking, when I was in a conference with a parent, more in terms of making myself sound good than in actually talking about the child.  And the best times I had with parents were when I could forget myself to some extent, probably never completely, and really thought in terms of the child.</p>

<p>And this is — I'm sort of nervous about tonight too, because last year being my first year of really being responsible, I found I, suddenly my mind just blanked when I met the mothers.  And this, tonight is a night when there's a tea for all the mothers.  And I'm just afraid I'll do it again, because I'm so worried about myself that I'll just blank out and I won't be able to, (chuckle) practically then, think of who the child is.  Or else, if, if I'm in a state of being sort of that way, what comes to my mind are the bad things about the child, not the good things.  And since at something like this you should be talking about the good things, I get panicky that I won't be able to think of anything (chuckle) good.  And then I, of course I don't.  And I didn't have this trouble when I was uhm assisting another teacher and would meet the mothers.  Because this, you know, I'd done this before and then I had no trouble thinking of nice things to say and, and really thinking of the child when I was talking, so the child was alive in my mind at that point.</p>

<p>In fact, that was sort of a hard thing, when I decided to do the assisting, because I had taught high school for a year and I had, in a way, wanted to put myself through another year, because I knew of a lot of things that hadn't worked out in my teaching, but I wanted to see if the second year wouldn't be better.  But on the other hand, because so many things hadn't worked out, I was really almost afraid of another year.  And so the situation arose that I, I, MSCZ wanted me to have a part-time job, at least not have a job that meant a lot of work at night,  and which, of course, teaching high school meant to me, because I would always do way beyond anything that was reasonable.</p>

<p>Uhm, this job opened up and I debated taking it because it, it was almost like a loss of face, face in the hierarchy of teachers.  But on the other hand, I sort of welcomed not having the responsibility.  And I was, then I was afraid of the fact that I was welcoming not having the responsibility.  And I just, I was confused at what attitude I should have, not, and, and I was thinking in terms of "should" rather than just what attitude I might want to have.  And again I was, I remember being very defensive about it when people would ask me what I was doing, and I'd always have to throw in that I'd taught high school at one point.  (Pause) And this made it very hard too when I started, because the person I worked with had her own problems, which I grew to knew, know very well and she felt insecure with me because I taught before.  And I, and I was too afraid to tell her I really didn't have any idea about young children and what to do.  So I, so I pretended that (chuckle) I knew, and it was, it was an awful situation for a while.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Our time's up.</p>

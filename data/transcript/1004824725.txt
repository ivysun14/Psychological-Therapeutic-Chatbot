<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to project.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This morning when I left the house it dismal. Warm, but dismal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is weird that it's so warm too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how did you fare in the storm? Are you guys all okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We did okay. I was worried that we were going to lose power, because all my milk—I have so much milk in the freezer. And that happened to my best friend Stephanie. I guess it was last year, when there was like a big ice storm or something, they lost power. And she like went back to work full-time too, so she was like really good about stocking up and had a huge supply. And they lost power and she didn't even think about it at first, and then it dawned on her the next day, and at that point it had started to thaw.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what can you do anyway, I mean if you didn't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. So I was so worried Todd went out and got dry ice, because we heard that that would just keep it a little bit longer until you could get it to a freezer. So we had the dry ice and we were all ready, and then we were fine. So that was good. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad to hear that, because I can imagine how devastating that is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My friend said it was just awful. And I told her, I was like "Now I understand." Because when she told me last year, it was like "Oh, that kind of stinks." Like I didn't really care. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody that's not pumped can really understand how precious those ounces are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every little drop, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm glad you guys -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So were you okay, too?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're okay. My house is without power. But I'm no longer storing up breast milk, so it's just regular groceries. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My mom came to watch Trae today, and she took a shower when she first got there, because they don't have power either. So at least she could—she's like "It's so nice; there are lights on."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's amazing how engrained you are to like turn on the lights. And we lost power in the middle of the night, and I only knew because my youngest walked into my room saying he couldn't find any of his pacis. So I went back to his room and I'm like, oh well, no lights are working and I can't find them either. (laughs) [00:02:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we were pretty lucky, I think, that we didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well I think as long as no houses fall on apartments or houses—I mean no trees fall.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No trees. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the important thing, that people are safe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I know. And we had our school closed yesterday, and it hardly ever does that. So that was surprising, but nice not to have to go in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think keeping people off the roads -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was definitely the right thing, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, whether you're walking or driving, you just don't want to chance being hit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I'm okay. I'm in like a hard stretch right now, I feel like, just in terms of—Trae's sleeping is so much better now. When I was here two weeks ago, oh my gosh, we were really struggling with his sleeping, and we were -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you were about to start the sleep training? </p>

<p>CLIENT: The sleep training. And it's kind of funny, because I feel like my friend Stephanie and I have been joking, we're like "It's the power of fervor. Like we just talked about doing it, and then all of a sudden..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you didn't even have to do it? [00:03:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We didn't really have to do it. We did one night, but he fell asleep within the little five minute intervals. So it wasn't bad at all. And then the past two weeks, he hasn't had—we haven't had to do it in consistent nights in a row. Like we'll do it one night and it'll be like a five minute one. And then the next night he'll sleep right through the night. And then the next night—so it's like, it's kind of weird because I feel like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he knows how to put himself to sleep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He can definitely get himself to sleep, yeah. But it also feels like—like last night we had trouble getting him—he did a lot of crying before he got himself down. So it's almost like I wish we had those four or five intense days that my friends were saying "prepare yourself for." Because then after those intense days, it was pretty much—not solved, but much better. But I feel like we still have ups and downs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Because he hasn't really gotten the message that "No matter how long I fussed, mom and dad are not coming to get me." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he hasn't had to come up against that. [00:04:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's kind of funny, I was like "You figured us out. You know what was going to happen, and we didn't really have to do it." So. But it kind of feels nice to know that now that we've tried it, it's not this like terrible thing in my mind. Like it's not as scary for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, well you didn't get worst-case scenario, which is what of course you're fearing, is this horrible... what feels unending.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it's nice to know now when he does start crying, it's like we have this strategy that we can try, and it doesn't feel as terrible as I thought. So I feel like with him, it's been a lot better. But now I just feel like I'm having so much trouble. I feel like it's shifted from Trae not sleeping to now I'm having all this trouble. And it's just been so frustrating because I feel like I was so tired already, just because we were having trouble with Trae, and now it's like—there were a couple of nights where I was having trouble but was able to fall asleep.</p>

<p>And most of it isn't weird worries that are keeping me up. I feel like there was one night where I was having trouble falling asleep and then was able to come up with this crazy thing to worry about. So that was one night. But otherwise, it's just... [00:05:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's happening on the other nights?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just being awake. And I really feel like the worry now is just not being able to fall asleep. And it's like so..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is as much a worry as anything else. Because you feel so out of control when you can't fall asleep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I literally scared myself two nights ago, because I literally was up like almost all night. And I know I kind of did it to myself too, because I have like a bunch of stuff due this week, and this past weekend was my grandmother's 95th birthday, so we took her gambling. I think I told you about her. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was totally fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:05:50] the routine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and because it was the 95th, my whole extended family went, which is really fun. Usually it's just the girls that go, my aunts and my sister and cousins and stuff. So everyone came and it was a great weekend, but I wasn't able to get any work done on these couple of papers, and so Sunday night, when we got home, I was up late working. [00:06:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were up working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, working and then I was like "Okay, take some time before you go to bed." Like I knew I was all like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to wind down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Revved up, kind of. And usually if I'm up late, I'll just pump as I'm working. But I just kept working and then waited and watched TV while I pumped and tried to do some relaxation, and I was thinking to myself "Well, I'm so tired. I feel like it will be okay, that I will go to sleep." And then I think just thinking about that kept me up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thinking about sleeping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so then I went and read on the couch and was still kind of up, and then fell asleep maybe for like half an hour on the couch and then went back to bed. And as soon as I got into bed and was like "okay, I think I'll be able to fall asleep," Trae woke up. So it just like—I feel like I'm getting frustrated with myself, because now it's like "Okay, we're getting Trae back on track, and now is the time when we can start to come out of this haze of being so tired." [00:07:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not immediate. Because now—your sleep schedule was irregular because Trae was irregular. And you can't—it's really hard do expect yourself to be like "Okay, now I'm normal." Because your body's not. Your body wasn't used to its typical routine. There wasn't really any pattern. You didn't know what to expect. So you need some consistency from him before you can then begin to establish a pattern for yourself. I think it's really hard to expect that you're going to have this instantaneous sort of ability to resume your pattern. You need to train your body again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe just giving yourself the expectation that it's going to—it's not that you can't sleep, but that it's going to take some time to resume your pattern.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot of pressure to say "Okay, I can sleep now." [00:08:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And I think it is hard too because this week is a busy week in terms of school. I mean it's kind of crazy that this is the last month, pretty much, of school. But just the way my coursework fell, most of it was backended.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a lot of end pieces.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I think that's part of it too, is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know where to fit in the work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. And I feel like I can just scrape by when it's just readings and stuff, so I can go to class feeling prepared. But now that it's stuff on top of that, it's hard to know when is the time that I' going to do it. And I feel like the only extra time I can get is at night. And that's just not working either. So it just—it's hard to know what to do. Like even I have a paper due on Thursday, and it's with a group that we're going to do a little paper swap. So hopefully we'll swap tomorrow. But I haven't even started writing it yet. [00:09:01]</p>

<p>And then Tuesday is the class where I am a teaching fellow for. It's kind of a day where I just know I'm not going to get a lot of homework done on Tuesdays. So then I'm thinking "Well I can try and start writing it tonight, but then will the same thing happen?" So it's just hard to know what the right thing to do is, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And can you survive another sort of all-nighter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And at this point I feel like I just can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you sound really frustrated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I did that on Sunday night, I was trying to get myself to sleep and I'm doing things, and then I just got so frustrated—I just started crying in bed, trying to get myself to sleep, and then went to the couch. Like it just is hard to figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it is. And you sound really frustrated with your sleep and frustrated with your work. There's just not enough time for all of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is really hard to have to fit everything in. Fit taking care of yourself, taking care of Trae, taking care of your work. It's a lot to juggle. [00:10:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And I feel like it was okay because there wasn't that much work to do—I mean there was, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now it's taking up more space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay not to have it all perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not just the work, but all of the things. There may not be possible at this phase of life to really have time for everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) Yeah, and especially with the weekend too. I was able to get more work done than I thought, because at least we had the drive. So Trae slept for a little while, so I did some work in the car too. But it's just hard to know when to fit it all in. And I do feel like that feeling of being frustrated with myself—even last night, I felt myself kind of dreading the nighttime, which is a feeling I would have a while ago when I was having trouble sleeping. And then the same feeling I would have when Trae was a newborn and dreading the night, because it was just always hard to get through the night with a newborn. And now it was like that feeling was coming back again. I'm just like "I hope that I don't do this to myself again." [00:11:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a heavy feeling to sit with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because it is, it's like you're doing it to yourself. Which just feels so silly. It's like all I want to do is sleep, but then I won't let myself sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard to do that sometimes. It's really hard to get what you want sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does it compare to what you expected?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think—I feel like up until this point, like this semester has been okay, better than I expected, trying to balance everything. And now is when I'm feeling those feelings of being overwhelmed kind of creep in. And I know we've talked about before not trying to look ahead too much either, but just knowing "Okay, between now and the last day of the semester before finals start is December 4th, there is a lot that's going to have to get done." And I feel like the routine that I got into, that was working okay, was just doing enough for the next day in terms of work. And now that's not going to work right now. [00:12:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's not going to work right now. So part of it is having to come up with a new routine when you're already feeling maxed out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And not wanting to sacrifice time with Trae, either. I was thinking "I could even get a babysitter or something for a couple hours on Friday," which is the day I'm usually home with—but then I was thinking those are the days that I look forward to all week. It's just so nice to have that day at home with him. So part of me doesn't want to have to do that either, because I was like... where? It just feels like everything, there's no extra space. There's no wiggle room to get any more time out of during the day. So I was like that could be an option. [00:13:10]</p>

<p>But I really have not wanted to have to come into school or anything on the weekend. And I haven't had to do that yet. Like I've definitely done work on the weekends; usually during his naptime, or sometimes Todd will take him to the grocery store or something and give me an extra hour or something. But I feel good that I haven't had to be like "Okay, Todd, you need to watch him on Saturday because I'm going to have to go in for a work day basically, at the library."</p>

<p>So that's been nice, not to have to do that. And I think a little piece of me was worried before the semester started, like would I have to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that make life better in this particular month, basically of November? I know it's not ideal, but what's the give and take for you? What's going to make, overall, life feel more satisfactory? Just for this month. [00:14:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. And I think that maybe is what I'll have to think about. Because I feel like now, more than ever, I don't want to have to do work at night. Just because I think it is just hard for me to—I think also it's like I have to gear myself up to get this energy to actually do work at night, because I'm so tired. And then it's like bringing up all that energy is hard to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and then it's hard to wind down from that. So I wonder if it's more disruptive to try to do work at night, even though you don't feel like that's taking time from Trae or your family time. Is it more disruptive than getting someone to come and sit for a few hours on Friday, or taking like you said on a Saturday or something, splitting up your family time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because at this point, I think it might be worth it to just at least try that, too. But at least I know too, like this week and probably next week, I guess—I have to look a little bit more, but it's nice to—I know it's a finite period of time. [00:15:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. You're not setting up a new life. You're setting up "how do I get through the end of the semester."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And actually, I feel like next semester is going to be like a whole new world for me. It's going to feel totally different. Because I don't think I'll even take any classes next semester. I think I'm just going to helpfully be in a school collecting data. So that, I feel like it will just be totally different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll reconfigure that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Thinking about that, I just need to remember that part too. That is just like I can make this push through. But I feel like I'm just so much worse at handling things when I'm so tired, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you are. Sleep is a very important piece of our day. And it fuels your body and it gives you emotional stability and the ability to think more clearly. Sleep deprivation is used as a torture technique on purpose. [00:16:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking about that. (laughs) I know, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't often want to give credit to people who harm other people, but there's a reason they use sleep deprivation so often in these types of things. Because it has a very real effect on how we respond to situations and how we feel. So the fact that you are on the verge of tears and the fact that it's hard to think straight, is very normal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So sleep is a really important function that our bodies need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know, and I was thinking Monday, at least we didn't have to go to school. I was like "I don't even know how I would have functioned." I can't remember a night where I had that little sleep. I mean, I did surprise myself that at least I was able to make it through the day, and got the stuff done I needed to. [00:17:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But of course, you made it through the day at a cost.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it wasn't a nice day. It could've been a fun day home, because Todd didn't have to go into work and we had Trae with us. And we still, it was nice to just be home and relax, but it was—that piece of it, I was annoyed too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel good when you haven't slept.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You feel like in this fog. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you able to relax at all when you're not—because sleep is really important, but so is relaxation. And I'm wondering if you're able to find a way to just do a few moments of deep breathing, or take a moment to close your eyes and imagine something peaceful, calm. To give yourself a little respite, even if you can't sleep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I try and think of that, when I'm going to sleep. It's like "Okay, now is your time to just do nothing." I feel like the days are so busy, and Todd too, it's like we get home but then we're getting him to bed and getting dinner together. [00:18:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Very little downtime.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And thankfully, we do—and I think it's at a cost, because we go to bed so late, but we usually do wait to have dinner after Trae's asleep. So we're really—we're so European, we eat at like 9:00. (laughs) So it's late, but then it's like by the time we eat and then I try and pump one more time, just to try and keep up, to be able to replenish the bottles that he drank.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you need that nighttime pump to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do now, yeah. Because I just can't keep up with him now. He wants six ounce bottles. So when I pump during the day—usually the first time I pump, I can get six ounces, but then the next time. Yeah. So it's like playing catch up, kind of.</p>

<p>So it's like by the time we get to bed, it's like 11:30 or midnight, sometimes, so even when I do sleep through the night, or he does, it's not that long. [00:19:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Have you tried pumping after nursing him on the days that you're home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just started trying that, actually, on the days—like in the mornings. I've been trying that. Yeah, after I feed him in the morning. Because that could be a good alternative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm wondering if—I know a lot of women try that. I know I did that, and it worked for me a little bit, to save—there were points in time when I was waking up in the middle of the night, at 4, to pump, and I was like "This is ridiculous."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it might be a little bit less disruptive if you try—if you're able to pump after you nurse him. I know it's not fun, but maybe less disruptive to your schedule than having to do a late evening one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I know it's really important to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the other thing is supplementing a little bit with formula, that's okay. If that's what works for your family to get you the sleep you need, and to get him the calories he needs, it's not a mark against you. [00:20:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and that's something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it doesn't mean you're not nursing. I know it's important for you to nurse, and you have this goal of nursing for a year, but supplementing a little bit does not mean that you're not nursing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that I think is good to keep in mind, because I think—I have to separate that idea of "I'm still nursing him, it is okay to give him formula if you need to." So I think we did talk about that—recently, actually, I tried drinking that mother's milk tea. And I don't know if it was just like my own thinking "Oh, this is working." But I feel like I've been able to get enough the past week maybe. But I was thinking that, because now we have this little oatmeal for him, but he likes it better when it's made with breast milk. So then I was like "So now I have to be pumping to make the bottles and to have milk for the oatmeal?" So that, I feel like especially, that we can make that with formula and then—[00:21:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. He can get used to it with water too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I think too, with just trying to get the extra calories in him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Mixing it with breast milk or formula has more calories. Because the actual oatmeal doesn't have much in it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So but it does, the other day I was trying to pump and I was like, I just feel like it's pumping trying to catch up to get him enough, and then school I'm trying to find these hours to catch up. I just feel like it's this feeling of catching up on both ends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well it's a lot of drain on you, feeling like you're trying to meet all these demands.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Give yourself time to take a deep breath. And my guess is you're not really breathing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even in here, it feels like—it's like you feel this pressure to figure everything out, or make sure that you get everything in. And there's not a lot of time for you to just take a deep breath. [00:22:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it has felt like that. Just like running from one thing to the next, kind of. And even this morning, leaving, I was trying to feed him before I came. So my mom came and I could've taken the bus but I was like "I'll just stay and let you take a shower, and that way I can feed him." And then he didn't nurse well, so then I had to hurry to pump to catch the bus. It all just feels like—and it's like little stuff like that, too.</p>

<p>I feel like I've been doing better about him not wanting to nurse. Because he actually has been nursing a lot better. We've had definitely a good stretch. But there were bad little feeding sessions where he hasn't done as well. But I know he's getting—I can just tell he's putting on weight. So that's making me feel better. So I feel like that's—the pressure has lessened a little bit around that. But then this morning, when it didn't work, it's like little things that just are setting me off because I feel like I'm just so tired. [00:23:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well I think you're really drained. And so those little things, there's not a lot of reserve to put them in perspective or absorb them. They are important things; not to make light of how that feels. But you don't have a lot of reserves to absorb the impact of those kinds of things. It's really become really big deals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is nice. I feel like then I can say "It wasn't that big of a deal. My mom can just give him a bottle. I made the bus. I got here." You know, but it's like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it cost you, because you feel so rushed and harried, and you're not getting to—you didn't enjoy that, right? That wasn't a nursing session that felt good for you. And it doesn't feel good to be rushing to the bus and wondering if you're going to make it. And it doesn't feel good to not have a nice handoff with your mom. Yes, you managed all those things, and no, none of them were the end of the world, but none of them also felt good. And you need to let yourself acknowledge that there's not a lot right now that feels like you're doing it well. [00:24:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are. I think you're actually doing a really amazing job of being a new mom and being a graduate student and being a wife. You're doing a really good job at all those things, but it just doesn't feel like it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, it's hard to feel like—trying to do a good job at all those things, but am I? And I feel like especially with Todd, that's the side that—for both of us, we're saying like "Is that the side that's slipping the most?" That we haven't been able to—we still haven't gone out yet. I did get a babysitter, though for us for his—well my sister—for his birthday in two weeks, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That counts. Anybody that watches the baby. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughs) So that will be good, but I feel like that's another thing that it's hard. Yeah. [00:25:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's the thing that will feed you, and that's the thing that I think so many people let go of, is finding space and time to focus on your partner. It feels more selfish, and it also is really important. But I think if you've read any of the research on parents of young children, most people say that marital satisfaction dips, and it comes back. But I think it's pretty common to experience what you're experiencing is that, it feels like there's all these things that you need to attend to, and the thing that's last on the list is attending to your partner and nourishing your own relationship.</p>

<p>So does it make it feel less difficult? No. But I feel like you're in a pretty common position. And paying attention to that stuff does make the other stuff easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's coming up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So that will be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's take some time to do some relaxation in here, since you don't have the space to do it elsewhere. Before we move to that, are there other things that you wanted to talk about? [00:26:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that was everything. I feel like sometimes when I get so overtired that I am more susceptible to letting those things I know I don't have to worry about creep in, and so I feel like that's been in the back of my mind too, like not wanting that to happen. And I felt myself, there are a couple of things over the past week where I did think about them and worry about them a little bit. But I was able to let them go. But that feeling of not having those things to worry about has been so nice, but now I feel like I'm like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're wondering if you're storing them up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or just like susceptible to them because I just feel so much more tired, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, when your defenses are already down, right. So these things creep in. Maybe a little bit less awareness? I think when you have more—there's more of a pattern for you, you're able to be aware of what's happening. You're very aware of your own thoughts and aware of your own process. And I wonder if that's slipping a bit. As you rush from thing to thing and you feel more sleep-deprived, that you're aware of how to keep yourself grounded and how to keep yourself present in the moment is kind of waning a bit. [00:27:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that's just what gets me nervous or worried, that I don't want that to happen again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so the question that's been really useful for you is to check in with yourself, and say like "Is this important right now?" And you can still use that question for yourself. And if it's something that you're worrying about, "Is this going to be a problem?" It's not important right now. If it's not a problem, it's not important right now. And that can kind of bring you back to the moment, and keep you focused on "this is what's happening for me at this moment. This is what I'm focusing on. This is what I'm doing or what I'm working on." And the other stuff you can let go. [00:28:04]</p>

<p>It might flitter across your head. And being able to notice your thought and acknowledge it, and then let it go when it's not important, is a way to keep yourself present. Rather than having that thought kind of flitter into your head and then wonder about it. You can check it and toss it away again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know. And that's what I think I need to keep remembering. Like I found myself, even over the weekend with my sister, something came up that I was worried about, and checking with her. Like I found myself kind of checking to make sure. Yeah. Which I feel like I hadn't really had to do in a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You trusted yourself more. And you're losing a little bit of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it's relevant, like can you trust yourself? Do you need to check with other people right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean I do feel like that's something I've been so much more aware of, is that idea of just needing to trust myself. And I do think I can, but I just have noticed needing to do that more so. [00:29:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling a little bit more secure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the fact that you caught yourself I think is great, right, because that means that you're in a place where you can notice it's happening and challenge yourself to kind of work back to where you were, being able to use yourself as your guide. But you're catching it. And that's the first step. That's what you needed to learn first, is catch yourself when you were doing that, and then just do it. Check with yourself rather than someone else. And so you can return to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, let's—let me check what we have in the books for November.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we can do your co-pay now, before you get relaxed, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. I even wrote the check.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. So let's see. I have us as a question mark on the 13th at 2:30? Did I remember to ask you about that? [00:30:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's at...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have us for 2:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Back to your sort of normal time. I don't remember if I had actually confirmed it with you. And then two weeks after that is the 27th, which is the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, and I'll be here and doing my regular thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. Okay, yeah. I'll be back by then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And then—I don't know if you know your December schedule yet. If we did the two weeks, it would put us at the 11th, which I can do your normal 2:30 time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. I think that should be fine. Actually, yeah—I think once I get to December, then it won't be—like I think I just have one final. But it's a final that we've been working on already with drafts, so that will be good. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the next one after that would be on Christmas, which I assume you're busy? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we will be gone that day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we can work around that when we get closer to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Good. (pause) Great. I know, we're so excited for Christmas with Trae.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it'll be his first Christmas. [inaudible [00:31:27] Oh, and I'm going to do co-pay so we don't have to switch into money mode once you're relaxed. (pause) Thanks. I'll just turn this off.</p>

<p>Alright, so let yourself get as comfortable as you can. Close your eyes. And just find a rhythm for breathing that feels relaxed, comfortable. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>(pause) And once you feel comfortable, slightly extending your inhales, matching your inhales with your exhales to let yourself get full, deep breaths. (pause) Start by mentally scanning your body, noticing anything that feels tight or conformable. Thinking about breathing into that space. Letting go of any tension as you exhale. Letting your body become a bit more relaxed with every breath. (pause)</p>

<p>Repeating that process as many times as you need to. (pause)</p>

<p>Also noticing whatever thoughts may be present in your mind. Notice them, acknowledge them, and without any judgment, let them go for now, knowing that any important thoughts can return to you when you need them. And everything else can be let go of. [00:33:19]</p>

<p>(pause) Letting yourself be absorbed in the present. Noticing the sounds that you hear. (pause) Notice what your body feels like, and let yourself be grounded in this very moment. (pause) [00:34:00]</p>

<p>Pay attention to some common tension spots. And to do so, think about on your next breath in, whenever you're ready to take a breath in, think about clenching your teeth together. Noticing where that brings tension to your jaw. And then when you're ready to exhale, think about purposely dropping your jaw, letting your teeth come apart, and noticing how that feels different to your neck, your throat, your jaw, and your face. (pause) And you can repeat that, clenching your teeth together as you inhale; then when you're ready to exhale, dropping your jaw, relaxing your mouth. (pause) Taking a full, deep breath.</p>

<p>And on your next inhale, drop your chin down toward your chest. Noticing what that feels like in the back of your neck and your throat. And then when you're ready to exhale, let your head float up, resting gently on top of your spine. Noticing the difference in your neck and your shoulders. [00:35:10]</p>

<p>Inhaling, and bowing your head forward; exhaling, and letting it float up to a neutral position. (pause)</p>

<p>On your next breath in, you can think about dropping your ear toward one shoulder. Noticing how that feels on your neck and your shoulders. And then letting your head float up when you're ready to exhale. Inhale, dropping your head the other way; exhale, letting it float back up.</p>

<p>On your next breath in, you can shrug your shoulders up toward your ears. Noticing what it feels like in your back and your neck. Exhale and let them drop all the way down. Inhale, shrug up; exhale, let them drop all the way down. [00:36:04]</p>

<p>On your next breath in, you can think about bringing your hands toward your shoulders, tightening your biceps. Notice what that feels like in your arms. And when you're ready to exhale, let them fall all the way back down. Inhale, bending your elbows, making a tight bicep; exhale and release. (pause)</p>

<p>On your next breath in, make a tight fist with your hands, squeezing as tightly as you can. Exhale, relax those fists, let your fingers relax and come apart. Inhale and squeeze, tight fists; exhale and relax, noticing the difference in your arms, your fingers, your wrists.</p>

<p>On the next breath in, you can think about squeezing your belly button toward your spine, tightening your stomach muscles. Exhale and relax, letting your belly be soft. Inhale and squeeze; exhale and relax, taking a full, deep breath. [00:37:10]</p>

<p>On your next breath in, you can squeeze your knees tightly together, noticing the tension in your inner thighs. And when you're ready to exhale, let your knees come apart, relaxing your legs. Inhale and squeeze your knees together; exhale and relax, letting them come apart.</p>

<p>On the next breath in, you can lift your feet up off the floor, tightening your thighs. And when you're ready to exhale, relax your legs; let your feet fall all the way to the floor. Inhale and lift and tighten; exhale, drop down.</p>

<p>On your next inhale, just pull your toes back toward you, tightening your ankles. Feeling tension in your shins. Exhale and relax, letting your toes come down to the ground. Inhale and flex back those feet; inhale and release. [00:38:16]</p>

<p>Reversing the motion by inhaling, pressing your toes down into the ground, tightening your calves; inhale and relax. Sorry, exhale. Inhale and press down; exhale and relax. Continuing to breathe at a comfortable pace.</p>

<p>Take a moment to notice your body, any place where tension may have crept back in or refused to leave yet. Think about taking a deep breath, and when you're ready to exhale, let that tension go and let your body be relaxed. (pause)</p>

<p>Also taking a moment to notice the thoughts that have crept into your head or have passed by. Notice them, acknowledge them, and let your thoughts go, letting your mind be relaxed and empty for now. [00:39:10]</p>

<p>(pause) You might fill your mind with a thought that's comforting to you. Hold onto it for a breath, and then let it go. (pause) And let yourself take as much time as you need to hold onto this feeling. And whenever you're ready, at your own pace, let yourself come back to the room. (pause)</p>

<p>Your body got a little relaxation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. that was good. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You need that kind of space for yourself. Even though it's hard to make space to take it outside of here. So hold onto that good feeling, and I will see you in a couple weeks. [00:40:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Good. Thank you. This was good timing today, I think. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad.</p>

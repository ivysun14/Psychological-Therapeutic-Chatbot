<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Wednesday, January 5th, Wednesday, January 5th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All we did was drink on Thursday to Sunday. We were awful, it was so funny. Was it Sunday, my girlfriend came out with us and she said, "My God, you're not going to believe this," but we had, like, a bloody Mary in the afternoon. She said, "But I feel rotten all day until (inaudible at 0:00:24.0) get drunk and I need it." And we had alcohol again. It was so funny.</p>

<p>We had, let's see, what happened Thursday? Oh, I had sort of a breakthrough Thursday because, like, I was real worried about - my nails off, I got scared stiff because she said - my girlfriend said that this real, real sharp girl who had been in her class, and is supposed to be student teaching her class and represented them like a teacher. I don't know anything about modeling. I'm learning it myself, I'm supposed to be a teacher, right? 0:00:51.5</p>

<p>But anyway, let's see, she said this real, real sharp girl is going to be there. And then she's going to introduce them to this fellow, this Japanese fellow who I thought was cute and I kind of liked him in a way, you know. And then I thought, "Oh, Jesus, well, forget him." And so I was all worried about it because, you know, I was thinking about me, me, you know. I thought, "What am I going to do?" And there was going to another student there, and I said, "Oh, great, now I got to watch my Ps and Qs to make sure that I do everything right and play the perfect hostess and the whole baloney."</p>

<p>And finally right before the party I decided, look, kid, make sure everybody has fun. And then if you have fun, fine, if you don't have fun, that's tough. It doesn't make any difference because, you know, like, you're having the party. You're throwing part of the party. And I was having - only one of my friends could make it. The other ones couldn't make it. And it was a small party anyway. (Inaudible at 0:01:39.5) for people coming from Judo and that. </p>

<p>But anyway, that's what I did, you know, I just played it by ear and I said, "Look, just worry about people getting their drinks and worry about people, you know, getting the hors d 'oeuvres out. And then they have fun, whatever happens, happens and that's the way it goes.</p>

<p>And it was so funny because I had more fun that night, and I had more people like this one fellow who was a friend of Xiang's came along. And he's also a black belt in judo so we had something in common. At the end of the night, we were getting up dancing, and all of a sudden we do (inaudible at 0:02:07.1) we were dong a throw. We had a riot. 0:02:11.3</p>

<p>But anyway, like, he came up and he grabbed me from behind, he scared the living daylights out of me. He said, "You know, you," what did he say? "You're very cute." And it just got me to the point where I thought, "Well, you know, dummy, you keep thinking about yourself all the time and about your feeling like this other girl is prettier than you are." Because she is, she's thinner than I am for one thing, and she's got a beautiful face, just a gorgeous face. And, you know, you just kind of think, "Oh, should I hide in the corner, what am I going to do?"</p>

<p>And then you end up, you know, I didn't like my outfit because we had to pin it up and everything, oh, it was terrible. I looked heavy in it, heavier than I am in it because it was - like, we had to double up the hem. Oh, and so I don't know, I just - it just was so funny because the party turned out so well. And it turned out like everybody was dancing with me and everything, all the fellows and I had no problem. You know, and people really like you when you really put yourself out for someone else, and when you're always thinking about yourself. 0:03:04.6</p>

<p>My girlfriend came up and said, "You know, I'm very proud of you because for once you're not thinking of yourself." And it just hit me, you know, "Dummy, this is why I have problems keeping friends." Although, like, with girls and that especially, I usually don't have that much problem starting to make a friend or getting an acquaintance, because I can be fun when I just let myself go and just, you know, relax and goof around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And people are sort of, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, people are sort of attracted and then I get to this point where I - you know, (inaudible at 0:03:34.2) afraid I try to get possessive with that person or I'll think, "Now what are they doing," you know, because they're being nice to me. What are they doing, I don't trust them. And it would be something like, you know, I want to cut it off more or less, although I don't realize it. I say, "Why doesn't anybody like me," you know. But I think it's partly I don't want anybody to get close to me. 0:03:50.9</p>

<p>Because as soon as I let myself go, it comes naturally to me, I'm the type, even my girlfriend says this and I agree with her now, I wouldn't before. I'm the type that should be married or let's see, how can I say it, or have, like, one special fellow or something like this that I can really sort of have the security so that I can really give to him and do lots of things for him because I enjoy doing that.</p>

<p>Or I was even thinking about - this crossed my mind, I don't know if I'll do it. If I don't get married, I'm definitely probably adopting a child because I found out that you can do that now. A single girl can adopt a child. And then I could give this child love, you know? And it's the type of thing that - like, especially with a child, it might even be better to adopt a child than get a boyfriend or a husband because men are so ridiculous anyway. The nicer you are to them the more they - I don't know, they're goofy. 0:04:37.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, it's really delightful to you to be able to give to somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To give to somebody and to - not even if - I don't expect somebody to turn around and say, "Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you." But I don't want to - I don't like the idea of them turning around and just saying, because you like them so much and you show you like them and you're nice to them, and you do whatever you have to do to show that you like them. And then they turn around and say, "Well, she's easy" or whatever. Not even with sex or any - I'm not talking about that because I've lost many a boyfriend just by being too nice to them, you know.</p>

<p>And it's very hard for me to be like my girlfriend with the smart comebacks and things like this, it doesn't come naturally to me. And I look like I'm sarcastic when I do it. So I have to do it a different way. I have to be, like, sort of nice, but just sort of reserved. Not be smart, but just kind of go, you know, and then drop the subject or whatever or just not do something. 0:05:24.2</p>

<p>And it's very hard. And this is, I think, where I went the other way for a while too. Because I don't think I've been like this all my life, I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like a thing, partially with fellows that I'm really afraid, you know, of giving everything I have because I'm just afraid that they're not going to - you know, they're just going to say, "Well, (inaudible at 0:05:43.1) everything here so forget it," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, on the one hand that doesn't seem to work when you're too nice, they go away, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the other hand, it's not natural to you to play hard to get.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it isn't. And with people in general I've learned that. And I think partly with the girls now, I've sort of let myself go a little bit again and a little too much I think. Because I've almost come like pushy, like, I could tell, like, at the party, only one girl or two girls, one's kind of funny anyway, she's, like, kind of weird. It's not me it's her. Because, like, everybody who's come in contact with (inaudible at 0:06:17.1), there's something weird about that girl. I don't know what it is, but there's something weird about her. 0:06:20.6</p>

<p>But this other girl, I have noticed - see, I wanted to get near her because she's a folk singer, and she sings and she plays guitar and things like that. Something that I'm very interested in. So I'd like to become her friend. And sometimes when I try too hard too, I get that because, like, when she came to the party, I said, "Oh, what a great looking outfit." And it was a nice looking outfit, but the girl is only 17 and it was for a woman maybe 30, you know, 35, not for a girl 18 or 17.</p>

<p>And so I said, you know, I said, "Oh, that's a great looking outfit." And I guess it was because I really didn't believe it myself. But she did look nice, she really did, but it was too old for her, you know, and then she had a wig on and she looks better with her hair down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you were trying too hard or something. 0:07:03.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I could tell it because then it was, like, she kind of ignored me and she was talking to my girlfriend. I was standing right there, right on one side and she was talking to my girlfriend and I realized that I must have just been too gushy. And, I mean, who wants a gush? And I realized that I don't like it either. But see, that happens sometimes. It gets me so mad because when I don't try I end up with friends or boyfriends or whatever you want. But as soon as I try, forget it, the ones I want I can never get. And that's been happening ever since I've been a child, though, I guess I just, you know, try too hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about the trying that chases people away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I guess it's probably because it's not really me when I do that, you know, it's like I get gushy or I get - with a fellow sometimes I don't know what to say. When he says something, I just can't - (inaudible at 0:07:48.7) well, I used to giggle, now I just, you know, (inaudible at 0:07:49.8), you know. And normally, like at work or something, I have a riot because somebody will come out with something, I can throw something back. 0:07:56.9</p>

<p>I can't be witty, you know, I mean, like I can't take - turn a sentence around because as soon as I do it either sounds ridiculous or sarcastic. But, like, if they come out with something, I can add onto it and make it, like, a clever line back. You know, I can do that. And then we get along real well, we'll throw things back and forth and, you know. And it's just so funny that you can get along with people that you don't really care about. But as soon as you care about somebody, it's so hard for me to, you know, like, handle a fellow I really care about. And if...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like - it's actually that way. I guess it's - I don't know where that comes from. Oh, I had this - this came to me again, so maybe I better say, I was saying to myself, "I'm not going to tell what I'm going to tell in therapy," so, you know, because I was thinking about, I better say this. And I thought, "No," but it came back again, so I guess I should say it. I started one of those daydreams again back to, you know, the Roman time that, and it starts out that there's this other fellow sort of in it or something and does something, and he slapped him across the face or did something. 0:08:57.0</p>

<p>And I kept - then I had this thing, like, sometimes I would go into this - it's kind of weird, like an amnesia type thing. And I'd always have this Matthew around that I would always cry to. And this time I can remember saying something about, he said, "Don't hit me." I said, "Don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me." And then I ran to Matthew and I was thinking to myself, "All right, now Matthew either represents my father or my brother, one of the two, and some other man was hitting me.</p>

<p>And then all of a sudden, I could just hear myself saying, "Ed, don't hit me, Ed, don't hit me. Daddy, don't let Ed hit me." And I'm just wondering whether my brother - you know, like, this just came. It wasn't something I thought, "Well, this will have to fit the story so I'll make something up." It just sort of came and I'm thinking to myself, "I wonder if it wasn't that my" - because I can remember my brother, you know, really hitting pretty hard. And I don't remember now whether I ran to my father or I called my father and he wasn't there. 0:09:48.8</p>

<p>Because see, then that's where it kind of stops. And then I just sort of made up an ending like, you know, he was there, but I'm wondering if that's not whether I wanted him there and he really wasn't. And whether, you know, like, maybe he was at work or maybe he was sleeping or, like, my mother wouldn't let me go to him or what it was. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt very bad. I felt like I was really kind of upset. When I hit that point where I realized I was saying, "Ed, don't hit me" to myself and going to daddy and saying, "Daddy, daddy, don't let Ed hit me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're really alone and you want protection and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he wasn't there. (Crosstalk). That's part of it, yeah, I felt very, very, like, you know, like there was nothing that I could do, very helpless, yeah. And it was a weird, weird thing because, like, I was walking home when I was thinking this and I just had the - oh, was this awful feeling. You know, you're just walking home and you just feel, "Oh." 0:10:42.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing to support you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, and that's what I think. I don't think my father was there or that I couldn't get to him. But I think I did run to him that time. At least that time because I remember saying, "Daddy, daddy, don't let Ed hit me." It just - it came back to me. I can't picture myself as a child saying this. But, like, when I said it, it sounded, you know, like I had heard it someplace before or something. And it was - oh gosh, it was such a - it was a realization, so I sat down and I thought about that for a while.</p>

<p>And I was wondering if that wasn't part of the reason that I had problems with my brother, let's see, I don't know if daddy had partly to do with it, that I wanted to get to my father and couldn't, or that I was playing my father against my brother or something. I don't know what it was there. But I do know that I was talking - I was (inaudible at 0:11:28.5) to Mrs. Foley's and she was saying that my brother had a real rotten attitude towards me. 0:11:32.6</p>

<p>And it was one of the reasons I left there. She said she can't understand it. And, like, I talked to my brother, when was it, New Year's day, I got - I called up mom, Mrs. Foley and, you know, wanted to wish her a Happy New Year and Ed got on. Well, I guess Theresa got on the phone first and I said hi to her, and then she put my brother, Ed on the phone.</p>

<p>And I was talking to Ed and, like, it was like I talked to somebody like, I can't explain it really. It certainly didn't feel like I was talking to my brother. I have much more feeling talking to my mother than I did to him, and she's only my stepmother. And, you know, I talked to him and he - she said he's, like, near a nervous breakdown and I can tell he is because, I mean, he is so - he's talking like a machine gun. And it's, like, "Oh, how are you? Oh, that's nice. Oh yeah, well, we'll have to go see ma - yeah, right, right. Well, I forgot about going the other time," you know, and all this. And then, "Yeah, well, we'll be out," and I'm going - by the time I got off the phone with him I was like this. 0:12:29.5</p>

<p>And, you know, I kind of see now that he's got lots of problems. But, like, I can't do anything for him. I can't even do anything for me, how can I do anything for him? And I really feel - it feels really kind of like - not exactly like I feel real selfish, but I don't really feel happy about it. But I really can say now that I still have the hurt that my brother didn't love me. But, like, I talked to him and I didn't feel sad that he wasn't responding to me. And I could - you know, you could tell even over the phone if somebody responds to you, like, warmly.</p>

<p>And, like, with my stepmother, I told her I was going to therapy. And it still bugs her a little bit. Now I don't know whether it's because she realizes now that it's partly a mother's, you know, like, there's something wrong with partly the mother if there's something wrong with the child. And part of my hang-up came from her. But, I mean, it was me too. You know, I'm not saying it's all her fault. You know, I guess a reaction between the both of us and no (inaudible at 0:13:29.8) reaction or no interaction between us and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, so you were saying with your brother, like, you didn't quite feel sad but... 0:13:39.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt a hurt. Now the hurt was not because he the person didn't love me, but because he was my brother and, you know, for a long time I felt he didn't love me. Although I didn't bring it out, you know. Once it got out in the open I still had the hurt, like, my God, I've got a brother and he doesn't love me. But not directed especially towards him. In other words, I can talk to him and it doesn't bother me a lot. I mean, I won't be crying and everything when I get off the phone. Yet, when I think about it sometimes, you know, like, boy, is that rotten to have a brother, you know, when I see, like, Martin and Jodie, and, like, my girlfriend and we went out to see her brother and how they get along, and how nice it is and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not so much him, it's just the fact of not having (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to have a brother and not have a brother. You know, to have a blood, big brother, but not to have a brother, you know, it just kind of bugs me. And he's already taken this other girl on who is no blood relation or anything as a sister. So it's like, he blocked me out, he's got somebody to replace me, but I don't have somebody to replace him, and in a way that's how - I think that kind of bugs me too because, like, he's got a little sister, but I don't have a big brother. 0:13:39.2</p>

<p>And it was so funny because I think I - well, (inaudible at 0:14:54.9) care about anymore. Like, I used to really dig him as - I didn't realize how much until my stepmother said, I used to go around staring at him. But it was more or less like a father image because I was, like, 8 or 9 years old, that I was looking for. And to me he was - you know, because he was big and strong and everything. He was nice and he was funny. And he was very nice to me at first. But, like, he was 18, so, you know, what do you want from an 18-year-old fellow?</p>

<p>But, like, I don't care that much about him anymore. And I was thinking about why he - you know, Jodie's brother. And he is so funny, and so he's another one that's pretty big and strong guy. And it was so funny that this just came out, he said something smart to me, oh, about he's pushing the food over towards me, he said, "Well, I thought I'd put it on this side so it would be easier for you to get." I said, "Look," you know, and I went like this to him and I said, "I was thinking about adopting you as a brother, but now forget it." 0:15:44.1</p>

<p>You know, and that just came out too, you know, like, I say things a lot of times that I don't think about what I'm saying. And they just sort of come from nowhere, you know. And then when I say it, then I think about it, like, that was said in jest but, you know, was it true? Did I really think - or was it just something that came out? Like sometimes you can say something that's meaningless, sometimes you can say something like you really feel, like, "Boy, I wish I had a big brother that had a relationship like my..." not even him even. It's just that he and Jodie have such a great relationship, you know, and I guess I'm jealous, you know, it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would really like to have a big brother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd love to have a big brother. I guess it's - like I've always said that, I've always said, "Boy, if I ever got married, I'd like to have a boy first and then a girl." I'd always like the girl to have a big brother. And... 0:16:30.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like someone to care about you, someone to protect you, someone you can count on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, and it's got to be a big brother, not a little brother, a man, you know, because a man is somebody that, I guess, a girl thinks of as in terms of a protector or something. She thinks of a father or a big brother or maybe both, you know. Just somebody that's there, it's the big, like, head or whatever you want to call it. And I don't know now whether it's because, like, with my father, I probably didn't know him that well. I can see it that I probably didn't see him that much. And so there is a possibility. I've seen it with my sister's kids.</p>

<p>Like, when my stepbrother takes and goes on the midnight shift, he's a security guard. When he goes on the midnight shift, the kids don't even know him after it. Like, they may see him for an hour a day or something like this. They don't even know their father after he comes off it. They have to get to know him again. 0:17:23.4</p>

<p>Well, I think, well, if my father did this all the time, sure, when I go to school and then I probably never saw him, saw him on weekends once in a while if he wasn't sleeping.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just never had a father?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way I think because I cannot see how he could have hurt me so much in the length of time that he was home that I would completely push him out of my mind as such. Like, I can only remember, like, certain instances when he - I got that candy that time or something, and it wasn't the candy I liked and so I got hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it seems to you like maybe you're pushing him out of your mind, and maybe you should do something about that. But on the other hand, that doesn't quite seem right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it also doesn't seem like it might be what really happened. See, it might have been that I transferred the affection that I should have had to a father to my brother, so that I had, like, a double. He'd be, like, the big brother. He would be, like, the protector. He would be, like, the head. He would be, like, the person that - like, I always went to if I was looking for a father and he's only, like, five years older than I am, four and a half, five years. 0:18:26.1</p>

<p>Because I can see it in a way, like, my mother says he used to always buy me things. I can remember a time when someone tried to hurt me. I was a little rough neck and a little tomboy. And a big - well, I must have been first or second grade, this was a seventh grader, so my brother was only, like, maybe sixth or seventh grade himself. And two of them were, like, beating up on me. I said, "I'm going to go home and get my big brother." And that was the first thing I thought of, like, I would think normally that, like, a child - like a little girl would say, "I'm going to go home and get my father."</p>

<p>But I wouldn't say that, I said - I remember that, I thought that was kind of odd. You know, it's usually, my daddy is this and my daddy is that. I don't remember myself ever saying that. It's always my big brother this, my big brother that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was always him you could count on? 0:19:09.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that's what it seems like. Like, I sort of transferred everything to him. And when he wasn't there it was a bigger shock to me than I thought it was. You know, and then when he came back and we had this rotten relationship, right from the start, we just never got along when we were at that foster home. And I don't really know exactly what it was on his part. But he did have a rotten attitude, you know, so it wasn't just me. He had a rotten attitude towards me and I had sort of the same towards him because maybe is was Andy, maybe he was jealous of Andy because I got so close to Andy. That could have been partly it why he didn't like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just didn't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whatever it was, we did not get - right, we didn't meet. And I thought all the time it was me completely with my brother. But Mrs. Foley said, "No, he had a rotten attitude toward you too." You know, so then it was, like, both of us, we just - you know. And then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you saying, like, happened (inaudible at 0:20:07.3) or what happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partly I don't know what happened and I would like to know, you know, like, how we got to this point where - you know, like, how can I feel so much towards this one person? And then, like, all of a sudden, like, I can talk about him and it doesn't really bug me. 0:20:26.1</p>

<p>Like, it bothered me when I said before, like, my brother didn't love me or that my mother wouldn't, you know, look at me or anything unless I did handstands in front of her. But I really can say - I'm saying this and it doesn't even bother me. (Inaudible at 0:20:38.3) shocks me because, like, I would think it would get me all broken up that my brother doesn't love me and it doesn't. And, you know, like I'm saying, "Wait a minute, you know, like, what's going on?"</p>

<p>Now whether I'm just, you know, like, holding all that affection I have for someone and just waiting for the next man that I fall in love with, and just transfer the whole thing to him, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to you like you should be really upset that you don't love your brother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it would normally, you know, like, bother somebody. But I don't know whether in that case I just hardened myself so much that, like, now it doesn't bother me anymore. But then, like, I never realized before when I was younger that my brother didn't love me, really. I mean, I thought he was mad at me. I thought he was this, I thought he - you know, like, for a while he might not even liked me, but I always thought he loved me. 0:21:26.8</p>

<p>And lately, I just said to myself, all right, I always make excuses for him first of all. I say, "Well, he lives north that's why he can't come and see me. I don't have a car, he's got a car, he can come and see me." When he's coming south because I used to live south, he could pick me up very easily and take me out to see my mother, and we could both go together, but he never did. He never once tried to get in touch with me. I would send him cards at Christmastime. I even bought him a present last year or this year, he never - I know he didn't get me anything again this year, last year no card, nothing.</p>

<p>And, you know, like, I always think of him in that way. I always think, well, I've got to get a present now for my brother. He's still my brother, but, like, it still hurt all over again when I don't get anything. I walk out there and she's got a stereo, a 13-year-old kid. He gets her a stereo. And, like, his own sister, he doesn't even send her a card. He doesn't call her up. He's got my phone number. He lives eight blocks from my house. Do you think he would say at Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, "Would you like to come over? May I come over to your house? May I see you, would you" - you know, nothing, every time I get in touch with him, I call him, he never calls me. 0:22:29.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He always leaves you out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I got to this point where I said, "Look, Charlie, you may be my brother in blood, but forget it any other way." You know, because, like, my father had that with his brother. He just completely cut that whole part of the family off because I think they forged his name on a hundred dollar check or something. And my father said, "That's it." Well, I think that's a little bit - I personally think it's a little bit, like, too much of a punishment, they were close anyway. But more than likely, they weren't that close anyway. (Crosstalk). And this might have been, like, a last straw and he said - so I said, you know, "If my father can do it to that part of the family, I don't know why I can too, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, you're not getting anything out of it so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's true. You know, it's - to me, it's - I don't even think it's that selfish because, like, I've tried. You know, like, I've come and I've called him. I've done this I've done that for him. And, you know, I get him a present. I do this. And like I said, I've called him before and I said, you know, "Like when can we go out to see mom? We'll go out together and then we'll get her chicken or whatever she wants, you know, and I'll pay half or whatever." And we can go out because she's happy, you know, so this is not even for me but for ma, you know, like, "Could we make her happy, she likes to see us both together." 0:23:40.2</p>

<p>"Yeah, we'll go out in a few weeks" again, "I haven't been out there in a few weeks," you know and all this. I think to myself, you know, like, "What kind of a brother is that? Who wants him?" You know, really, and I get to the point, like, if a brother is going to be that rotten, I don't need him, I really don't. And right now I'm getting more confident. And I don't know, I still got lots of hang-ups that I've got to get out. But, like, in that area, I'm getting a little bit less insecure and a little bit more self-sufficient.</p>

<p>And, like, if I don't have anybody, all right, you know, like, there's nothing I can do about it. I just have to go from there. Like, I've got two sets of foster parents and they both care about me. And I've got a stepfather that I can sort of transfer some of my affections to. 0:24:20.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you can really make it without him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm getting to the point where I think I can. It still hurts, you know, like people will say, "Do you have a brother?" And I say yeah, you know, and it kind of - like they'll say, "Well, where is he?" You either say, "I don't know, last time I know he was eight blocks from my house, and I haven't seen him in six months." You know, and I get (inaudible at 0:24:39.2), they got to look at you like you're crazy. But, you know, well, I shouldn't say that. During the summer he did come over. Of course he didn't call me, and, I mean, this is Sunday, it was the only day we had off and we went to the beach.</p>

<p>So this is why I thought, "Well, maybe he does want to start something." But, like, what kind of an idiot is going to come over to a girl's house when she lives with another girl, it's a beautiful day out. And he knows you've got a bike, and you got one day to yourself, do you actually think she's going to sit in the house that whole day? I mean, you'd be crazy to. 0:25:09.8</p>

<p>So, but at any rate, I shouldn't say that, he did try. So I guess in that respect, I did feel like, well, maybe he really does want to start something up since I'm close. But that was during the summertime. Now maybe it's because, like, Mom Foley said that he's starting to get like he's going into a nervous breakdown. Maybe there is something there for me, I don't know. I really don't. But even in this nervous breakdown he still goes out and gets this kid a stereo and he doesn't bother with his own sister. Last year it was a watch, you know. And it's - you know, it's just to me, like, this is not the way a brother should be to his sister, it just isn't.</p>

<p>Like, if she was his girlfriend, fine, that's different. This is a girl he might marry someday or something, all right, that's different. I'm not trying to play favorites with a girlfriend. It's like first of all, this is the beautiful thing about that, he's got a love for her, but his love won't get any less for you because you're his sister, see, because it's, like, a different type of love that he has for you. It's, like, a family love he has for you, and he's got a different type of love for her, like an emotional thing, you know. 0:26:14.8</p>

<p>But it's, like, even if he divorced her or whatever, you know, like, whether he stayed married to her or he divorced her, he married six girls and he had that same type of love or as much love for them, he's still have the same amount for you, you know, because you're still his sister. But, like, he doesn't feel that way. You know, it's, like, he's taken the sister love and taken it, put it over to her. I wouldn't care if he liked her, but she's too young, she's, like, 13, he's, like, 20-25. I'm sure she's too young and she's not that good looking or anything. And she's, like a cute little kid, she's 14 come to think of it. She acts, like, about 10. She's very immature, but she's a nice kid, you know. She's nice for, like, a little sister type, you know.</p>

<p>She's, like, when I got out there, I'd like to think of her as a little sister and she's just starting to get into the world of boys and that. And it's so cute, you know, to watch her go into this, "Oh, I got a boyfriend, don't tell him that." You know, (inaudible at 0:27:05.4) the same thing when I was 13 or 14. 0:27:07.5</p>

<p>And, you know, you just kind of laugh with her and you go along with her, and you share her, you know, her new experiences (inaudible at 0:27:13.7), she starts giggling, you know, like a little kid, like young girls do when they first start. And it's really nice, like, I've almost adopted her as, like, a little sister. Like, I've got two of them in both the families and they're both - I don't know why, but just all of a sudden they're both coming up really well. The other one was our brat, like, nobody could stand. And I was probably the only one among the girls that really said, "I don't care what you say about her, and I admit she's a brat, and I don't like her a lot of times, but there's still something about her." I said, "I really feel kind of, like, a love for her."</p>

<p>I said, "Maybe it's pity I don't know." But I said, "There really is, like, a feeling there, I care about what happens to her." And they were saying, you know, all this pity and all this bull -  - . But, like when I went out there I didn't feel like it was pity. Like, I could see it, like, when she was - my father, oh, it was great, my stepfather (inaudible at 0:28:01.8). I never felt much like he was, like, he was my father. He was too old. He was, like, a nice grandpappa, you know, but not like a father, like, 76. 0:28:11.7</p>

<p>But it was so cute the way she goes to him, "Oh, dad, you should have seen (inaudible at 0:28:16.6) on the floor by his dresser (ph). "Oh, you should see what I did in school today." She's getting all, you know - and he's, "Oh, yeah, really." He's still reading his paper, really. It was just, like, she could really share with him and it was such a great thing to watch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the warmth of that or the sharing of something that's really...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's such a - it's a beautiful thing because it's, like, a father and daughter sharing. And I guess it's because of that, like, I never really had it. And I said, "Boy, I wish I had." I'm too old now for it I suppose. But, you know, it's like something that you really feel that you missed because you never had that. You know, and when I think about people that are in these divorce cases and things like that too, where they haven't had a father, or especially if you can't see him, if he doesn't have any visiting rights or if the father dies or something, how rotten it must be for a girl never to have, you know - like, I at least have a stepfather that I can kind of go to and I can, like, feel something to him. 0:29:18.5</p>

<p>I felt like the last time I went out there, I don't know whether it was me or whether - I don't know whether it has to do with it, like I said, I admitted I had lots of hang-ups or what it was, but, like, he was a little colder when I first came out than he usually is. And I don't know why. At least maybe it was my feeling. Maybe I wanted him to be more or maybe I came on too strong or something. I don't know. But, like, I almost started crying when he kissed me and said, "Hi." And he kissed me and (inaudible at 0:29:46.7) I was crying getting into the car.</p>

<p>And, like, I feel something towards that man. Like every time I see him, it's just, like, this is my father. I don't care, like, now he used to be a milkman. He's doesn't have a lot of education. He's not a real smart guy, but there's something about him, he's got a lot of love and he's like a father image to me anyway. And, like, I don't care what he does, like now he's a janitor, I don't care. 0:30:08.9</p>

<p>It doesn't make any difference to me, he's still my father, you know. And, like, I'm not ashamed of him or anything. Like, with my own father, I was ashamed of him. I was ashamed of what he did. Like, he worked on the airlines. I was ashamed because he had a nervous breakdown when he was younger and he stuttered and things like this. I was very ashamed that this was my father. And I knew that. You know, like, when he would come over. I think he came over once with my uncle to see me at my church shelter for my eighth grade graduation or something. And I hardly paid any attention to him. I can remember that.</p>

<p>And I guess it was because, like, I didn't - I guess I didn't want him to talk a lot because, like, he stuttered a lot and he was very nervous. And I think really in a way, I was, like, ashamed of him, I never realized that for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really needed somebody to be a father, but of him you were ashamed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I felt like I really - that might have been another reason why I took my brother on as a father image too. Because I really do feel like he wasn't - I can't really explain it. Like, the older I got the worse I got too. You know, it was, like, in eight grade and then in high school, like, I really didn't even feel like I had a father. And it was only when he died that I really felt like I lost something. 0:31:22.9</p>

<p>So in a way it must have been - it could have been like a stifled feeling, like, I had for him when I was little. And it was because of this, like, I didn't want to talk to him and I didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Turn this tape over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This session is continued on track A of the other side of the tape. On track A of the other side of the tape.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really weird about my father, the way I felt when I grew up. I just realized that now that when I was little, I was ashamed of him too probably. Because I can only remember that time when he came at my eighth grade graduation and (inaudible at 0:32:02.9). I didn't say anything. And I don't even know if I felt it, you know, outwardly. But I can remember that really wanting him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, everybody (inaudible at 0:32:14.6), everybody would think badly of you because you had such a father.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I was also afraid for lots of years because, see, like, I didn't know, I was very ignorant in that area too, that I didn't know that nervous breakdowns were hereditary. I didn't know that breast cancer was hereditary. 0:32:32.5</p>

<p>I had a fear, like, when I got, oh, maybe like 15 or 16 or something that something might happen with my legs, that they would start, you know - that I might not be able to walk on them. And, like, with my father, I was afraid that I was going to have a nervous breakdown, I really did. And, like, if somebody said something even in jest, I can remember this, like, "Oh, you're crazy," you know, I would (crosstalk), "Don't say that because, you know, it may be tomorrow."</p>

<p>And I really felt like - you know - and then I thought, I talked - who did I talk to? Somebody who knew a little more than I did and they said, no, that, you know, like, nervous breakdowns are just from you. But then I said, "Well, look, my father had a nervous breakdown, which meant that he was very nervous." My mother - I remember her going to the doctor and the doctor said - what did he say, oh, he said to relax. And she's like an iron spring inside. She's not outside, she doesn't shake or anything. But, like, he told her to relax and he said, "I told you to relax." She said, "I was relaxed." And that was as relaxed as she was going to get, which meant she was very uptight inside. 0:33:38.2</p>

<p>And which meant, like, I thought too that I would be the same way. I thought, "Oh, Jesus, you know, like, all I need is something like that." And I can remember that because my mother was telling me about it, like, I think he was a cab driver or something and this happened, I guess, on the bus or near the cab or something like this that he had the nervous breakdown. And I always thought too, "Oh, what would happen if I went, like, you know, nutty and I was right in the middle of somebody?" Oh, my God, what would happen?</p>

<p>And it really bugged me more than I wanted to admit that, you know, like, there was something there that I was always afraid I was going to go crazy. And then, like, when Jodie told me I needed therapy, oh, Jesus, you know, and I didn't realize that even until now how much it really bugged me that there was something there that was really a problem, you know. And then I started getting, like, boy, I went hysterical. I haven't cried like that in a long time, it was on my birthday. 0:34:35.2</p>

<p>In fact, I probably never got that hysterical. I cried before, but I was never hysterical like I was that night. Now I get - I get - I do another thing, and I did this once afterwards. I had another crying spree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was this one with Jodie, the one where she told you needed therapy, is that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that was, like, "Wow, there's really something wrong with me?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, see, she was my teacher too. And all she had to do was say something. And so now I'm starting to separate, you know, myself from everything she said because part of it, she even said herself, she said (inaudible at 0:35:08.2), "One person can't know everything." And, like, my friend the pseudo intellectual that I thought was so smart, I am seeing lots of things about him that I can see now, like, he's not so smart first of all, he's not an intellectual. He thinks he is. 0:35:24.8</p>

<p>All right, he's had a couple of years of college, but he's not an intellectual. He reads something, he takes something from what he's read and he says, "Now I know something and I can present an argument," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is you don't have to get so swamped by something somebody else thinks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I used to always think - you know, listen to him and he's say do this, and I (inaudible at 0:35:41.7) I got to do this, I got to do this or I'm dumb. She'd say do this, well, I got to do this or I've done a stupid thing, or I've done this thing or - let's see, I'm not going to get any place if I don't do things the way she wants me to do them. And where - you know, and this was part of the reason, like, I'm kind of frustrated because the things I go into, she's already into, and she's better than I am with them. 0:36:03.1</p>

<p>It's just like a big mess. And it's just a weird thing, like, I'll listen to her now. But I'll think about what she said first of all before I'll just say, "Well, yeah, I guess that was - I shouldn't do this or I should do that or (inaudible at 0:36:33.7).</p>

<p>It's, like, (inaudible at 0:36:35.5) last night. And he's not the older one, this is the younger one. I work at night sometimes for him. And he's, like, about 35. And I don't know where I'm going with him. I'm kind of, you know, like, because I know I need a boyfriend right now. But I also know - well, maybe it will work out just working part time one or two nights a week with him, and then maybe going out every other night or whatever it is with him, Luke.</p>

<p>But, like, we're in the office and everybody is gone, you start making out and it's funny as heck. We weren't doing anything serious, you know, he was, like, kissing me and things like this. I just kept looking at him, he says, "What's the matter?" I said, "I don't know, but the whole thing is ridiculous." You know, I just kept saying to myself, here I am, he leaves me alone, I type his envelopes or whatever I have to do for him for about two or three hours. All of a sudden he comes in he kisses me on the back of the neck. He (inaudible at 0:37:32.9) we start making out. And he'll come in, in between sometimes if nobody's around. 0:37:36.9</p>

<p>He'll come up, you know, he'll grab me from behind and he'll kiss me. And I'm thinking to myself, "This is the weirdest office relationship I have ever had." And, like, I don't know exactly, like, what's going on. I know I'm kind of attracted to him, I don't know why exactly. It's not like I'm in love with him. And I came right out and I said, "Look, you're married, you love your wife." Because he was talking, like, eventually he'd like to take me to bed. Came right out and said, he said, "Eventually I'd like to take you to bed, maybe the end of this year, maybe in the summertime." He said, "I don't know, whenever you say yes."</p>

<p>And he says, "And don't worry, if you keep saying no, that's fine." I said to myself, Buddy, you don't know how it's going to take you, I'm going to keep saying no and no and no." But it's, like, I just never had it, like, with my other boss, I can just tell him, he'll go to kiss me and I'll say, "No, no, no, you can't do that, remember we've got to have a good working relationship," and I can get away with that with him. 0:38:26.7</p>

<p>But this one, you know, partly because I don't want to, this one's younger and he's more desirable as a boyfriend because he's only, like, what, 35, something like that. And he's good looking, and he's got dark hair and he's, you know, tall and strong and the whole bit, you know. He's the type that (inaudible at 0:38:44.4).</p>

<p>And it really bugs me because I would like to do something, but I know with even the way the stupid morality is yes, especially with him because he's, like, Italian. And, you know, he lives in the suburbs and the whole bit. That I have to work my way really slowly in becoming his girlfriend, and then I don't know what would happen to the job, and I need the job. So it's, like, oh, (inaudible at 0:39:05.7), you're sort of torn this way and that way.</p>

<p>And he came right out and admitted, he didn't say he didn't love me, but I said, "Look, I know you love your wife." He said, "Yeah, I gave her." He goes, "It's a seven carat diamond ring." I said, "Yeah, sure, what did she do, carry it around her neck or something?" And for Christmas or something, and so I know, you know, I know he was exaggerating, but he probably did get her a nice diamond cocktail ring, you know. 0:39:29.2</p>

<p>So I said, "Okay, fine," so we're still playing this little game, but it's weird because, like, I'll say that to him. I'll say, "Look," I said, "I know you love you wife." And I said, "I know there's - that what you want is just something on the side." I came right out and told him. I don't know whether this is the right thing to do or not but I did, you know, because I didn't know it was going or, like, what to do. You're sort of like (inaudible at 0:39:50.9).</p>

<p>And so he'd say something - what did he say to me? He said, "Well, when you have the feeling too, then we'll go to bed." And the first thing I thought of because I wanted him too, I think, I thought, oh, feeling maybe he really does care a little bit, see. And it wasn't really that. What he meant is when you feel like going to bed, fine. When I thought about this logically, I said, "Dummy, don't get your hopes up, and don't get to this point." Because see, like, if I dig somebody, naturally I want him to dig me.</p>

<p>If he doesn't, then I feel like, you know - so I said to myself, "Okay, I don't really dig him that much." And so, fine, I'll keep working for him, we'll keep going out, we'll have fun. And that's it because, like, I'm not going to have any relationship with a fellow who I know loves his wife. And I don't think it's cricket first of all because he's only been married three years. And I don't know if he's got a child or not. And I just don't like that idea of, you know, like, especially if I ever - I would never have an affair with him, I don't think because he's married and I just don't like the idea. 0:40:53.6</p>

<p>Maybe I'm old fashioned, maybe it's just my own Catholic upbringing or something, but if a girl is sitting home and she's depending on this fellow as being her, you know, whatever, all right, maybe, like, with Jewish fellows, they say that - well, this is what I heard, I don't know if it's true or not. But they say that if they run around and they go to bed or whatever with another girl, it just helps them be a better husband because they get off their frustrations, you know, and they don't force her if she's not in the mood or whatever. And fine and then they become a better husband because they've got something on the side, but their wife comes first.</p>

<p>But, like, with a Gentile guy, I don't know what would happen. I don't know if the wife would find out what happened because I had this once before when I was, like, 18, how another guy was married and his wife got my number and all sorts of things. And she calls me up and she's balling over the phone, she's got three kids there, you know, and you feel like this big. 0:41:45.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't want to get into that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't want to be the cause of any kind of trouble, even though the guy and I finally ended up just, you know, saying, "The hell with you." I said because he was married, I just didn't want anything more to do with him. And I don't know, we just sort of broke up. I saw him once or twice afterwards, and I told him, I said, "Forget it, you know, it's just not working, I can't do it" because I was a good Catholic at the time. But not even that, I just - I don't know whether it's because of me because I feel like, I wouldn't want that to happen to me. You know, like, I wouldn't let there be another girl there if I had a fellow who was my husband and I had a couple of kids at home, I wouldn't want him to be goofing around. 0:42:23.9</p>

<p>But it's not even that, I'm not so much worried about, you know, him kissing me, just to be having fun and going out and having a couple of drinks. The real thing that bugs me is I don't want her to find out that something is going on. And I think it's because (inaudible at 0:42:38.4). Not because - she couldn't do anything to me really unless she wanted a divorce and then I'd [be run] (ph) as a third party. But, like, I really think it's because, like, I felt like if that happened to me, I'd feel terrible too, so I wouldn't want to do it to somebody else, you know.</p>

<p>It's, like, they always say, "You can't really feel for somebody unless you felt it yourself." And, like, I have and I wouldn't want to do this to this girl. You know, so I keep trying to tell him that, you know, like, I don't want her to know and you're sure we can go out for a drink now, you know, she won't call the office, and things like this and he said, you know, like, "Look, what I do on my business is ours or my time, I make the money and I bring it home to her." 0:43:15.6</p>

<p>So in other words, what he's saying in a way kind of bothers me because what he's saying is, "I don't really care about you at all, I care about my wife." But I'm just here for having fun. But in a way I kind of respect that and I'm happy because then this girl's not going to get hurt. And I know where I stand, so I won't fall in love with this guy or feel for him because, you know, like, I know he's just going to turn around some day and just say - the only thing I really worried about, and I told him is (inaudible at 0:43:38.2). He says, "Look, you'll still work for me whether we go to bed, whether we keep going out or we keep fooling around or not, you'll still work for me." I said, "Fine, good." Because (inaudible at 0:43:48.9) is what I really wanted in the first place when I started that job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sounds like you're pretty comfortable with the way you've got that worked out for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless something happens, yeah, I just kind of worry because I'm funny that way. I get - my girlfriend brought this up partly, this is partly one of the reasons I started thinking that. She said, "Boy, you like anybody who's nice to you, don't you?" And I kind of took - you know, - a lot of things. I said to myself, "All right, how many fellows have you liked or you've gone out with, and you've stayed with a lot of times?" Not stayed with, you know, I mean, you know, sleeping with or anything like - I'm just staying with a long time, like going out with him a long time just because they were nice to you, and you really didn't like them? 0:44:27.1</p>

<p>And I realized, I put up with a lot of jerks just because they liked me and they treated me nicely. And (inaudible at 0:44:34.2) them, I really couldn't say I liked them. I could talk to them. I might like them as a friend and they like me as a girlfriend or like all this other bull, or I liked where they took me, like this one fellow. I got so sick and tired of him repeating this one piece of poetry, I was about ready to just, like, "Don't you know anything else?" You know, every time he'd get romantic, he'd recite this thing to me, I knew it by heart by the time I broke up with him. It was so funny, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, why should you do that? Why should you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, why should I put up with someone I don't really like just (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that say about you then, something that you keep doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's like my girlfriend. Now she'll probably want me home tonight, like, she's supposed to have this friend of hers - this is a riot. I can go into a story about that, which is funny as heck. But anyway, he was going to come over for dinner. Okay. Well, I was thinking that possibly we would go to (inaudible at 0:45:26.8) again because she's got two friends in from Connecticut. Okay, that sounds big and impressive. Well, I was there twice last year with these fellows. And (inaudible at 0:45:34.6) one is this year. 0:45:35.4</p>

<p>One is them is, like, a boy, and we both agreed to this. I said, "I can't believe it, last year this guy at least had something." He's like, "All you see in his eyes are dollar signs. As far as the person goes, nothing there." All he worries about is the almighty dollar. And he's just, like, the only thing he'll say is, like, "I bought a new Bill Blass suit." Or, "I bought these..." you know, like, all this bull. And you just think to yourself, "Oh, you know, nouveau riche, forget it." Where is his friend who is real nice? And this was another breakthrough because, like, when I went there, I was with his friend last year.</p>

<p>I was supposed to be with his friend last year. And his name is Phillip, (inaudible at 0:46:15.1) his name. And so I was with Phillip. I wasn't really with Phillip. My girlfriend says, "Look, we're going down but we're not going to be with anybody special. There's going to be, like, four or five fellows." Well, Wes, that's the one that's, like the boy, he left the table. So Phillip was there and this other fellow, Davis and somebody else whom I didn't know very well, and they were very, very intelligent. They were talking back and forth. 0:46:35.2</p>

<p>And very educated and they were also about 40 something, you know, like they were both were a lot older and they had been around in business, and they were more or less intellectuals so they were talking back and forth. And my girlfriend was talking to them. While I was talking to Phillip, and I knew - I (inaudible at 0:46:49.2). I was very proud of myself because, you know, like, I did this once and I was figuring now so I would get two people back, and a good relationship because when Jodie met Phillip at a show, like, a convention, like, about two years ago, she said he was one of the most beautiful people she'd ever met and he was real nice.</p>

<p>Now he's made lots of money. But it hasn't really changed him except that I think, like, Wes has rubbed off on him in this way, that's he's gotten - can I say it, he's, like, with the smart remarks, you know, like with the kind of dirty little innuendos because he thinks that's the thing you have to be. And you have to come up with these smart things when you drink, and things like this. 0:47:29.0</p>

<p>So she got to the point where, like, she'd be very defensive, she'd put on the big act. So, like, she was sitting here and me and then Phillip, you know, and then Davis and I guess the guy's name was Ian sitting next to Jodie on the other side. So I got up. He was talking to me saying, oh, you know, Jodie, said, "She's got a nice shape and she's a pretty girl and she's got this." But she kids (ph) with these smart remarks, you know, she keeps going and she won't get down to the (inaudible at 0:47:53.0). Like, she was such a nice person, such a real person, now she's not and I could realize it too.</p>

<p>She gets like this around some people. And I can tell when she's putting on a big, phony act and I don't like it myself. She's such a nice, sweet, you know, beautiful person, and then sometimes she just puts on this - you know, like, you'd just like to go (inaudible at 0:48:11.5) sometimes with her smart remarks. 0:48:13.6</p>

<p>And I guess some of the fellows feel the same way. So I said okay, I think it's just about time because he had been complaining for five minutes. So it's just about time for me to leave, you know, for a few minutes. I got to go potty. So naturally, I knew he'd move over and hopefully, because I just kind of felt that, like, this is the time that if I left now, I think he might talk to Jodie and say, like, "What's wrong?" You know, so I stayed in the bathroom, practically took a shower in there and stayed there for ten minutes or so.</p>

<p>I came back out and by this time, he was talking very nicely to Jodie, which is great. So he was going to get up, I said, "No, no, no, I'll sit on the outside." So I sat on the outside and let them talk. Okay, now normally what would have happened to me if, like, the fellow I was talking to, you know, (inaudible at 0:48:59.8) the night would turn around, and I didn't know these other fellows too well. I would sit there and say, "He doesn't like me, they don't care about me, I'm left out." And I'd sit, you know. 0:48:59.8</p>

<p>So this time, I said, "The hell with [this noise] (ph)." They were talking, that's what I wanted to happen first of all. I guess maybe that's what made me feel kind of good because I had planned this whole thing, like, a little cupid over here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody did it to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was more, see, she didn't realize this until after I came out and told her, I said, "Yeah, I knew it was a good time to go potty because I knew he'd move over and talk to you." But even so I think if that would have happened - you know, like, whether I left the table or not, whether I really wanted them to talk or not, I think I would still have felt, like, [this bit] (ph), like I was kind of left out.</p>

<p>Because, like, I watched them for a little while and, you know, I didn't get into the conversation. I kind of looked back and forth and I said, "No, this is the time for those two to share." Like, they haven't been sharing all night, think they haven't shared for a long time. And it was really weird because the thing is - and I really shocked myself because I didn't feel any hurt at all, that, like - you know, like I could get up and I could goof around with him and everything. But, like - and I really like him. I really can say I think he's a nice guy and I like him, but I'm not jealous. 0:48:59.8</p>

<p>You know, and then I just started talking to this other fellow, I said, "What, I didn't hear what you said." I sat there and I just watched them for a while, the two fellows talking back - you know how you can do that sometimes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you can sort of get their attention. Like, the one fellow turned around and I said, "I disagree with you." You know, "What?" And then you just, you know, kind of get into the conversation, so I didn't say a lot. I just kind of, like - see, being at a lower level than they are, in a way is an advantage sometimes because it's, like, with a teacher, sometimes they'll talk to a student to see other students' reactions.</p>

<p>You know, and say, like, "What's going on in that world that I can't reach you?" You know, and so, like, he was trying to explain, like, he would tell his father that he can't understand about his son because his son is running wild and all this. And he said, you know, like, "I was in the hospital for, like, 18 months in a cast" or something. And I guess he was a co-pilot or something and the pilot had died in this plane crash. Everybody had died but him. 0:51:06.8</p>

<p>And he had, like - he's got, like, a piece of metal in his head and he's got - oh, all sorts of things were wrong with him. He was paralyzed and the whole bit. And so what he said was this one - the pilot's mother came into to him and said, "Well, why are you alive and my son dead?" And he kept thinking about this. And the more he thought about it - a young kid, he was about 18, you know. The more he thought about this, he's saying to himself, "Yeah, why was I - why am I alive," you know, and all this.</p>

<p>So he sort of - he wouldn't talk to anybody, he wouldn't make any attempt to get better. Like, after 18 months the doctor said, "Look, you've reached the point of no return. You either turn over - turn you head" because he'd turn away when somebody would come. "You either turn your head back this way and you try, or you're going to be like a vegetable the rest of your life." So it took him just about a minute or two and he turned over and he went like this - like, you known, he would do it. 0:51:51.6</p>

<p>Now this is a story saying that, like, no matter what kind of problems you had or whatever - like, he had to learn to walk all over again, it took him, like, 18 months again to start recuperating and playing something with his fingers, I forget whether it was piano or whatever it was to get his fingers to move again and all sorts of things. And he's saying, like, "No matter how hard it is for you, for anybody, if you really try, you can do it."</p>

<p>You know, I said, "Well, I'll tell you something about that story that, like a lot of people - I'm not saying me." I said, "I understand, but there's a lot of people that I would know that wouldn't." You would say that and they'd say, well - one or two things, "Well, that's all right for you because you're strong and I'm weak. I can't do it." You know, or they'll say, "Boy, he really thinks he's a big shot because he did this and that." And, you know, "Probably wasn't as bad as..." 0:52:38.0</p>

<p>You know, they'd make all sorts of excuses is I was trying to tell him. And they would not take the story for, like, I would take it or like lots of people would take it because, like, they can feel and they can - I can think a little bit, you know, now. And I said, "I could react to that." But like I said, a lot of the people I associate with wouldn't take it like that. And he said, "Yeah, I guess so." You know, so anyway, we got into the conversation, it was funny. So when Al left, he came up to me, he said - he kissed me on the forehead, he was so cute. He said, "You know something, you're gorgeous."</p>

<p>Oh, okay and it was really weird because, like, I hardly talked to him. I was talking to Phillip more than Ted, you know. But it was really just - it was just such a sweet, nice thing to come up to you and just say, "You know something, you're gorgeous" (inaudible at 0:53:22.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it really made you feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was - and it just - you know, it was really a nice night. And, like, the last time we went, all I could think is, "Oh, the pompousness in the room." And it was overdone. I was thinking more the room than the people really, you know. And then I wanted to make sure I was kind of clever and kind of cute and the whole bull, that I would look like I - you know, very sophisticated. So I walked in, like, the heck with it. Walked in with a nice outfit and everything, but, like, (inaudible at 0:53:48.6), who needs it? You know, it's a big status symbol, who needs it?</p>

<p>And we were trying to, you know, get the fellows to take us some place with better food and maybe a little less - "All right, if you want, you can order something that's real expensive and it's got all the (inaudible at 0:54:00.7) or something, but don't sit in this stupid room, you know. Oh, the food is so terrible there.</p>

<p>And, like, it's nothing like - but people - like, a lot of the people are not even the rich people, but they're going there to see the movie stars, right? So they [stay there] (ph) for two months, and they come in there over dressed and the whole bit, you know, then they sit like this because they're afraid to do anything to this fantastic room. And it's such a riot because it's such a pawn (ph), you know. Not a pawn (ph), but like a - it's not like we're critical, you know, of people to be that way. 0:54:31.3</p>

<p>Now we're going to be here - now we have to act like this and now we have to sit like this, and we're scared to do anything. Why be there, you know. And the funny thing is, is they think they're being sophisticated like the high upper brow, and what they're acting like is just exactly like what they are, people that don't know what they're doing. And they're sitting up there and they're scared stiff, you know.</p>

<p>And we saw so much of this we were just cracking up, so funny. We just watch people, but it was a good night I have to admit it. You know, like, the only thing that bothered me at all was like when Davis said something about, "Yeah, pretty girls are nice, but I'd rather have somebody who's intelligent." And, like, he was very nice to me and everything, but, like, I don't know whether he meant that for me or if he just meant that in general, like he was enjoying the company of the two of us. You know, like, he...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was, like, right away you felt like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, because, yeah, it was probably more my hang-up than his because maybe he thought because I am intelligent. Maybe he saw some of my intelligence coming out. Maybe he wasn't, you know, meaning it as a pawn (ph). You know, but right away I took it as that. That was the only thing that bugged me all night. But the rest of the night we had so much fun. It didn't bother me a lot, but it was just, like, a little thing like, I wonder if he meant me. 0:55:43.0</p>

<p>You know, then kind of crawl under the table, I hope he didn't mean me. But he was real nice. And then they both said, "We'll call you girls." So, you know, like, more than likely. It wasn't, like, you know - the only [ticket back] (ph), there was another time it kind of bothered me because, like, Phillip last year, he likes Jodie. He's liked her for a long time. Last year he said to me, "You're sort of like a dark haired Jodie." At that time, I think I was resenting it already, but wouldn't admit it. You know, at that time, I thought, "Wow, boy, is that a compliment" because I admired her so much.</p>

<p>So this year he said I looked like Carol Lynley, and I didn't catch the "ley" at the end, I thought he said, "You look like Jodie." And I went, "What?" Just like that, I didn't say pardon me, I said, "What?" And he said, "You look like Carol Lynley." I said, "Oh, okay." You know.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to look like Jodie and I don't want to act like Jodie, I wanted to be me. But it was funny because, you know, it was just the idea, "What?" "You look like Carol Lynley" like he was afraid to say it. 0:56:48.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After that response.</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was funny. But then he's - you know, I said, "Oh, thanks" because I really - I knew she was a movie star and everything, so I thought, well, he was meaning it as a compliment, fine, you know. But we had so much fun. And then he was telling me, "Oh, you gained some weight since last year." But, like, for a while when I got this heavy, I'm losing a little bit. But, you know, like, when I got this heavy I thought, Oh, Jesus, you know. And we were both saying this, we were both in light outfits.</p>

<p>And I had one of hers on and she's taller than I am, and it was big on me. And it, you know, like (inaudible at 0:57:23.4), oh my God, I looked like two tons and a half. So he said, "You put on a little weight around the hips." And I said, "Yeah." He said, "Since the last time I saw you last year." And I said, "Oh really?" He said, "Yeah, about four and a half pounds."</p>

<p>And I said, "Phillip, don't tell anybody (inaudible at 0:57:40.6). It was really like about 15, and it's the funniest thing. But, you know, we really - it was really so much fun. I can really say that that night was really a riot. 0:57:50.3</p>

<p>And I can go away from it saying, "I don't really care if we ever go there again." I don't care if I ever see those fellows again as such, except that, you know, like Phillip's nice, I would like him to keep in touch like once a year.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was just, like, right, we just had a good time and I didn't feel jealous and I didn't feel left out. And she said that too, she was very proud of me that I could just take my - you know, take my attention and okay, so somebody is talking here. All right, we weren't with anybody, just talk to somebody else. Even if you were, talk to somebody else. There's no big deal with it. 0:58:22.7</p>

<p>But see, it was always like I was very possessive with somebody, whether I cared about them or not. They were talking to me so you can't talk to anybody else, just me, you know. And it's weird. It's weird when you get to a certain point that it's not so bad anymore in lots of ways. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what you were saying (inaudible at 0:58:40.9), things are really different for you now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're getting there. We're getting there. There's still some hurts that I know have got to come out. But, like, you know, generally speaking, I think it's - God, the last six months or so. Not even six months, about three months it's been really changing an awful lot, something really funny with my communication with people and that. 0:59:04.9</p>

<p>I was always so garrulous, I thought I had a good communication with people, but wow, it's a different type, it's not a possessive type, it turned out a lot better. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

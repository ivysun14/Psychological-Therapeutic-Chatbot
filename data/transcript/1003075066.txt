<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, uh, [PATIENT NAME], I just, uh, wanted to say thanks for doing this, and we, we'll just try to go about a, a typical, normal session here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, looking back, I, I last talked to you 3 months ago or so, back in April, and here we are in the summer.  So overall how, how are you, looking back at this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I've had a lot that's been going on since I saw you last.  Um, I don't know if my mother in law was in the hospital when I saw you last, but she went in, like, around [DATE], and she was in the hospital continuously and spent, like, two months in ICU —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we were, like, on, it was like a roller coaster, you know.  Um, she couldn't breathe.  She had fluids built up.  And, uh, they did a tracheostomy on her, and it just didn't go very well.  So she passed away on [DATE].  And she's lived with us for 5 years.  So it was kind of hard.  And then my husband was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you're really getting hit with all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So it's, he hasn't even recovered from his mother's death yet, and so he's been on disability from work, so money has been kind of tight.  So that's another stress.  But, um, I've been handling it pretty good.  I've been doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you attribute, uh, your success there to?  Any, any thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I really don't know.  Um, I take care of my granddaughter, she's [AGE], on Mondays, Mondays through Thursdays, for, like, 6, 7 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The little ones keep you going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think she, really, I think she really saved me.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  You've been through this depression thing for a, a long, long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since about '92, '91, '92, in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I assume there's been times along the way where you've been through rough patches like this.  Um, what would say in terms of how you're doing now, and in how you've done other times?  Is, is this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what?  It seems like when I go through rough patches, I actually do better than I do with e, than with every day things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why, if it's just, I feel like I need to be strong for somebody else, you know.  I really don't know.  But usually the, the aftermath is when I, it will come up and get me.  You know, I'm waiting.  [LAUGHING].  But I've been doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has your health been o, okay, while, while everybody else is having these troubles?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, they think I have asthma, so I've had that to deal with, but, um, other than that, my health is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking anything for your breathing these days?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Advair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that's new.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you been consistent with your psychiatric medications, pretty much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Never, do you ever miss?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're real consistent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I know you've got the 3 Luvox.  You've got —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That on a consistent basis.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, what about the other as needed medications?  Are, are you using much of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  The Trazodone I take 75 at night, that's because the stent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that's half a pill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Uh, the Klonopin, there's been days that I haven't needed it all, and then there's days I take it once, and then there's other days that I need it twice.  And that's about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So does that average out to one a day?  Because sometimes you don't and sometimes you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have 2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would say, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often would you say there's a, a day good enough that you don't take Klonopin at all?  Is that very often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Maybe like once a week.  Maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well at least you're talking once a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Better than —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So bad.  Are you sleeping well with your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With your half a Trazodone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any change on your thyroid or Zocor or lisinopril?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  The same —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you staying active?  I know the kids keep you active.  Are, are you doing anything for yourself in terms of exercising or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Getting out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Um, my husband and I want to start, you know, walking or doing something.  It's just, right now, he's still grieving.  He's going through a little bit of depression, too, I think, over his mom's death.  And, um, I don't know, it's just, I'm tired constantly.  That's the only complaint that I have, really.  I am just, I mean, tired where I can't even put clean sheets on the bed, because I'm too tired to do it.  You know, I have to wait until I get up the energy to do it.  And I just, I don't know why.  I've had blood tests done, you know, every thing seems to be okay.  And I just ap, attribute it to the depression, only because everything physical seems to check out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  I don't know.  But I feel okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when I hear you say that you thrive on the tough times, and you're always there for everybody else, making sure, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Giving them the strength and support, it would make sense to me to say when you're giving and giving and helping and helping everybody, not just physically, but emotionally —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That can make you tired.  That, that can wear you down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In a tired, it feels physical, but it may be a lot mental, in that kind of way.  I don't even know that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It has to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's probably true, because I'm the kind of person that I feel like I have to take care of everybody.  You know, if my sister has a problem, it, it's my problem then.  You know, I have to find a solution for her, and I have to find a solution for my daughter, and, I wish I wasn't like that so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are those people also having problems that require your assistance lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well my sister had, is bipolar, and she lost her husband to cancer, and then she took care of her brother in law, and she lost him to cancer.  So she, she's doing okay, but she's by herself, and I see her, like, maybe twice a week I bring her over to my house.  She, she only lives, like, 5 minutes from me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, we'll spend some time together.  You know, I try to get her out, you know, as often as I can.  And then my daughter, she's just having work problems, you know, trying to find something she likes, and things like that.  You know, but I'm just, I'm one of those caretaker people, I think, that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If somebody called you up in the midst of feeling so tired that you can't even function, and said they need whatever —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can, can you say no at that point?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to, because I just can't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So at some point your body tells you, that, that's all I can do.  There, there's nothing more I can do today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But see, then it bothers me.  Because, I, I didn't, you know, I couldn't do this for them or whatever.  Then it bothers me, and I get upset, because I can't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that make sense to you that those kind of things should bother you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I mean, everybody tells me it's my own fault for, you know, taking on things.  But it's just my personality, and I just can't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't want to say it's your own fault.  It's your, it's your personality —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know if anybody's ever said it to you like this, but it's okay to say no.  At, at some point you've given all you can give —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you've done all you can do, and at that point, whatever it may be, if it's drawing that line somewhere —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, it's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can't give every ounce of energy that you have to everybody else and have nothing left for yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're your own worst critic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not s, somebody else who, who is going to criticize you for saying no after you've done so much except for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's just, I'm, that's the kind of person that I am, and, like, a perfectionist, too.  And that's when I was in nursing, I think that's why the stress of that got to me, because I couldn't do things the way I wanted, because of time.  You know, I couldn't take care of the patients the way that I felt should be the right way, and, um, I, it was just stressing me out so bad, I just couldn't even take it anymore.  Even though that, I loved the job, but I just couldn't do it anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if I give you, just as an example, if I told you, "I take 10% of my salary every year, and I donate it to charity," what would you think of me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Think you're a great person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't say I give 100%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I said I gave 10%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Still I think that's a good —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think I'm a great person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because you give —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's on, but it's only 10%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not giving everything I have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  But it's still —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But would, wouldn't a great person give more than that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well maybe not great, I'd say you're a, a decent person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So a great person would give 100%?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably, or try to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you see where I'm coming from, it's that you, you can give less than every ounce you've got —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People will stay, still say, "Hey, you're a great person."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You give enough.  You do what you can within your means, within your ability.  You, you just said it to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can be a great person by giving 10% in, in that charity example.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If someone calls you asking for help, you can say yes to them one time out of 10.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you happen to have enough energy and enough time that day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could be a great person for that.  So why beat yourself up if you only say yes 9 times out of 10.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  It's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why should you, why?  You, you just —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Answered your own question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why though.  I don't know why.  You know, and there's, I mean, I have, this is how little energy I have.  If someone gave me $1000, and said, "Here go on a shopping spree, or go on a trip."  I, I wouldn't go, because I just don't even have the energy to go anywhere.  And, like, if we get together, like, if there's a family function, like, I'm there for an hour, and it's like I need to get out of there.  And it's not, and I don't know why.  I don't know why I feel that way.  It's like I can't relax anywhere.  It's like I have to be on or, I don't know what it is.  I, it's like I just can't sit there and relax.  It's, like, I'm, I'm fidgeting around, I'm walking around.  I can't stay and have, like, a conversation with somebody.  It's like I, a few words and it's like I have to up, and then in an hour I have to be out of there.  You know, I need to go home, and I need to have quiet.  And that, it's, that's kind of big problem for me, because every family function, it's, like, I dread even going.  And I love everybody in my family, love be, seeing the, but I don't know why I'm like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have to work on giving yourself permission.  You, you just told me 10% is okay for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, by gosh, 10% is okay for  you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifty percent is okay, 75%, what, whatever percent you want to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you use that an, example, wouldn't you tell me I was a nut job if I said I gave 100% of my salary to, to charity?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've got a wife and kids at home.  I've got a mortgage and food and, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If I gave every last thing that I made away —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would, wouldn't you think I was kind of strange?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well what about your wife and kid?  What about, what about yourself?  What are you going to eat?  What are you going to wear?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where, where you going to live?  What, what are you talking about, you gave it all away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I understand that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you can't.  That, that goes to far on that extreme and it, it's not even good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Yeah.  I just don't know how to stop it.  [LAUGHING].  You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I'm just trying to lay a groundwork of, of a way of thinking of it.  It's certainly going to take a lot of time, and talking yourself through it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Experiencing time and again how to do, but I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I've been saying mo, no a lot more.  Only because it just, it's too much.  [LAUGHING].  Just can't do everything.  It's better now, I mean, I shouldn't say it this way, but now that my mother in law is not here, it's a lot easier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, I mean, that, there was a lot of care with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See you've been on the Luvox now for a while.  I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think out of all the different things you've tried that you, you've found something that's, I think, at least —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The cream rose to the top, some —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To some degree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Although, I, I don't want to everything is all perfect, we're, we're hanging in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you're getting through a tough time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, goodness, don't we, uh, ask are, are you just about ready to get all your prescriptions refilled here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I wanted to ask you, too.  I don't know if you have any, but you gave me those samples of the Luvox.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The CR, I think it was.  Is there any way I could get some samples.  It's just that we're having tr, like, money problems until my husband gets a check.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So if I can help you out for a, a week or 2?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  A couple weeks would be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All right.  I have to see what I have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think, I think I have some.  Do you have any thoughts if the Luvox CR works any better, worse, the same as the regular Luvox?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't, I didn't see a difference, really.  I didn't notice anything different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have, I believe I have coupons for Luvox CR.  So I don't know if, if a brand name with a coupon comes out cheaper of if sticking with a generic without a coupon comes out cheaper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It [INAUDIBLE] what the difference is between the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to think.  I, I pay like, I think, $140 for a month of Luvox.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Out of your own pocket?  Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I mean.  But right now with my husband being on all these meds, and then me, it's, like, we're just really having a rough time right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what, I'm going to, I'm going to give you a prescription for the Luvox CR.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A prescription in addition to the samples with the coupon, and if I'm, if it's more expensive —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We can change it.  You call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have a feeling it may be less expensive, because for one thing, we can cut 3 pills down to 2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You won't, won't be buying as many pills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we have a coupon.  So with all that, it may come out cheaper.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  I'll check it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If I'm wrong, we can change it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  My husband got some, uh, coupons, too, for some of the stuff they put him on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's, it all helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, I mean, it was, the prices were ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The mail in prescriptions are relatively cheap and affordable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As compared with the Luvox.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think the Luvox and Lipitor are the 2 that are crazy.  And the Advair, too.  That's, like, almost $300.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's all, all the new ones are higher [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh my gosh.  It's amazing.  It's been a crazy summer with the weather, hasn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Raining, rainy all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, just, cool.  It hasn't been really hot.  Which is fine with me, because I don't like it when it gets real hot, but, it's funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Makes me wonder about all that global warming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  [LAUGHING].  I wonder what winter is going to be like.  They said we're supposed to have a mild winter this winter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I think —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'll take it, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I'm going to get you some refills here for all your prescriptions.  Um, I'm going to write them for 3 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll see how the price comes out on the one with the Luvox CR and, you, you just let me know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  What do you think about that Michael Jackson business?  Isn't it amazing, all those medications that he was on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that there's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, somebody is in big trouble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doctor out there is going to be in big trouble, and it just reminds me —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How could even risk your —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not, not all doctors are good doctors.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How could you risk your license to do something like that?  Not even to mention the patient, putting him at risk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some people lose —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't un, for money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All about the money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For money.  You know?  It's sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is.  And it's a, it's at least a good answer for me when people start asking for more and more pills, and more and more narcotics, I can point to that and say, "That's not" —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "The kind of doctor I want to be."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you want, if you want all those kind of prescriptions, you need to go somewhere else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wouldn't even want to take all, you'd feel like crap all day.  I don't know how anybody could even walk around with all that in them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Addicts are addicts.</p>

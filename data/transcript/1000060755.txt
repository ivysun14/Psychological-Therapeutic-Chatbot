<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client 0518-014, client 0518-014 session number 14, session number 14, March 2, 1971, March 2, 1971.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. And you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know yet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just ran over. I just saw Madison for the first time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, the library, right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The mattresses and everything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's real nice. Because that's the only way I ever study. I mean I can't study in chairs. Every once in a while if there's a big enough, you know, arm chair to curl in I can do it but I just always like do it on my bed. It's real nice to have those mattresses. It's real different too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I imagine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I like it better than Bobst a whole bunch. Bobst is just too vast to deal with, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's pretty good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyway. How are you doing? You sound like that there's something that you..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was feeling bad and then I talked to someone who made me feel better and so I'm a little preoccupied. I feel reasonably good. Not too preoccupied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you have a good week, and ok weekend? Did you get done being scared? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the weekend got a little freakier. Like one night we went out, Sunday night we went out for Jen's birthday. 0:02:08.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And after, it was a nice it was a nice place. After dinner we went to a nice place on the West side and then came back. And I wanted to take a drive. And so I just took a drive. And left everybody else and took a drive. And you know I always park my parent's car in their parking lot behind their apartment building and then walk home because it's only like four blocks right down fifty-fifth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just had this very eerie feeing in the parking lot when I returned the car at two in the morning. And I decided, I started to get out of the car and I decided that I wouldn't. That I would leave it near my house instead and they would be able to figure it out or something. And I got, I drove it home and got back. And my roommates were all like watching the window like super worried because somebody had been shot at my parents, in the back place of that parking lot that I had just been in about an hour and a half before. Just like, I was just like, I just you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of weird that you had that funny feeling. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not surprised and I do that a whole lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have premonitions? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well right. I mean things are like, there's been something eerie going, if you're there then it's, the air is still like weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not, I mean I think it can always like be explained once they learn more stuff about it. Thing like that would be obvious if you were being all paranoid. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyway. But I'm ok right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm so excited I'm not being super crazy. I just like will refrain from walking around a lot alone at night. 0:04:04.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really a few things have been happening with Holly and me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like all through this whole thing I've really been unable to be helpful to her. And it's not because I haven't wanted to be. But it's just like whenever I'm with her we react in this funny way. When something happens, it's not good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Some kind of friction almost. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Some kind of just not getting it, you know. The gears not being together or something. And it really has been upsetting me. And it's been like that you know since the whole thing happened. And before it a little bit. I was being very spaced with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It really hurts that in her like time of need I can't be close to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's..</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I, she feels, we like talked about it for a really short time yesterday. And she said that she hasn't really thought about it. Because it's like one additional hassle that she doesn't want to have to deal with. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was like, that's how come I haven't brought it up for all this time. Because I didn't want to have to say, "Holly what's going on?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she has so many other things to put her energy towards. Figuring out a, but I still just feel very badly that we're not..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes I just have this funny feeling like why (inaudible at 0:05:26.1) I mean I'm there in as much as I you know I want to be there for her. But I'm just not, I'm doing all the wrong things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not, it's not even so blatantly I'm saying the wrong things that are hurting her that I'm doing the wrong things. It's just like some very subtle not hitting it off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah like you'll say something that won't quite be helpful. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I'll just, or I'll, it's not even, sometimes it's that. Sometimes it's just a particular way of being right. Sometimes you just like see each other and it just makes both of you happy and you like play it right, you know? 0:06:05.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it just hasn't been good at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't make each other happy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I don't understand what I'm doing. I mean I know it's partly her too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it's, that we're, when we're together we're doing these things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To each other that aren't quite good. But I can't get to, I can't understand why. It seems really important for me to understand it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you doing to her? What is she doing to you? Maybe we can pull it apart a little. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'm self-conscious now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either it hasn't been good so the things I say are self-conscious. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In this. Maybe that's what I feel like I'm worrying about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Wanting to be her friend. Wanting to be close to her more than, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could see how that would not work. Like you said noticing each time whether you're being close to her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe that's part of it. And also she just has a certain bit of annoya, where she like will get annoyed or. It's not even exactly annoyed. Sometimes it's annoyed but sometimes it's just like a little..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Frustration or irritation? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like she has this distance there right? And we both get aggravated at the distance too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And we don't, I don't know, she doesn't know what it is either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not, it's not quite like ordinary being aggravated at each other, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. It's not, it's not. And the thing is it's very, it's very subtle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 0:08:02.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's nothing, it's just not at all blatant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what subtle means. But I mean it's like, it's not like she'll say, "Oh Stacy." Or I'll just say, "Well, good-bye Sarah." It's just, it's nothing determined like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like malaishly not quite right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like I'm scared now so that I can't commit that. But it's really making me feel terrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just really would want to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like now of all times you want to be able to come through for her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I don't, the thing is all the intention is there right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I, but somehow, and I'm really surprised because usually I would think that you know like in the hard times I would be able to come through for somebody that I cared for. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's been, it's never happened for me that it hasn't worked that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That when the nitty gritty is there right, I'm really there too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what's so strange is it's not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's very just it's very disconcerting. And very icky. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess a lot of it must be I'm self conscious. About it now. In general I wonder if things seem more forced with people? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:09:55.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really bothering me. I don't know. 0:10:15.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not just Holly, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe in a way. That's it. I guess I feel like I have to prove myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To almost everybody. Because like I'm very aware like at home Jen's really touchy. I really like Jen's, just a whole lot. She's very touchy. And really moody. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not just all right with Jen. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not ever simply all right with Jen. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And she's very different than a lot of my friends. Like I don't know where lots of her moods come from. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel a lot different than her. So it's harder to key in to where she is. And so I'm usually like making sure that what I say and seeing how it affects her to see what kind of mood she's in and what I can..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if she's going to be like wanting to be alone and I should bug off. Or if she's like tense and wants to play you know whatever it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, Diane I'm always trying to make sure that it's good with. Always. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it has been ok. She hasn't been making me feel dumb. I haven't been making myself feel dumb around her. But I know with Carmen I'm not comfortable. And I'm not comfortable with Betsy. And I could never for sure always count on Jen. 0:12:19.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, it's like you haven't got any relationships where, you know you can come home and relax and if you're feeling bad they'll take care of you and like it's all, you can relax. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everything's a little...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. There's none that I, well I think with Andrea in a way. With Andrea and with Cathy. Cathy and I almost always have a good time. Make each other feel good. But it's just like basically all the relationships that I consider close really aren't close. And I'm really not completely comfortable in them. I can't just like sit around and be me and think it's ok. I'm pretty worried about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's strange. That's true at this point. Wow, that's really too bad. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Isn't it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like it's different than that usually. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually you feel more comfortable? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well somewhat more comfortable than I am now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Guess that's what's so shaky about Holly and me. Is that like she's about to go away too. 0:14:00.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: She's going away on Saturday. We don't like have any time to patch it up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really scared that she's going to go away and that we're going to have kinda soured a bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. I know that in her head she'll say well, it was just something that was going on right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that Stacy and I are still good friends and that, you know I know that we'll both do that in our heads. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Anyway because we've both been very reassuring to each other about how close we are. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that we'll be friends for a long time. And that her going away doesn't mean that. But I'm just like scared in my head and that in her head that neither of us want to admit to something a little bit (inaudible at 0:14:51.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it doesn't have to be forever. It's just like I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just like that maybe. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess I don't understand it because it you know, this is when she needs people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah you can't really condone at all what the icky part is. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I can't. No I can't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aside from that thing when you were studying that started it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. I forgot about that. It was back then too. It like it was a whole week. Right, and that has, I understand that kind of. I understand how I like put myself in a subordinate position then. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:16:16.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Asked so many things that, you know I understand that, And it's not quite that. It doesn't feel that inequal now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just feels like we're missing each other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And some of it is because like she doesn't have anybody that she can send back to me. I mean she's really just, she's really not emoding and she's not being helpful to anybody else because she has so much to think about. And that's like makes sense right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because this whole thing has happened to her. And she's about to have to go away to Sarah Lawrence and basically [I'm doing the] (ph) school meeting people and she's like definitely (overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't have anything left over for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right or for anybody. So I guess maybe a lot of it, for anything, for it to be good right she has to really help give stuff to me too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somehow maybe I don't have enough to reach all the way just to her. Maybe I don't know her that well or something. To be able to say the right things. I don't know. I just, I just saw her before I came here and it was just another one of those weird things. (inaudible at 0:18:08.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound kind of discouraged and tired. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah I haven't gotten hardly any sleep at night. You know I just have, there isn't like a whole lot I can do. And I have to decide what to do next quarter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's just like in the back of my mind at all times. Not knowing what I'm going to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And Jen's moving out. So I'd have to live with Tanya and Diane. And that would be just terrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've got all that to cope with too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've got all that to cope with. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah maybe, maybe, maybe I also wanted, maybe I also wanted Holly's help or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we help each other think out things. That's what we've been doing all quarter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe, maybe somewhere I'm like disappointed that she didn't, she can't help me do any of the head thinking that I've got to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's what I'm saying that from up here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rather than down here right now. So I don't know if it's true. But it probably is. Yeah, I do feel tired. I feel kinda like, I don't know. I felt like an old woman this morning .So I went home and took a shower. I decided I'd start the day all over again. I just got back in town about an hour ago. I washed my hair and put on bright colors. And I felt better for a little while. And then I just sat there and..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:20:26.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Decided to clean up a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) Clean up a little. That's cute. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't cope with all that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't cope with all that. All that stuff. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I don't know what to do with any of it. And I'm doing, you know and I'm doing lots of bad things again. I even forget about the way I'm feeling like I was just like (inaudible at 0:21:20.3). Like this guy Rodney Candis who lives in Madison and is a friend of my sister's who likes me. I know that he does. And he's really nice. And he came down and visited. He hadn't seen his mother in about a year and a half. He came down and she lives (inaudible at 0:21:42.3) and he came down to visit her. I think he also came down to see me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'd put it off all weekend long. He wanted to take me back up to his mother's place and spend the weekend just walking around (inaudible at 0:21:54.2). I didn't want to do it. So finally I just, he came in Sunday before he left to go back to Madison. And I know that he's for some reason really sexually turned on to me and he's like a very, he's like a really nice person but I get completely scared away because... But then, like I also just have this feeling like I have to prove my sexuality or something. Because I didn't sleep with him or anything. It was just like, well it was like high school making out with somebody on Sunday afternoon. 0:22:32.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like, and it's very scary because I can, it's very scary when I can get somebody all excited and really be so removed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I don't know why I do it either. Because I know that somewhere I really don't want to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But somehow, I mean it wasn't even anything big right. Just, I'm just sitting there kissing somebody but it was like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that I wasn't into it. And I know that I can pretend like I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then somehow, but then I get really revolted you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I can be that dishonest. And that somebody else can believe me and that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just that I do it, right? And that I'm doing it and I you know was not doing that for like a really long time so I wouldn't go to my head where it is. I was just like was doing it again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And that's a, you know in some ways it's a little thing but it makes you disgusted with yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then the other thing is I keep on meeting all these freshman boys. These really sweet lovely exuberant...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very androgynous freshman boys that I've just like got this call to disappoint all these really lovely freshmen boys and I don't know what I'm doing. (chuckles) I just start, and I like them a, you know I don't know. And it's like I know something screwy is going on. Just I'm actually upset because I'm, you know like I'm only 18. But I, I'm just 18 but I'm you know pretty old for my age in some ways. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:24:24.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I keep on thinking these boys are very young for their age. You know like very interesting poetic types. And all very beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Defining yourself a little suspiciously there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I do know. I mean there's something obviously that I'm avoiding, right? I don't know. I don't know. Just I, at first, like when I first meet, some that I've met in the library I work with one guy that's real nice. And another I just met because he's real beautiful and he springs across campus and (inaudible at 0:25:38.4) And I couldn't, it could be nice if I knew where I stood by it. I mean if I could like be sure it was just because they were people that they were nice people that I liked them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But somehow that they're these androgynous freshman boys..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just seems like it's a big part of who they are and has something that I haven't' figured out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you aren't really liking them as individual people you happened to meet. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no that's not true. Again, the way I'm saying it sounds like what you were about to say. But I don't think that's true. I don't think it's, I think that's not exactly what I mean because individually each one is like important and that's how come I like them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's also just that they all end up being freshman boys. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Seems to me..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And some of it probably is because there aren't that many nice guys left who are older. Because lots of people leave her. But it also seems that, it almost seems like I'm avoiding a much more equal heterosexual relationship with somebody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like taking these really wonderful people who I spend my time with but all the time with being inequal now I feel really older in a bunch of ways. I mean sexually attractive but also sexually non threatening right? At the same time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Like they don't make demands on you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they are and aren't you know. But sometimes like a lot easier to deal with. It's not as demanding. It's just not as sexually centered in a way. 0:28:02.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's much more like walking to see the sunrise in the morning, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Do you like not being pushed? </p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is, the thing about liking not being pushed is that I always end up pushing myself a lot. Like with Rodney. Like he, I very deliberately. He wanted to like see me Saturday and take me back to his mother's house. So I would have ended up spending Saturday night and I probably would, can't go to sleep with somebody at their mother's house but it just would have been all this many more night things to have to handle, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I wouldn't do it and finally I like arranged it so that he had to leave at eight o'clock Sunday to get back to Madison and I saw him at about, I met him at four. So we had four hours to just like take a nice walk and stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And we did and I was like just very carefully keeping my like sexual distance and went outside and bought a thing for Jen and stuff. And then for some reason I like felt compelled. And it was not so much, it wasn't so much that I, I mean there was also pressure from him to be that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To be like sexual instead of just like playing. You know (inaudible at 0:29:39.6) walking around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But something in you..</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could have, I could have somehow chosen to avoid it. I mean because I was, I'm very good at avoiding stuff right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't. And I find that I do that a lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You let yourself get into it. 0:29:59.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And almost in a very ego way. With him it was a completely ego way in that I just know he's really sexually turned on to me. And I don't quite understand it. And I obviously don't respect it a whole bunch. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It has something a little bit fascinating about seeing that he is all that turned on? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. Not quite. Because I usually get kind of upset by it. Well lots of times I don't even get upset. I just don't feel anything. That's even worse, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because then I don't even, there's no like even perverse enjoyment in it, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like blah. It's just like somehow I'm programmed to act like. I don't understand. Sometimes I just can say I really just want to find one really wonderful young man. You know and just like for the first time something that I'm sure of and that's sexually (inaudible at 0:31:35.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that I'm not running and doing all these crazy things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I want to be protected from myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Someone you like enough to keep you out of temptation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And that's the thing. That's the thing that's like most important. I guess that's why like, like, I mean the guys that I like are these guys that I have been attracted to as friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:32:05.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's like just so much more important to me. And that when any like love relationship would have to be based on was first being like more a friend than even sexually attracted to a person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because without really like just digging them as a person there's just no way, I mean just completely, there' s just like no way for me to handle the sexual part without then. Because whenever I do kinda like a person and then get into any kind of sexual thing then I just really don't like them as much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Ok. You have this sort of uncomfortable feeling of not knowing quite what you're doing and not really understanding either. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's also a funny thing that I, you know it doesn't, and the thing is I'm very surprised that is that I'm aware of all these things that make me more uncomfortable and more unhappy with myself then I do them anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. That sort of, like knowing you're too heavy and eating potato chips or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Right. A very good high school example. (chuckles) You're funny sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've just been eating a lot of potato chips lately. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you feel too fat?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you feel too fat? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you feel kind of, yeah? Everybody does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Everybody does. I've been doing that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 0:34:01.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: The worse off I feel about my body the more I always eat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To comfort myself about how I feel. (chuckles) I think it's a Jewish tradition or something. I don't know. What can I do about all this stuff? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Yeah that's the damn thing about being able to control yourself. I mean it really, you know it's sort of funny but with the potato chips but it's really like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it really is. It really is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the way you're getting sort of disgusted with yourself because you know you're doing it anyway. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. It's like, exactly what it's like. And I don't know what to do. And I can't discipline myself to do my schoolwork. I mean it's just like all together lack of getting it together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know that I feel better when I do my work. I know that I'm just like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I just, and there's nobody there who's losing but me. And I'm doing it anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not doing my work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doing things I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean too standard to all over the place. I just don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you got any one big thing on your mind? Some big anxiety or something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably what I'm going to do. 0:36:01.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why did you ask?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was thinking about when I felt that way. Like at loose ends and stuff like that and it seems to me that sometimes it's been because, I'm never sure but sometimes there's something I can't face or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the thing is I don't, when I get this way I'm not even sure what's at the bottom of all the crud.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it just kinda..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like running around to keep yourself afloat or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I know there's like, but I think I'm mostly not thinking. The only time I remember to talk about what I'm going to, you know worry about even say what I'm going to do next quarter is when I'm here with you. And all the time it's like not thinking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it's so hard to face. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like so enormous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not knowing what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah I just like have no idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't even begin to figure it out because I feel like I don't have any criteria for figuring it out. Because I don't really know where I am so I don't know what would be good for me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I don't have enough. Most of the time you know that you're feeling icky and tight assed and you shouldn't be in the city any more. So you should get yourself out to the country. But I don't even know how it is that I'm feeling right, I don't.. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:38:01.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I can't tell what would be right, better for me to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: My voice just sounded very all of a sudden, you know sometimes how you say no and all of a sudden you just kind of hear an instant replay of the last..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your voice sounds. It just sounds like I was being very whiney.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just occurred to me it must be really a drag for somebody to come in here and whine at you for an hour. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't, you know. You didn't sound whiney to me when you said that. I think I know what, it's kinda, it's sort of like the same thing like you can't stand yourself for not getting more of a grip on it. Something's too weak, too flabby, too placid. (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Those are really powerful words. Flabby and placid like this will. Oh no. But I also just want to figure some of this out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How do people learn things in therapy if you don't tell them? (chuckles) Oh this is going, it's going to do something bad I'm sure. 0:40:14.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like if you just had something firm to start with that would help. Instead of just looking around and there isn't anything. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really a queen at looking around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You want to do something that's good for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I also just want to do something that will make me happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're tired of being (inaudible at 0:41:30.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this, I mean this quarter I really thought I was going to get myself I was only going to take one course.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And do my thing (inaudible at 0:41:37.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And finish up all my incompletes. That was really going to be good for me and then I'd be able to leave this place with a..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Clean slate. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Clean slate and </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And time to do things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do stuff and you know and be able to transfer when and if I wanted to and you know. And I set everything exactly so that I could have a lot of time to deal with my incompletes. And I haven't done a single fucking incomplete. I haven't even thought, I mean today was the first day I started feeling guilty about it. 0:42:06.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I started feeling guilty last week. I started doing Gentleman's (ph) thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just like haven't done anything. I've started losing faith that I'm like capable of doing it, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really do feel like this quarter my parents say, "Well, what happened to you this quarter?" You know what? And I'd say well I wasn't able to do it. And they don't understand those words. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean you weren't able to do it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really not in their comprehension that somehow I really feel like I've been unable to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But somewhere else in me I have the same amount of comprehension that they do because..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know we've built my image up into having a very strong super ego and you know I don't. I haven't gotten it done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Do you tell yourself like, "What do you mean? You've been fucking around all quarter. there's no reason. There's no excuse for that." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not even so much fucking around because fucking around kinda sets you up with a choice to do something other than fuck around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I see what you mean, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But somehow I just haven't..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you haven't..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doing that. I wasn't..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't have the energy or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I may be over..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lack organization or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, more organization. Like do it. And if I can't do things that are going to make me feel better, that are going to be good for me then you know it's just like you know like that's what one would think that one would want to do. 0:44:11.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially if I had set it up as a goal and especially if I'm aware of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then to still not do it with having set it up and planned a whole three month period of my life around doing it and then I just don't even think of doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like who am I kidding? What am I doing? You know and then I have all these outrageous feelings about it. I'll every week or two in the past you know and then I would never do anything about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you get all mad at yourself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like usually Tuesdays after class, after my one class. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's a really good class. I always think wow, I just really want to read the material ahead of time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that I'll know what they're, so I'll be able to like join in the discussion. Because I'm obviously not too dumb to talk, you know. Or too dumb to think of things to offer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And every Tuesday I say that to myself. And I've never gotten the reading done. I've started to get part of the reading done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like today I read you know about 60 out of 150 pages. But I never just get it all tied up, really done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except for when we read Baudelaire. That was just poetry. And I really, and I've read a lot of Baudelaire anyway. But it's you know, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's so frustrating to decide to do something and then not to have any control over whether it happens or not. And I mean it makes you, talk about feeling untogether. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What do you, what do I do? How can I get it together? Tell me. 0:46:04.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I wish I could. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is that, and the thing about being untogether is that it's very, it's still like this unspecified and kind of ambiguous condition. Doesn't like, lots of times like Gentleman's (ph) favorite example. Like he says if you're hot it means that you want to be cooler. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He says a person that, you say "I'm hot." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're (inaudible at 0:46:33.7) But saying I'm untogether doesn't hold in it the answer of how to get together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. That's interesting. I mean it says like you want to, to me it says you want to be more organized. You want to have firmer boundaries. You want to be clear about what's you and what isn't you. You want to be more compact and in one place. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt good for you to be, hearing you say this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Say it because then it, right, because now you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's nice to, it's nice that you like know enough to know what it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe when I was saying it, it also sounded like a bit more possible. Just hearing it said too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. How come? That's true. That's true. Yeah. 0:48:05.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least someone knows what I'm trying to do. At least you know more articulately. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is I've started to feel like they're not just merely developmental things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. They're something that has to be manually got together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean not something like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'll wait around and like it will come to you but it's something you have to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And some things like, like I remember being consumed with this feeling of not knowing where myself was and a much bigger way than I am now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's always going to be a theme in my life but it was just I couldn't function almost. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that just kinda gradually got to be less of a question. I don't know how it happened. That I kinda grew into feeling like I knew a little bit more about who I was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's certainly still not anywhere near answered, right? But it's just not as consuming. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But that' s like a developmental thing almost. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just like nothing particular that I did. It's just like living longer. And going more places and having more things happen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well maybe like, like let's suppose you're right. Like maybe there's, you have to do something. Like is there any particular, specific thing that would make you more compact or that would tie into you or give you a boundary, make your will effective? Maybe I don't know. Like those are metaphors but like they ought to apply to something. 0:50:10.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah I know. Right. Those are exactly the things I looking to be able to.. The thing is it seems like my not doing my school work and stuff is like, and not getting that pragmatic part of it together seems like only a manifestation of my, of me who I really am. The nonacademic, just the person who like is kinda still undefined and not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of like somehow I just really think of Carmen. Who with Carmen I feel the least, because Carmen I really like but I've talked to her least of any of the people that I would possibly become close to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think whenever I'm around her I have these intense feelings of being fliberty-jibberty. You know just laaaa. And kinda in inane and somehow I'm feeling like the most important thing is the psychological thing and but and I don't know how to attack it on that level. Instead of, I guess probably, maybe if I just did actions right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That were together actions. Like if I could clean up all those incompletes and things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that would, maybe it would effect it and become kinda for real. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I'm saying? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But everything's kinda been one way. There's actions and there's my head. 0:52:03.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And the actions only are manifestations of where my head is at. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. For some reasons I want to you know stop and say this. I mean it's just what you just but I want to say it anyway. That not doing, not getting your incompletes done is like some, a perfect expression of where your head is at. Like you're, it would be sort of alien to actually sit down at a desk and work and be organized. Because that's not where, your head is all vague and sort of lost and confused. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's exactly what I've been feeling all quarter. But the thing is like to get out of it what do I do? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Your starting out the idea like..</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I don't know which comes first the chicken or the egg. Can I like, do I have to get myself together before I sit down and do it or maybe if I sit down and start do it I'll get together because I'm doing it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'd really like to know. And it just feels, I've just been feeling basically what you said that it just seems so I can't get, you know my shit isn't together in my head so I can't..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Can't really think of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. I guess like sitting down and doing it sounds so mechanical somehow. Or the thing is like if there were something you could do that would sort of reach back into your head a little more. Like you, what do I mean by that? I mean like something like, it's like something that would be organized but something that you could also be clear on why you wanted to do it. 0:53:52.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. Or to want to, I guess the thing is it's, it's also something that I don't really want to do. I know that in, also it would be good to get my incompletes done. It would make me feel better because it's just this achievement. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? But none of the work that I have to do is any kind of work that I feel that interest in learning. Not interested in doing that much scholastic work period. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So it just seems like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like a drudgery or something. It's not, it ought to be something that you value for itself. And you don't at the moment. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I might be fooling myself with that. I might be like, I might be an all grand rationalization. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because when I think about it none of the work that I have to do is, it's not like a chemistry paper or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, you know I have to write a literature paper on either (inaudible at 0:55:15.5) And they're like things that I've been interested in before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're interesting papers, it's just that you're not interested now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. What's that sound like? It sounded like something kinda familiar but I don't know what it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like a bird. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought of something more romantic like some kind of old shepherd on the hillside. 0:56:04.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A shepherd (inaudible at 0:56:07.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the last thing that I (inaudible at 0:56:13.0) too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's why there is a shepherd.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible at 0:56:25.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)it's going to be lovely (inaudible at 0:56:34.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I get it done. (chuckles) Are you ever this bad? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm a little, lately I'm a little bit where you are. I'm also having a (inaudible at 0:56:52.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: How are you solving it? Or can you let yourself be untogether or? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. (inaudible at 0:57:12.9) It's like it's, I'm getting a bad enough conscious at the end of the quarter that I'm starting to work a little. I'm starting to get interesting in the work. But I don't, I'm certainly no doing, I mean I haven't found any little keys to pass along. Want to talk on Thursday? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah actually, I guess that's fine. Oh no, I work from 1:30 to 3:00. How about, [do you have Thursday?] (ph) I mean on Wednesday? Or later? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about, maybe we could do it at 12:30. How would that be? </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine. 12:15 maybe? That way I could get that extra.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:58:45.4</p>

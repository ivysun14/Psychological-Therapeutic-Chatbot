<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) I, I keep finding I, I don't know how many other things I'd come across, that I'd prefer to think about, but uhm, I had started out by thinking of Friday.  And it, I had been thinking about the fact that I had a dream, I had I think, a number of dreams, but one I remember enough to know that in it, uh, in some way I, I felt pursued by my obstetrician, Dr BBB, and that at this point he wanted to give me more attention than I wanted to have from him.  And so that I was sort of always trying to run away from him.  </p>
 
<p>And, I, I was just thinking when I got in here, that that dream came after MSCZ and I'd made love.  And it was a situation where I didn't feel the same conflict that I'd described the night or two before that.  And it wasn't a completely successful thing for me, but I went into it wanting to do it more than sometimes I've felt.  And, and then I had I think, a number of dreams, and that was one.  </p> 
 
<p>But then I started thinking about, instead of thinking about Friday, and, and some of the things that were really bothering me then, or seemed very important, uhm, I started thinking about my bras, and how when I bought them I didn't know exactly what it was I wanted, because I did—, I guess I hadn't bought a new bra, except for things I needed when I was pregnant and then nursing, for quite some time before that.  And uh, anyway, styles have changed a lot, and then now I was just thinking I am still not sure I like what I got, but I have a better idea of what I'd like to get.  Except now, I've gotten what I'm going to get.</p>

<p>And the other thing that I found that I kept want to — well I just started thinking of it, but it seemed, it was the kind of thing I could tell, I could think of more easily.  Uhm, yesterday we went out to the DBJ, they have a house in the country.  Uhm, there was another couple there that we've met before, through them.  And, well I'd met, we've met, MSCZ and I've met the girl even the time before that, when she came over — she and her husband were living in Paris, then — she came over once on a trip by herself, and with her young son.</p> 
 
<p>And both that time and then the time we met this girl and her husband for the first time, MSCZ and I were not sure how we felt about them.  And uh, I don't know, whether or not we liked them.  And then, yesterday when we saw them again, they were more likeable to us, but I felt, I felt critical of her in a way that I could tell it was not just to do with her, I don't know.  But I was talking about it with MSCZ wh—, after we left, and sort of wondering why I'd feel competitive with her.  Because I, that's the only thing I could decide it was.  And there were 2 other women there, FDB and then another friend.  And I didn't feel the same way about either of them. </p>  
 
<p>And MSCZ said, well, she felt very comp—, competitive with you.  And just now when I was thinking of it, I was thinking of, she made, I think maybe I felt the way I did before she made those comments.  But she did make some comments early enough after we got there, so that it was clear how she was feeling toward me, right away.  And uhm, I, I, don't know, I think maybe what I'm thinking about now more is, how did I come out in this competition between the two of us.  (3-minute silence)</p>

 
<p>Mm, I was just thinking now, uhm, the thing that was bothering me most on Friday that I did think about over the weekend occasionally, and how even though thinking about that feeling of competition with this girl I met yesterday — I saw her again — uhm, and which was not a pleasant sensation to me at the time, it seems like a very pleasant subject, I guess, to think about, compared to the thing I was thinking about from Friday.  Uhm, of thinking about not coming, and this feeling I have of not wanting to even think about not coming.  And being frightened by the thought. </p>  
 
<p>And when I thought about it over the weekend, I guess I was trying to imagine what I'd do, if I didn't, just so it wouldn't be so frightening.  And uh, because I don't know if that's exactly why it is frightening.  But, I b—, I kept getting the feeling of somehow if I weren't coming here, then I don't know, I wouldn't have an excuse, and I don't know exactly how that works.  But then I'd have to become something, or uhm, well it seems like it's almost, I wouldn't have the excuse of, oh, I really don't have time for any number of things that I can think I could be doing for a fuller life.  And then I think, well, I don't have time, because I'm coming here.  (2-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>And I also began thinking of uhm, i—, I suppose, in a way I was thinking of it, again, I'm coming here, so I may not have time, but I wasn't exactly, because as soon as I, that occurred to me, and then I, I thought well, naturally, I could work things out, so it wouldn't have to be this way.  But my instinct was to immediately think of it first, as I'm coming here, so I won't have time.   </p>
 
<p>FNI called this morning to say that she had given my name to a neighbor of hers who has a daughter who's having reading problems, and I, they sound fairly severe from what FNI said.  And the woman was calling partly to just in—, ask me about ITA, and some things like that.  And then FNI said, "And I also suggested that you might want to tutor her."  And she told me somewhere early enough in, in telling me about this, that the girl was eleven.  Which is right in the middle of the 2 ends I've taught at, so that my immediate feeling was, well I don't know anything about that.  And uhm, I don't know, instead of just hearing what FNI had to say, and then thinking about it, and dealing with the call when I got it, it was almost as if I started arguing with FNI on what I knew and what I didn't know.   </p>
 
<p>And uhm, I don't know, I came away annoyed at myself that I took sort of an argumentative position.  And I, and it seems similar to what I did when FNI called to say that she'd given my name to the person connected with ZCC, over the job, that uh, when they were looking for somebody.  That then too, I sort of argued.  Only then I was arguing on, I really didn't see how I'd h—, I could put that much time in, right now.  But uhm, (Sniff, Sigh, 5-minute silence)</p> 
 
<p>I don't know, I was just thinking of the contrast between, the ambivalent feelings I've had about both that job at ZCC, and then, thinking about tutoring this girl.  Uh, I ha—, I still have not received the call from her parents, so they may have already worked something else out, I don't know.  And my feeling is, mainly anyway, I'm not qualified, if she really does have a problem.  But still have a very ambivalent feeling, I think, about whether I want to do it, or not.  And I don't know, it seems like almost I want to, but then when I think of the amount of work involved, or what I would consider necessary, that's when I decide I don't want to.  I, I don't know what it is exactly that I'm (Sigh) —  </p>
 
<p>Well anyway, in, and then in contrast to that, I was just thinking of this morning.  Uhm, and maybe it was partly because I was thinking of this that, that I came to feel this way, I don't know.  But there have been a number of things that I didn't do last week that I wanted to do.  And then over the weekend, we were away from home longer than, ah, more time, especially yesterday we were away all day, which we hadn't counted on.  And so, some things I thought I could do yesterday, I, I didn't.  And some of them are things I was looking forward to, some more sewing that I wanted to do, and things like that.   </p>
 
<p>Yet uhm, I don't know, this morning I, I felt mostly that I was just sort of forcing myself to do anything, because I really was just sort of waiting around to come here.  And then, when I came here, I'd feel well, I'd accomplished something today, or  the day was complete.  Or I don't know, in some way, it wasn't necessary to do anything else.  And yet that was disturbing me, too.  But it's, to have that feeling, i, it seems like that's the absolute contrast to thinking of doing anything extra, like the tutoring that — especially if I tutored this girl, I'd have to learn quite a bit.  And so that it would mean a lot more work for me, instead of just tutoring somebody in first grade that w—, I know much more about.  And uhm — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, what strikes me is that another contrast between how much you dwell on this problem in contrast to how quickly you passed over uh, the dream that you had, and your experience with MSCZ.  Which, although you say you weren't in conflict, still you didn't feel was successful, whatever that means.  There really is a contrast between how you're preoccupied with should you tutor the girl or not, and the amount of work involved, and so on.  And completely neglecting the other, except to mention it.   </p>
 
<p>(Silence) I know, I think of uhm — a, and it seems like I'm using this girl now, which is, in effect, my thinking of going back to work, even though it would be a fraction of what I sometimes mean when I think of it.  But uhm, how sometimes I've been afraid of using work, in this way, and I've sensed it since I've stopped work.  Whenever I've started thinking, well maybe I really want to go back to work, that I'm running away from central problems.  And, I don't know, that I can throw myself into the work and not think about MSCZ.  And I can be then, too tired, and too busy, and uhm — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Right, I think that's all true.  And I think you're thinking about it now, is the same idea.   </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  (2-minute silence) Well I don't, I was just thinking of this way of running away from the subject, that I keep having.  And how on Friday I got very concerned about just thinking of not coming anymore, and the fact that I was feeling then very much, if I resolve problems with MSCZ, that would be central to my then beginning to feel I didn't need to come.  And uhm, and then I got all involved just in feeling afraid about not coming.  And I don't know, now when I think of it, a, and I think just in terms of this running away from the subject, I don't see quite why I do.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Well, regardless of why you do, you still are.  Really, see what's happened is that uh, you really haven't said anything more about the dream.  So your very preoccupation served to keep you from it.   </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) Well, I just can't remember anything more about the dream.  Mm, I get the feeling now, which I don't know if it's the feeling I had at the time, uhm, well I even get vague on, was it really Dr. BBB, except that was the one thing at the time I settled on.  But now I'm thinking, it could have been you, it could have been my father.  And that there was something very much mixed in feeling sought after, I guess, by him in a way, in a way that was both fatherly, and, and, and that was as a lover, too.  And uhm, that I was running away, or getting away, or uhm, rejecting.  I don't know exactly what it was.   </p>
 
<p>And that, I think in the dream, I didn't want these attentions, and yet I, I don't think I minded that whoever it was, I, I think I made it be Dr BBB, but it might, I don't know, I don't know, it was almost as if I wanted those feelings to be there.  And then to say, well, I don't feel the need to respond to them.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Well, that's pretty much what you do with MSCZ, isn't it?   </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I was just thinking that.   </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   You tease him, you attract him, you want him to find you interesting.  But you uh, also want to thwart him, frustrate him, keep him out of the bedroom, make it unattractive to him.   </p>
 
<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) N—, r—, I'm thinking of something that I, I don't feel confused, except it seems like something is confused in my feelings.  Uhm, and because I was remembering on Friday, feeling that somehow if I talked about the problems with MSCZ and worked them out, then it would take me from you to him.  And that I had the two of you very separate, and feeling that you were good, and he was bad, or that I felt good feelings toward you and destructive feelings toward him.  And uhm, I don't know, th, thinking about the dream that made me feel well, that I've mixed him up with you.  And thinking now, that this is the way I felt toward MSCZ, makes me feel, think my feelings are very mixed up, there.   </p>
 
<p>And I, uhm, I don't know, I think what, well (Pause) I guess maybe I am feeling confused, even thinking about it.  Because it seems like I'm thinking about both sometimes the, well the fact I can fantasize about you here, and uh think about making love, and so forth.  And, and yet, a, and I'm thinking that, sometimes with MSCZ, I'm thinking very much that I want to be able to make love with him, and feeling very frustrated when things don't work out.  But there is very definitely this other side of teasing him, and then rejecting him, or pushing him away and thinking violent things, too, which I talked about here recently.  And, as if I really am denying all those feelings.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>Well, the 2 feelings seem so very opposite.  And then I end up, I guess, thinking I'm not sure what my feelings are.  And that's what is confusing.  (3-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>Well, I started thinking again of the girl yesterday, and this feeling of competition between us, which I, I, I guess, at least there I know exactly what my feelings were.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   And if you don't know something for certain, that's reason to be quiet and silent here?  Do you think in a way, what you've been doing today is part of the same process of teasing me, and then frustrating?  Mentioning the dream and all that it might mean, and then some circumstances about something different with MSCZ, but without really exploring that at all.  So, it's kind of the same thing.  An invitation, and then frustrating it totally.   </p>
 
<p>(2-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

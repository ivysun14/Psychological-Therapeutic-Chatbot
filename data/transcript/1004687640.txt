<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(inaudible noises)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hold on one second.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I have this... It's actually not how I said I rushed over ... So, there's this staff chat list which ... (PAUSE) ... it's interesting in many ways. It's supposed to be kind of you know, a ways for all staff to be able to chat with each other across the whole e-mail (inaudible at 00:56).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think you've mentioned that before. [00:00:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so what happened is usually it's just like a little bit of chatter and then this women who had also been college roommates with [inaudible] posted this kind of amazing like, "Dear Transition Team: These are four points I want you to clarify." And she was retiring anyways so she was just like, "I don't give a fuck." (LAUGHTER) It was kind of amazing. It was polite but it was still like ... and they sort of responded and she was like, "You didn't answer all these questions." And then there was no further response.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's this one person who works in the science wing who (PAUSE) just, all she like, if anyone argues or disagrees with her she gets really angry, starts insulting them and says how everyone involved in the transition has been really incredible. She doesn't understand why anyone has anything negative to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyone who has anything to say is a horrible, terrible stupid person. (PAUSE) And it's kind of like, "Alright well that's, if that's your tack (ph) I guess..." Do what you gotta do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also a one person library so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's a department library.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. I See.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And honestly, it's amazing that she didn't get laid off. Because that library will probably be gotten rid of, gotten rid of because they're not very necessary anymore. So, someone had posted to this list about an article that just came out about the idea of having more conversational communication in the workplace and how it's really important to have bottom up communication not just top down. And, the first response was like, "Ugh, I hope transition is such a ... like basically they're jerks. I wish they would do this." [00:03:03]</p>

<p>Because this library person lamed (ph) up a storm and also mentioned that we should be more polite because she has a master's. (PAUSE) Yeah, it's like, "Oh right." So that kind of got ignored and then they wrote a response where I was like, "You know, It's a really interesting idea." Someone in comments, people were talking about it they linked to another article about fear in the workplace and why people don't speak up and which is all about like you know. It's all well and good to try and have a conversation in the workplace but people have power over you, or your department, or your budget, or your whatever so people don't like to speak out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or speak up or whatever. And what was interesting though depressing was that the article was like, "Yeah, there's not a really a way to eliminate a culture of fear once it's been created. (LAUGHTER) The best you can do ... And I was like (inaudible at 3:59) The article was like, "This is depressing. P.S."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the best you can do is create pockets like managers can create like pockets of trust within their little fiefdoms, their groups and hopefully that can spread more or whatever but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're kind of screwed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I wrote to them I was like, "You know, blah blah blah, communication is great. I think this article, like you really need to pay attention to power dynamics and how that can affect things and then the other question is: If you spend time communicating upward, does anything happen? Like, you know, does anyone do anything about it? And you know (inaudible at 4:45), like, I'd be much more willing to spend time getting feedback if I thought someone did something (LAUGHTER) but if they're not I've got other things I can do. And so I got three private e-mails saying, "That's a really great response." I'm like, "Yeah, you're all scared of answering on the list." [00:05:05] (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>And then right as I was leaving this guy who's one of the new committee (ph) group heads came by and he was like, "I just read your e-mail" and I'm like, "I have to run!" Because it was like one o' clock and I had to stop by the library to drop something off so we walked by the way underground to Widener (ph). And he was just kind of like, "Oh you know. It's a really great e-mail. I've heard from a lot of people you know like that woman in (inaudible at 5:37) has a lot of things to say." And I was just like "Well, hmm, you know ..."</p>

<p>(inaudible at 5:47)</p>

<p>He had heard about me from multiple people in advance of him coming here and since there are like four black women working in the library it's pretty clear that one in the lot well two sort of. Then it's kind of like, "It's me. Yeah, it's just me." [00:06:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he also said... And so, it's interesting that people are talking about me. At first I was like, "Oh that's really cool," and then I thought, "God I really hope that it doesn't bite me in some way because I don't really trust (inaudible at 6:32) pretty much. (PAUSE) So we were talking and he was just like, "Oh, I really hope that you haven't felt any negative consequences and if you have you should tell me and (ph) like, and if you have, I want to talk to you some more about it." (PAUSE) [00:07:01]</p>

<p>I mean I've talked about this before but it's just, I get really torn between saying nothing and going crazy saying nothing. Like, I'm not doing the best at accepting that when asked for input the answer is, "We don't want your input." (PAUSE) You know, part of it is also people saying, "Oh you (inaudible) know the school is now going to be in transition you shouldn't just you know just because it happened that way in the past doesn't mean that it will now." I mean, I could believe that but you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there is always the pretence of interest, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah, they go through a lot of effort doing that and then criticizing staff for not being involved. I'm just like ... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:08:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, so last week one of just sort of attempt the disastrous transition look better they decided, the district team decided to redesign all the webpages into a big portal webpage where you go to like a main portal webpage and it gets them off to the libraries. And historically speaking, no one likes portal pages.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, they're very popular for like web designers like them and people who are in management always love them. But users usually don't want to use them becauseâ€”for a variety of reasons. They're confusing and poorly designed but also if you want to just go to your thing, like you're like, I just want to go look at the hours for the place. [00:09:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like twenty clicks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... And like they did one a while ago and the students refused until they made them use it in order to register. It was ... Because no one wanted it.</p>

<p>TRANSITION: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I gave the transition team that feedback. I was just like, " (inaudible at 9:27) project. Meh, meh." And so, a week ago (inaudible), they were like, "Can we have feedback on this new portal page that we're going to make like for like September 4, I guess, for the beginning of classes. And it's not ready. It's like a month or two from being ready.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Clicking on the hours doesn't work. The maps don't work. And it's very unclear if the test site just doesn't display that or if they just haven't like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 10:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so several people asked me, "Oh are you going to that webpage feedback?" No. I mean, I've given them my feedback and at this point if they're really rolling it out in a week and on time and my feedback is wait another month. And no one's going to care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't see why I should. And I got dirty looks from Karl and someone else. But like, you know ... It just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and that's not, those aren't the only reasons I think, not to do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean another one would be because you're incredibly sick and tired of being asked for your opinion, giving it, and being completely ignored.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I mean those are the reasons I was willing to articulate in a staff meeting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00::11] I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No really I want to do it. I was like, "Yeah." I am tired of spending time coming up with something and being ignored. Or even not spending time on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's tricky because like, I guess part of what I was thinking is that you know, you get a dirty look from Karl because you say something that makes you look like you have a bad attitude. But it's not actually because you don't want to be helpful it's because you've been burned 5 million times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it really sucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And his response weirdly often is that you should talk to your managers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of which he's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:11:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I'm always whenever he says that I just never... It's just the most surreal thing because he's like, "Don't talk to me but you should talk to me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and I hear so many people talking about how he's so affable and friendly. Which is true. He's generally a pretty affable guy. He always says yes. And some people sort of say that as an opening, "Oh you must like working for Karl because he's so friendly." And then I just don't usually say anything. Or I'm like, "Yeah. He's interesting to work for." You know. Yeah, like I really hate having a bad attitude about it. Like I hate having a bad attitude about like a bazillion things. (PAUSE) [00:12:49]</p>

<p>And yeah, it's because like I've tried the bazillion ways of communicating. And I was at the edge of having some, like I've had a couple of moments of like, "Wait. Am I having." I generally think of myself as being able to communicate well. I was having some moments of, "Oh my G. Maybe I am just a shitty communicator." And then I kind of pause and I'm like, "No. No. I'm pretty sure that was communicated clearly. (PAUSE)</p>

<p>And then, actually then a coworker criticized me for bad attitude recently which surprised me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And made me super freaked out for like four hours. There is this incredible box project.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I think you've mentioned the incredible box.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and everyone hates it and I decided that I would start putting ridiculous things in it like Machiavelli or Microsoft Encarta or books with like really weird like titles. If any library is within that age will have incredibly racist titles. [00:14:01]</p>

<p>So I was like, "Doo doo doo." And I found it sort of really satisfying and entertaining. But sometimes, a lot of times, the students don't scan the books they submit (ph). I made a mistake. Because they were like, "This is crap." "Yes. Scan it."</p>

<p>After about a dozen books I had dropped off hadn't gone in, I asked. I actually asked one of the staffers that I know. I'd been trying to do it completely honestly. And so she looked into it and figured out what was going on for me. So I stopped by at like 5 or closing and kind of made a crack about how I was really sad that they hadn't scanned in Microsoft Encarta when they scanned in two other terrible books. And my coworker was just like, "I just made an executive decision that that wasn't appropriate." I'm like, "Come on! You're not supposed to make that decision." (LAUGHTER) [00:15:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she said to me, "Don't you have anything better to do? Do you really have enough free time to just blah blah? "Yes." (LAUGHTER) But it also took me five minutes. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I'm sitting around with nothing to do. It's that, you know, searching the card catalogue for books that have incredible in the title really does take five minutes and Microsoft Encarta happens to be something I walk by every day and every day I'm just like, "Why is this book here?" Or this CD ROM collection really. But she was really kind of pissy about it. Like, "Why did you do this? Why are you wasting your time? Blah, blah, blah. Why are you ruining this project?" Everyone else thought it was hilarious. Her critique just made me (inaudible at 15:51) "Oh am I really a terribly person?" Like should I not be sabotaging this project? [00:15:59]</p>

<p>But I don't know. (inaudible at 16:05) kind of calmed me down. She was like, "Oh, forget about that. Aâ€”It wasn't really the only time I've heard it either and Bâ€”The point of the project is you're not supposed to censor what people drop off."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this way you find some of the problems (LAUGHTER) with the system. Also, interestingly I'm discovering certain bugs won't pop into the system when you scan them. So, yeah, like it's a glitch. In addition to it being a stupid project, it's a buggy (ph) project. So... That's also something. (PAUSE) But you know like, I do feel a little bit bad that one of the highlights of my day is taking a few minutes to ponder sabotaging the incredible box but then I think it's a couple minutes and the students seem to find it hilarious if they notice. [17:01]</p>

<p>So... But I also do worry that if anyone who wasn't my coworkers found out, then I would get in trouble for it in some unknown way. But yeah. I don't know. It's also very weird to hear managers from other grounds complimenting me when I don't get that from my...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my managers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. Like, I never really know what to do. PAUSE [00:17:57]</p>

<p>Like, literally it just makes me feel more kind of embittered and cranky. Because I feel like, well someone else who isn't supposed to even pay attention to me thought I did something well and the people who were supposed to actually pay attention to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... had no idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, either had no idea or just don't. Like I don't maybe they don't get it, maybe don't care, maybe they think it was bad. I just don't know. I mean, I can guess what they think but...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I think pretty much everything you talked about (LAUGHTER) for today has to do with you or someone else sticking it to the management at work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:18:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But also in this way where it's like not so explicit but that's what you're kind of enjoying talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because in the end it's completely like it does something to mean like this is a mildly satisfying, completely meaningless form of protest that will have no actual long term effects other than making me laugh whenever I put things in the incredible box.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think that (LAUGHTER) all these things make you feel good in a situation that makes you feel very bad whether it's the incredible box or the soon to be retiree who wrote the thing. The frustrating this is it's fun to hang out about all that. [00:20:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. It's a weird fun like its enjoyable. But then I also think, it much rather be... I'd rather that I don't have to do things to make my, to make it more enjoyable, where I work more enjoyable I guess. Like, it's totally enjoyable but it's also kind of depressing that, you know, it's so hard for me to find something enjoyable with my actual job. And also so the person who I was talking to on the way out he was like, "Oh well is that a job that you really want?" And I'm like, "Well no. But it's kind of the job I have right now." And it's really unhelpful for you to say, "Is that the job you want?" Unless you're offering me a job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, you're not. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>And with work paying for school, like, you know, (inaudible at 21:23) this really is... Like it only makes sense for me to get a new job if it was within the company or if it paid a lot more. It'd have to pay at least $7000 a year more. Actually, more because taxes but whatever. And, I don't think that's feasible, unfortunately.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:21:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 22:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like it's enjoyableâ€”it's totally enjoyable in the moment but as soon as I take it back, I'm like, "Oh G. Why?" I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the kind of fun you ought to be having at work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I think the other thing is that I basically work alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is just no one in my area and I think of times that I've had trade (ph) jobs and it's been easier when you have like, your coworkers also mock someone with you so you're like a little team but I work I'm like of, not a one person apartment, but I don't have a coworker. I don't even physically stick to my area most of the time. [00:23:11]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>So, it's just like kind of lonely and really isolated and while there are other people directly in my department they're all physically distant. I mean, they're on other floors.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And basically they're all in one office space. So I'm like, "Yeah hi. Most of you are on the second floor." And there's another group on the other end of the building. And I can stop by and visit but it's not the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PAUSE [00:24:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I thought about, one of the things I decided to do was to e-mail a coworker who I like who is more near the research end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so part of me wants to go to the Karl's manager and just be like, "Hey, here are some things." And then I also think that might be curse (ph) inside but I don't like... It might be cursed (ph) inside or it may just be a wasted half hour meeting. Like, it could go either way. And I want to ask this person if she had any thoughts on (inaudible at 24:50) waste of time versus possibly if ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, she's a coworker. She's not Karl's boss. [00:24:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. She's a coworker. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's in a different unit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she's one of the librarians and one of the senior librarians. And I've worked with her before and I really like her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I thought that she might sort of have thoughts beyond, "You really shouldn't do that" or like, "burn down the building." Which currently is the advice I've been getting from friends. And I'm like, "That's not..." Like, neither of those are really helpful. Well, do nothing might be helpful. It's just frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:55] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I also just keep on seeing things that are interesting. And like, "Oh, the new library could totally do this or that or this interesting thing." And I think, and I'm totally qualified to do that and nothing's going to happen. Or this new, right now they're spouting out some of their like conceptual ideas of what will be happening in the future. (inaudible at 26:17) That's totally interesting. There's currently no one to talk to about it. There's no person in charge of it. The recommended thing would probably be talk to my manager which will go nowhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I just feel sort of like, "Mmm. This is depressing." I should probably stop and think about it. [00:26:46]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I don't know. It's just when I was doing secretarial work in the other department... After I'd have this weird bit of this is not really using my talented full potential.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the other hand, it was pretty much easy. I could always get my work done and I'm like, there's like, you know. The lack of opportunity for growth was kind of nice in a way. Like I was just like I was just trying to do my job and the department was not interested in changing anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it wasn't like someone was like, "Oh can you think of 50 new ways to...?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just like, "Alright. Can you make like, add more into that webpage? I'm like, "Yes I can." You know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sort of within the preview (ph) of what my job was I could basically just do whatever. (inaudible at 27:59)</p>

<p>And so I would think, "Wow. I'm a really really really overqualified secretary." And do like a good job at this so that's kind of nice. And most of my faculty appreciated and grasped that I was wildly overqualified.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so they were like, "You like being the overqualified secretary." So right now I'm just like really overqualified. My job is sort of incoherent but I'm pretty sure I'm more qualified than Chet for a lot of things, except for video editing. I know I'm more technology qualified than Adrian (inaudible at 28:49). More qualified than Karl except for that I don't want to be a manager and I don't have a library degree. [00:28:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 29:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Well I'm the first person Chet has ever managed so. (PAUSE) But yeah and Karl getting himself on committees about technology. And I'm just like, "Alright. Why are you doing this?" So now I feel like, "Oh but there are things I could actually do." And this is sort of theoretically a career that I'm interested in. And there's all this changing so maybe...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so it kind of like feels like this opportunity. Except I don't think there really is. PAUSE [00:29:58]</p>

<p>So he keeps on feeling well ... (inaudible at 30:01). I guess I get press releases a lot about how there are all these opportunities. And it's kind of like, if there's no like. (inaudible at 30:19) there's this illusion that things are changing and maybe things are changing. Mostly I'm more there's an illusion of change. (PAUSE) And I think that do you think that this is a really great time or the library could actually change and could do all these things that are interesting and I'd love to be a part of that and it's not possible. [00:30:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is like one of the times where (PAUSE) things seem to line up with so much with what you're saying. I mean, the extent of the frustration and (PAUSE) unfairness at work and the kind of mildness of your tone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's at least partially... Since I was just talking to someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I had nobody that had to be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... mild. (PAUSE) And also I do worry that... (PAUSE) So I spend a lot of time at work trying to embrace (ph) the unfairness and sometimes I worry that if I start really ripping in and get comfortable, I mean like, these guys really suck, that it's just going to kind of come out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:32:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also occurs to me and I wonder. (inaudible at 32:31) ... incredible box or like felt good. I don't know that it's progress to you (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It throwing (ph) the incredible box is fun. You know it's depressingly enjoyable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the rest of the stuff is mostly depressing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. (inaudible at 33:09) ... or really mad or upset about what is happening but mostly when I think about it, it's just like, a lot of it is just depressing and makes me feel like the best thing to do is to just do as little work as possible and just kind of do nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that I don't know. I don't really feel mad so much. Like I guess I am a little bit. I guess I am just overly apathetic about it. Like is it worth... I don't know. Like when I start to get angry or whatever the next thought is, "Is it worth it? Is it going to get anywhere other than just me feeling upset?" [00:34:07]</p>

<p>I don't know. Like I guess also I'm really... (PAUSE) I don't know. Like the workplace is not ... people don't really express emotion a lot. (LAUGHTER) Which I was talking about in contrast to where Ashby works. Where she was saying how like every week at work someone starts crying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm just like, "What? What the H?" [35:05] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sound's more like my workplace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and she's just like, "Well it's the helping profession." And talked about their feelings and there's lots of like 25 year old and it's their first job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't. I just can't like imagine if people cried every day at my work and that's kind of part of it. Like when I'm feeling intense about it, I'm more feel like tears of frustration slash humiliation more than anything else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really could cry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come? I mean, if I recall it's true. [00:36:03]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel better afterwards. I don't know it feels like a sort of loss of control to be like... And if I'm crying like I don't... I just feel very vulnerable and kind of embarrassed and I don't want anyone around. And also I feel like in crying I just lost. Like if I was having like a discussion or argument, I feel like I just lost it because I'm crying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And well... Sort of also like if a person... Like if I ended up getting my way, it was like, "Oh my G. I just want to get her to stop crying."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or if you're trying to have some kind of like discussion (inaudible at 36:59) or whatever I'm just lost because instead of like being able to create an argument I ended up bursting into tears.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [37:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which part of like why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I mean I'm not sure that it always means that you haven't argued your point or that you've definitely lost the argument that you're in or...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's a couple of things. Like some of it is like when I'm working with guys or talking to guys like it seems like their biggest fear is if someone starts crying. So if a woman starts crying, either a guy will be like, "What can I do to get you to stop crying? I'll do anything ..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:38:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that proves that, you know, women are weaker or that, "She is a woman and she can't handle it and obviously everything she says, she is just some hysterical girl."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (inaudible at 38:24)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so there is that. (PAUSE) I don't know. My parents are always like... If I cry or if I when cried (inaudible at 38:39) before they are just like, "Stop crying." Like, they definitely want me to stop crying. Or sometimes it's weird. My mom will sometimes say that I don't cry. So I guess that you can cry briefly. She (inaudible at 38:57) at my brother's wedding and my aunt's funeral. (PAUSE) [00:39:01]</p>

<p>And I just like it just sort of men's fear of crying has definitely been a thing. My parents' fear of crying is definitely a thing. (PAUSE) I don't know. I mean I think also having this job, the job that left to me crying at work for the first time ever is a lot. That's kind of a big thing. And that after you both cry in the bathroom and it you're crying in front of Karl it's still like nothing. Like I felt totally humiliated and I felt frustrated like I didn't communicate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then nothing really happened. [00:40:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it certainly didn't do anything for your sort of confidence and security (inaudible at 40:13).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now. We'll can do some more tomorrow.</p>

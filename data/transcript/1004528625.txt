<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like your dress very much. The weather has certainly changed. (phone ringing) I'm just going to turn this off. So, I got a call on Thursday night from (inaudible) to my brother, saying that my dad was in the ER because his friend had come to... I don't know, the story was kind of confusing. Something about his friend, my dad's friend, who was going to visit him in Georgia, and then my dad called him and said he shouldn't come, couldn't go on his trip. Long story short, my dad was in the ER because he had been drinking again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He had been drinking again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:00:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't exactly know what he went to the ER for. I know the friend ended up coming down and his wife came too, and they were involved with getting him to the ER, either in the - everyone is kind of confused as to whether my dad asked to go or whether they forced him to go and I just got - (yawns). When my uncle had talked to my dad, my uncle had said you know, you had been doing great the whole time we were down, because my uncle was down when we were too, and he said what happened, and my dad said that he had been drinking the whole time that we had all been down there also. And that just, you know I had left saying that (chokes up) (pause)... [00:02:00]</p>

<p>It just really... I mean it was the only kind of like positive memory, the only kind of happy (sniffles) time I can really think of, of having with him. And I was saying that I wasn't hopeful for the - you know, I was just happy that that had happened, but now knowing that he had been drinking the whole time, for some reason that like tainted it a little bit for me. (crying) I just feel a little bit cheated I guess, or just you know manipulated and like it wasn't really authentic. I don't know. Which is ridiculous, because the time was still great and it shouldn't take away from that experience and logically I know that that, (coughs) that doesn't change anything that happened during that visit, but it still makes me feel like... (pause) I don't know. [00:03:18]</p>

<p>I still just am really upset by it. And then I start thinking, like then I get mad at myself because everyone was drinking in front of him, including me, and I think of course he wanted to go home afterwards and drink. And then I think, like I should have known. He wasn't coming around until later in the day, like 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon, and when he's sober, he wants to be doing stuff all the time, he wants to be busy all the time, but when he's drinking, he doesn't come around until later in the day, but that I wasn't even thinking about it. And then he, one morning came and said he had been throwing up blood that morning, and I just though, like I was like oh, you probably have another ulcer, you need to go to the doctor. But I didn't follow up about it and it didn't - like none of these things added up for me, until I like... I guess I'm mad now that I see all these signs that I could have at the time, put them together and thought and said something, but I didn't. (pause) [00:04:39]</p>

<p>So I guess he was in the ER for five days and he talked to my brother on Saturday and he was back at home then and he said he was going to go to treatment today, but I doubt he'll go. (coughs) And um, -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know specifically what he was in the ER for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no - no. I don't know if it was because of the throwing up the blood or because he wanted to dry out safely. I don't know what it was. (pause) You know, like nobody calls me directly. Somebody calls my brother and then my brother calls me. (clears throat) And then, so that - so Thursday that happened, and then I called my girlfriend Emma and said just can you come over for a walk, and we went for a walk to talk about it. Because Chris, I have a hard time, because like Chris wants to really be there for me, but I get there and he just says, do you want to talk about? And then he doesn't ask any - he's just like such a typical guy, and I just have a hard time just like spilling my guts immediately, as soon as it happens. [00:05:55]</p>

<p>So I went for a walk with my girlfriend and talked about it and I felt much better. And then at 11:00 that night, I got a call from (clears throat). Well, my brother and I had talked earlier that day and he and I had also talked about - we talked about - he like, he's so nonchalant about it. We talked for five minutes and then he says oh yeah, the reason I'm calling is... and tells me the thing about my dad. He was like you know, and he's just like da da da, like it's no big deal, like dad's going to go get a teeth cleaning. He acts like just totally whatever about it. And he said something about our other brother and I said he I don't know, and I said did you call him and he said yeah, and something like, it came up that he, our other brother, knew about the, the kind of like fight between John and my mom and my step-dad. Not a fight really, a heated discussion I guess. And my brother John was like well yeah, what did he say to you about it, and we kind of talked about it for a minute and it made John really upset, and he was mad that you know, that our mom had talked to Fred about it and mad that - I don't know, but he had to go to class. [00:07:20]</p>

<p>And then at 11:00 that night I got a call from his girlfriend, who was crying and saying John was wasted, he's out of control, he's punching the walls, he's kicking things and just yelling that he's angry, and I don't know what to do, do you have any suggestions. And so you know, I told her to leave the apartment and that I would call him, just because I could hear him yelling at her and saying like - they're technically broken up right now but living in the same apartment, which is a bad situation. He doesn't - he would never touch her, but he gets really mad and he says really mean things, and I knew that as long as she was there he was just going to keep going and just saying the meanest stuff he could say to her, until he got...</p>

<p>So anyway, she left and I was on the phone off and on with him for the next little bit and it was really just, I mean he was (inaudible) hurt him a very long time and saying he's all alone and nobody's on his side and he wants to go face first over a cliff, and he's just saying all these terrible things and not making any sense and so... But he was like, it was like every 30 seconds, he would reset. Like he was on like, he like couldn't remember past 30 seconds and so I was worried. I could tell that he had taken pills also. He was just like slurring his speech in a way that wasn't just drunk. And as soon as I told his girlfriend to leave, I got really nervous that he was just going to do something, just because he kept saying the thing about wanting to go face first over a cliff. [00:09:04]</p>

<p>And so I called our other brother and said you know, I don't know if you have a key to his place. I don't think you should go there now, because I think he'll be really aggressive and combative, but maybe if you go in the morning just to check on him. And so our other brother, who is like me and is very nervous, was in his car anyway, so he drove over, and he could like see that the lights in his apartment were off and could see the - he kept telling me that he was in bed and so Fred - I was worried that he was up finding more alcohol and whatever. So anyway, the situation worked out and he ended up being fine, but the whole night I just didn't sleep, because I was afraid he was either going to (chokes up) do something or get sick and choke on it or I don't know, just something. And the next morning he called and (pause) you know, he gets like this every time our dad goes back to rehab, and he doesn't put the pattern together. (crying) Every time our dad goes back, I get a call that night that he's a mess. [00:10:10]</p>

<p>But he acts like so tough about it during the day that it's - and he expects you to be tough about it during the day too, when he first tells you. You're expected to be (sniffles) - that's my reaction, like I get off the phone with him and I just cry because I'm really upset, but you can't do that when you're on the phone with him and you can't ask him if he's okay about it, because he's just going to - he's just too tough and he's too hard. And so I talked to him the next day and he and I talked a lot, and he just blames it on a lot of other things. But after a couple hours of talking on and off, he - I was just saying like you know, this is a situation that just keeps coming up and you're saying that it's all these things that you can't juggle and that...</p>

<p>Anyway, he like tries to solve this - you know, he's working really hard to solve his problems himself, but it's not working and so I was trying to get him to go talk to somebody and I've been trying to get him to go talk to somebody a very long time. And I just um, you know said that what do you have to lose, you're not, like I tried to play into his personality as much as possible, by just saying you claim you're this really self-aware guy who wants to better himself and make improvements, but you just keep trying the same things over and over, why won't you try this one thing, go for an hour. What do you - what's the harm, what are you going to lose? [00:11:48]</p>

<p>I said you know, I'll look into it for you, I'll research somebody, I'll find somebody, and like if I schedule it for you will you think about it, will you do it? And he said yeah I know, it's like you make the appointment I'll go do it. And so on Friday, I called a few women in Concord and told them to call me back immediately. And so I set up the appointment and then called him to tell - he was then by that point, he had started drinking again already, on Friday afternoon. And I said like all right, so your appointment is set up for noon next Friday and he said oh, I need that number, I need to change the appointment. And I said are you going to change it or are you going to cancel it, and he said he was just going to change it. I didn't realize until a few days later, that he has an exam, so he was just changing it, and so he's going today, to go talk to somebody, which is a really big relief and I'm really, really, really relieved. Mostly because I feel like he relies on me a lot for the kind of stuff that he should be maybe talking to a professional about. I just don't... like I can support him as best as I can by listening, but like it's a lot for me. It's a lot of pressure and I just, I don't know what to do any more. [00:13:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel like he relies on you for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just somebody to vent. I feel like he relies on me to be the person who hears him, to be the person who immediately he turns to, which is fine for the most part, but not for like a few hours every week. (pause) Like I just, I feel like he relies on me to like I don't know, make sure that... (pause) I don't know. Like what he's - the way he's approaching things is like I don't know. (pause) Put it this - I don't know. Maybe he doesn't - I just feel like there's a lot that he needs that I can't help him with. [00:14:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think someone else could?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think somebody who is a professional could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What could a professional do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, just offer - I mean just what I'm here for, the same kind of thing, just honest feedback that isn't - that has no tie to his outside life. You know to - it's a person who can be completely honest with him, without any... anything there bringing into the situation, you know? With me, he knows by bringing certain things up or by talking about certain things, where I'm coming from, because there's all these other things going on. You know, if we're talking about things with our family, if we're talking about things with school. There's already a whole set of baggage that I bring to it, that he's already aware of, and so just having somebody else who's not connected to his life, who he knows, it's like a safe place for him to go and just (pause) talk for a period of time. I just feel like he needs that. [00:15:53]</p>

<p>He needs to just - he needs to have an out loud stream of consciousness that helps him to just move forward and to like let go. He just has so much built up inside of him that he needs to just process and let go of. I mean he doesn't - he just - everything from when we were little, it's just still inside, and I feel like it needs to come up and go out, or just be thought about and dealt with, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of baggage do you feel you're bringing to this, to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just my own certain you know, like when he talks about stuff with our dad, like I have a different feeling on it sometimes. Or when he talks about his drinking, I have a different feeling on it you know? And he knows that um, (pause). I don't know, I guess it's also easier for me to let my emotions and my love for him take over and be - that be driving force, instead of like my rational brain. And so I'll just sometimes tell him things are okay when they're not okay, just because I love him and I don't want to - it's either like the easiest way to get something done or I just don't want to hurt his feelings. And somebody else isn't going to necessarily do that, because they don't - it doesn't matter. You know like or I won't say something because I don't want to get in a fight with him, and like that's not going to matter to a professional who doesn't have - who isn't his sister. (long pause) [00:18:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel helpless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Not so much - I mean now that he agreed to go see somebody, I feel like a little - I feel really relieved. I feel like it's the first time he's really wanted to help himself and, and I feel relief that like I'm not... (pause) I just felt pressure before not you know. (pause) I just felt like I'm the only one that can, that can like fix this. I'm the only one that you're like talking to about these things, so I'm the only one can fix this, when in reality I know the only one that can fix it is him. But like I felt this pressure and I'm a little relieved of it now, just because I feel like he's kind of taking it into his own hands by doing something for himself. I don't know maybe that's crazy. [00:19:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you say that, maybe it's crazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just that like nothing really changed but this one thing, so. (pause) Like I get all hopeful and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I hear that. I guess that's what I was - I'm thinking why am I asking the questions I'm asking you, and I think that that's one of the things I was thinking, that it sounds like you're really - you're feeling a sense of responsibility and looking at someone else who could take over responsibility and do something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just want someone to - I want him to do something. I want him to make a choice. I want him to care about himself. I don't want to depress him more and I want you know, I just want him to take control of the situation. I don't feel like he's driving the ship. I feel like he's just bobbing along. He like masks it in all these other ways. He reads all these books about psychology and he's listening to all these like self-help things, but it's all a bunch of bullshit, because he does it for like a month and then it's on - like it's just something new, and it's all, it's just bullshit. (pause) [00:20:50]</p>

<p>It's like - I just like think if he could get in a pattern of sticking to one thing. And I've just felt - I felt really helped by the situation, and so maybe it won't help him. Maybe he won't be receptive to it and maybe it won't work for him, but I've felt really helped by it and so - and I've just felt like coming and sticking to something every week for a few months, that eventually it starts to help and it starts to pay off. And I just feel like if that could work for him, then like I just need - I really need him to do it, I need him to try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said that several times today, like it's working for you and you want him to do it too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean why else do people go to therapy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do people - now people go to therapy so that their sibling can also be helped. I'm not sure what that meant. [00:21:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm not here because I want him - I mean, I'm not only - I'm not here just - I'm here for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean everybody goes to therapy to better something about themselves or to heal from something or you know, to help themselves in some way, and that's all I want him to do. I just want him to help himself (pause) and this worked for me. I don't give a shit what the hell works, I don't. If rubbing magic stones works together, rubbing - like if that works for him, I don't give a shit what he does. I just want him to do it, because he's - like he's dying, he's killing himself. And I - it's killing, like it's killing me. (chokes up)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sort of - that's what I wanted to talk to you about. He may be killing himself but why is he killing you too? [00:22:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's my brother, I love him. (pause) And that's just not ever going to go away. (pause) I don't want that to go away. I want to be this fiercely protective over him. It's just how it - I don't think that there's anything wrong with that. (sniffles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wrong with...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How protective I feel of him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like I'm saying there is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? (long pause) I certainly don't see anything wrong with your feeling so protective of him. I think you're giving yourself not many options by saying he has to go do this, because if he doesn't then where does that leave you. [00:24:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. Yeah I know. I know I'm going to be really disappointed if it doesn't - if he doesn't - if he doesn't. Like I have a lot of fear that he'll leave today and just say like that sucked, that woman is full of shit. He already said to me the other day, like oh, why does she have all the answers? And I just said, like she doesn't have any more answers than you do, and I don't think she has necessarily any answers, but you don't need to look at it that way. You just need to look at it as a place to go and talk and feel free to just say anything that you need to get off your chest. It doesn't need to be a place to go find answers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one thing I wonder. I know that it's very painful for you to think about you and your brother as being on very different life paths, that you are on the path to feeling stronger, feeling good, having sort of a healthy, productive, satisfying life, and he seems to be going in the opposite direction. [00:25:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah of course, it kills me to... (chokes up) (pause) But would I feel that way if he was choosing the opposite path and like anything else? Do you know what I mean? Like I don't think that... (pause)</p>

<p>Like my brother Fred is choosing to stay at home, not leave Massachusetts, go to college. He doesn't drink, he doesn't - like another sense is my other brother is choosing a very different path. He doesn't party like I did when I was growing up. He you know, lives with our cousin. Well actually now, he's moving back in with my parents. So he's like staying at home with my parents for the most part, going to college, and staying in Massachusetts. He's choosing a totally different path than what I did, but that doesn't upset me or you know. [00:26:24]</p>

<p>I think that the reason that my - I just - I'm just - yeah, I guess because I feel like I'm getting better and he's not. Are you talking about like when kids who have siblings with - like I feel like it's the same thing as when kids have an older sibling. They talk about this with kids with Down syndrome. If they have a younger sibling who doesn't have Down syndrome, the younger sibling won't surpass them, they'll only learn to read at the level that like their older sibling with special needs can. Like they say they'll inhibit themselves because they don't want to outgrow that you know? I feel like that's what you're kind of like, you know like. Not like my brother has special needs, but I feel like it's like that situation, where it's like, (pause) like we were damaged together, and it was something that - it was like this camaraderie. [00:27:30]</p>

<p>Like when you said a few weeks or months ago, I said I have this like fiercely protective love over them that I don't have for anybody else, and you said you guys are war buddies, you had this trauma and you um, you have this thing together. And so yeah, I guess part of me feels like if I'm healed, or not healed because I don't know if I'll be healed, but if I'm capable of dealing with some of these things that he's not, I feel like I'm leaving him behind (chokes up) and I feel like he's all alone. (pause) And I just feel bad that he's struggling with some of these things. (sniffles) Oh my god, (inaudible). (crying). [00:28:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's such an interesting analogy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't think it's true?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, do you - I don't know. Maybe it's not accurate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think - what made you think that I -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what made you - you just said, do you think it's not true. I'm not sure what you're responding to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, because I am a nut-bag. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? I said what -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - what were you responding to and you said oh, I'm a nut-bag.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A bag of mixed nuts over here. Because you said such an interesting analogy and so I - because I, you know that I question everything. I said - because then to me that means that you think that it's not accurate. [00:29:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, trust me I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think that that's important right? How you got from that to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - that's what I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, well I'm not taking that as okay, that's what you do. Let's talk about something else. That's what you do, I mean that's important to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because unless, unless I hear like yeah, that makes sense, or unless I hear like a concrete agreement, I think that whatever somebody says is in disagreement.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then I would think that you think a lot of things I do is that, because I'm quiet a lot of times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I explore, like I'll ask questions, but I don't usually - that's exactly what I think, and even though I do agree with you, but I don't often sort of verbalize it. So you think a lot of things that I think, that I just say, I think you're wrong. Well that's - note to self. [00:30:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I told you, it's a bag of nuts over here. I mean not a lot, that's dramatic, that's like a little intense, but I interpret a lot - I mean it just makes me question myself and what I'm saying and thinking. I don't think it's a bad thing. I think I should be questioning things that I'm saying and thinking. (pause) Oh god. (pause) I'm, I just, I'm using all of your tissues. (sighs) The thing is that as soon as everything happened with my brother, I just, like I just stopped really caring about what was going on with my dad. I mean not stopped caring about it, but it was like it completely paled in comparison to the feelings that I had about my brother being that drunk and that sad sounding and that out of control, and that I had never - I hadn't heard him say he wanted to kill himself. I mean he wasn't saying I'm going to kill myself, but by saying I want to go face first over a cliff, hearing him say that, it made my feelings towards my situation with my dad feel like eh. Like I care and I'm upset and I'm like, I was more sad about... (clears throat) How do I say this? It was like I had - it just made me realized like how little I care about my dad in comparison to how much I care about my brother, and it made me feel like (pause) everything that I care about with my dad is just a reflection of like how it affects me. Like it's just I care. [00:32:35]</p>

<p>I guess it made me feel like I care not very little, but not a ton about his actual physical well-being. I care, like I care in the sense that I don't want him to be in extreme amounts of pain and I don't want him to be terribly depressed and lonely and all those things that I talked about before, but when I hear my brother talk about it, it's this feeling of like I will do anything on the planet right now if that feeling could go away for him. I would do anything and I don't have that with my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it like resonates with something deeper in you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah of course. It's like I see all these feelings that I've had and that I've felt, and he's having them. And it's just like, and then you just know that feeling and then it's this person that you love so much and it's like, and you know why they're there and you know - I mean it's just, I can't describe it. Yeah of course it's because of a lot of the same feelings that I felt, and because of the same experiences and because of the same situation. And with my dad I feel like it's just all self-inflicted. And maybe it's not. Maybe it's because of trauma he's had in his past that he hasn't dealt with, bla bla bla bla bla. All I know is that me and my brothers have pain that's because of his choices, and now we're in the position of having, now we have to make choices, and we have to decide to change our behavior and our you know, watch the hand that we were dealt with our DNA and watch these certain you know, things that maybe we're more prone to, and help heal from some of the things that he's inflicted, so that we don't carry forward this pattern. And so that makes me resentful of him and angry towards him, and it makes me also really scared for my brother. Like change it, change it, like I'm going to change it, don't you want to change it? Let's change it, let's not do this, we can't do this. We can't, like we can't recycle these problems again because it's been recycled for so many generation and like we have to, we have to stop. We can't keep doing this. [00:35:14]</p>

<p>And so I like get this like panicked feeling of like, like we're not going to be like that, I'm not going to be like that, you're not going to be like that, you're not going to be like that. The three of us are going to be different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He has to get with the program.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has to get with the program. He has to get onboard, because he's onboard, he says he's onboard, he says he's nothing like it, and then he's just like it. And it's like no you're not, and you're so smart, and you are so self-aware in some ways, but in some ways they're just so - there's this wall. (crying) Oh, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you love him and you're so frustrated too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I am very frustrated, and I - and then I just... And I feel like no one understands like how much it consumes me. You know, like I feel like I was really reactive all weekend to Chris. Not all weekend, like we had a really nice time, but I was on edge. I was on edge all weekend and little things that bother me. And then I would just be in a bad mood and then I'd cry by myself and it's like - and for me I just think that he should know, like I'm just like, I'm distraught over what's going on with my brother and I can't function. I can't function in this way, that he just goes along, because he doesn't - like if he knew how much I like - how much it consumes my feelings towards my brothers, he would be like you're a little crazy, like that's a little bit intense. [00:37:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's like, because I just know that nobody else that I am friends with has these feelings of like - like I feel like my brother's well-being consumes me more than like any other person's relationship with anybody. I feel like more than my well-being, you know like Chris is concerned about my well-being. You know it's just like I feel like he would be like that's a little intense and you need to relax, he's a grown man and he can take care of himself. He doesn't. He doesn't say that to me and he understands that I'm upset about it, but why, you know two days later, I'm annoyed about a little thing and I always feel like ahhhh, you should just know that I'm edge right now. And he shouldn't just know. [00:38:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm still stuck on why you think nobody would understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess because I just don't think other people would want to like - I've said to people, you know that feeling that you have where you would like kill somebody if you saw them make your sibling cry? And they're like oh yeah and I'm like no, I would - I would do, like not really, but I have this intense wave take over me when I see my siblings upset, only my brothers really, where I feel physically ill. And they're like no, I don't have that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I was going to say, they may not have that feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But why couldn't they try to understand what you're feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess. Because I always feel like they'll look at me like you're a weirdo, that's really intense. [00:39:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, if they don't have the same feeling you do then you're a weirdo?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if you're like the only person standing alone with that. But I know, I know, I know. It's not, I'm not, and I know that my circumstances are different and that I come from a different background that would make me feel more protective over them. And I know. And if I just explain it. And for the most part Chris is really understanding and really - and doesn't you know, care if I'm on the phone in our living room until 1:30 in the morning on a Thursday. For the most part, he's really understanding and great about it. I don't know, I like - I think I like isolate myself, because I just say like (pause) he you know, they're not going to understand or they're not going to be able to relate to it and then it's going to seem weird because they can't. [00:40:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm wondering why you feel that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just because I know that they don't feel that way about their siblings, or Chris doesn't feel that way about his siblings. But that doesn't mean he can't necessarily see how I can feel that way. Or at least - or why I at least can't explain it to him. And I think he does. I don't think I even need to explain it to him honestly. I think I'm making a bigger deal of it in my head than needs to be even. Because I don't think he would - I don't think he would actually care and think that I was a weirdo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it seems like you're very aware of how your experience growing up could isolate you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well it's just always made me feel different. It made me feel like I act this way or react this way because of a certain difference in how I grew up, and that maybe people won't understand that because their experiences were all the - not all the same. I don't - that's obviously like a terrible thing to say, but a lot of my friends had very similar experience, in the sense that they had a mom and a dad who either both went to work, or had a mom who stayed home. They were in a situation that's varied a little bit. You know, my dad had a temper or my mom drank a little more. You know, like everyone has certain things definitely, but everyone I know came from a pretty similar situation. They went to public school, they got good grades, they had a pretty functional family life, there was maybe one or two traumas that happened, a grandparent died or like you know, a parent you know. I don't know, something, got fired from their job, like something, lost their job. I don't know. But for the most part, I feel like I'm the only one who has had a different experience than that and since that you know, like I don't feel like anybody really raised me. I don't feel like anybody - nobody I know has a parent who is an addict, and nobody I know has a parent who was abusive. Nobody I know has a parent who has been to rehab and um, so I just, I feel alone in that I guess, and I feel like because of that, I maybe act a little differently. [00:43:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually don't agree with everything you just said. Talk about like, when we were talking about ways in which it seems that I don't agree when I don't feel that way. I shouldn't say I don't agree. I just feel like, you know I understand what you're saying, that there's sort of a quality to your experience that other people - you feel that other people won't relate to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you do kind of see, well everyone else is sort of similar and then you're off to the side, as opposed to people having you know, very qualitatively different experiences, everybody. I'm not sort of trying to minimize the trauma you went through, but I don't know, there's a particular way that you go through things together in your mind that isolate you a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I just feel like I'm the only one who you know, I guess had kind of a trauma or has. And I guess everyone has their own trauma. [00:44:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like your friend who has this eating disorder, she's had plenty of trauma.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not to minimize what you're - I mean it's just, I'm just trying to understand. And now what you're saying is no wonder you feel such a camaraderie with your brothers, because it's like you're in this unique situation that no one else could possibly know, and then everybody else is together on their side. I don't know if there's different sides.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do feel like that. Well, I've also just had people - I mean I've always felt like people have always down - like they've always kind of looked at me skeptically, like things I would say. Since I wasn't - since a lot of my friends I've had since I was really little, and since at ten years old you're not really going to say really scary things that happened to you at home, especially if you want your friends to come to your house to play. You're not going to say my dad pulled out a gun and said he was going to shoot all of us, or you're not going to say, I heard my dad raping my mom. You know, you're not going to say things like that, so when I would start to say things when I was older... Even at that age, oh I hate my dad, everyone would say like oh I hate my dad too, he grounded me because I didn't do my homework. You know? And I'd be like you hate your dad because he grounded you, like I wish my dad would ground me. And so it would start with things like that and then it would be like, and then I'd get a little older and I'd say my dad is totally out of control, he just drinks a ton. And my friends would be like, yeah my parents drink a lot on the - you know, like my parents drink. They had a party and they all got really drunk. It's like when my dad gets really drunk, he's really drunk at 6:00 in the afternoon, like every day. [00:46:14]</p>

<p>But I always, since it was like these friends that I had known since I was six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and then at twelve, fourteen, fifteen, starting to say these things, it was always met with kind of like skepticism and like, well then why wouldn't we just know that all along. I come to your house, I see your dad, he's a nice guy. He's nice to me, he's really funny. And then even in high school, when I was really open about it, my friends who would come around you know, we'd go party at my dad's apartment when I was a few years older, because it was a free for all. And he'd be like, I got you guys so much alcohol, and he had like stocked. He let me throw a graduation party at our property in Manomet, and the kitchen was full of alcohol and they were like your dad is awesome, we love your dad. You know, like everybody loved him and he was so great and he was so cool and I'm like - you know, and he was being so funny and witty and joking, and everyone loves him. And it always makes me feel really defensive, like anything I say is met with this kind of like, no I know your dad, he's not that thing that you said he is. [00:47:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we're going to need to stop actually, but it sounds like in a sense you feel like others have isolated you, like you've sort of been put in this position, so how can you not feel this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me get that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you apologizing? You didn't do anything. You've come in here to talk. I'll see you on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, sounds great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, bye-bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

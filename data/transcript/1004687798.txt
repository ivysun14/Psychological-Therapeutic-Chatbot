<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you? I'm sure you're hot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm okay. I just bought these workout pants online and they actually fit me, which is really good. Daphne said I should talk to you about my having body image issues and stuff. I still haven't contacted the nutritionist or anything yet so I'm worrying about that, but we bought the stuff for running and walking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both of us. We are going to do the run/walk thing because he had done it before. It starts with running, walking two minutes, running one minute, walking two minutes, running one minute, and then you have a day of just walking and next it's like run two minutes, walk one, etc. until it gets slowly building up. We have to lead up to running thirty minutes. It's not like fast running, but running. 00:01:09</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel about embarking on that plan?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure it's sustainable, but I also figured since we're going to offset it - because their plan has it so you're running on Saturday and resting on Sunday and I'm like "I don't need to rest on Saturday." I mean I can, but I'd rather not; spending this time just walking 30 minutes a day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long is your walk from home to here, or from where you walk from to here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today it took 20 minutes; it should be a 15 minute walk. Also Sydney's car got towed because yesterday we were at a Hotel for the wedding and we forgot to park on the other side of the street for street cleaning. We walked up to the towing place except it wasn't there so I actually after this have to go out to the towing place out here. 00:02:02</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get the car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we were walking for about 20-30 minutes, too. Actually walking isn't as bad as I thought it was. I don't know how I'm going to feel about running. Also I'm sure Sydney is going to run faster than me, but he says he can come back and forth and stuff. Of course I'm worrying about what will happen in the winter when it's cold out and it's snowing. I mean it's cold outside. [ ] (crosstalk at 00:02:32)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today it's 90-something. (both laugh) I don't know, but it's definitely summer still.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it will be summer for a while. I want it to be something that can be sustainable through the winter and I don't want to pay money to join a gym.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you may need to see how this goes; see how you feel and revamp when it gets colder. 00:03:05</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't really want to be like, "Yeah, tone it down to walking," or something like that. I realize I would much rather exercise a lot and build up lots of muscles so it burns calories so I can eat whatever I want rather than trying to diet. When I talked to my psychiatrist she was mentioning, "Oh, instead of trying to cut things out, you should add nutritional foods." I was like, "I can do that," in theory. "I actually [bought less steak. When I was cooking dinner I was up here beforehand] (inaudible at 00:03:41) Oh, I will have a snack, I will have some nuts. They are adding protein," and then I opened up these nuts and there were these moths in it. We deal with moths. I didn't end up having any nuts. I'm sure somewhere in the house we have some left-open bags that would not have moths in them. 00:03:56</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could probably buy some, if not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We could. Moth-free.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like you feel ready to meet some shifts that you weren't ready to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom was looking today for sneakers and the pants and stuff; and I might get more and just charge it to her credit card and all that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad to see you have some support and it seems Sydney is supportive and your mom is trying to be supportive in a way that she can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because they're measuring my waist and it was 46"; and Sydney's waist is also 46", but he's 6 feet tall and I'm 4'10". I was just like, "Oh, my God. I am so huge, because I should not be that waist size with this." And I can still sort of fit into my corduroys. I need things that aren't corduroys because that was probably a huge — because when we were walking around to get the car, I was wearing corduroys and it was really hot. I was wearing these to walk to here it was not really as bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really makes a difference. 00:05:13</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes a huge difference. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm really glad to hear that you were able to do some things that eliminate some of the things that were standing in your way. I think not having clothes that you were comfortable exercising in stood in your way of being able to exercise. It sounds like your fear of how hard it would feel was also standing in your way; and having done this today and having walked for the car, it wasn't as bad as you thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The walking, though; the running is supposed to be — I don't know. I guess when I think of running I think of sprinting, so I'm not sure what they mean by a "mild run". If you're going some . . . why not walk, then? Would that be jogging? If it's mild running do they mean jogging? Do they mean — what do people do when they run for 30 minutes?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think setting your expectation that running is going to be a little bit more impacting than walking and, with this plan, it's a certain amount of time — not a certain amount of distance — you set the pace for yourself at what you can do. If the first challenge is walk for two minutes, mild run or jog . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's just semantics. 00:06:36</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . then you figure out how slowly do you go so that you can do it for the 60 seconds and then still be able to walk that next bit. You shouldn't feel like you're going to keel over, because that's too much for your body. You want exercise to feel healthy, not for it to feel painful. Yes, you want to stretch your limits a little bit, so you want to feel a little bit winded. You don't want to feel like you're about to keel over and die. You're not going to go back for the next day if that's the goal that you set for yourself, so you want it to be something you can do because that will encourage you to do it again. And it's, like you said, you want something you can sustain. Sustainability is what's going to make up change for you. 00:07:28</p>

<p>CLIENT: And walking to therapy, especially now that I have the workout pants, is fine. I'm like, "I think look okay on me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You look perfectly acceptable. You feel more comfortable in some sweatpants, really. That's really helping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because when I was wearing my dress yesterday Sydney thought I looked really, really good in it; and I'm like, "God, people are thinking," because I'm thinking just the way it sort of stretches, I was like, "They will think I'm pregnant or something." No one actually said anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you didn't feel comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This wasn't the Chinese dress of awesome, but I remember the way you talked about how it felt when you wore that dress, and you felt really good about yourself. You felt you were comfortable to have people looking at you, you felt good about what you had chosen and how you looked in it; and I think feeling good about how you look, feeling confident, is where I'd like for you to be again. 00:08:31</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just hard to do that when I don't think I look good in that dress. I was like, "Well, I could still fit into it." It was okay, I just didn't want to go out and try to find a new dress because if they still sold that dress or something like that dress in different colors that I could like get in a larger size, that would have been fine. But ever since then, because I got that dress at Nordstrom's, if I'm ever at Nordstrom's I look at their formalwear and see if there is anything cool like that; and of course there never is. It's like most of the dresses are sleeveless or spaghetti straps, but you don't see dresses like my dress ever anymore so it's like I didn't want to count on being able to find something because I didn't think I'd be able to, so I didn't even bother. 00:09:34</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it about that dress that you feel comfortable with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact that it had short sleeves and stuff and the neckline is okay. It actually covers my body and goes out and doesn't have an empire waist or weird ruffles or those weird skirts that are tucked underneath. I really don't like those styles. Even though they work for some people, they're not my style and they're just dresses that look like you're going clubbing or something; they're not that classy. Or the really formal ones are really, really long for people who are ten times as tall as me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you'd need to have something altered.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So floor-length gowns wouldn't work either. This dress comes to my knees and so I wouldn't want something that only came up halfway to my thigh or whatever. I don't feel comfortable in dresses like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want something a little more modest. 00:10:35</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also, I guess, because I'm bigger and I feel that a lot of the styles that they make for people who are larger are like, "Oh, they're larger; therefore, they're going to be ugly anyway so why don't we make them look really, really frumpy, too?" It's hard to find a 16. I guess a 16 is considered a "plus" size; and I guess some places must have nice plus-size clothing, but I think in terms of dresses and stuff, it's harder to find something that works. Yeah, frustrating. It really is. 00:11:26</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm wondering what it was that made you take this leap to purchase some stuff to exercise in. It sounds like you must be talking to Sydney if he's concerned. I'm wondering what prompted that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess with him it was when we were getting him a tux and stuff, and also because he was like, "Well with Chinese dresses, yours is too small for you. I want to get you a nice one." Looking at the 3XL, their Chinese dresses in 3XL are like a 42" waist or something, and then I measured my waist and it was like 46. 00:12:06</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there was this moment of realization?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I knew my clothes were getting tight, but that was really scary so I was like, "That can't be good." Sydney was also realizing that when he — he re-measured himself when he was getting the new suit so he would have a suit for the wedding. He was 46 waist also and didn't like how he was looking. He ended up looking really good in his suit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you thought he looked good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought he looked good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He thought you looked good. He thought you didn't think he looked good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he didn't think he looked good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. 00:12:43</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt, in general, I was more tired and it was also because I've been feeling more and more depressed, so I'm like, "Well, I need to do something active to stop that." I need to exercise, because it's not like I get off my antidepressants at all because I can't. I'm already taking vitamin B and vitamin D.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're doing a lot of the things that usually work to manage your symptoms.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it wasn't quite enough. It's also wanting to feel comfortable with my body. I like being able to walk long distances and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It gives you a level of freedom and independence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:29) and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It looks like you've managed how to pare down to a small purse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well my other purse broke, actually, so I need to get a replacement purse and this one is not a replacement purse because I would want something that goes across my shoulder. This is just the things I need in order to pick up Sydney's car. Actually, I think the heaviest thing in there is his keys, because he has a ton of keys. So not quite. 00:13:58</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But being able to pare down, I mean even if that is not the purse you want to use, you pared things down and that does make it a lot easier to be able to walk — when you're not carrying a lot of heavy things that make you unbalanced.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because in order to be carrying nothing, I actually have to take time out to walk. If I want to make it more part of my routine, I need to carry less things or get stronger again and carry things in my backpack.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now your backpack spreads the weight evenly on your shoulders. It would be better for your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And especially walking 20 minutes with a backpack like that. Especially if I switch over to my new laptop instead of my main laptop for going to work, then I could at least walk to the Square and take the 77 bus and all, so I'm getting that exercise, too. 00:15:00</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, breaking it up like that — walking part of the way and then using transportation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not going to walk all the way up there. That would be insane.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can think about ways you can kind of break it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean like going to work with my backpack, well there I wasn't taking my computer to work last year, and the Museum is the length of the walk to here, maybe a little bit shorter. But, yeah. I don't know what walking with Sydney is going to be like because I'm not sure if he has gotten his shorts yet. He hasn't gotten his sneakers yet. I think it will work. 00:15:49</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you worried about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm worried about the fact that the whole time he will be running faster than me and I'll just be running; because the thing is that when you walk with someone, you can talk with them and then you talk about things and you're not bored. If you're running, you are running, and you can't really talk, and then it's not as interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do it with him or would you prefer to do that by yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I would want to do it with him, especially because I'll will want to be able to motivate him and stuff. It's like if I'm running by myself it's even more boring. I mean I guess we can pick out nice places because we can use his car to, say, pick places like right here. [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:33) His stuff is in that room []. His furniture is unassembled yet. We have the bed, the mattress was delivered Saturday, so we have it. We need to assemble his bookshelf. I guess also his bookshelf was delivered then, too, and we need to assemble his bookshelf in order to put all of the books in there, then we'll have a lot more space after that; so we're still sleeping at my place because there is not really the space to do things at his. Once he is actually moved in and unpacked, he's a 5-minute walk from the Square and then at the Square there is the bike path and we can go on the bike path and do things there. Or, if we wanted a change of pace or something, we could, in theory, drive to the Cemetery or to the arboretum or something like that. 00:17:33</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. Those are all ways to make it really interesting, different things along the path, beautiful spaces.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just requires time and stuff. It's like an hour instead of 30 minutes or something, so I'm not sure if it's really worth it, but it might be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what would you be doing at that time other than . . . ? What are you giving up to spend an hour?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being unemployed. I guess right now I have the time. And I guess if we did get jobs we could walk nearby instead and do it in the evening or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Focus on — these are making plans for now and they may need to be adjusted if things change. For now, the weather is nice; you do have the time. 00:18:37</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how it's going to go until we start. Sydney was wearing his dress shoes last night, which were new. He got a bunch of blisters. I'm not even sure that walking today would be the best idea for him, so maybe we could do the walking to not get the car. I'm kind of really annoyed at my parents. We had the wedding yesterday and it was okay. I made my speech and it was just really reading, but I made it sound good and everybody thought, "Ooo, wow. That's so pretty and she wrote it herself and I'm like, 'No, I didn't write it myself.'" See. It's Union by Robert Fulghum, or however you pronounce his weirdly-spelled name. There was this cool chemical ceremony where they pour in chemicals in this light-blue water and then it turned into this indigo water. Their chemicals were both white. And then there was this part where it was like stand up if you're witnessing and we stood up and the officiant said a bunch of words and said, "Say 'I will' if you are supporting the marriage." I didn't actually say "I will," but I did stand. I don't know what my dad did, but the whole thing is I'm sort of pissed off with the whole mom being like, "Georgia, you need to do the reading." Blah, blah, blah. "What will the family think if his own sister isn't in the wedding?" 00:20:21</p>

<p>We get to the wedding and we're sitting down in the front row, which is the row for the family, and dad was sitting there and I'm like, "Shouldn't you be in the back?" and he's like, "No." I'm like, "Wait, you're not walking Cullen down the aisle." It was only mom walking Cullen down the aisle, which is I guess in order for Christian ceremonies; but in Jewish ceremonies, it's both parents. Dad was asked to also walk Cullen down and I'm just sort of pissed off with the whole — like that's very, very, very hypocritical for my mom to say, "You need to do this because what will the family think?" when it is a much bigger deal, in my opinion, that dad didn't participate in the wedding. 00:21:12</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come your dad didn't participate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably because of the whole intermarriage thing; actually, definitely because of the whole intermarriage thing, not because Doreen is evil, but because of intermarriage, whereas my mom really didn't want to alienate him and stuff. Doreen walked herself down because she has both of her parents divorced and remarried, so she would have four parents walking her down the aisle. I guess I was also really confused because my dad was wearing the matching purple that all the family members were wearing and I was like, wait . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He'd be participating in something . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess for photos, mostly, but I assumed he would also be walking Cullen down the aisle if it was that big a deal if my mom was making that big a deal about me doing the reading. It was just wow — that is not fair that you do not participate in the wedding. You guys made me do it. 00:22:16</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. My mom made me do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe she couldn't make your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but she could make me, I guess. I guess maybe it's because if dad didn't, it would be even more of an insult. And maybe she didn't want Cullen to think all [homeric] (inaudible at 00:22:36) Jews hate intermarriage and are racist and whatnot. I'm not racist. If he had married anyone else who wasn't Jewish; but because it was Doreen and because Doreen is a proven sociopath . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't like her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not about her religion; you don't like her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't want Cullen to think blah, blah, blah. It's your marriage, blah, blah, blah, that I'm also being because of religious reasons, so that's why I did it. And I've never told Cullen that I hate Doreen. Cullen doesn't know that I hate Doreen; Doreen doesn't know that I hate Doreen. My parents know that I hate Doreen. 00:23:27</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were really mad at your parents. How was it for you to make it through the day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't the most horrible thing ever. It was actually a nice ceremony and I had Sydney next to me so we could make snarky comments about things, like when they were giving the mass and Cullen was like, "I promise to love you whether or not we're on the East Coast or the West Coast, and if I have to . . . " blah, blah, blah. I'm like, "He left out the part about will he still love her if she ends up in jail for mass murder." I don't think he knows that she's evil. I don't think she'd actually end up in jail for mass murder, but she turns into a sociopath against him. I could make the snarky comments to Sydney. 00:24:19</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It helps you blow off a little steam.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did. And then we had the cocktail hour and we were both sitting looking at penguins and stuff. It was at the aquarium. I guess I left that out, didn't I? (laughs) It was at the aquarium. We had the aquarium to ourselves for the evening. There were lots of penguins, so I was looking at penguins.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool setting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a cool setting and it was cool that there was something to do and we got to go in and all and what if we just showed up in formalwear to someplace that hosts weddings and be like, "Oh, we're with the wedding," and we get into the place for free. They didn't say, "Oh, who are you?" at the wedding or anything. It was just like, "Oh, yeah, wedding. Formalwear. Of course." So it was a nice setting and they had a table zero and stuff and Sydney was all like, "Oh, they zero indexed it," and I was like, "Yeah." And I stayed with my relatives and Sydney liked my family, because this was the first time he met my extended family and stuff, like Cullen and Doreen. We were staying with all of the relatives and they were all like, "You should come to visit." We might go at some point. So it was okay; I'm still bitter, though. I am still bitter about the fact that I had to participate in the wedding and dad did not. [00:25:55] Because the reasoning was what will the family think, not "what will really, really hurt Cullen's feelings if dad isn't participating in the wedding and someone else needs to because otherwise he'll be completely alienated from the family. " It was what will the family think. I was like, "You're the one that cares about that," you know? 00:26:26</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you made it through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I made it through. Now she's a member of my family and that's really scary. I will have to see her every Thanksgiving from now until forever, unless I don't go to Thanksgiving at my parents' house or they ever go to Thanksgiving at her family. No, they wouldn't, because what they do is they go to Thanksgiving at my parents' house and then her parents also live there, so they go and visit. It would never not be — they would be at both places. There is no way they would ever not be at both places. There is no way I would ever not see them unless I was elsewhere for Thanksgiving. [00:27:09] and I guess a part of it is that he knows that I have a reason for thinking they were evil but they were nice to him when they met him, so I'm kind of thinking I don't really have an ally any more. He doesn't think I'm lying. He knows all the things that Doreen has done. I told him that [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:39) about it. He knows that Cullen has been a douche to me because I'm [hasidic] (inaudible at 00:27:45) and he even can see how Cullen could be a douche just from his manners; but because he likes to believe the best in people and stuff, it's just like . . . 00:27:54</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On your list of evil things that Doreen has done, when was the most recent?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the most recent of things I actually know that she has done probably was four years ago or so at least so, yes, it's been four years, but the thing is that you're mostly grown up by the time you get to college. I mean there is some additional brain development, but if you're doing sociopathic things in college, you should have grown out of it by college. Right? 00:28:29</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know how she thinks or how she behaves, but it's possible that she's mellowed over time or gained some perspective. Yes, the brain development as far as areas of the brain, that's done. Most brain development is complete by adolescence, so you're talking college. You're constantly building synapses and learning new material. Your brain is "plastic", it's never fixed; but, yes, your frontal lobes are fully developed, that type of thing. But it has been, since you've been in that contest with her, it's been a long time and maybe I wonder if she's gained some perspective or at least mellowed out a little bit, which may be part of what other people are seeing or in more frequent contact with her. 00:29:30</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the canary thing was more recent than how she was thinking the whole "Ooo, they need these canaries for research. Isn't this the cutest thing ever?" That was Thanksgiving 2009 or 2008. It was either two or three — it was three years ago, and so maybe the canaries weren't then, but her thinking it was the cutest thing ever was only three years ago and being proud of the whole "hiding the guy's car". In college if there was someone they didn't like, she and some other people took his car and then somehow and then it was snowing & hid it under snow. He couldn't find it and he couldn't find it and he ended up filing a police report and then in the spring when the snow thawed he found it. Of course, the car was probably totaled because it had tons and tons of snow on top of it. That one might have been a few years ago; but she was proud of this — not remorseful or anything — proud of this three years ago, a little bit less than three years ago. Thanksgiving 2009 she was still proud of it, so I don't know if she's actually mellowed out that much since that or not. Maybe, but she still think that maybe canaries is cute and that stealing people's cars is fun. I'm not completely crazy in thinking that she's evil. It's not like I want to let go. On the one hand I kind of do want to be able to prove to Sydney is evil but I don't want to go and hang out with her and Cullen for an extended period of time and see how evil they are because . . . 00:31:30</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really don't like her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't like her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now she's my sister-in-law and that's kind scary. I've really come to the realization that yes, she actually is my sister-in-law.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not something you have control over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not. If I'm excluding myself from my family would she no longer be my sister-in-law or can you only emancipate yourself from your family if you're under the age of 21 or something or under the age of 18?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's a legal definition. It doesn't really have anything to do with what it feels like you. 00:32:08</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I might feel free of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would it be different for you if we gave it a different word? She's not your sister-in-law.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't feel different unless it was also that I was not in contact with my family or anything like that. I'd have to disown my family in practice and not just in theory in order to do that, and I still can't do that. I'm still so really, really, really worried about the job thing, not that I haven't found any jobs that I liked. A couple of days ago I got another rejection e-mail from this office assistant position that I applied to a little bit back. I don't know, maybe I should just use this time to focus on getting in shape; but I also need a job so I feel guilty about spending money and stuff. 00:33:08</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So have you looked at the postings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I looked last Monday and there really didn't seem to be anything that was good. There were some things that were like okay, I might apply for; but there was nothing like, "Wow, this would be really awesome."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you didn't apply for those or you did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did not. I mean last week we were also moving Sydney into the new place and I was going kind of crazy from all that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so it's Monday again and you looked today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because we got back from the hotel, figured out that his car had been towed, we were worrying about it a little while at home and I was trying to get my W2 from [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:49) so I can send it to state health and complete my application for them; then we went and looked for the car and it wasn't there, and then we came back, and then I came here. So, now I'm all panicked because I've not had time to look at job postings. 00:34:04</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then that goes on the list for tomorrow, so after this you can go and actually get the car?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I am actually going to get the car and I guess I could kind of look at them on my phone while I'm on the bus. I wouldn't be able to apply for anything or even really bookmark them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you have time to do it tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. I have work tomorrow but I could do it after work because I have the whole afternoon; because I usually get off work sometime between two and three. I have time, in theory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn't need to be an entire afternoon. You can set a limited goal for yourself of spending an hour, which would give you time to work, come home, look at the listings, eat, even have a half hour to walk. There is a lot of time between two or three and when you go to bed or even when it gets dark — (chuckles) set the bar back a bit. 00:35:11</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to be walking after it gets dark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're efficient with your time you can fit these things in and have a balanced day; here is time for you to relax, time for you to work, time to look for work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just hard making that time after myself and stuff and just doing it, especially because I'm always hanging out with Sydney. Maybe if I went to a different room. It was like I don't get to go [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:46) an Internet or something unless he was also ready to look for jobs. I mean he's getting better now because he's finally on the right medications. It only took . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounded like he was pretty active this week. I mean just being able to make it through the wedding . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: He made it through the wedding and then we left about nine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He walked with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Walked with me to get the car because we needed the car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he did it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He did it. It was still like yesterday I was still sort of freaking because he was still tired and it was hard to get him to . . . we need to go to the hotel. I need to have time to change and do my makeup and do my hair, and I was afraid I was going to have to possibly go alone and it took a lot of coaxing to get him there, but he finally did it and he was okay after that for the most part. He's still going up and down. He was fine with the move and I didn't end up actually helping with the move other than driving the car so he could have the car and the U-Haul van. 00:36:56</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he was able to do the rest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also bugged him because he was planning on hauling everything by himself. At first I was sitting by car while he had therapy, but after therapy I was like, "You need to call your friends." So I made him . . . so he sent out a blast e-mail to a bunch of his friends and then three of his friends ended up coming over and helping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So just comparing that to when you moved his stuff into your house, it sounds like he's doing a little bit better; and you're being assertive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because then it was just like, "I refuse to do this again. I can't lift anything this time. I don't want to watch you have to lift all the things you need help. I swear; you really do. Ask your friends and offer them pizza," and it worked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you. I'm glad you were able to get him to help himself rather than you doing all of it. 00:37:50</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I also posted things to my friends. One of my friends was able to, by the time I would have been picking him up, they actually were done with all the stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your friends helped out before; but you enabled him to reach out for other people to help support him and he was able to do some of that on his own, which is good feedback. It takes some of the pressure off of you which probably feels like a relief and allows you to do other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was nice not to have to move anything myself and just relax — actually not relax — make dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's focus on kind of doing what you did for him, for you. One step at a time focusing on what you can do and so, for him, it's "what are the steps to getting moving?" For you, it's "what are the steps to making sure you can get different things done in your day?" You want to take advantage of this momentum you have on exercising. You want to get back to looking at the jobless things. It doesn't have to be all-consuming; it can be find an hour and make that happen for yourself. Let me stop there for today. We are on for our regular time next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was the week that we are moving it to 12:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that is next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is next week, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I just know out of habit that I'm going to see you at 1:30, but I think you're right. Next week is the thirteenth, and that is 12:30 and then back to normal on the 20th.</p>

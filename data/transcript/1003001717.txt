<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess they wish (inaudible at 0:39:19.0) a lost cause. They sort of told me. I was thinking of moving to Sante Fe because my sister and her husband are out there. And I've always liked New Mexico. And somebody told me don't go to New Mexico because a lot of people go there just — they just fake out he said. And it's just an excuse. New Mexico is an excuse for people. (Laughs) (inaudible at 0:39:45.5) that would be that way for you. Like you would just be running away from things here (inaudible at 0:39:50.8) Well like they said, the weather is nicer out there than in New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:39:58.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't think I'd really be running away. I'm pretty honest with myself. And I don't think that I'd escape just like that to another town. I mean I kid myself that everything would be rosy out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like (inaudible at 0:40:20.5) if you could just get into a different environment it would just be better for you. Like sort of like well you'd still have the problems but they just wouldn't be so pressing. It just wouldn't be so real for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well — yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what keeps you here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In New York? Well —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:40:39.9) from the other side of that like maybe if you stayed here, you could work on these things (inaudible at 0:40:44.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. I don't think that that's what's keeping me here. I — well my parents and my sisters (inaudible at 0:40:53.0) my three sisters and the other two live here. And, I don't know. I just — I'm just — I feel like New York is my home. And there are — my friends — most of my friends are here. And I still care about them and want to be near them I guess. [0:41:10.7]</p>

<p>But, like also New York is a city that I'm — I know the streets and everything too. (Laughs) I mean that's — it wouldn't be easy to learn the town. Like I just feel like it's home and I don't want be (inaudible at 0:41:27.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the feelings being home? Does that — like it's — so this is (inaudible at 0:41:33.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Probably security. I'm safe. It's — I know the city.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about how (inaudible at 0:41:40.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well one of them, she's a girl. She's thinking of moving out of town. She moved to New York three years ago. I met her at school in the East. And she moved to New York. And from what she's told me, she planning to move out west because she doesn't like New York anymore. So she asked me if I wanted to move out there with her. (Laughs) And I said I'll think about it just to placate her. [0:42:10.5]</p>

<p>But, she's thinking of moving away. And, I have — my other girlfriend, she says she's always going to move to another town but she's never done that. But I don't know if — deep down I don't think if she moved out of town I'd feel like I'd have to leave too. She's not — I guess she's not really the main reason that I'm staying here. Well I mean she's a comfort and good friend and —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are those the only people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well of my two main — my female friends. Of my male friends, I feel about my female friends. I don't think they would be the reasons that I'd stay here. Like Rob is in Alabama. Remember I told you he's in school down there. [0:43:09.9]</p>

<p>And, I don't know. If he were in New York, I don't know if he would be the (inaudible at 0:43:20.8) reason that I'd stay here. It depends on how we'd be getting along too. But like if I really wanted to push him out of my life (ph) and just not see him anymore, I might move out of town. If I was really — if I felt that he just was always there (inaudible at 0:43:39.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it sort of (inaudible at 0:43:43.8) than to be somewhere else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe because he's from (inaudible at 0:43:52.3) around. His relatives live there but some of his relatives are really (ph) — but I don't know. It might be. But he's not here now so I don't know (Laughs) if that would make any difference. [0:44:09.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it (inaudible at 0:44:11.5) that you stay in New York? It's like that relationship is still somehow alive because it all happened (inaudible at 0:44:18.8) Like you'd be -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's alive. I guess maybe I would be thinking mentally about it because we're in New York. But, I don't think that would be the reason I'd (Laughs) want to stay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think that would keep you from going away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. In fact I think if I did feel so sentimental about it and we were separated or broken up, I think would want to leave town. (Laughs) You know just to be in a different place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel so crazy about (inaudible at 0:44:50.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this is another thing that I keep wondering about in my mind. But he — like I said, he's just very calm about things. And he said to me, he said well our futures are tied up and everything because of Adrian. He said it's — he said I guess we're never going to be separate people (inaudible at 0:45:16.4) strangers again. But that was just because of Adrian but I feel differently. I mean I feel if two people just don't get along and say they have a child, they have — if they — if either one of the people don't want to have any communication with the other I think it's possible for them to be — [0:45:43.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like it's (inaudible at 0:45:46.8) to you that the only reason he really feels tied to you is because of Adrian. And he's still saying that he's tied to you so that independence (inaudible at 0:45:55.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well then I — well he says he still cares for me and all this type of thing. But I mean I guess you were saying it in the sense that — well my — that is — after Adrian was born and everything, I said that — I mean he didn't have to necessarily be there. He didn't have to (inaudible at 0:46:32.3) because of certain things. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:46:40.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this, as I said last time when, if he was different. If he would change or if he had worked on improving certain parts of his character, I suspect I'd really want to be with him. But now it's sort of the thing, now I am wondering does a person settle for — with someone (inaudible at 0:47:17.4) or do they try and help the person improve? Or just what do you do about that now? [0:47:24.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:47:25.2) probably a little of both.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that what you — what would you would do example?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's what I'd do. How does that feel? If you try as well as you can -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To help him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if things went really badly and you were (inaudible at 0:47:48.0) what would you do if it was really bad for you? What you say you've done all you could and to heck with it? Or would you say well, this is what the person is and just if you want to have any relationship with him you'll go along with it? [0:48:02.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It probably depends on how you wanted to feel. Well like if it's real bad on you so much that you can feel it (inaudible at 0:48:09.8) And this (inaudible at 0:48:13.1) eventually (inaudible at 0:48:14.3) Probably if it's still there then maybe it can very, very much (inaudible at 0:48:24.7) I don't think you've tried everything you can (inaudible at 0:48:28.3) tried so long. Like sometimes you think you've tried as much as you can and —</p>

<p>[Break in tape from 0:48:32.7 to 0:48:54.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I also I think I've tried to see myself with each different person or relationship. I just — not some much — I never really tried to have them all alike. But I am (inaudible at 0:49:11.7) compare them. But I really don't see how it could be all alike with all the different people. [0:49:18.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So what (inaudible at 0:49:23.0) you feeling that more or less you're pretty generous and kind with people that they can't help to (inaudible at 0:49:29.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of it's a war going on. Sometimes I — like I feel I don't want to talk to any stranger or anything like that. So I (inaudible at 0:49:40.4) Another thing is I guess I have to handle or learn to handle or learning to trust my moods.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:49:50.8) like do you think that many people differ that much between what they say and what they do? Or just what they think for example and what they actually do? Like say what somebody really thinks about a situation and then what they really do, do you think that many people differ? [0:50:13.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:50:13.1) can you give me an example?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. All right. Let's say — oh, this is a real rough one. Say, on Mother's Day or on Valentine's Day for example say you want to — you know you have to get, say your parents for example, you have to give your mother a box of candy and go out there and be with them. You know your parents. But you really say in your mind, you don't want to get her a box of candy. And you try to be with your parents and that type of thing. You understand better what I mean? Do you think a lot of people think (inaudible at 0:50:52.2) say things differently than what they actually do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just — let me just — let me try to say again what you're saying. See if I have it right. You feel that sometimes - sometimes what you think about in your mind about a person or a situation, what you say to yourself or what you think in your mind isn't actually what happens. It's not actually what you do to the person or say to the person in reality. Is it possible that you're talking about like feeling sort of angry or (inaudible at 0:51:26.7) or something with somebody? You're feeling like you have to be nice to them. [0:51:30.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That way too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean (inaudible at 0:51:33.5) with what they say and what they actually do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think (inaudible at 0:51:39.8) everybody is (inaudible at 0:51:41.0) But I think it's a question of (inaudible at 0:51:43.1) So I guess it's -I think it's a natural —</p>

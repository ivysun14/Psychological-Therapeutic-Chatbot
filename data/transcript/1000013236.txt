<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 7. Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good evening. I'm not even tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not even tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't? You must be getting used to it. Did you close that other night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 00:30) No, I got fired. They told me I wasn't working hard enough so I couldn't come back, so got to get another job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Got to get another job?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I missed you on Wednesday. I just wanted to say that I'd appreciate it if you'd call if you're not coming.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know. As far as I knew on Wednesday I was coming until - we worked until about 7 o'clock and there was no way I could call.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There wasn't a telephone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was no telephone there. Either way (inaudible at 1:07) and I couldn't take off to go find a phone, so I'm sorry if I kept you waiting. But I was kind of mad because they worked out really without telling us what we were going to do there so... And then I tried to call about 8 o'clock and nobody was here. It was too late by then. </p>

<p> I was talking to a psychiatrist today that my lawyer recommended for the purpose of testimony in court and I was amazed we talked for 2 1/2 hours. And I didn't really get tired of talking but my voice got real sore, my throat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you getting therapy from him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. Just a kind of - I kind of assume that it wouldn't be in the best interest in this situation to have kind of like a court situation imposed on delaying (ph) like where someone would have to testify like you would, and I don't think that would work out too well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I agree. [2:57]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this other guy, this Kibler, he still hadn't sent my lawyer any reports and so my lawyer just dug up his own. So I doubt if that guy's for sure a doctor. Seemed kind of weird because I almost let go more talking to him than I do here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Somehow you felt freer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It bugs me sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What bugs you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I can't let go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's something about here that makes you feel tired?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what that is or if you know what it is or what...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think part of it is that sometimes I kind of wonder if you really can see things in that (ph) way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking about see as far as seeing, sight or  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It was kind of a slip, but understanding is what I meant. That's an interesting slip.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said that was an interesting slip. Maybe it kind of carries over, you know. I kind of assumed you can't see it.[5L92]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaning you assume it because I can't  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: If you could just use a visual  - </p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - S-E-E.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you would have understanding, and I confused you on it. And sometimes I get really discouraged because I keep coming in here with the same old bull.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Same what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The same old bull.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of tiring. Like I usually feel pretty rotten and you said something about the only times that you can get it out. I don't like to do that with talk, because that's good and everything, it gets it out, but to me it doesn't seem to be making progress like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes it sound like emptying the bottle that's full of that, but it always gets filled up again so that you don't get any more. [5:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm blank. Not thinking about anything. Trying to get a kind of a job as a truck driver. I think that would be fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say it would be fun to drive the truck around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because on a construction job I was doing a lot of truck driving. I wasn't supposed to; it was all illegal, but I had to do it anyway. It was part of the job. I blew one of them up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Blew the truck up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which wasn't too good. It was a 240 and it just couldn't take it the way I drove it. I wasn't really driving it that hard. It wouldn't start so they had to push start, and after they push started it we loaded it and it took us an hour to load it. And then we had some other work to do so we let it sit and it got real hot but it was running. And then I drove it home, back to the shop while it was real hot. And I thought that once we got going it would cool off, but it didn't, so it blew up, and the boss didn't like that too much. [8:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you weren't too concerned about it after the way it was sort of amusing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it was a ball. Somebody did it. There's a guy named Chad at work. He says if they ever put me driving one of those trucks I'm going to blow it up. There's two old trucks, an old GMC and an old Ford. And the day before I blew up the Ford, the other guy blew up the GMC (laughter), so there's two blown up trucks sitting over at the shop. I wondered so now I had to shake off, had to take all the forms off that they wanted. They didn't do that while I was coming; probably did that today. Had to take all the forms off and then they towed the other one over to a jobsite, loaded it, because it wouldn't run by itself. I had kind of a ball and some good work They were working late, we worked until 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was kind of easy, it was fun? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess I made it a little too easy and that night I was kind of loading things so I can't be - I still had a ball.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't mind much getting fired?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At first I did. At first it really kind of hurt, because I thought I was doing pretty good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were surprised.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because they didn't say anything about it not - not doing good enough, the whole two weeks I was there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now all of a sudden.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the last day, last Friday, this guy says, "You like this kind of work, Joseph"? And something sounded funny you know, and I said, yeah. And he says, "Well, you're not doing too good you know," and then I thought, oh, here it comes, something about what I did. He says, "You know, you can't block the wall too good." Blocking the wall is blocking eight inch walls with the forms. And I said, well, I just need a little practice. And he said, "Well, you're still not doing too good, I'm going to have to let you go."</p>

<p>[Telephone ringing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello? Yes, I do. Okay, good bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you a little nervous?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You seem a little nervous tonight, very tense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I was with that phone call because I didn't want to talk to that person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like your mind was on something else.[10:47]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't think my mind was on something else. I mean I don't think - I don't feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something seems different tonight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what was happening to me is I was sitting here wondering how well I understand you. That's what I was thinking about before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. </p>

<p> COUNSELOR: I was sitting here trying to figure out how well I understood how you would have felt about losing a job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. It really did hurt at first. I just kind of shrugged it off and I looked to the other job, and even though I liked it I don't want to work something late like that again, so it's really no great loss. And I'm kind of glad to be out of there because they did kind of push you a lot, especially during the [romp ups] (ph) and I don't want to go through that kind of work; too skinny. I don't know, it seems like sometimes when there's a conflict going on in my mind, the ground (ph), a very strong feeling some kind of - that it's not easy to talk and it just doesn't matter right now.[13:22]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's more like nothing too active is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, everything's kind of calm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So employment comes, I don't exactly get that feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think what it was is that I got most of the rotten feeling out today talking to that other guy, and so the rotten feeling is dead and it's just lost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're not used to not having the rotten feeling around to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's good really. It's different </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It also sounds like you couldn't talk back, like you had three and a half hours of talking already today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, my voice isn't sore any more. Well, (inaudible at 14:44) like mostly criminal, bank robbery, and my relations with my parents and my girlfriend, other people, and just how I felt in general. And I feel happy about the way it turned out because it seemed like he got a pretty good idea of exactly what was going on inside of me and it was very surprising because even though he asked some questions like - he seemed really perceptive, and it was completely different from the way Dr. Kibler would ask a question. I liked it. [15:44]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I liked it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Well, the conference turned out real good because he was tuning in to you there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he could ask me a question about something I was thinking that I couldn't even say. I mean like the thoughts would be there but they wouldn't be readily accessible, and just a question would bring them out, and he just happened to know which questions to ask.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like things you couldn't say on your own but you could to say (inaudible at 16:19) was like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just thought how it would feel to have a thousand horse turbine under my car and just really step on the gas. [16:48]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really have all that power?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not just so much the power - well, yeah, kind of like the power but to be able to kind of lose contact with the ground. I always did like that when I could do that with my Olds, but this car, that would be different, because I would set it up totally different; it would be done right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But speed it up and I won't be flying, but not quite  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: You will be flying. Using the identical setup that I would use, a guy has a world record for the eighth of a mile; did 180 miles an hour in an eighth of a mile in a tenth of a block. No, it is a block. Is that right? What is it, [pro rests] (ph) are now eight blacks to nine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eight large and fourteen (ph) small.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 17:45). It takes them three blocks to stop. I feel good just talking about nothing. That was kind of like a dream I just had, putting a turbine in my car. It's a simple operation. It's expensive but it's simple. You can just replace the rear axle with this higher turbine center and you don't have to worry about gas mileage because you don't use gas in this. Liquid propane I think [18:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's some really hairy fuel. And you get a great big five gallon tank of it under pressure and then it lasts you like 15 seconds. I saw that girl yesterday again in the hospital and I don't know. I felt the strangest urge to just run up and hug her and kiss her and it's really weird. (Inaudible at 19:03)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But just like very sudden and very attracted to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like she was really cool, even though she knows her brain's all going - got some - got holes all over it. She doesn't really know where she is half the time and she's hallucinating all the time. She's still a really cool kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it was like a rush of affection that you don't usually feel towards people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't all at once, it was just like the more I would contain it, the more I would be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, the stronger it would get.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was so tempted at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was that tempting. She's so close, because we were cleaning out her hypodermic needle, how ridiculous. If I get caught in there I get about six months at least just for that, and then on top of that they'd screw me for the bank, more over, you know.. On top of being a bank robber, he's a dope addict. That's obviously not true from my point of view, but it wouldn't look that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They wouldn't know that, yeah.[20:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So she's in this hospital and the rooms are supposedly as far as the only - only for the two occupants that are in it. Nobody else is allowed in there except maybe family. Go out in the day room and the corridor's your room. So I'm in her room and then we were both in her bathroom with the door locked, cleaning out this hypodermic needle with the alcohol and matches and everything else to keep it clean, yet unplug it. And we're sitting there and I thought, what am I doing here? You know, I could get really messed up for this. And then we were kind of talking about  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you were kind of worried about it, but at the same time, that the worries sound sort of distant or something, like you were enjoying for what's beauty there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't really enjoying her. But she was - it's kind of sickening, cleaning out your IV every - but she was so kind of like innocent really and so kind of trusting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And trusting of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because this girl has been really hurt by a lot of guys and, you know, she's a nice today. Even though I kind of get real quiet sometimes around her because she only likes certain kinds of records and I usually hate them, so I sit there and listen to her. She'll say, isn't that nice, isn't that nice, and I'll say, yeah, it was nice. Really kind of a putdown answer, but she doesn't take it like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though you're not too nice to her, she's really nice back and there's some kind of na�ve quality about her, too. [22:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, both ways. She's using. She is very intent on ripping off a pharmacy, stealing from a pharmacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stealing what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stealing from a pharmacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like sort of amphetamines and cocaine, barbiturates, anything else she can get her hands on because it's like her life drug. And she also was about to give them to another friend of hers, because he's also in the hospital in kind of a tighter situation than she is so she really knows how it feels, and so do I. He's a cool guy so... She wants to get into a pharmacy and she's trying to get me to tell her all these ways to get into the pharmacy at the hospital. So we went down there and looked it over. The whole time I was thinking, oh, I was just thinking that I could get six or seven months in there, back in prison.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were thinking it the whole time, but there was something that kept you there doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't the intrigue, because there was no more intrigue. That part of my criminal life is over. It's no longer intriguing to steal something or to plan to steal something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No longer exciting. [23:47]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It was more like, I don't know. She was definite. She wanted to do it. She wanted to get into that pharmacy and just find out where the good stuff was and get out of there. And I think I was more intent looking at the way she looked at it rather than really looking at it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Looking at it from inside of her and seeing her, what she wanted you to do that - and why it would help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But almost being more like her than thinking of it from your point of view.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If it would have been from my point of view, I would have got out of there. We were doing all kinds of crazy stuff. There was an ambulance that pulled up and emergency parties and all these dudes got out and went in with the patient and left the ambulance sitting with one of the doors open. Lucky she wasn't looking for any needles. Right out in the middle of nowhere - I mean out in the middle, in the open, kind of. Now that I think about it, man, I get crazy. I could get busted or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you were doing it, now that you think about it it seems you were crazy. But I'm not even sure like do you think like you wouldn't do that, or is it still something you'd do if you were out there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd do it again. There's something involving fun about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably as dangerous as robbing a bank.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there something about taking the risk that's interesting? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. I think mostly what it was was we were walking all over the hospital and I was looking in all these new places that I'd never seen before. And I had been in the hospital and I didn't even know half these places existed. So we were out there in the hall just walking around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just exploring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And at the same time, casing the place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was like an adventure. [26:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at the same time I was not even casing it, even though I was kind of pretending that I was casing it, because I had no intention of robbing anything. And so that's kind of what made it fun. Because even though I was down there, if anyone could have kind of read my thoughts they would have - not read my thoughts, but I mean if I would have been on like closed circuit TV the whole time we were down there it would look like we were really going to knock the place out, and maybe that was her intention but that wasn't my intention. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it was like the discrepancy between how it would look to everybody and how it really was inside of your mind. It was like playing a game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Correct. This song keeps going right through my mind, I hear it on the radio. It's only an FM stations. There's a couple songs, and they're all sung by male vocalists, and in approximately the same keys that I can easily get. And so when I hear it in my mind I imagine myself singing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So right now you can imagine yourself singing that song?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being that vocalist? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'd like to be that some day if I may, get sane enough to hold onto a job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to sing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I think what I mean, instead of saying I have to hold onto a job, I didn't mean that. I meant like stable enough to be able to sing without having to reflect the song anything that would leave kind of like compatible with me. Like now when I sing along, well, not so much now, but before I used to kind of pick out songs that would reflect the mood I was in. And it would seem like they would - usually the mood I was in was kind of self-pitying and it would amplify my self-pity to sing along with the songs and I don't know if I can sing like that. Seems kind of useless.[28:57]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't - it just seems like building up to feeling sorry for yourself which seems useless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can do that all by myself and with (ph) these songs. But when I feel kind of good, or even when I feel just kind of crazy and I want to sing something, then the song seems very natural to me, because it's like I'm on the - to kind of - not so much - just kind of get it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Express it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't do that. I can't sing too much with other people around, like hardly at all. Sometimes I sing when my girl's around, but that's about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You care if someone hears your song?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and that bugs me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't because you aren't because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't know. I become conscious of their presence rather than of my singing. [30:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You forget about - you can't just concentrate on your singing but you know that they're listening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I saw somewhere where when someone is self-conscious, he's really not self-conscious, he's conscious of someone else. He loses himself rather than becomes conscious of himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what happens to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's much easier with the headphones on. Turn the volume way up with the headphones on and you can't even hear yourself sing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can't hear it, then you don't think about it. However, if you don't  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just hear it. Yesterday morning I was sitting there practically screaming outside because I couldn't hear myself because I had it turned up so loud in the headphones. And whatever did come through came through as my blending in if the song was already there and so it didn't stick out so I could sing. After a while I kind of realized, hey, I'm really singing louder than I'm singing good. It was really different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So as long as it doesn't stick out, then you can sing really well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Too nervous; I'm playing with this ring. Had my girl's ring on a chain around my neck and it's fun to play with a lot. This is always something to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you nervous right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm kind of looking for something to do. Talking to that guy, and I talked to him until about 4:30 again, and then I drove around Longhair looking for a restaurant, not a very good restaurant. I finally found a McDonald's; good bit of my suburban kind of store which wasn't in middle class suburbia like I wanted it. But anyway, I went in, ate my lunch - no, I bought it and I went down to the lake and ate it; took a while to get down there, and then came back and just sat around town. [32:30]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems that you're restless with this time on your hands.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's how I was getting my language out. That guy showed up for my appointment at quarter to 6. Because of what I had to do and I didn't want to drive all the way home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you don't have to drive, there's just nothing to fill up the time with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. My mind isn't creative enough to imagine something and I don't usually have enough money to follow through with my imagination anyway. So I sit down there in the lobby every night. Learned a lot about skunks, at least that's what I think it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a matter of filling up your time, trying to put things into it that are interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just hit me this week that my girl is going away to college in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that you're really going to miss her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just thought how really much I think about her and how much it means to me to have her around and that I'm going to miss her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound like something really important is going to be going. [33:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I would have committed suicide if I wouldn't have had her, just because I had a girlfriend I think that was - that kind of did it because it made me think that it's not only me that I have to think about. I have to think about how it is going to affect her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you commit suicide it wouldn't just be you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it would affect her I guess. At first that bothered me because it made her seem kind of like a burden, like she was tying me to this life (ph), but now it seems really neat because it seems like almost - like there's more to my life than just the little shallow world that I'm in. You know, someone else is home that is really important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gives it more meaning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think her going to college is going to hurt a little bit but it's going to make me see how much - not making me see but kind of keep reminding me how really important it is to have other people around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you realize how much you will miss her when she's not there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So even though she's going away, you're really grateful that you have her. That you had her. [35:45]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And even if it does split us up kind of, I'll always remember her. I was kind of thinking that, waiting to come up here, and I tried to call her and found out that she was out shopping. But I was just going to call her and tell her how much I love her. I've never done it before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you'd really like to let her know that when you feel it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Thinking this week how afraid I get around people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid you get what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How afraid I get around people. I can almost hear the frowns. I was afraid of someone frowning at me like. Even when they smile, I'm still afraid, because I'm always looking for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're very sensitive to whether they're feeling smiling and towards, and going over towards you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really. That's not it. No, it's more insensitive, because I'm insensitive to how they really feel and all I have to do is base my fear on them, or base my emotion on a fear that there will be a frown, and so I kind of guard myself expecting a frown always, and when the smile does come and the moral acceptance these days, I can't see it, because I'm still looking for the frown. [38:16]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're always or almost always expecting a frown. I'm sure it seems to you that people are going to frown around you, everyone is, I guess almost everyone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's much more likely that they'll do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But top (ph) like you say sometimes that way I miss them, I don't expect them to smile when they do, but like you know that but it doesn't - you still aren't expecting a frown.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. {Like I'd answer huh] (ph). I keep thinking about my girl, and I'm trying to tie these two together somehow. There's some kind of tie in there, I don't know why I try to do that, and she's real important in my life. Maybe I do that too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do what? Try tying things together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Trying to tie her to too much of me instead of me being an independent person and her being an independent person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it almost sounds like you want to be not independent of her, like you want to be really connected. [40:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that that makes me feel more secure, but when I was trying to do that I imagined that it would make me more secure, but when I finally feel that I have kind of tied her down to me and me down to her through talking or through making out or something. It seems so totally inadequate because it's like implying that I am nothing without her and she is nothing without me, and if you do it that way and you start adding things up it comes up that we are nothing together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, like zero.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Zero from zero is still zero.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't want that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like partly that's how you feel, though. Without her is like nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes. And then sometimes I feel really good and she tries to tie up to that and it spoils it. We've got to cut that out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you want to tie into her and sometimes  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like when I feel bad, I want to kind of like get her mood into me, and when I feel good, then she wants to get my mood into her, and all it does is succeed in destroying whatever feelings that are there and we are sliding apart from each other. [42:12]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you realize that that doesn't work and doesn't help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I haven't learned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't learned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but there's something that keeps you doing that. Like it almost sounds like when you're feeling bad you don't know how else to get feeling good, except you try to get that goodness from her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. [Come Kappa] (ph). It's like running away from the kremlins (ph). Like I'm done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can feel strongly that you try to stop that because you see it doesn't work, but that there's something really compelling in that to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like when I feel bad, it's not that I want her to feel bad and that's an exponality (ph) of good, because sometimes I just enjoy it feeling bad [ph]. It's just that I want to let her know how I feel. And I think that the logic I use is that if she knows, you know, if you're caught lying, that it's just what I do. But the reason is kind of like if I - if she knows how I feel then she can feel closer tonight and I'm like and I can feel close to her because it's like sharedness, (ph) but the way it usually turns out is that if I feel rotten and I try and share that with her, it ends up that she feels rotten too, and it spoils it.</p>

<p>[44:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you don't really want her to feel rotten.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Instead of sharing, it's kind of like imposing; like saying I feel rotten, then how can you dare feel good?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of in terms that you don't know a way to say to her or to somehow get to the thing of letting her know that you feel badly, but that still somehow each of you having your own moods.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you always end up feeling like you've imposed your mood on her and somewhat guilty, I guess, for ruining her mood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Because she doesn't feel rotten as often as I do, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're the one who does it more often.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually. Sometimes she has no idea what she feels until she's completely out of the house and we've been driving for a half hour and then she decides that she knows how she feels. Sometimes I can't see the change in the way she acts that kind of signals it. Maybe now she's a little bit closer to what she feels, and sometimes I can't see it. Just kind of like the little things she does, like the way she'll move her hand or something or the way she'll touch me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes you feel insensitive, is that what  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm kind of like a guy with pants two feet across trying to do needlework and it just doesn't work and it makes me feel very mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very clumsy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it feels like I'm bungling with something that really needs very sensitive care and something that I want to give very sensitive care to but I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you'd really like, it sounds like, is to be able to follow all of changes in mood. [46:29]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, and not so much to be able to understand it because that's  - you'd have to be a psychiatrist to even begin to do that, but I've kind of finally seen that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm finally seeing that I'd have to be a psychiatrist to understand people, but to be more accepting, accepted, and tolerant with me because sometimes I just - if there's a slight change, I not only can't see it, I resent it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's something about her - it's not what it's changing to, but that you don't want her to change?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I don't want to - well, it's not that I don't want it, it's just that I can't take it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It jars you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not expecting it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Like you can't  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there's no warning, nothing to get myself ready to clinch the big change when really I should be anticipating the change all the time or be open to it anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're caught off-guard for your comment (ph) to care, and then - it does sound like you feel jarred really. It's something you ought to be up to but you aren't quite up to. [48:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I keep expecting to have these therapy sessions - I keep expecting like to come out being a newly different person and with no traces of who I used to be and no traces of anything that had anything to do with the past, and I can just see a lot of it's impossible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what you hoped for is like you get washed clean or something like that, totally different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, didn't work that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now you can see...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That stuff about accepting and being able to accept yourself, that's the only way. I mean you can't just kind of bingo, new personality. It won't work out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you still have that same person inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like by coming here I would be trying to run away from myself when the purpose of this is not to run away, it's just the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To look into yourself or [deny to yourself] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I get too busy talking sometimes and ran away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you feeling that way then, running away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. But I have no respect sometimes. I kind of hide in a pariah (ph) of words. Like talking to that psychiatrist Monday. I don't remember any instances of him - with us in terms (ph) but that doesn't matter (ph). But today talking to that psychiatrist I notice that I would just drift all over on subjects. Like we'd be talking about parents and suddenly something about driving would come up, and then I would sidetrack that into something about my brother and then back into something about my girl. And to me it seemed oddly interrelated and maybe it was very coherent, but I don't know, maybe I was just getting at what was really important rather than what he was asking. But it seemed like I used much too much words. Like I was - [50:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you got that, but like you noticed a discrepancy in the questions he was asking and the way you were answering them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that it? That what you were answering was sort of going  - </p>


<p>PATIENT: I didn't mind that, because I figured - I just kind of let go. Not consciously, but just a need to let go. I don't know how or why but it just happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just relax.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And he would ask me a question about my father and I would bring up driving. Not really like that, but indirectly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you'd lead into it, yes. And if there was some quality in that that you felt  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought that was more valuable than if I had stayed on the question about my father. I hope I was getting more to the point that he might want. Again, all this wasn't conscious, it just happened, and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm getting a little confused because it sounds like before you were saying  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm contradicting myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. [52:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyways, it seems that I used so many words today to communicate things that really weren't that wordy. And it seemed like the reason this guy seemed so sharp was that he could pick out of all these words and all the little roundabouts that go into my speech that aren't too useful, and he can sort all those out and kind of chuck about half of it and keep the half that really meant something. And I heard a song, and I only heard like about two sentences of it. I don't even remember who's sang it our anything or even where I heard it, but there was one line in there, it said, "Oh, why bother talking when you can only speak lies," and I think I do that sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Speak lies?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it really actually hurts me, because then pursuing it to believing lies because it would start saying things, you'd start thinking the same thing. It's like talking yourself into something. I decided I talk too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like in a way you like the fact that you talked a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to have to put it in its place kind of though. Like, you know, a session like this, I think it would be a lot better when I just feel free to just stop, you know, but like in everyday life in talking to my girl or something  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I do that too often, I use too many words and it confuses her, confuses my girl, confuses my parents, confuses everyone, when really it seems plain to me when I've used so many words and so many different ways of expressing them that it loses something. [54:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying you're going to kind of shorten things up. And also it sounds like you feel that throwing in among all this that you say that some of this is really untrue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or things you're trying to talk yourself into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or things that I would like to believe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You somehow feel that if you say them that maybe they'll  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: True. Do you ever feel bad about losing your sight?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I do, but I think - what makes you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just wondering, because I know I would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does it feel like - well, I suppose it would - feel like you are really hampered by it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like you're really hampered by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it does. Well, it's the kind of a thing that sort of comes and goes, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it's funny. Like yes, I'm really hampered by it in certain ways, but at certain times I'm not much and sometimes I am. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's the kind of a thing that it's easier to accept than some other things, because it's obvious that I'm never going to have it, you know. Things that you're obviously never going to have are somehow easy to accept them sort of, they're dangling there, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to have to stop in about a minute or two. [57:04]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was just thinking about that plus (ph) brand new tires I bought for my car. They don't work right. Whenever I go around the corner too fast they peel over on the sidewall and they wreck the sidewall rather than stay on the treads and that makes me nuts. I'll have to change (inaudible at 57:25). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, we're finished up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'll see you Wednesday then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. At 7:00?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, do you want to come earlier since you don't have a job? </p>

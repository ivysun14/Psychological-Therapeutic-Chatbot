<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, my right hip has been hurting off and on since I had thyroid surgery.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I remember the thyroid surgery and your hip hurting after that but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It still [has been hurting] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now it's still hurting. That's terrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and especially if I'm sitting on a bus or sitting still on a plane, and I was on a bus yesterday so it really hurts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Back from [Chicago] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So the conference or...? So the conference [I went to] (ph) today...intensive workshop, which was really exhausting which I for some reason didn't think about in advance. So on the one hand I enjoyed the conference—or the workshop. It had a lot of really interesting things in it. It (pause) sort of hit some areas in which I'm already good at. It covered (inaudible) which I already know how to do. Those things were all very awesome. [00:01:19]</p>

<p>The certain (ph) problem was that we also (inaudible) we could apply [instead our home] (ph) institutions and I was just really bitter and angry. (pause) And it was hard...and [I know that's basically how I feel] (ph). I was finding it hard to talk about how this could be applied when the current insert is it would be gone. (pause) So that was frustrating. [00:01:58]</p>

<p>My (inaudible) was there and so it was interesting as she was also, she was just I guess less vocally annoyed as I was. (pause) And so one of the reasons why I was like, "Oh, maybe I shouldn't constantly bitch about work," is because I was thinking like, "Well, these are peers and they probably all know each other." And then day two, one of them, she's like, "Oh my husband works in the Ivy League systems. Oh, I know this guy, Chet and so he knows..." She gave Chet and another guy's name, (inaudible) it was like... (inaudible). I was like, "Wow! That's awkward. I should stop complaining." (chuckle) [00:02:48]</p>

<p>And then of course she also was like, "Oh, have you met this person? What do you think? Are they awesome?" And I just (pause) (inaudible) answer to that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Those people that you just mentioned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just...you know? (pause) It was just kind of awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially when she asked about Will Parr (ph). And I'm just like, "He moved to another location?" (pause) And also I had been talking to her, not using his name, about some project that he was driving me crazy with and then she brings him up. It's like, "Yes, he totally was that guy I was just insulting." [00:03:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. (pause) It was so funny. I found it really hard to not complain a lot. (pause) You know what I was thinking? I should probably stop. (pause) A—because it's not (inaudible) all the time. No one wants to hear that. And, if these are people who are potentially hiring people, (pause) that might not be the best impression. But it was really hard not to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're surprised by how hard it was not to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because going in I was thinking like, "Okay, discover something that I'm annoyed about." But (pause) it all something I'm interested in so I was thinking I'd be more able to concentrate on the parts I liked. What I didn't totally get is that I thought it was going to be more theoretical. [00:05:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it about? What was the conference about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so it's called Participatory Design—Participatory Design—and the person who sort of runs these workshops is an anthropologist who (pause) basically she studies anthropology of libraries. So she studies...she takes pictures of where people are, does maps, and then also has you do interviewing people about what they're doing and why they're doing it. You know, very open ended. "So, tell me about..." blah blah blah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, talking about (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's just a few doors down from what you did as an undergrad, right? Not the same but not so far away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my undergrad, yeah I did. I had required classes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) before mythology was described as the bastard child of anthropology in English. So it was interesting because I was interested in it and they started talking and I was like, "I know this! This is great!" And there was one person in the workshop who I found really frustrating. He was someone...he was a guy. There were two guys in the workshop and he just was a chronic interrupter. Like she would a question, we would raise our hands, he would just start talking. He would talk over people or stomp on sentences. Just very typical clueless guy behavior. [00:06:58]</p>

<p>So after the first day we went to interview a faculty member and the way that we set up is each person talk to this faculty member for ten minutes. So there are three of us—me, annoying guy, and another woman—talking to this faculty member each (ph). We can only talk for ten minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this a faculty member?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Well, no they were a [two part] (ph) faculty. So this was supposed to be practice at interviewing faculty to find out what their library needs are and [researching them] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We also video tape them. (inaudible) pick up on body language or things they are gesturing at. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know, (inaudible). So I was the last person to talk and he interviewed them twice to ask questions. Not just to sort of like, "Oh yes, this is (inaudible)." And afterwards (pause) (inaudible) I said something on camera (inaudible) and after I said, "I really didn't like you interrupting. I just think it wasn't very useful for the interview." And his response was, "Yeah, I know. I do that." That's it. No apology, just, "I do that." And as it turns out he also had training as an anthropologist because he's done...imagine doing (inaudible). [00:08:41]</p>

<p>I was like, "What the fuck? How the hell did you manage to do those considering you barely let people finish sentences?" Yeah, it was (pause) yeah. And then he mentioned some con (ph) about (pause) (inaudible) transcription...transcription services and that he had sent his off to some place in India. And my professor was like, "Yeah that might have violated ethical guidelines. (pause) And you're pretty much (inaudible)." Still kept on going. </p>

<p>(pause) But for me the sort of doing it part just reminded me of how frustrated I was. So like, we're talking to faculty and I'm like, "Yeah, I do enjoy talking to faculty." And then we had an exercise of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you frustrated because you never get to do that kind of thing at work or if you do it doesn't matter because (inaudible) it's going to be made use of anyway? [00:10:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. (pause) Some of my coworkers Karl and to a lesser extent Chet think it's inappropriate for me to talk to faculty members about what they might want? (pause) Which I find (inaudible). (pause) And then the next day we interviewed (inaudible) students. And what we did is we asked them to draw a floor of their ideal library. Like, you could have anything. And then we talked to them like, "What are these things that you want?" So it was really fun. We were just like drawing whatever and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And next time he wants somebody to write my papers for me.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, report with like (inaudible) 80 planners. Like, okay! And someone else, she was like, "I hate...I want to study alone. I hate when Kris is looking at me when I study. I just want it to be silent so I can talk out loud." I'm like, "Okay." She's really intense, very (inaudible), ideal silent study rooms with doors that lock. [00:11:21]</p>

<p>But yeah, I was pretty much like, "Oh this is great! Really interesting, what you like." And then we kind of all got pushed together and started tabulating common themes of what people wanted (pause) and I was doing that...we were doing that and I was like, "Wow, this is exactly...this is a lot of stuff that probably went into the focus groups for (inaudible) completely ignored. And I went to talk to my coworker [who can do this] (ph) and she's like, "Yeah that's when we do that (inaudible)." Damnit. (pause) It was just really incredibly frustrating. [00:12:09]</p>

<p>So apparently the university has this reputation (inaudible) for ignoring student input or anyone else's input. Yeah. And the workshop instructor actually directly commented and said [something like that] (ph). True. (cough) But I [ran] (ph) into someone else who (inaudible) and hated it (chuckle) which is great. But they (inaudible) and they wouldn't try to join them together. They just started scattering stuff around. [00:13:01]</p>

<p>So that was disheartening (ph). But yeah instead of like tabulation analysis which is then (ph) mean...like it just means that this room is (inaudible) complete disaster, even more so, than I think of it as being. And so I was working [for her] (ph) (pause) we sort of agreed that we wouldn't do any (inaudible) because we were both too bad (ph) at it so I suggested another room which is older, a little older. And that was a little frustrating too because that was another room we were thinking we'd get a lot of input from. It got some and it got some student input, a lot of which was ignored. It hurt because they started planning the room right when the economy collapsed so (inaudible) money but (pause) there were other things that (pause)...so they didn't do all of the things but other things like at this point they probably could do like putting posters on the walls. [00:14:23]</p>

<p>So it was kind of...because it was like, "Wow, this is pretty interesting." (inaudible) thinking of for revaluating the room. I just don't think that anyone is going to listen. And [I think some of my] (ph) coworkers will sort of talk to the group about that because I just think (inaudible) just really (pause)... (inaudible) empathy.</p>

<p>(pause) (sigh) So I don't know. I also griped about going to the workshop because it made me feel really shitty about my job and just sort of frustrated. (pause) When I like started talking to people I [was just thinking] (ph) about I just want to quit work, finish my master's degree (pause) because like yeah, it's only a year and a half but it's a year and a half of being really miserable. (pause) [00:15:47]</p>

<p>So (pause) I mean, that was (pause)...I don't know. All of these things I think about like (inaudible) intensive workshop and I'm still kind of thinking about (pause) the various ideas from it and how it can be applied. And one of the first things I thought of is when interviewing people is if we were thinking of my library they would have a hard time convincing staff to be videotaped because I think they would be worried that this would be used against them. (pause) And also relatedly (ph) good (inaudible) interviews and anthropology relies on a certain level of trust between (inaudible) and subject and (pause) I guess students probably put (inaudible). (pause) But for staff it's just so much stress has been lost (ph) and no one is doing anything about it (pause) and (pause) I don't know. Because (inaudible) about is this even a concept that would ever adapted to the university and even if it was, would it be successful considering all of the workplace problems and toxicity and rampant (ph) crappiness. [00:17:47]</p>

<p>So that was a little depressing because it was like wow, even if (inaudible) I really like doing but even if (pause) we try to I'm not sure how well it would work. (pause) And (pause) so (inaudible) first step, the instructor suggested, "When you go back to the university one of the first steps is to talk to your manager, supervisor, whoever it is above you," and (pause) that's not going to do anything for me. (pause) I don't know that going further up would do anything for me either. (pause) I don't know. I'm going to have to waste my time and (pause) I can think of it as being like, "Well next job, I can do X, Y, and Z." But it's just (pause) next job just doesn't feel...it just feels really far away. And especially since I'm really close to finishing, I also feel really discouraged by my workplace that it's hard to, I don't know, maintain any—not even enthusiasm—just finishing it-ness. </p>

<p>(silence from [00:19:46] to [00:20:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (pause) you're really worried about being overwhelmed by or stuck with how (pause) I guess it is miserable, angry, and disillusioned you are in your job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) And (pause) the workshop confronted you with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's just very (pause) with everybody talking about their other institutions and really interesting and cool things that everyone else is doing and that everyone else has been sent there by their institution who is interested in participatory design. I actually don't [know why they sent] (ph) (inaudible) especially since institutions are supposed to send us in pairs. And (inaudible) as a singleton. [00:22:15]</p>

<p>But yeah, it was just very depressing to have everyone, all these people (pause) being supported and not being (inaudible) and angry. (pause) And schools would applaud these resources, you know?</p>

<p>(silence from [00:22:42] to [00:23:53)</p>

<p>I mean the other things is in talking to people about various [designs and things] (ph) I've done at work, a lot of people were like, "Wait, why did that happen? That makes no sense. That's really dumb." Or like, "So (inaudible)" and just like reinforce, like yes, when describing it to someone else and they respond, it's kind of reminding me like, "Oh yeah, that was really crazy. Why are we raising that much money?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Maybe there's something here that you and I are...I don't think we...I think we agree about but that we're sort of seeing from sort of opposite points of view. Where you're struck by the way things from the conference confronted you with how shitty things are for you at work, like when you heard about how things were better at other places and how there was more interest and investment in the kind of stuff you're interested in at places with (inaudible) resources or how other people, when they heard what was going on, thought it was just as ridiculous as you always thought it was. So it's kind of like, "Oh fuck! This makes me feel sort of how more awful it is." And (pause) I guess part of what is striking me is ways you keep some distance from feeling that way until something like this happens. I think not that you don't know it but that somebody agrees with you and then you have faith that you were really right about it which you kind of lost a little bit in some way. Or you hear about how things are better somewhere else and it sort of brings home a new light how lousy things are where you are as though you weren't quite in touch with that in the same way before. Do you see what I mean? [00:26:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) in a way I think it's pretty clear why you would be keeping distance from what it feels like at work in this way because it sucks and yet it's your job and you're there a good chunk of the day every day. So I think I get it to that extent but I also wonder (pause) about the threat that being more in touch with it poses like [do you think you're going to be more] (ph) depressed? Or will you'll just be overwhelmed and unable to go at all? You know, like, are you worried that you'll only get more mired in it the more you feel it? Like why is it something to keep at arm? [00:28:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, there are a bunch of things. One of them is also (pause)...I mean basically it reminds me...I remember when I did that (inaudible) (pause) and I sort of have to want to control everything in a really intense way. That's part of why getting moved is making me overly frustrated and upset. It's that's I'm getting moved. It doesn't matter what I want. It doesn't matter what works for me, just moved. (pause) And it just kind of went...not only am I thinking about how (pause) in some ways it goes by workplace [wants you to be] (ph) sort of like...my friend described it as me as a remote robotic arm. And my manger is like, "Go to X, Y, and Z." And I should go to X, Y, and Z without thinking about it, without needing to know why. Whether it works doesn't matter. I'm just supposed to go do the task. Which, among other things, (pause) (sigh) I sort of feel like you could get a student to do that. You could get a lot of people who want to do that. If that's all you want in an employee, it's kind of depressing but... [00:30:02]</p>

<p>(pause) It's just frustrating. I like to think that I can understand decisions and make some of my own and work on the fly and that's not encouraged. (pause) My other fear... [another concern of mine is] (ph) is answer honestly when asked. Rather, answering in a non-politic fashion when asked about somebody who you think of (inaudible). Because why I complained a lot, it's mostly to phrase (inaudible) (pause) things you probably should do, say to your manager. And I worry about going over the line to things I was told would get me fired if I wasn't in a union. [00:31:22]</p>

<p>More generally speaking, there's always a way for [a supporter] (ph)...if someone above you wants you fired there's always a way to do it. You know what I mean? (pause) (sigh) Which sucks. (pause) And also like, yeah I do...right now I've been thinking a lot about my involvement with the room and there's this working group that's supposed to whatever, whatever. And (pause) I just find it super frustrating because (pause) no one is willing to talk about (pause)...no one's willing to kind of even get close to saying, "Wow, I think this room design kind of doesn't meet our wishes. Maybe we should think about ways to work around these problems." [And I wasn't really told] (ph) by IT that I should not mention any problems that the room has. Like I shouldn't say that (inaudible) which makes me crazed in so many ways. [00:32:55]</p>

<p>(pause) And so [when it bothers me] (ph) that they're kind of like, "Well, [I am] (ph) responsible for this room. No organize (ph) in this god damn room so I guess I should go." But lately I've been thinking maybe I shouldn't because it just makes me angry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) So (sigh) I'm still asking for your thoughts about (pause) keeping that (pause) feelings at some distance and you're saying that you can feel so helpless and I'm worried about sort of responding inappropriately or saying something inappropriate or (pause) about (pause) putting yourself in a situation that is really integral (ph) of being incredibly frustrated. [00:34:17]</p>

<p>So I think part of how much I understand what you're saying is that (pause) you're talking about (pause) managing how you feel in terms of what you do or don't do, like kind of out in the world. And I guess I sort of thing that may be important. (pause) That may be (pause)... I guess I'm wondering how much you generally manage things you feel, like ways that you feel, by sort of where you go or sort of what you do or don't do in situations as opposed to (pause) how you...as opposed to more internally? I don't know. I feel like I'm not being very clear. [00:36:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I understand. (pause) Like at work, I don't know why it is, I feel like...it's sort of like I just want to get through this day, this week, this whatever and (pause) I don't feel like my work raise (ph) does what it necessarily should...care about how I feel. So they sort of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I think of it as] (ph) like the feeling there's this sort of monolithic threat to you and the workplace. Like you're walking around with a bomb and the only thing you can do is make sure you stay away from anything that could kind of set it off or...for your sake. Something like that. But (pause) there's...yeah. Something like that. [00:37:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I do feel like, sometimes, that I am like an emotional bomb ready to go off and it doesn't feel like there's (pause) that...there's any way to deal with that. I work. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah there's not like a kind of internal modulation or some insulation from what happens or between what happens around you and the bomb inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so it's like it's just right there. And [Chet and Karl] (ph) are pretty clear that they're not (pause) interested or capable in making it feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah. I didn't think of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, (pause) I have this feeling like...I mean I'm aware of what that (pause) in a sort of long term sense. I would probably feel a lot better if there were a way for me to express my frustrations with certain things or if I suggested something, someone would actually listen. But since it's not happening, I feel like all I can do is (pause) medicate it by just avoiding crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now. We'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:38:49]</p>

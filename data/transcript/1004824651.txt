<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is psychotherapy sponsored by Apple?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) That was really funny. Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. So, so you said, I think (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:00:37) or yesterday that... (PAUSE) we were talking about a relational aspect of my skepticism. I was kind of checking it. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>So I was thinking about that. The very glacial process in New York I mean, I don't want to, I don't want to jinx anything but it seems like it's coming, coming to a conclusion. Or at least, I had the perception after a couple of exchanges that it's coming to a conclusion. Hints are being dropped that it's coming to a conclusion. (LAUGHTER) And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. Hints what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hints are being dropped...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that it's coming to a conclusion and we're supposed to speak this afternoon but I have a, I have a good feeling. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. And, you know, that, that good feeling is like the holy grail, you know? My, I don't know. (PAUSE) [00:02:01]</p>

<p>When, you know, when you... Assuming that, you know, part of what we were talking about yesterday was just a security in, you know, in our interaction, a sense that I'm getting what I need to out of the relationship. You know, kind of reassurances that I'm getting what I need to out of the relationship and, you know, that, that I'm being respected and sort of there's a sense of, you know, urgency about giving me what I need. You know, this is exactly the kind of thing that I'm looking for when I do that. You know, assuming that this is a kind of consistent feature of my interactions with people...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. This?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This feeling...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...this sense of, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...this sense of something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is what I'm looking for. So, I don't know. I thought maybe we could start there. [00:03:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, one thing, one thing that comes to mind as I kind of mull it over is how, how wide the, the, the range is, you know, between that sense of security and, you know, the alternatives. I mean, even within 24 hours, 24 hours, within three hours of that, you know, that exchange, you know, I was ready... Like really, I remember, I remember thinking this. [00:04:03]</p>

<p>I remember this... And, and responding to it and kind of acting in a way that's motivated by the assumption, you know, that I fucked something up and, and I'm just being dropped. I remember this yesterday afternoon. I remember, you know, kind of turning over in my head that apparent likelihood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this before you had a conversation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it was, it was barely a conversation. I mean, we're going to talk by phone today but, you know, really, really it was just a couple of e-mails. And I don't know. I don't know and I've been putting off the... the communications (ph) director had written me (PAUSE) and I put off responding. (PAUSE) [00:05:03]</p>

<p>It was, it was an ambiguous e-mail I think just because they're, I hope, I assume in retrospect just because they're still in the process which is basically what it said. And... I don't know. (SIGH) The range is so wide, so wide. I was really, I was really upset and when I'm upset in that way, you know, not in a, you know, what are the components of being upset. You know, what are the correlates (ph) to being upset. What do I think about? I think about, you know, being left. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>I think about being embarrassed or ashamed. I think about (PAUSE) you know, having to come up with some kind of ulterior (ph) plan on the fly, having, you know, basically put a lot of eggs in this basket. (PAUSE) And, and I get, I get kind of compressed. I don't know how else to describe it. Like, my immediate sensation is of space being compressed around me. You know, these kind of repetitive behaviors, whatever they might be, become much more acute. (PAUSE) That sort of thing. (PAUSE) [00:07:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are the repetitive behaviors that you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So surfing (ph) would be one. Sometimes body things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like lip chewing or picking, picking at things. (PAUSE) That mostly. (PAUSE) [00:08:00]</p>

<p>I'll find it hard to move, to interrupt (ph) whenever it is I'm doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're stuck in it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stuck in it. And I'll have a very strong impulse, you know, there are two countervailing (ph) impulses, one not to communicate at all. We talked about this a little bit. And one is just to, to have, to have a kind of... The interactions are not very controlled. But like I'll want to see somebody face to face rather than e-mailing or calling or... So sometimes I'll just go over to somebody's desk rather, for a very routine matter rather than e-mailing them. (PAUSE) [00:09:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you aware of any feelings in that state?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well shame is a feeling. It's pretty strong. (PAUSE) Fear. (PAUSE) [00:10:00]</p>

<p>Worry and, you know, it's a complex... There's a... I don't know. It's not very specific, I guess. (PAUSE) Yeah, I mean, I'm not cut off. I don't think I'm cut off from... Clearly there's some component of, you know, of that kind of dissociative impulse but it's not... I don't know. I'm kind of aware of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're kind of aware of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of aware of it, I think. I mean, maybe I'm, maybe I'm avoiding the kind of full range of it but I'm aware. It doesn't feel good. Like, I don't feel nothing. I'm don't feel numb. I feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever it is, you know, whatever the behavior of the sort of orientation is, it's managing something. It's not avoiding it. It's kind of a, a bad strategy for managing something that I'm conscious of rather than just, you know, blanking on it. Although, you know, at times, as we've discussed, I have done that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just blanked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (PAUSE) [00:12:00]</p>

<p>Well this certainly clarifies for me, the frame which some of our interactions or kind of elaborates... To what we were talking about at the end yesterday, in that, it seems like the question for you is something like, in both in here and elsewhere, you know, are you wanted? [00:13:11]</p>

<p>Can the other person, the other party, like, sort of see you and where you're at and what you need?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those seem like two different things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or do they want to see where you're at and what you think and what you need and maybe that's it. (PAUSE) And it's like the vicissitudes of that, that have this really dramatic effect on sort of how you're feeling and what state you're in, including sometimes what you have access to in your mind and what you can do. [00:14:21]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I see that very clearly, I guess. You know, I see that very clearly in thinking about going to a new job situation of, you know, sort or existing comfortably and happily in any job situation really, any professional setting. I see that particular parallel here less. [00:15:01]</p>

<p>I mean, I guess it's suggestive that the, you know, my sense is that the feeling is the same but I, I, I... It's easier for me to see the second half of the equation, the part about giving me what I need than the first part of the equation, feeling wanted in our interaction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, that, that being said, I think, you know, the, the, you know, the model you're presenting, in general is right. [00:15:57]</p>

<p>You know, there's a relationship in my mind, at least, and probably in reality to some degree between the sense that I'm wanted and the sense that my needs will be provided for and when that's not present, it's very hard for me to orient myself. All three of components of that model, I think, are problematic, so far as I see it. Maybe it's just inevitable and it's just a matter of lying back and thinking of England. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I, I don't think, I don't think that's a great way for relating to the world and I, I... My sense is what's been challenging to me in, you know, navigating this part of the ravine is, is partly that very persistent, very primeval sensibility. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, so I'm agreeing with you. I'm saying yes. I don't quite see how it works mechanically in our interaction but I do see part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the fact that I see part of it maybe suggests a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. And I think you've... I entirely agree that sort of (PAUSE) it doesn't mean like, you know, having recognized it or having seen it or framed it that way doesn't mean it's the way to deal with this is just that it's incumbent on you to kind of suck it up or think about something else or, you know, try to remember that that's, you know, distorted in some sense and just deal with it. [00:18:15]</p>

<p>Like that, that is... I agree that that is not, that does not follow from having this picture of, of what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so that's... I mean, I... We're back to yesterday I mean, I, or any day really, implementing... I feel satisfied. I feel good about our ability to come up with models.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:18:51)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well here's your thing (inaudible at 00:18:52).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (PAUSE) [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's more to learn about the way that... (PAUSE) When this... I mean, really what's going on is you're being hurt or you're being responded to in a way that makes you feel, you know, wanted or understood, and good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'd put it a little differently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want to interrupt your train of thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, but I would say that I am hurt and, you know, my orientation to different kinds of interactions or relationships is, you know, the product of the fact that I'm wounded in some way and, you know, kind of... [00:20:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a preexisting condition?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's like a lot of these interactions are just normal interactions. It's not like... They shouldn't be wounding. You know, whatever. Maybe modal (ph) words are not what I should be using.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:29) I take your point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see the point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to divert us too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it would be nice if, you know, everybody considered only my needs and, and, you know, just sort of arranged their day so the main focus... (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clearly, that is, that is the change we need to make (inaudible at 00:20:55) (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) You know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm hurt. I'm wounded. I respond, I'm responding in way that's suggestive of some, some, you know, some... (PAUSE) I don't know. [00:21:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Profound hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. Anyway. (PAUSE) I mean, it's not like... You know, I go through these interactions with people and each time they break another limb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's more like, it's more like I'm trying to run on, you know, on a sprained ankle and it keeps on swelling up again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>I think part of this (PAUSE) also involves the kind of fantasy on your part, that the other, that it's like kind of an act of will or won't on the part of the other person. Like, they could see it and do have the power to fix it. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>It brings to mind, for me like an interaction of, you know, a pretty young child and a parent where the kids comes with a cut or a problem or a whatever and there's this kind of idea that the parent could make it all better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you seriously presenting that? Oh, you're trying to understand my internal orientation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Maybe. (PAUSE) So how does that, how does that move the ball down the field? That image or narrative? [00:24:05]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well... (PAUSE) I guess your response kind of makes me think it didn't.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Where are we trying to get to?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you seem to be having a bit of that reaction of like, sort of seeming maybe a bit (PAUSE) wary or... (PAUSE) [00:26:00]</p>

<p>(inaudible) sort of seems a bit testy about it. But I don't want to say something that's provocative or make you think I'm being critical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. I am a little testy about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess, you know, a shrink will always come back to one's childhood. And A, there are very good reasons I'm sure for that and particularly for something that's as retractable (ph) as this pattern has been so persistently. I don't think that that's unreasonable. I also think there are probably pretty good reasons why I'd be or at least explanations for my resistance to it other than that, you know, it's that yet again, sort of harping on this... [00:25:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I guess... I don't know if this clarifies at all but I'm, at least in this conversation, I'm less interested in your childhood per se and more, like, trying to say something about the kind of primeval, as you referred to it, sort of (PAUSE) state of mind that goes along with what we're talking about. You know, I did refer to childhood and a small kid so I can see how you got there but I was less trying to say, you know, maybe this injury comes from some interactions like that or something along those lines in your history and more like, you know, one aspect of the kind of primeval quality of this seems to be, you know, the idea that the other person can fix it, if they want to. [00:28:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That said (PAUSE) I guess that also leaves me unclear what it would been had I been saying, "Well I think this comes from X, Y, and Z in your childhood," that would make you skeptical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not skeptical. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like, I've, I've I've gone there so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of... And without much productive issue. [00:29:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's always kind of diverting and, you know, potentially...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a kind of, you know, emotional porn something, you know, associated with rehashing things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that in many cases are, you know, painful but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we're actually kind of on the same page, I think, in that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I, I agree. You know, sometimes, to my mind that matters most what lies in the moment and sometimes that can relate to, you know, something from childhood that somebody sees in a new way or remembers anew or something like that. But I agree that a lot of times there's sort of a diversion in looking back or rehashing things in childhood hat actually move, moves things away from the action. So... [00:30:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, so we're a little bit diverted. Restate the, restate the point that you were making so I can find it again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually the point I think is most important at the moment is that is was your feeling that I was sort of diverting into history that kind of bugged you a bit. That I guess that seems to me like an iteration of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you know, you know, "Ethan, that's not, that's not really what matters to me at the moment. Like, why are we going there?" You know, a bit of kind of looking past you instead of looking at you or something like that. I mean, that seems to kind of recapitulate that (inaudible) [00:31:11]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. I mean... I think, I think the way that you put it earlier on it that (PAUSE) I'm not wanted. I have a sense of not being wanted and therefore that my needs won't be met and therefore I have trouble orienting myself. I think that's the most concise expression of it. And, you know, to the extent that we're trying to, you know, (inaudible) some kind of, or at least identify some kind of transference (ph) relationship. [00:32:09]</p>

<p>We have an interesting in trying to understand our interactions so that, you know, it's as close to this sort of recurrent pattern as possible. I just don't see it right now. I don't see the first part and (PAUSE) and I'm not, I'm not quite..., maybe I'm just being very narrow in this and maybe I'm being too abstract in the way that I'm thinking about it but I don't, I don't see, I don't see. In what you just described, you know, it's true that I'm a little skeptical of this, you know, what seemed to me, initially at least, your attempt to kind of divert us into history.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't quite see how that fits the bill. [00:32:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. What bugged you about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I... (SIGH) It's just kind of a stereotypical thing one would talk about with a psychotherapist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:32:25)</p>

<p>CLIENT: A. B, it's something I've done, you know, fairly repeatedly. C, I think, you know, if I were sort of go there... I have a sense that it would reflect a sort of, a lack of enlightenment on my own part. It's like I'm just sort of wallowing in the, you know, the, the transgressions of, you know, of my, of my family and my parents and, you know, it's like, get over it already. [00:34:09]</p>

<p>You know, so part of it is, I don't know if annoyance it the right world. But part of it is a kind of resistance to what seemed like a gambit on your part that would lead us into a cul de sac. And the other part is sort of impatience or suspicion of my own motives in, you know, being willing to pursue it, you know, out of some...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Compliance or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I mean, being willing to pursue it out of some sort of self indulgent, you know, impulse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, a couple of weeks ago, you said something that, I think you may well not have intended in this way but that I understood to mean that I was evading responsibility for this, I guess. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>And that's kind of what this, you know, what looking for, you know, ways in which my parents didn't, you know, meet my needs and trying to, you know, kind of looking for love in all the wrong places. That's what it would mean. It would mean a kind of self indulgent desire to rehash and blame these very old relationships for where I'm at right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So and I think, quite frankly the, my impatience was in balance less at you than at myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:35:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have, you know, I like thinking this way. It's congenial to me to think about historical things. Jennie, you know, alternately, you know, gets frustrated with me and kind of chuckles at me quite a bit for this and, you know, so I, I often go there. I don't necessarily think it's the most healthy or constructive approach from our point of view and I think my response reflected that sense of unease with this tendency (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE) I guess I... I mean, that's certainly clarifying for me (inaudible) elaborate what was troublesome to you. (PAUSE) [00:36:55]</p>

<p>I guess the thing I'm still not clear on is how that's different really from our than pursuing something or my... I'm instigating the pursuit of something that's, that really have met your needs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure because I mean, that's the piece that we're in agreement is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is relevant and, you now, se can sort of talk about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...think about, In parallel, the part that's not clear is the not wanted part and that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...since that is such a consistent and important feature of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, of this</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That makes sense to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's kind of like, yeah we both agree that, you know, taking things in that direction wouldn't have met your needs. However, it's not clear what that has to do with, if anything, you're feeling kind of unwanted by me. [00:37:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, exactly. There's a complex here and one of the reasons to me, on the face of it, it seems difficult to, you know, to extrapolate from our interactions to others... Whatever the issue is in vivo is that, you know, in order to establish the parallelism, we created a kind of transverse relationship and and part of this rapport that we've created that I have less concern about, you know, my, my, my status, my being wanted. I mean, you know, the complexity of the billing, I guess, introduces a bit of uncertainty on my part and, you know, we can go back to that. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do have a thought about the other part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although we can (inaudible). [00:39:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. No, no. That's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is (PAUSE) so my tentative hypothesis...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tentative hypothesis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that, you know, while I get that in a sort of more general way, you do feel cared about and wanted by me here. Which is good. And so it doesn't leave you feeling the same as, for example, you know, as with talking with the people in New York. [00:39:53]</p>

<p>I guess I wondered if, you know, on a kind of more micro level (PAUSE) you know, this kind of aspect of the model is evident where you unconsciously have this idea that if I divert things in an unproductive direction, I kind of could have known better. Or if I actually care, I wouldn't have done that. You know, that's the sort of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very occasionally I remember having that kind of a thought but not just now and not in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think that's, I don't think that's generally the case.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not generally the case. You know when I do feel regularly and consistently this sort of uneasiness...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The end of the hour?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is the end of the hour which I, I think is close. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I mean, that's come up but yeah, we've never really...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very very distinctly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:41:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I inspect you very assiduously to, to identify the end of the hour and to identify the extent to which when you become a bit distracted. It's very... You know, your behavior in this regard is quite consistent and identifiable and it's important to be able, first of all, to identify the extent to which distractedness is, is just a kind of cyclical phenomenon and also not to overstay my welcome, I guess. You know, both literally and figuratively which I suppose I'm at the risk of doing right now but... [00:42:01]</p>

<p>Yeah. I mean, that's my... I assume if you gave me a, a, a blood pressure machine, this would be evident that as I notice your becoming aware of the time that, you know, that my level of anxiety goes up to some degree.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I follow there's both an immediate experience of my disengaging a bit at the end of the hour and you're anticipating that it's actually going to be time to, you know, get up and leave.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something real that's happening right at the moment and something you're anticipating is happening. [00:43:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. (inaudible)</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Clears throat, 3-minute silence) Uhm, I was thinking about something that, it was sort of a continuation of that fantasy I'd had, uhm, several days ago when I was coming up from the subway, and then I mentioned it again yesterday.  But I almost immediately dropped it and started thinking about a boy at school who s—, was new after school started, and has been a great problem, except now he seems to be adjusting.</p>

<p>And uhm, the secretary today tho—, said something that implied she thought somebody had been treating the mother of this boy badly, and it could have, she could have meant me, or Mrs BBF, or both of us, I don't know.  But it sort of disturbed me that she was being critical the way she was, because she didn't understand the full part of it.  And I don't feel I have treated the mother awful.  But anyway, I started thinking about that.</p>

<p>And what I was thinking right before I went into that, was uhm, c, coming up those short stairs connecting the, the new uhm, addition, and this part of the floor.  And uhm, somebody came out of, I guessed it must have been a men's room, right behind, you know, right after I passed the doors, somebody came out.  And then, uh, I don't know, I just had this feeling it was a man, rather than a woman.  And then I could tell that the person coming behind me, even though the person was being quite quiet.</p>

<p>And so I immediately started fantasizing, what if it's you.  And here I've been talking about uhm, these feelings about somebody coming up behind me on the subway, except when I thought of it today, I thought of it as having had these fantasies of you coming up behind me, rather than of somebody else, which I, you know when I was thinking these things on the subway, uhm, I never thought directly that I was thinking of you coming up.  (Sniff) And uhm, a, and yet today, that's the way I thought of it, as sort of, what a joke it would be if you really were coming up behind me, just like I'd been fantasizing.</p>

<p>And, and then I was afraid to turn around and see who it was.  Not afraid, but uhm, I guess I was f—, I don't know whether I didn't want to find out it wasn't you, which, I finally did look, and it wasn't.  (Clears throat) Or whether I didn't know what I'd do if it did turn out to be you, although I don't, because for a moment, it seemed to me quite believable it would be you.  And I think I even was thinking that uhm, you were going quietly.  Because it seemed as if the person were walking more quietly than somebody would normally.  But I, you, kn—, it might have been my imagination.</p>

<p>But in any case I was thinking you might have been going more quietly so that I wouldn't realize you were behind me.  And I don't think I thought that, because then I thought, well you might really come up behind me.  But more, just simply that, it would be a funny situation after what I've been saying, and you might want to, you know, not have it be there, in reality.  And uhm, I don't know, I guess, th, the main part of it now is, sort of the thing that, is a surprise to me, is the way I thought of it today, as if I've always been fantasizing your coming up behind me, which I hadn't thought directly before.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   OK, and what would I do now?  What?  Here I am walking behind you.  What do you want me to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) Uhm, (Pause) uh, well, the thing I thought about, and it seems it's obvious from the rest of the fantasies I've been having, is that I want you to uhm, put your penis in me, from behind.  But then I, I, I don't know.  I mean I, I can't think it absolutely directly, and I can only think well, it seems that must be it.</p>

<p>And then I start thinking of, there was a time when we were talking about my having particular feelings about that.  And I can't remember, I think it had something to do with, well, at some point I'd talked about uhm, what I'd read somewhere that, if you wanted to have a boy, well I can't remember now, but it had something to do with if you're trying to have a sp, specific sex, and I think it was, that was the position, if you wanted to have a better chance of having a boy.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>But it might have something to do with something else, too, because uhm, then I still wouldn't see you.  And sometimes, I me—, I'm thinking about sometimes when MSCZ wants to make love, and I'm feeling ambiguous about it, and then I like to begin by lying with my back to him.  And maybe, maybe i,i, it isn't something else, maybe I just am not recognizing that it's all part of the same thing.  But he has felt, and it does seem to me sometimes, that's true, that uhm, you know, it's an avoidance of uh, being directly involved or recognizing that it's him.  And (Clears throat) I mean, somehow that it's a rejection or, in your case, I guess I'm wondering if it's avoiding the reality still, so that I can keep some fantasy going.  But if it's all in fantasy, then that doesn't seem like it would be it.  So —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, well, but you're, you tell me about something you infer now, on the basis of all that we've talked about.  But what I'm asking you is, what do you want me to do?  Supposing uhm, I'm available?  What do you want me to do?  What do you imagine?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, Silence) Well, I can't get beyond uhm, and I don't feel this is really thinking about it enough, but uhm, you know, sort of a general feeling of your, or, your making me feel very special.  Uhm, by being a mixture of a lover and a father, you know, who, and, and that's finding me special in 2 different ways, in a way.  Because you know, as a father you'd accept me, no matter what I did, almost.  And then as a lover, because I was special to you, sexually.  And uhm, and, and then I think of being loved in both those ways.  You know, physically loved in both those ways is part of it.  That uhm, but you know, when I start to think more specifically like this, then I get vague.  And — (Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>And somehow it involves — which again is being too general, I think — but uhm, wanting you to create a feeling in me, that, that makes me want to return or respond.  Uhm, you know, to a feeling that I'm wanting you to be having for me.  Just the kind of thing that's missing between me and MSCZ.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, the thing I started thinking about, is uh, first, well, I me—, th—, I don't know if it was first.  I guess I was looking at my shoes and thinking of wearing them to school, and uhm, that almost immediately made me think of sitting with some of the teachers today, when they were having lunch, and I was doing something at my table.  And then I was talking to one teacher.  And I couldn't think of a word that I wanted to say.  Because I was talking about one of the rooms that has a lot of very young children in it.</p>

<p>And yesterday, when I had left, there were a lot of chairs at the doorway, and it sort of looked as if they were making a, a, well now, I can't even say the word again.  And I couldn't, what I was struck by is, that I couldn't say this word when I was talking to the girl.  And she had to finally supply the word, "blockade," to me, which wasn't quite right.  But uhm, "barricade," I guess, is the word I was trying to think of, and I couldn't say it.  And I just had trouble again.  And I'm struck by it, because I feel, well, that's what I've done.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Umhmm.  How do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, by not thinking any further about what fantasies I have.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Right.  You've put up a big barricade.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And now I have my contact (lens) trouble.  Because just when I started talking about that word, I began to have trouble in both eyes, which is unusual.  (Sniffs, Pause) I, I guess I'll need some Kleenex, if you have any.  (Sniff) Thank you.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What happens when, with your contacts?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, I don't know, because I have trouble Z,,,, all the time, anyway.  But the way I've always thought about it, is just that a particle from the air gets into my eyes.  I've learned there are certain ways I can —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   This air in here is totally filtered.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Really?  Well, (Laughs, Sniff) I can't, I don't know, maybe I am completely creating it, but it's the same sensation as when something gets under the lens.  (Sniff) But a lot of the time, I feel as if there's something potentially there, and I've learned there are certain ways to keep my eyes, so that uhm, open my eyelids so that I can avoid something happening.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, you're putting up a barricade, a blockade to your fantasies about me.  What you want me to do, and what you imagine us doing together, and what you really want me to do to you, and you can't see in addition.  So you're blinding yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sniffs, 2-minute silence) And I, I guess what I'm really concentrating on, just simply, uhm, (Sniff) how much I'm doing something like this with my contacts to myself.  And uhm, (Sniff) I immediately started thinking about a girl at school who has, she's one of the 3 scholarship children that I've been trying to get into a different pattern of behavior this year, because they were just terrible all last year, and I think, handled badly.  And uhm, I don't know, sometimes I have a question if I'm being too hard on them.  But because they were treated always with some, everybody trying to make concessions for them last year, I go in the opposite way.</p>

<p>And today, one child who always refuses to come down from the roof, and she was catered to all last year, and begged, and so forth.  And I've been very brusque with her when she does that, and uhm, (Sniff) today when I was dealing with it, I was very brusque with it.  And I s—, I said it made me angry when she acted that way, because she had no choice, and she had to come, and I had to bring her physically, if she wouldn't come.  And I didn't like her making a choice, when she had no choice.  I don't know what all I said, but anyway, and then I talked about, in a more pleasant way, how I liked having her around when she was being uhm, making choices that she had, and, following routines where she had no choice.</p>

<p>And at the end I said, and I don't want you going running to Miss BST, FLMZ, (Sniff) when you get downstairs, because she's done this  before.  After I've had to deal with her, because FLMZ can't, partly out of just feeling very angry herself, and she can't handle her anger with these children, uhm, because she had to deal with them a lot last year, following what the head teacher last year wanted her to do.  And she didn't agree, but had to do it, and she just uhm, well, she can't be firm enough.  And I don't know, and also, she does tend to be very motherly, which is sometimes good, because it counteracts me, to an extent, when I'm sometimes inclined not to be.</p>

<p>But uhm, sometimes I think, she does it out of, you know, misjudging the situation.  And uh, this girl has run to her a number of times after me.  And i—, and then it's as if what I did was, had no effect.  Uhm, and today she, when I said that, she really began to think about the things that I've been saying.  And I had also said she couldn't go up to the roof tomorrow, and every other time we've done that, she's ignored the fact that I have said that (Sniff).  I mean, you know, usually I've said, "You have to be, you'll have to wait until the rest of the class has gone up, since you had trouble coming down."  Today I said, "You're just not going to be able to come up at all."</p>

<p>And uhm, s—, and when we got downstairs, she stayed by me then, and began asking me what I was going to do tomorrow, and just more about it.  And I was thinking, well, and, and we ended on a very positive note about this whole thing.  Uhm, so I was thinking, well it was good I was so firm with her, and strict, and, and almost hard.  And I don't know whether I'm thinking of that because I'm thinking well, what you pointed out I was in a way, being the way I'm thinking I was with the girl, but I wanted you to be more so.  Which, again gets me back to sort of, thinking of the way I want you to make me uhm, well, I don't know if it's be obedient, uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How about, just to make you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm, well, yeah.  (Sniff)  Yeah, I suppose that's true, just be forceful with me, and you know, make love to me, or, I mean, it's kind of, overpower me.  And the specific, or, the most important thing, I suppose, would be by making love to me.  But — (Clears throat, 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Oh, and I went back to thinking about this girl and the anger I felt at the time when uhm, you know, I finally had to pull her out of, she was inside a climbing thing that had some boards on it, she was sitting on the boards.  And I had to either stay and argue with her for a long time, e—, or, pull her out physically, which I did.  And I, i—, partly in choice, let myself go, because uhm, that was one of the things they did last year, they did a lot of discussing and begging and talking and nothing would happen.  And uh, so I felt all along, these children, the 3 girls have to be handled much more physically, in terms of physically removed immediately if they're disrupting, and not a lot of talking about what might happen.</p>

<p>Yet uhm, I don't know, I mean th,th, there's some other reason I'm sure, why I'm thinking about —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) It's transparent.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well (Laughs) it's not to me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You are telling me that you're sick and tired of our just talking about this stuff.  And you want me to do something.  Here we sit and we talk about making love, and my putting my penis in you, and so forth.  And you're telling me that you're fed up with talking, you want me to do it.  Act, cut out these discussions.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't know, I'm back to my, it seems like a dilemma I've felt before, uhm, (Sniff) you know, of thinking, what if you really did do what I'm saying I want you to do?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But do you see that that's what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, (Sigh) well I guess I'm not sure, because I feel as if I have to deny it.  (Pause) And I can also, I mean I, I can think of it u—, in 2 different ways.  And one is, that I can see that that's what I'm saying, if it's all kept, you know, as a fantasy.  But then, when I heard you saying it, it sounds like I'm really saying now, let's even cut out the fantasy.  And that's what, that's when I feel very troubled, and, and I start thinking, well what would I really do, and how would I really feel if you did cut out the fantasy by actually becoming, you know, turning it into reality.  And uhm, I don't know if that's what I'm saying.  But that's somehow what I heard when you were saying what it seemed that it was so clear I was saying.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you do recognize that your thoughts went immediately to, you had to handle this girl physically.  You want me to handle you physically, and stop just talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I don't know what the trouble is that I'm having with this, you know, uhm, I mean, part of it is, I can't imagine, what if you would really, because it, immediately I have to start thinking, well how would I react, then.  And uhm, because it's not the same thing as saying, well I have this fantasy about you, or I am, because it always keeps a distance.  And uhm, well maybe it's because I still have this feeling if I actually express directly wanting this right at this minute that then it would happen.  That i—, you know, somehow, the power of saying it would make it happen.</p>

<p>And uhm, and the other thing I guess I'm wondering is, then (Sigh) you know, sort of saying well I have these fantasies.  I'm recognizing that there's something I'm keeping unreal.  And if I say I actually want it to happen right now, uhm, then I have to take the chance of being disappointed.  And I don't know.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Then, I, I, I guess I'm just thinking that a—, well, yesterday and the day before, the day before particularly, I suppose, uhm, th—, I was being so reluctant to think about my fantasies as fantasies.  And now I'm thinking, well, let's just get back to thinking about my fantasies as fantasies.  And uhm, (Pause) I don't know, it's almost as like I, as if I'm in a dilemma of choosing right now, of, do I really want to admit, or make uhm, that kind of statement.  You know, such a direct statement of what I want right now.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I, I guess the other thing that I can't uhm, tell about, is you know, because I really feel in some kind of dilemma, and I do—, I mean I don't know if anything I've said is exactly it, but just now I was thinking that it's almost, something is, I feel threatened somehow, and it's almost as if uhm, well, in trying to project, well then, what would I do, if you did do what I wished, of, you know, directly dealing with my physically, right now.  Uhm, and I have this feeling that everything would be spoiled, the fantasies would be spoiled, and uhm, that that just might be a defense against thinking I really want it, I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, what would be spoiled?  How?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well then I can no longer, you know, want things with you in the way I wanted them.  And imagine anything I wanted to imagine, if you started doing some of the things that I wanted.  You might not do them the way I wanted exactly, or I don't know, somehow uhm, I wouldn't have the control.  And so—, it almost seems like it would make you just, just another man, and not a special man.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, I, I, this has been sort of vague, and now I think of it a bit more directly, of, clearly, of uhm, thinking well, what could happen is, you know the kind of feeling, I suppose, it would be disappointment or, slightly different than that, or more than that.  Uhm, that I had, maybe that I've had with MSCZ and that I am sure I had with some of the boys that I dated first, of uhm, you know, when dating and when uh, you know, it would be very short period of time, but being special to somebody, and supposedly that boy was special to me, for however long we would be dating just each other.</p>

<p>And uhm, you know, soon as the relationship became special, and especially if there were anything physical, and then it would be, at the most, kissing, and I used to even think it was horrible to be hugged, or anything like that.  Uhm, because just everything, anything physical was disappointing, and not what I wanted it to be.  And uhm, you know, I guess not from the right person.  Or, (Pause) and I don't know how much these feelings have to do too, with the fact that anything that my father did do to show affection physically was so awkward and uncomfortable on his part, uhm, that there was never any warmth, a, and it was never anything, I mean, it was totally unrelated to any fantasies I would have, I'm sure.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And uh, I'd be the same way?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, probably that's part of what troubles me, because I don't know or I just don't know what would happen to my feelings.  (Pause) But then, that starts me into thinking, well you know, first I was thinking, well MSCZ's warm, but I can't respond to him.  And then I can think, well, the fantasies I'm having about you can be, or before I had them about you, about my father, what comes between MSCZ and me.  But then, and then I was thinking, well what if you weren't the way my father was, and I can't.  And then it gets me into thinking, how would I sustain the feeling, that I, the only other time I think I've actually talked about that here is when I've imagined having that exchange of feeling with MSCZ, and feeling I couldn't, couldn't, uhm, stand, you know, really having it.</p>

<p>Uhm, because it's very fleeting, as it sometimes has been with MSCZ.  That's alright, or I can imagine it, fantasize about it.  But to actually have it, uhm, I don't know, it just seems like too much.  And I don't, uhm, I guess I've never felt I've really understood why I feel that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What specifically are you referring to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when you asked that, and I began to (Laughs) understand.  Because I think probably specifically I'm referring to the desire to respond sexually, you know, without control, or anyway, with abandon, with freedom.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I think you've gotten away again from the immediate matter, which is what you want me to do is to handle you physically, to make love to you, to kiss you, and make you respond.</p>

<p>(2-minute Silence, Sigh) I don't know, in a way it would seem, well, I guess it really, wasn't even thinking so, but I can see I'm having a terrible time thinking about that, or feeling it, or you know, just uhm, accepting it, or whatever it is that I'm not letting myself do.  Because uhm, I mean, even though I'll think about something that I think of as being hard to think about, but it's easier than thinking about that.  And just now, after you spoke, I was thinking again of the girl, who, you know, sort of parallels this, apparently, and uhm, (Sigh) some of the ways, I guess, that I was feeling I did make her respond today, finally.  But — (Laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You're giving me encouragement, huh?  You're telling me you wish I would make you respond.  The way you made her do it.  And cut out this talk.  Our time's up.  
??</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you were, that's where you went out, on [DEIDENTIFIED]?  It was crowded out there yesterday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was.  Um, there's a little boat ramp, like at [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's real near our house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Main thing is, parking by there —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] on the boat for a little while.  [INAUDIBLE].  That's why I couldn't come on Monday.  We had some car trouble, and we were supposed to leave on —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I heard you were out of state.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we were going to leave on Monday, and then we had the car trouble, and his dad, you know, works on cars and stuff, but he was already on the picnic.  It was the alternator that went out.  So it was just a problem of getting one since things, a lot of stuff was closed on that Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus we didn't notice then, and we never leave until evening anyway, so it was like 7:00, and I was like, and then, I mean, we left, I got up at like 4:00, 4:00 and tried to leave, but my [AGE], he didn't, [NAME OTHER] was staying a little longer —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so they stayed with him.  So he was like, "Please let me stay here one more night and come get me in the morning?"  And stuff like that just slowed me down, and I probably missed it by 45 minutes.  But when I knew I wasn't going to be here, I went ahead and called, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I appreciate that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, and I was so surprised that, um, she got me in as fast as she did.  I thought, I thought it'd be like two months probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  No.  We do what we can.  People that we need to see.  How's your mood been?  Mood swings, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Actually I've been doing, um, really good.  Um, I think the, uh, the Xanax that you've put me on —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It works really well.  Um, and, as so, I found myself on some days where, like, um, I do all right, just, uh, wake up and, once I get through, like in the morning I take them when I wake up.  So I don't usually think about taking one right then, because I, I'm, I wouldn't say I'm in a bad mood when I wake up, but I just have to be awake for people to start talking to me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, you know, the kids they, I, I get up before they do, and either, you know, or get coffee or Mountain Dew, something to start off with a little bit of energy and, you know, start making breakfast.  And then, I start waking them up.  After that, now they're out of school now, so I was like, I was joking with [NAME OTHER], I said, "I can see the need for these increasing, they're out of school all summer."  [LAUGHING].  But, but, um, just the, you know, just the kids.  But I don't really have a hard time with that, but my two year old, he'll be three tomorrow —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's talking a whole lot now.  He hasn't for a while, but he's gotten, you know, just real, kind of, mouthy.  Like he's starting to see how far he can get with stuff.  And I have definitely spoiled him more than the others.  So I've had to start hand a few more pops at him lately.  But he's potty trained.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  That makes it a little easier for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Most definitely.  I'm thinking of giving his diapers away to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm so glad I'm done with diapers.  He caught on real fast.  I mean, like, he had started messing with it before he started preschool.  But, he's kind of like [NAME OTHER], and when he started, he just kind of put it on the back burner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like he's got so much other stuff to do.  And then we started, like this summer, it took him about a week.  And now he refuses to wear a diaper.  And I was thinking, I had towels down on the bed, so he wouldn't pee in it forever.  And he would not, he didn't want to wear the diaper.  And, you know, he wet the bed a couple times, but he got it real quick.  He's real good.  He'll tell me, "I got to pee."  So we run back to the bathroom.  I'm like, "Good.  Yes."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's how old now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE]?  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He'll be [AGE] tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's awesome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He's going good.  And [NAME OTHER] graduated [DEIDENTIFIED].  And [NAME OTHER] is going in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] to where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I'm hoping to get him in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, our, the way it's divided up would not put him in that school, but since then, you know, his father asks, what preschool [INAUDIBLE]?  And so [NAME OTHER] is still only, [DEIDENTIFIED]'s 15 minutes away from my house.  So, I mean, and it's a really good school.  Like, I like the teachers, and [NAME OTHER] is doing so well there, like, I'm trying to get him in there.  I think, you know, it's not an overly crowded school, so I think they're going to let him go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it would make pick up and drop off a lot easier.  If, now I can drop him off, but if I'm working my parents do all the pick ups.  So really we're sending them to two different school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're very busy as it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your schedule look like for the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, pretty much the same.  I've been working.  Um, we'll be going out of town, I, we, we go to the beach a good bit and stay with a family there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't have to pay for hotels and stuff, so that's all.  I mean, I pay for gas to get there, and [NAME OTHER]'s dad wants to see the boys all the time, so he's like, "I'll give you gas money even, if you're kind of broke."  So I'm like, "Okay."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, we got to spend the night on the beach when we went.  We, um, spent the night there Sunday night, in a tent.  So, I mean, I love that kind of stuff, frolic in the ocean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's your thing out there, yep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I love sunrise.  I mean, like every time [INAUDIBLE] two days in a row, I'll be there every morning.  And even if we're not on the beach, I'll drive [INAUDIBLE].  I can stay on the beach nonstop there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, but, yeah, I haven't really had, um, anything out of the ordinary, uh, happen, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just, you know, it's, it's, sure it's insane.  I mean, like, I waited at first, you know, because I knew they were PRN.  So I kind of waited until I was starting to feel myself getting —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Flustered and all that stuff, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, okay, they didn't, they actually started to work pretty quickly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I, I can definitely tell that, I'll sit down, too, like, on the day and I sit down and just try to relax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, that was happening, I mean, it happened at least every day.  So then I kind of got myself into the routine, like I said, to get, to get a lot of stuff done, like I don't want to wake up and then take it.  Like I don't want to be completely dependent, because everybody is going to have a bad day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  So I don't want to be, like, completely dependent on it.  But, and I would go ahead and take one.  Especially for work.  I mean, like, working at a restaurant is so, it's, like [INAUDIBLE] when we're getting off, and you can't really rely on people.  It gets very annoying.  I mean, like, people were running [INAUDIBLE] side work.  And I'll do it, because if we don't do it, then we're all going to get yelled at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  And I'm just not used to working with people, and it's a lot of young people.  Not to down, you know, now there are some people that will do a really good job.  But, you know, some of them are, I mean, there's a little girl, [NAME OTHER], and she's [AGE], she has a kid.  And, I mean, like, I was, you know, [AGE] when I had a kid as well.  But she is just so slack in what she does there, and she's always talking about boys.  And I'm like, you should learn how you got that baby.  And then it spends a lot of time with her parents, which, you know, I told her, I said, "Well everybody needs help."  I mean, but I lived with my parents when I was getting their help —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And tried to be really involved.  And she was like, I mean, she tells me all these stories, "Well I just, it gets so boring.  I mean, like, I don't mind keeping them during the day, but I want to go out."  And I'm like, I see [INAUDIBLE] like that, and then complain their child is not attached to them.  And I'm, like, so now I try to offer friendly advice.  I'm like, "You want to be close to that kid, you better be around."  You better, you know, being young, this is my motto, "I'll still be pretty young when they're grown.  So I can still go out and have fun when they're old enough to watch themselves."  And stuff like that, but, which is not going to be until like 15, 16, I'm not leaving them alone.  They're boys, especially three of them all, because I'm like, my house would be gone when I come back.  I'm afraid.  Especially if they're like me.  And my mom always threatened, like I told you, "I hope you have three just like you."  And I'll say, "Great."  The little one is a lot like me, but really smart though.  Very smart.  I couldn't be prouder.  I'm bragging on [NAME OTHER].  He, um, he's in the 100 book club at school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's read over 200 books.  And they've —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got him on a third grade reading level, they say.  And he's starting to do geometry.  And I'm like, it's not going to be too long I'm not going to be able to help him with his homework.  I had to double check myself on a fraction because I really suck at math.  But English I'm all right with.  My mom asked me, one day she was helping him with homework when I got home from work, and she was like, "What is this word right here?"  And I was like, "Onomatopoeia?"  She's like, "What is that?"  I was like, and see I thought that, too.  [INAUDIBLE].  And, I'm like, "I don't think there should be letters in math."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's no good to me.  But I have been, I'm doing good with that, taking that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And like going to beach, um, I did notice when I was at the beach, I only took one, one day.  I mean, I was just like, I was relaxed.  But the little one, my youngest stayed with my mom just because we did not plan on staying that many days.  The car trouble.  And I'm almost glad.  Because that ride, going back and forth, I mean, if you're lucky they sleep the whole way.  But that doesn't usually happen a whole lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You drive in the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I try to, um, I try to leave, if I'm going there I don't leave early in the morning because the sun, you know, comes up over there and I'm facing the east the whole way.  And I hate driving with the sun in my eyes.  I try to time it like that.  We usually, you know, leave at about dark when we come back home.  But, I don't, you know, I try to rest and get plenty of rest up that day because I'm going to be driving.  And then they will go to sleep, or if it's early in the morning they will go to sleep and sleep all the way home.  And it's not a bad drive.  It's like three and half hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got other trips planned this summer, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Mostly just for there.  Um, I think we might go see a big concert, "The Warped Tour."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, because there's a couple bands I want to see, but it's going to come pretty close.  So, I really like music, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who all is going to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably just me and [NAME OTHER].  Um, especially to the band thing, just because there's probably going to be a lot of drinking and stuff, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably don't want to take my kids to that.  But we always take them to the beach.  That's the kind of thing we can easily do with the family.  And they love to be in a tent.  And they [INAUDIBLE].  I never had.  So, and I mean, as long as I got them, I, I wish I had a lock on the tent.  All they, they can just unzip it.  And they need to listen to me and, you know, just like the water right down next, makes me real nervous —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, I mean it takes very little to get me really nervous with them around.  Especially with the big waves, you know, because the older two think that they can handle it.  And I lost my sunglasses while I was there.  Like, the waves knock me down, okay?  You, you got to [INAUDIBLE], they'll knock you down, too.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You and [NAME OTHER] doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, we are.  Um, we had, um, a decent argument, uh, probably, it was after I saw you last, and, um, it really wasn't that bad, though, but since that happened, um, just because I don't like to argue a lot in front of the kids.  And I guess because we've been together so long, I mean, you get set in your ways, so we both come up with some plans, like, uh, doing things differently.  And have even considered before we actually get married, going for some marriage counselling.  You know, for both of us.  Um, nothing major, just all these little, stupid fights that really don't matter.  But, any, uh, he'll be in a bad day, or in a bad mood from work, or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] me.  And it's just the little nit—picky things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like, he'll like ask me, "Well what do you want to eat?"  And then he, like, I'm very passive, you know, when it comes to food.  If I don't like it, I can make it where I do like it, or I can eat a bowl of cereal.  I can munch on something else.  Plus I work at a restaurant.  There's unlimited food for me if I really get hungry.  But, you know, he's very picky.  He's the kind of person that wants a cheeseburger plain, but he wants, you know, this added, you know, no onions, but mushrooms, things like.  So I usually let him decide, and like I said, as long as I get the kids to eat, I'm good with it.  I can eat a frozen pizza for all I care.  And it's those kind of little things that we argue about.  We finally got a point in our life, you know, I'm tired of something like that turning into a yelling, you know, screaming argument.  And I said, "Now I'm not going to have the kids seeing that over and over."  And —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me why it would if he, if, if you let him pick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.  No.  That's, you know, it's, that's, I mean he's fine with picking, but you know, I, uh, "What do you want?  What do you want?"  And I'm like, really I don't care.  And I, I don't know if it's him thinking I don't care, just saying that so I [INAUDIBLE] bother with it.  Or he's like, "Well what do you want?  Why won't you say?"  I'm like because I don't care, like I really don't care.  You know, it's always the little, really stupid things —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That you shouldn't really even argue about.  It's just, I guess, being tired, and so that builds up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  And I, I told him, I said, "You know I think we've agreed, you know, [INAUDIBLE] walk away, you know, and go and deal with it.  And if I tell you I'm not hungry, listen to me, and let me take care of myself."  I mean, I've always been very independent, and that's never been a problem before, and, you know, he, uh, he's definitely got some, I guess, some trust issues that go back and some, just, he'd really weird sometimes, like he'll be in a really good mood and then get really down about whatever.  And, and that can increase, you know, because then I'm like, and I'm the same way.  I'm like, "Well what is wrong?  You know, why don't you talk to me.  You're sitting there like you're pissed off, and you won't say anything."  You know, and that's me, I'm like I'm going to figure out what it is if there's something wrong.  We can talk about it.  We can fix it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, and, but, it's like when he wants to talk, then I might be in the mood where I need to be left alone.  And I, so I try to think, sometimes I would like to be left alone, so I'll shut up.  But, you know, it's those little things I think we should have to work on.  I guess living with someone every day you have to deal with those things.  Compromise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It was just getting to the point that we decided to get, to come up with a plan, so to speak.  That it was just getting annoying when, you know, kind of like, uh, I hope whenever, "I hope everybody is in a good mood when I go home."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well I'm glad you recognize that, want to improve it, and you guys talk about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um—hum.  And we both agree.  You know, it's terrible to come home and wonder, "Are we going to argue?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What mood is he in, or is she in, you know?  And it's like, oh, it's like a terrible thing to be worried about coming home.  You know, that's where you should be able to go and always know that you, you know, you can at least be okay.  And, so we're definitely working on that.  But, um, surprisingly that has not made things worse for me.  Now maybe because it's because I have had the Xanax.  Like I said, I try not to, but I've been taking at least one every day.  When I've had bad days I might take one and a half and then take the other half in a few hours or something.  Because I don't like, like I said, I don't want to just rely on that.  I don't want to, like, every time I get —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just a tool.  It's going to fix it, you know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can't just rely on it, because it's, still going to have problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still have symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, it's been doing all right, though.  Like I said, that did not seem to cause, like our, our arguments, you know, I guess because it's a new opening, at least we're trying to work on it.  So, that being the case, it's makes the arguing not, and we really have been doing better.  I mean, it's, it's been like a month since we had that, and we've definitely been working on it, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's changed a lot of  his stuff, because, um, I always tell him, I'm, I'm always worried about his health.  I mean for years he's eaten not healthy, you know, greasy, just, you know, and he's been gaining weight, and he drinks beer.  I mean, I started complaining, and I was like, "You know, you drinking all the time is really getting on my nerves."  I was like, and "I drink, too, sometimes, but, not, like, every day."  On the weekends it had gotten to where he was waking up at, like, 9:00 in the morning and he'd be drinking by 10:00.  And I was, like, this, that's too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he's cutting that back.  He's not drinking Budweiser any more, he's drinking Bud Light.  And he only, he'll buy a 12 pack, keep it, like, three days, which he was killing, uh, more than a 12 pack in a day for while there.  And that, and that was kind of like another side of him, I'm like, "You're drinking so much, I mean, are you not happy?"  I'll be, because for you to be, like, I mean, he'd be passing out early, you know, I'm like, "You know, you're almost, you know, like you're drinking troubles away."  And for long a time, he has kidney stones, and the doctor said, you know, it takes forever in the ER, you might want to start drinking a beer.  And I mean, I've, I've heard that that will help —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Flush it out, but I'm like, I'm sure he didn't mean a case a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Literally.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I'm saying, I was like this is not a method, I was like, so, you know, he's, he's changed that.  He's switched from drinking, you know, drinking soda.  He's been losing weight.  Been doing things more healthy, we've been exercising together, like a lot more —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We do something every day.  Try and spend some time, like, you know, my mom will want to watch the kids, that's when we'll walk.  So we'll have some time alone that's not stressful.  Like there's nothing to stress us out.  You know are kids aren't with us, the dogs aren't with us, we're just doing something together.  You know, there's nothing to worry about.  And I tell him, like, "You can walk with a beer in your hand."  He has to, but he has definitely cut back, and things have gotten a lot better.  He's, you know, I can tell he's trying to not argue.  He keeps a, you know, tone a lot calmer a lot longer now.  Which is incentive for me to do so.  You know when you see somebody just, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My initial thing is I'm going to just go it, do it right back at them.  Aggravate it with them.  So we're both working on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still planning on, uh, school in the fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I think I'm going to be going possibly to [DEIDENTIFIED] on my day off, for like computer programming and help with job placement.  I haven't made that final decision just because I had talked to somebody and was going to set up an appointment to go to a tour and see what they were about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just want to make sure it's a, you know, an accredited school.  I just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a big school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's a nation, nationwide, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it sounds good.  I was talking to a friend of mine's dad does that, and they did go to, he went to a tech school, but he said, really a lot of those are just as good.  Just check it out.  And so far, what I've asked of everybody when I have looked into it, it looked really good.  And it'll be cool, they can help you with job placement there until you get out somewhere else.  So that's kind of cool.  Like that, that would mean, like, I would have a career started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least be getting experience right afterwards.  Because I have not done anything else with computers otherwise.  It's been in the nursing direction.  But, um, I really like computers.  I do like to fix things, you know, I like to figure things out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At home now I'm the one who fixes the computer, and that's just what, doing what I figure out on my own.  And I enjoy it, and I think I'm, I've decided against the teaching on that, you know, on that computer programming I could end up doing from home one day.  Like, I, I [INAUDIBLE] and just go in for meetings.  And that'd be cool, having three boys.  That way I know what they're doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to leave them home alone too much, you know.  But my office, I'd be, you know, maybe upstairs.  Although I can't wait to build a house.  I've already decided on where I want my office, like, far away from everything else.  I'll probably end up sleeping in there.  [LAUGHING].  I know, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  You've got a lot of ideas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  I can't wait to finish school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So [DEIDENTIFIED] would offer you what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I do, I definitely want to do computer programming, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like programs, you know, you can build web sites for people to like whole other stuff, you know, like, I'm really interested in that.  Um, they have a whole lot of different things there.  They have, like, web site and design for web site, things that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what I'm interested, I might branch off into that, like, but I would like to get, um, they offer an Associate's and a Bachelor's.  So, you know, depending, I'm definitely going to start with my Associate's, so I'm going to start working, but I may continue it later.  But I definitely want to do programming.  Um, a friend of my, like I said her dad does it, and he makes about $75,000 a year by himself.  And that's pretty decent, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could live on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been living, well, you know, and especially, that's by myself and then whatever [NAME OTHER] does.  And he's got a couple ideas.  I've already got a lot of my financial aid stuff filled out and pretty much ready since I've already been to some college.  And if I only had to go a couple years, I told him, "You know, I'll go.  I'll start working.  And then you can go to school.  And then that would make it to where if you could not work as much,"  But his uncle told him, he does gutters now, and his company will put him through school, but he's, you know, he'd then be, you know, more like sales.  And, and he doesn't think he would enjoy that.  And he's not saying he's not good with people, but he's not good at sales.  Like, you know, your sales people almost kind of have to have a little bit of, you know, not honesty to them or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, because they're supposed to sell a [INAUDIBLE].  He'd just come out and be honest with it.  And I'm like that, too.  I really couldn't do sales.  But he enjoys doing the work.  But he's like, "But I don't think I can be doing hard labor when I'm 55."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "And I don't want to be out in this heat doing this," he's like.  So, I would like to do that, but still he wants possibly to own his own business and his uncle told him he'd help him get the gutter stuff and help him get started, so I said, "That would be awesome.  I mean, then you could work, and then once you got the age where you couldn't, you would only, and be pretty established by then, that you [INAUDIBLE] continue what you're doing."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I mean, I think that's a good idea.  And he's good at it, I mean, I could never do it.  He's got to do the measurements, um, and, um, tape measure, I would never.  I would screw it all up.  I was like a fraction of an inch short every time.  [LAUGHING].  But he's good at what he does.  He enjoys it.  He said, "I don't really mind the heat at this age."  He's like, "I have it this easy."  And, he says, "I like being outdoors.  I don't like sitting behind a desk."  So he's enjoying it, so that's cool.  But I, I know I got to go to school.  I can't be a waitress my whole life.  I see some of those waitresses working now, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not downing them, but I can't be that age working two and three jobs because I've got to support kids.  I mean, I would be so aggravated by the time I got home, my kids wouldn't even want to see me.  Just move out and send us the money.  Because I would be so annoyed being 45 even, doing that job.  And working another job, then coming to waitress at night.  And the woman I work with, she's like a perfect example.  Because to me she has had a complete breakdown since I was there.  And it's like, "I've had it! I've had it!"  And I was like, see, that would be me, and I don't want, and her [AGE] son works there, too.  And I couldn't do, be doing that when my kids are [AGE].  I mean, which I'll be [AGE] when I have an [AGE].  I still don't want to be doing it.  And I would like to have a job, a career by then.  Start saving for retirement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think you will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, I hope so.  I'm definitely, I want to be out of school by the time I'm 30.  I was talking to my dad the other day, and he was like, "Yeah, I'm, I'm going to need you to take care of me."  I was like, "I know."  I'm the only child, I know that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's got his dependency on you all worked out, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  But, you know, him and my mom, I guess, have a [INAUDIBLE].  He said, "I don't know that your mom is going to take care of me."  I'm like, "How can you say that?"  [LAUGHING].  She just works a whole bunch now.  He does most of the housework and stuff like that and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's she doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's still nursing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Working with the babies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] and she spends a lot of time with her parents now, because, I mean, they're getting up there in age, and so my dad just feels kind of [INAUDIBLE] sometimes.  Like he'll clean and cook and have dinner ready for her when she comes home.  I guess she might appear a little bit not appreciative sometimes.  I don't think she does it on purpose.  I just think she's tired, she —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Taken for granted?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's what he says.  He get, uh, my dad is very sensitive, emotional person, so he, I get to hear about that.  I don't know, I, I understand, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, really.  And his health is not great at this point, I mean, he's got his IVTs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's taking care of himself now, but he didn't start in time, so he got nerve damage, and gets gout real bad in his hands and feet.  And so he can't really use his left hand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You guys get together often with your parents?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] so I go there usually before I go to work, and like I'll wash dishes for him, or help him do some stuff.  Because he watches the kids until she gets home, so I try to get everything set to where he doesn't have to do that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You working today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  I go in at 5:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 5:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  I work just about every day.  I'm off tomorrow.  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's hard.  I'm lucky, because that's [NAME OTHER]'s birthday, so I'm going to Toys R Us.  I get my check tonight, and I'll be going tomorrow.  I already got him a cake that I made.  I been making cookies and cakes for them at home since they've been out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got a lot of energy, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] can get your medicines for you, no side effects.  That's good.  What about sleep?  Is that okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.  It's been doing good.  Um, I've got back on the caffeine, like, there at work, I been a whole lot better at home.  I've been drinking water and stuff, especially with [NAME OTHER].  Drinking a lot of vitamin water and stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway that, and I love Gatorade.  But Gatorade really does have a good bit of sugar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, pretty good.  And, um, but at work I'll find myself, when I go in and I'm tired, I'll drink at least, like, you know, we don't have Mountain Dew there, which is probably a good thing.  I'd probably kill the whole soda machine.  But, I mean, I drink Mellow Yellow.  And, um, I'll have like one cup of coffee a day.  But I know I'm supposed to not have that much with the Adderall, so I try to, you know, maintain it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But sometimes I find myself at night kind of having to lay still, but I think it's because when I close down, and I don't get home until 11:00, I can't just cut off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need to tire yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I have to just kind of relax.  Watch TV for a little bit.  Usually eat, like, a little bowl of soup or something.  I don't eat a lot, then I won't be able to go to sleep, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What time you getting up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Early still, um, the boys slept until about 9:00 today, it's because they were on the lake and stuff.  I was so surprised.  I was up.  I hear [NAME OTHER] leave, and then after I'll lay there a little while.  Like I said, I like to out there and get my stuff in order before the boys get up.  Because if they wake up the same time as me, I just feel like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "Just shut up for 10 minutes, y'all."  Because, I mean, they get up and they start.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're awake.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They wake up ready to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  I mean I've got to stay, well I was doing really good, but I've been shouting out, "Don't forget, you've got to go to the bathroom.  Don't forget," you know, "Go and pee."  [INAUDIBLE] he's there.  He's gotten really good, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  You've done well with him.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... but it took me weeks to see... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...your initial appointment and I know it goes over to - it makes you on, well my... [inaudible]...of the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay. Don't worry about it. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were here, so. Well how are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm fine. How are you doing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm good. So was there anything in particular that you would want to talk about today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I'm very good at this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Good at what? When you say you're... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I need to have like a topic in my head or something that I want to discuss. Am I - am I supposed to?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Just whatever comes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whatever comes to you. Sometimes it's based only with the last session that we had. Maybe sometimes questions come up between sessions. Maybe something's gone wrong today or...just whatever comes to your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Because I was just trying to like - I was thinking about like, well what am I trying to pinpoint here and what am I trying to get out of it? And it's kind of like I'm not really quite sure. I definitely know that one thing I would like to gain is like some sort of ability to, not like work on my self-esteem, but - well I guess that is probably like the biggest factor I find is that - I don't know. I've been like reading like a lot of things that, just like defeat and disability, is there like things that people have in their lives that are like really hard to overcome? Sometimes I feel like my self-esteem is like really fragile and I don't know if I can overcome those things. And I would like to like be able to like - I find that little setbacks, I just have like a barely like altering self feeling about like how I feel about myself, it's just like never very consistent. And I guess one day I would just like to feel more just like secure with who I am and not let it, not have it waiver as much as it does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So being comfortable in your own skin?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, yeah. I think I'm really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:02:18.5]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...uncomfortable in my own skin.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't always - I kind of - if my - just my self-confidence waivers. Like sometimes I can go out and be around people and I'm not really like - and I'm feeling like confident and like I can go out and do that kind of stuff. And then other days I'm like feeling really down about myself and I don't want to be around people and I don't want people to see me at certain times, and then some days it's just like, sort of like up and down all the time. And like some days I'll be at work and like little problems sort of seem to be a big deal. And then other days it's like, 'Gosh, I can't even handle this.' Or like, it's just like one little thing about how I feel about myself and just like set this reaction where it like keeps me from doing things and... [0:03:09.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So I remember initially on, you mentioned that insecurity affects your intimate relationships. But it sounds like the not being comfortable with really who you are spills over sometimes, even in your job... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and in your performance with that maybe?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I don't really ever - it's kind of like hard for me to believe that somebody would just like [making noise]. I feel like how people feel about me also is not stable. Like I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...always feel like - I'm always scared I'm going to give somebody a reason to like not like me. Or, like I always, yeah, like I'm just always - or in getting to know somebody that, well there's going to be a point in time where they're not going to like something about me and it's just like a matter of time before that comes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And then like you - you're doomed for this to happen or - when you say it 'will only be a matter of time before it comes to that'?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like there's this like 'do it' like thing, and - I don't know. I just don't always feel like I'm a very likeable person and I just always feel like it's going to show itself somehow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Has anybody ever told you that you have - that you're not a likeable person or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my sister and I were laughing last night because - well we were having a get-together because my brother's getting ready to go to the Marines next week, so we were with our family last night, and we were just like joking about things. The thing I mentioned with like the soccer coach, and we were just talking about all these other things. I feel like - I don't know. I feel like I've been more - I don't feel like I've been picked on, I just feel like weird things would happen. Like we were talking about all the times we went to camp and stuff. And I remember like one time I cut my hand open and the counselor like made me put on these like plastic gloves and like keep washing dishes like when I got back. And then at 4-H camp, like we were at 4-H camp together and they just were telling me all the different ways the horse could like basically injure me and it scared me. And I, the next day I was riding and they were like asking me my name - asking me my horse's name and I didn't know it and then it kicked me off, my horse, and like it wouldn't let me ride the rest of the time. And like Dorothy and I were just talking about how I've had - it just feels like I've had like a lot of experiences where like - I don't know, like people are like - it seems to me like people don't like me and I don't know why. And like I feel - I don't feel like I've - so picking on it makes me feel like I'm like - I don't feel bad for myself, I just - it just seems like people have just had like issues with me somehow and like - well like it's just bizarre. And I wouldn't know where they came from and so then it makes me feel like, 'Well maybe I must be like...'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There must be something with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I would just like - I don't know. Like it's just like it's hard for me. And I've had like a couple of good weeks so it's hard for me to just like - if I'm out like, well feeling those feelings like that day or at that moment, I tend to think that they're not there. And so if I'm not... [0:06:14.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I mean? So it's almost like when I'm feeling that way it's easier for me to explain it because I think I tend to brush kind of stuff off anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Brush it off in what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, 'Oh, I don't really need to talk to somebody. I'm fine.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That kind of thing. And I think I'm kind of like going through that right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of like, 'Well things are going fine.' Like I feel - like I feel dumb like going to talk to Betty and not really having anything to say in particular. And like - you know what I mean? So I like just like get mixed feelings about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So because things are going well, it's like, 'You know why do I need to talk with somebody? I really don't need to talk to anybody and I feel kind of silly.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. And I guess that would make sense. You know a lot of times, I mean that's what happens in the process of therapy. Sometimes people come, even to the initial appointment with all these bad feelings and things and that initial appointment, just that point of contact with a therapist, can make them feel better and then it's all of the sudden, 'Well I really don't need therapy because everything is okay now.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like I know those times are going to come again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just not in it right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a momentary... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know reassurance, and so... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you have to sometimes push yourself to stay with this, keep with the process sometimes. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do though like - like when I talk to my boyfriend about it or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...he's just so confident. And I'll be like, "Well how do you feel so confident? Like what is it about you that you - why do you think you are this way?" He's like, "Well I don't know." I'm just thinking, 'Well gosh.' He just doesn't seem to care like in relationships and like somebody decided to leave him or someone decided to like mess it up somehow, he can just blow it off and be like, "Well that's their loss. That's their problem." And it's like I would like to get to a point where I could have like enough confidence in myself where... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...if somebody wronged me somehow or I made a decision, I would like to just be able to like be like, "Oh well, I'm going to be all right, like it's not going to affect me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Just have something though that the other's taking you for real?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there are some days I feel like - like all of my issues with my skin, like I keep I mean going to the doctor, and like some days it's just so red and I like don't even want - and it's like - it's like I don't want anybody looking at me and it's enough to make me like not even want to like face the day. And I'm like, 'Why am I letting something so small like my skin, like which probably nobody would even notice, like why am I letting that like ruin, like break me down, and just make me...' Like little things like that just can like make my confidence just like hit rock bottom and make me, like impair me totally. [0:09:04.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I want to like - and I'm thinking, 'What if something really bad happened to me? Like what if I like lost an arm or like what if I went blind? Or like what if something really bad happened, how would I even like get passed that, thinking I can't even handle like little things like this?' Like that's the kind of stuff I always like, 'Well I wonder?' It's like because I'm going... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that a fear of yours at all or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not really a fear. I just see like that strength in those people and I'm like, 'Why don't I have that strength?' It's like, 'I want that.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the strength is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like having something you can't control happen to you but like being strong enough to move forward and still like be happy and have a happy life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. So the strength in being able to tolerate disruptions in your day or disappointments or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In just how you feel about yourself. Not letting it like totally impair how you look at yourself... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so that the fact that it like cripples you and you don't want to do anything. Like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...they seem to overcome that imperfection about themselves and move forward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this one is like all or nothing thinking? 'If I have this one blemish then all of me is bad.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's bizarre.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I notice it in myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who are the people, when you think about it, who have that strength that you long for and you desire? Who are the people that come to mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just some of my friends. Like my friend Madelaine is just one of the most confident people I know, and she has her bad days but, it's not that she wouldn't take any crap from anybody, but just you just can tell she's a confident person and she's nice to people and she realizes, "Well if I'm a good person, I'm good to people and they're not good to me, oh well." Like or, "This is who I am and I accept it and I can't change it and I'm happy with who I am." I just feel like I have a lot - or my friend, my good friend Rebecca is the same way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just see these really strong people around me who, yes, they're not perfect, nobody's perfect, and they just love themselves for who they are. And they just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it that you fit into that circle? Do you all hang out together, Rebecca and Madelaine?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They, we're like friends since sixth, seventh grade. But... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...Rebecca lives in California now. And I've always been like, kind of like the - a lot of my friends think I'm funny but I think I always - I think I develop - I've from like a young age I like had really bad skin and people would like make fun of me about my skin. And I like was like a very - I never - I've basically always just used my sense of humor as like that was like my thing. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was a way to compensate for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I've, still that is kind of my rule.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I've become like quieter and more reserved though as I'm getting older. But, yeah, I definitely always felt like I was like the ugly, funny friend, in like our group... [0:12:12.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or in other relationships I've had with people in general.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So who gave you that title or that role in the group?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just my friends just would always tell me I was funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was never like a said, like...nobody ever like gave me like that title... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I just gave that to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Did you feel that way based on how other people responded when you all were together? How did people respond, react to you in a certain way that they didn't or they did to your other friends? Did they ever give you that feeling or reinforce that feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. I went through a period of time where people would tell me that - they would just like make fun of my skin and I had really bad skin, and would just like blatantly to my face like make fun of me for it. Well I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kinds of things would they say to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just, "You have like zits all over your face. Looking pretty ugly today Emma." Like things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And who were these people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like a couple of guys in history class and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Was this in high school or was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. When was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably 11th and 12th grade.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I think like a lot - like I like was really self-conscious about it and my dad would say things to me like, "Well you should really try to like go to a doctor." Or like things that I had been trying to do, like almost like implying it was my fault. Or like - just my dad would just always like say stuff about it, like not to be mean but just - but it just made me like really conscious of it. And I was like, "Well I know." And then for like a while, it went away for a couple of years and then I got back to college and it came back again, like really, really bad, like my freshman year, and I went on this extreme medication and it helped get rid of it. But definitely in my - definitely in my freshman year it like definitely caused me to like not do as many things because I was really self-conscious of my face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's kind of where I get my issue with my skin. It's like I get... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it's like the same feeling. Like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...'Don't look at me at all. I don't want you to look at me.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Because I know what you're seeing." And it's like it just makes me like really like upset. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must be painful? When you say like... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really painful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...not be able to face the world or want the world to face you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because of something that you know is not your fault?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it almost was just...putting it as, well, as something you have control over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then I was like really reclusive about it and people would say, "Oh, your skin looks really good now." And then it was just like - it was a nice compliment but I'm thinking, 'You noticed. Like I know you noticed. You're - I - you're telling me right now like, yeah, you know I have really bad skin.' And so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So even the compliment turns into... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I'd rather just have no - any people not saying... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...anything about it at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. [0:15:13.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like I had acne for like a really, really long time and it was really, really hard, really hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you dating at all in high school or did you have boyfriends or girlfriends or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like right before like my skin - I had my first boyfriend when I was 16 and then I didn't date anybody. I had a couple, like it never really was dating, it was just like a casual like hanging out, but that was typically...by today's terms I wouldn't consider him to be my boyfriend, but at the time. And then like my skin got really bad when like when I turned like - actually like junior high - junior high it was kind of like - well, junior high it was bad. Then it was okay for college - I went on this oral medication, it went - it was okay for a couple of years. And then, yeah, when I turned - then when I was like 17, 18 til I was 20, like end of high school, beginning of college, it was really, really bad again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So definitely when my skin was really - when my skin was really bad I dated one guy, when I was 18. And that was hard because I just had...I mean you don't really want him looking at you. I mean that definitely affected... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that relationship, and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...yeah, I definitely didn't - and I had a retainer, and so I definitely - when I was like 18, so I definitely didn't date anybody til after my skin was better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And that was a conscious choice that you made or how did that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it just affected like - I wouldn't even sometimes put myself in social situations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you had a retainer from what age?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like 18 to 20 I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whose idea was it to get the retainer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've definitely always had this desire to be like - I know there's no such thing as like looking perfect, and I would never like do a surgery or anything like that. But I've always like, for some reason, how people think of the way I look has always been really important to me. And I don't know, it's - and...it might stem from like my dad. I don't know. He would always, like when I was in high school and I was really athletic, he would like call me like a Butch and then he would say something about my skin or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Butch? What did - what did that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just - I don't know. He would just call - he would like always compare Dorothy and I to like some of the other girls on our soccer team and we were always taller and bigger and just with - he'd always talk about these two girls on my soccer team who he thought was really pretty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Your dad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what would he say about the other girls?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just would always talk about these girls, Teresa and Jennifer, and how pretty they were all the time. He just would talk about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would he ever just tell you and Dorothy that you all were pretty or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He did after like my skin cleared up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I remember him telling me when I was really little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's always just been important to my dad... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which is probably why I feel like weird about it. But like he was always like really hard on my mom about the way she looked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, how so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well when she was pregnant with like my younger siblings, he'd call her like fat when she was pregnant, and just always kind of - I have heard him call my stepmom... [0:18:15.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I've heard it - I've heard him make fun of her weight. So my dad, my dad's just kind of like - people would like call him beautiful Ricky when he was growing up. It's, my dad's just kind of vain along those lines.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's always picked upon my, apart my friends, like their physicality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I don't know, maybe that's where I get like - because I know like I'm not going to ever - nobody's perfect at all and nobody's ever going to be perfect looking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like I have what I have, so like when I get like a problem - I'm going to already deal with the way I look. I'm going to deal with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't do anything about it. But when I have something like acne or like weird, red skin, it just makes me ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra self-conscious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, and I think that's why I worry about my weight, with the way I deal with it. It's like - like when I feel like I've exercised and ate well that day, I feel better about myself. It's weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so it sounds like - I wonder what that was like growing up? With your dad, with these certain expectations and hearing him ridicule your mom and your stepmom, hearing him talk better-fully (ph) upon your friends and not you, I'm wondering what that was like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just remember going to soccer camp and like being with those girls and always thinking like - my mom, my mom and my older sister will say, "Yeah, you were like obsessed with Jennifer Slavin and Teresa Calvin." They're like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ..."You compare yourself to them over and over and over again, and you just always thought you were really ugly."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my sister was like, "Yeah, you just always had horrible, horrible self-esteem. You just always consider yourself to be like a sorry (ph) little girl and Jennifer and Teresa were like the most beautiful girls and you wanted to be like them and..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be like them Emma, was that to be like them, would that mean that you would gain your father's affection, more of your father's affection or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just seemed - I think I just kind of associated that with being important to everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like in hearing that all the time or just - yeah. I mean I can remember, I remember being young and asking my mom if she thought I was fat. And I went through a phase where I was like exercising like a maniac and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...my mom was worried about me. Because my mom always told me I was beautiful and my mom never... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...ever said anything like that ever. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How important to you was it to hear your father tell you that you were beautiful or to think that you were beautiful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he tells me now, but to be honest it really doesn't even mean anything, because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now it doesn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it doesn't mean anything to hear it from anybody. It's just like I just don't believe it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you have preferred to hear it from your dad when you were younger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I probably would've just preferred it to be a non issue. Like, 'Why aren't we talking about like how smart that person is? Or why aren't we talking about - why are we even talking about this? Why don't you tell me that I'm smart? Why are you telling me that I'm pretty? Or why are you talking about Teresa? Teresa's smart, why aren't you talking about that? Or why do you care about my skin? Like why are you talking about it, don't you know it makes me feel bad?' Or like just hearing him, the way he's talked to my stepmom sometimes, it's just like disgusting. And I would say, "Dad, like how dare you talk to your wife like that?" Like, "How dare you tell her she's fat?" [0:21:41.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you confronted him on that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how did he respond?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was embarrassed. But like my younger, my younger sister has weight problems, she's 14.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Bella?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bella, yeah, she's pretty overweight. And he doesn't, he's not mean to her but he will like get upset with my stepmom about it and like imply that it's my stepmom's fault, but my dad's overweight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's like, when he gets really upset that he's going gray. And my dad's just like really like vain, and it's like made me feel like that's really important that you have to like - I feel it's - I think that's kind of probably what it is and it just makes me feel like - because I don't doubt, like I don't doubt - I don't doubt like myself being a nice person or I think I'm an intelligent person. I mean I'm not a rocket scientist but I don't - I've never like - I've never really like doubted this part about myself, like I know I'm a hard worker. And just like I love these stupid things about appearance, like - you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like a part of that, you mentioned earlier, a moment ago, that part of your self-consciousness about your appearance may have something to do with your father's vanity? I mean it sounds like that's what you're saying, that your sense (ph) is like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or just like - well because like when I look at other people, I don't look at people like. I'm not looking... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not judging them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not ever. I just - and I, but I feel like since my dad looked at me that way... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and seemed to look at me in a negative way that other people are looking at me like that, too. And, yeah, and it's like not being very close to him now is like - I don't know. It's just kind of like a broad range of things. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. That what it sounds like. It sounds like this could be pretty complicated. I can just imagine how it must feel having this broad range of things. [And I don't know how even] (ph), how one can...get, become...overwhelmed with it, with it being so many things that it could be about or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know, just running (ph) a stick through the ribs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I try to like - I've tried many, many times in my life to be like, 'Well this is probably because of that.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like, well there are all these other things too, that have happened and I don't even know how they could be manifesting themselves now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's just kind of like really a wide range.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it could be? I mean it doesn't have to be. Let me - and before I say that, how comfortable are you with this idea that it doesn't have to be any one thing, that it may be a combination of things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I feel like I don't want to waste anybody's time. And I kind of feel like maybe it's not - I know it's not an equation but I feel like maybe I'm just like feeling sorry for myself, right? But I don't feel sorry for myself. Maybe I'm like making - I don't know. Like maybe it's not something that can be solved or maybe it's just what everybody deals with or maybe...there's really not anything there. I don't know. I guess I feel like I need to like be able to like produce a product out of it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any idea what that product would look like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't. (chuckling) Just like - or that I'm like bringing in an equation that needs to be solved, but I wouldn't even know what those parts of the equation are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You mentioned something a minute ago which is interesting. You said that, 'you don't want to waste anyone's time.' How do you, what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm sure you've probably talked to like a lot of people who have probably had really like similar (ph) problems or have had really horrible things happen to them in their lives. And it's like I just think that in comparison to that, like I probably have relatively small things that happened or issues, so. [0:25:51.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that have anything to do with, maybe with a comment that you made earlier, when you asked...yeah, I think when - I think you asked me if it was a problem? 'What is it like? It must be a lot to move from one client to the next?'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably, yeah. Nothing in relation to how you make me feel when you talk to me, nothing like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just...you could've just been talking to some whose had horrible, horrible, horrible things that's happened to them, and then you come back to me and it's like - I'm like talking - I feel like I'm talking in circles all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you find yourself fearing that you waste people's time? Like with me or in your relationship like with Jerry or even your sister? You know, do you - does that thought go through your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It goes through my mind when I'm like, when I'm talking about my life sometimes with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I feel like - I just feel like I'm more of a listener with people, like people are talkers. So like when I am the talker, I feel like I need to like hurry up and get it out or that I tend to like just not - I just tend to not say things because I think people don't care what I have to say, but probably not a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think they don't care?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that, yeah, a lot of times I do. I think that people just don't really - they don't really care what I have to say or wouldn't like what I had to say or would like somehow be judging me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like, I don't - I hold back what I want to say a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think in our conversations that we've had over the last few weeks that there's certain things that you may have held back from saying because you were fearful that I would judge or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think - well like what I said before, like it's hard for me to talk about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like hard for me to get used to like talking about somebody judging what I'm saying and to like totally listening to what I'm saying. So it's hard for me to like - I've always felt kind of like when I'm like talking - I've always worried about talking about myself too much because I don't want to seem like I'm like self-centered or - and I don't want people to think I'm like selfish and like not listening to what they have to say. So I'm always like really like hyper sensitive about listening instead of talking, so that's why it's hard for me to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What has happened in the past when you think about it, I mean in your childhood or early years, where you felt that way? Where you felt that, 'Because I was self-centered or I talked more or I did this, I may have...that person may not have wanted or that person may have been turned off with me, whatever, or I've wasted their time.' You know, where have you felt like what you were doing was like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I just never, ever even felt like I really had anybody to just like listen to what I said. Yeah, I think that might have been more it than anything. Like I think... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm just used to people not really taking the time out to hear what I have to say. [0:28:59.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I just - I've just always been like a really conscious person about other people... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...more than I have been about myself. And even - I remember just even being younger, I've just always kind of taken on the role of like consoling people, and mostly my mom, and I'm sure that's where I get it from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've always like I think just always kind of taken like an adult role in like a relationship with people. So I always tend to - I will listen to what they have to say first, before I get to say what I have to say. And I don't know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if you say what you have to say, what will?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just think that what I have to say just isn't as important to people as what they have to say to me. Like I just - or I don't like - I just kind of guess I feel - I mean there are certain people in my life now who are listening to, who will listen to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just takes me a while to get to a place with them where I feel like I can just talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it doesn't have to be like about anything in particular, I can just feel free to talk, but I haven't really usually. My dad and I will like sit in the room together now and there's just like we don't have anything to say to each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just don't feel like I can just talk with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or like at my family gathering last night, like I hadn't seen my step grandma in a while and it just seemed weird, like I - there wasn't much to say and I didn't - I couldn't just like talk about life. Because I felt like, 'Well she probably doesn't really want to hear it or she'd probably be bored by that or, and they're not or if they're not asking questions, so they don't really want to know.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Yeah. If on one hand it's, 'Do I have any - I really don't have anything to say or do I really have anything to offer in a sense.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 'But then they're not asking, so how much do they really want to engage me?'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's got to remind you Emma - it kind of reminds me of, I think it was the initial session. You talked about fearing or worrying that you didn't bring enough to the table.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like I'm hearing that theme as you're talking to me today. How's that - what - how do you put that together...a little bit more? Or is it connected to what you're talking about today? [0:31:30.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny, because if I think about it like in bare bones, I think, 'Okay. The confident people I know, what do they have?' Then I think, 'Well gosh, they always had like parents, like really like telling them how awesome they were and like supporting everything they did.' Like I think, 'Well why is Madelaine, why is Madelaine so confident? Well because her parents like drop everything and like support her or they just - she always had - she always has lived with her - she lived with the two parents who were married. She'd come home from school, talk about her day. They like supported her. They would call her, make her feel loved. Well ghee, what about - well what about Rebecca? Well Rebecca, Rebecca had the same thing for a while but then her parents got divorced. But like her mom is like really devoted to her and her mom makes Rebecca feel like loved. And I think has always made Rebecca feel like pretty and smart and totally those things.' And then I think, 'Well what about Jerry? Well Jerry's parents are still married and they like would do anything for him and he has like a really solid parental relationship, where his parents have always been extremely supportive people.' People who have supportive, loving families tend to be confident people. And then I think, 'Well, maybe it is simply, quite simply because I don't have that, like basic wiring in me that was never really like in place. It never was and maybe that's why I've always felt this way.' But then I'm like, 'Well why doesn't Dorothy feel that way...like me?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean because even looking at Dorothy's situation, it comes from the same... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...environment. Okay. So what do you think of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she's always been like more of like... [audio blip at 0:33:06.8 - silence to 0:33:14.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so as she's in the same house, the same environment, has the same...upbringing in a sense, but she's more confident. And you explain that how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she just always - Dorothy just has never compared herself with other people like I did, never. She's just always kind of had this like, 'sense of who I am' and that, 'take it or leave it'.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So with your friends Rebecca, Madelaine and then now Jerry... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [I don't believe them.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you're hung up with the idea that people have the loving parents who support them, are there to encourage them and look after them, they seem to appear to be more confident and things like that. And here you have a situation where you didn't have that type of foundation with your own parents. But then look at Dorothy and she is more confident... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in things. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's...how do you explain?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:34:24.4]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, you know? That's kind of like where I get, where I'm like, I just don't understand why I feel this way or why I just have always just kind of always felt like just not good enough... [0:34:38.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or not an equal. Not funny enough or not pretty enough or not, not any... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so again, it's something with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it goes back to that. That drawing board must be something wrong with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that how it is? I don't want to put words in your mouth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Because like even my brother, my younger brother and my younger sister, they just seem to not - they just don't - yeah, again, like they're both - my theory is just wrong because they just seem very comfortable with who they are... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and they seem to accept it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How does it feel to be different from your brothers and your sisters?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's just frustrating because it's like I don't know why. And I've thought about it and thought about it and I'm like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but it's just some thing intrinsic in me. It's not like I'm - I mean I'd - it's just some way it's just the way it's always been. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did dad talk to them in the same manner he talked to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My dad was kind of weird. I remember being really little and he told me that I was his favorite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Dorothy was, Dave and Alan were really tiny but Dorothy was older, and I just thought of Dorothy and I was - I started crying and I was like, "Well what about Dorothy?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just started like crying. And like - I don't know. I just was also, like when everything was going on, I was also just different from them. Like they didn't - I don't think they knew a lot of stuff that was going on, because they didn't want to know, but I found everything out. Like I just - I've just always been kind of - I've been more - I've always been a little more defiant than them. I've always been a little more, not reckless, but more prone to like being a little bit more reckless, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just drinking at a young age, and like just doing drugs at a younger age, and like sneaking out of the house at a younger age.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, all right, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just doing things like that, that they never did. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of drugs were you doing and at what age were you doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just marijuana like at 16.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And drinking you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At 16, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Sneaking out of the house, when did that start?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, probably like the same age.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would only like go to like my friend's house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was never anything like really dangerous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean things that they wouldn't do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's kind of like, if you look at my actions you would think - but back then I think I - it's weird. Again, it's like back and forth. I probably was more confident then, but at the same time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but I still would look at myself under a microscope, but I just have never been a consistently confident person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you Emma, when you said that your dad told you that you were his favorite, under what kind of - under what context? How old were you when that happened and what was going on when he told you that? [0:37:38.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I was about seven.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we were just driving to get pizza and my dad was like, "You're my favorite Emma of all the kids."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just was thinking, 'Why would you tell me that?' I remember just thinking like, 'Why would he tell me that?' It was like my parents were just getting ready to get divorced, and I remember - I remember just like crying, like what about Dorothy? Like thinking, 'Why would a parent...' I just remember, 'Why would he tell me that?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that was just out of the blue he said that to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Did he give any explanation of why he thought you were his favorite or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'no']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what that meant or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just saw me upset and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like for - well when I was really little, he'd always tell me when I was little, before I like became like a teenager, when I was like - before I was like 13, when I was little he was always saying, "You're so pretty Emma. You're so pretty. You're so pretty. You're so pretty. You're so pretty. You're so pretty. You're so pretty." Like, la, la, la, la. And then I like got a little older and - my dad's just always really focused on the way I look and I don't think he did that with Dave, Alan, and Dorothy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what, up until like seven and 13, he would shower you with these compliments about how pretty you were, and then they stopped? [And his sort of formula] (ph), what point or what happened to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He stopped with the acne and like...gaining a little weight, being a teenager and like, crap like that. And then - and then just started like hyper focusing on other girls, like the people, my peers and how pretty... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...they were and not saying it to me, and then...just kind of like - I just don't think parents should focus on their kids like that. I don't think that should be what you're - I don't think that should be the thing you're honing in them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean their physical attractiveness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think he really did that with me. Maybe, maybe Dorothy's confident because he didn't do that to her. I don't think he did actually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you noticed a difference in how he, what he said to Dorothy's from what he said to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Was there any other differences in the way that he interacted with you than Dorothy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really. It's hard to say, because like I just - everything was always so combative it just - it was just like a wide range of mixes and feelings, because I haven't - I honestly feel like I didn't pay attention to very much, because I just was focused on issues.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There just was never any calm. So there's really never been any time to really reflect and there definitely was never time to reflect then. So I don't know how it - I - the differences, I wouldn't know. Because it just seemed like, past a certain age it was just like going to my dad's house and like just getting away from my mom's house, and then fighting with my dad because he was saying things about my mom, and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what about affection? Did your - was your dad - was there a difference in how affectionate he was with you than with Dorothy? [0:40:39.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (big sigh) No. I never really like wanted my dad to hug me I think. He, which he tells me now that like when I was little, I was like really tough. And he would tell me I was like a princess and I'd think, 'I'm not a princess.' Then he'd try to hug me and I wouldn't let him. And he barely hugs me now. He's always kind of awkward. And, yeah, I mean he's never really been very affectionate. He used to be affectionate. He seems pretty affectionate with Bella, but Bella was like raised in his house... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...with like him...like he'll say like, "Bella's my kid."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can see, because she was raised with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think he's actually even been a little like, though he knows we were little, I think he's almost been kind of resentful of us for staying with our mom, and I think that makes him less inclined to want to deal with me now. He's kind of like - he seems to have this attitude of, 'Well if you want me in your life, come to me.' So I get defiant, because I'm more of a defiant personality. And I'll be like, "I'm not going to come to you then. I'll just be by myself and you can - and that your punishment is that you just don't get to know me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's how it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you see that as a way of punishing him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well kind of, because it's like Dorothy will take - Dorothy used to be more defiant about it too, but now she's kind of like, "Well they're our parents. We don't know how long they're going to be here. And he loves you and why don't you know if he loves you?" And I'm like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in relationships you have to like hone those relationships and you have to maintain them. I'm not going to say, "Well dad, because once in a while you told me you loved me and you won't talk to me for once, I'm not going to be like, 'Wow, my dad really loves me.'"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "I don't - it's not like you have to earn that from me but it's kind of like, show me, don't just like let me - why do I have to like sit here an hour from you and like wonder?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think if I had kids I would shower them with affection and I would let them... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...know I loved them. And I wouldn't ever talk to them about how - I would make how they looked any type of an issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would never call them - I would never call like a parent fat in front of them. I would never do any of those things. So I just get to the point where that, with my dad and my stepmom, where I do kind of blow them off. It's like, well I wouldn't...no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a two-way street. I'm 28 now. I'm not ten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If...we're adults, lets have an adult relationship. If you don't want to deal with me, great. Not even like they're dealing with me, it's just kind of like - and then when I do see them, I will go home to see them. They just don't even like - it seems like they barely even talk to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you are there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and then that makes me just not - and then I don't really talk. They don't seem to want to know what's going on with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, I've generally found that there just seems to be like a general lack of interest in what I do with some of the key people in my life. Which makes me like feel like, 'Well if they don't care then who does?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. Yeah. So it's, if they don't care who does or who should?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost like you were saying. [0:43:35.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like even like my friends who I know love me, if I haven't talked to them for a while, they'll be like - they'll talk and talk and talk and then say, "So how you been?" I'll go, "I've been fine."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like, "What have you been up to?" "Ah, just work." And I like hear myself and I'm like, 'They just really told you everything and you didn't judge them for it and you were interested in what they had to say. Why can't you like open up and like know that they're not going to think of you the same way?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that to yourself? [overlapping voices at 0:43:59.1]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I do like feel like blowing off a lot when I talk to people. Like I just feel like nobody's really, really hearing what I'm saying or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you at all experience that in our sessions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And if you did, I mean, I would want to hear that. [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, I don't experience that. I just have this weird like guilt about just spewing off information. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Spewing off? When you say spewing, what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like maybe some of what I'm saying isn't very important. It's so weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a little weird to hear myself even say that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because it's like, 'Well that is true. That's kind of how I feel but admitting it is weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is it important to you to want what you say to appear real important to the other person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [silence from 0:44:52.1 to 0:44:59.5] I just don't want to like waste somebody's time and I'm like, don't want people to think that, ' Emma just talks about herself all the time.' So like, it's so like self-conscious, all of it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So this, I mean spew, when I think of spew - like when you think of spew, what images come to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like when flying it out, like randomly, like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just kind of like spew, like you spit up or you know... </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...as spit, as to...all over someone if you...talked, like you're going to do this all over someone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so it's almost like a, I'd say a dangerous thing, but is this, it's like whatever you have to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It'd be negative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's a negative thing to talk about you, to talk about your interests or talk about your life or to talk about how you feel, it's a negative thing to do, and it's a negative thing for that other person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm just curious of where you may have received that message, 'To talk about what's important to me. To talk about how I feel. To let someone know what I'm interested in. That's a negative thing for them.' Where do you think you got that message from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [silence from 0:46:24.5 to 0:46:35.5] I'm not really sure because it's just been this way for so long. I hate like just sitting here and like blaming my parents. But just, I feel like in the key years growing up when I had a lot of problems going on in my life, like I didn't have anybody to talk to about it. [0:46:52.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And - I don't know. Dorothy seems to have just gotten over the fact that our parents aren't very attentive people and she just will say, "Well that's how they are." And she still - but then again I've heard her, she's been talking - she'll be at my dad's house talking and then she'll leave and my stepmom will say like, "Dorothy's really like..." She'll imply that Dorothy's really like focused on herself. But I wouldn't think that of her. I, it's weird, I don't, I just don't judge people how they judge me. Like I want to hear what my sister has to say. I just don't ever really feel like people want to hear it. I don't know. Yeah, I just feel like I burden people with things about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So to share what's important to Emma, to share or to tell someone else how she feels or what she values or what she thinks, [is burdensome for the other person to hear?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So again, as we were talking about in other sessions, that somehow you're responsible for burdening other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that part of sharing yourself is burdening to them? And I'm wondering, how do you bring that into your relationships, even with Jerry and the fear that you have of losing him or...doing something to, as you talked about in a dream, to cause him to walk away? Do you fear that you burden - that you're burdening him in this same way or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny, because I still like - we've been going out like eight months or just little less than that, but I still don't tell him like - I don't just like - I still definitely guard - I'm guarded still. I don't - when I was with Matt for five years, what I would get mad about more than anything, was I would get really mad at him when he, it seemed like he wasn't listening to what I was saying. Like when I felt like he was blowing me off... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it was like, I think I viewed him as like the one person who was going to listen to me or I think like should listen to me, and then when he wouldn't I would get so mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would like enrage me. And like just when he was - when I felt like I was telling him something important to me and he just was blowing me off, and it just really struck me as the most like defiant part of our relationship. It was just like - I think because I tend to make the person I'm in a relationship with, like that I do make them my confidant... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I don't have a lot of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, but I don't feel like Jerry like my confidant yet. You know what I mean? I feel like that kind of, for me, takes time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say enraged - I'm going to back up for a moment. Yeah, because if you feel like Jerry's really not a confidant, and so it's not something that you do automatically, as...they have to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Over years or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, perhaps, sure. When you mentioned enraged, can you tell me a little bit - well about what that looked like or? [0:50:07.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would just notice him just not listening to what I was saying. And then I would just, like inside of me, I would just get really - I wouldn't like yell, but inside of me I would just get like really - I just felt like a pressure inside of me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I would just stop talking to him. Then he would pick up on the fact that - because I had stopped talking, he'd be like, "What is it?" I'm like, "Never mind." And I would just like not even want - I would just be more, kind of like immature about it, and then, "Forget it." And like, "You're not listening to what I'm saying. I don't even want to tell you anymore." Because just, for me, that was just like a really big - with him that was like a really big turnoff for some reason. Just - I'm like, "I'm telling you something. I don't talk your ear off. So when I talk to you will you please just like listen to me?" Somehow like - so him not listening to me would just like really make me mad and would make me not want to talk to him for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think would've happened if you showed him or how you responded to him reflected the amount of rage, pressure, that you were feeling on that... [inaudible at 0:51:13.4]?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well when we - after a couple of years...you're still a little more guarded. So initially, when I found him acting like that, I would convey it as more of like - I would be more verbal about it. I wouldn't be mean - I wouldn't get like as angry, I would just kind of like convey the hurt. Because him, "If you're not listening, you're going to hurt my feelings." So I would talk it out more because it was at a stage in our relationship where it didn't seem like it was a problem yet. But over the years him not listening to me, I would just like blow passed the - I'm going to - I said that, "You know this hurts me when you do this, so I'm not going to convey that to you. I'm just not going to talk to you anymore. Because like how many times do I have to like tell you when you don't listen to me it upsets me and it hurts my feelings? Like how many times do we have to have this conversation?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "And you're just still not even like conscious of me enough to just listen to me when I'm talking to you." It just was - it just - to me it became like, just like a sign of disrespect and just like the lack of interest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I guess like for me, having a partner that listens to what I say is important. It's like one of the most important things to me, because I don't have - I don't feel like I can just like talk to people. So... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that's, that will be something that you would value in a partner, is to have that to be on top of the list, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have someone really listening to you in some way? Because listen - when you say, 'Jerry's not to listening to you.' Especially, because you don't talk a whole lot about...important things to yourself or private things, that person shows a little sign of respect... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...for you when you do take the time for that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's why like Jerry is, because he'll ask me like questions that I wouldn't even think he would know to ask me. Like he'll just ask me details about things and I'm not used to anybody showing interest in me like that or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of details do you mean? [0:53:02.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I went to a show the other night and so I - the night before last. So I didn't get to see him. I went home to see my family right after work yesterday, so I didn't get to see him yesterday. And the day - like earlier in the day we were talking and he didn't ask me about the show, which I didn't even think about. But like later on he's like, "Oh, I totally forgot to ask you, how was the show? Did you have fun with Dorothy?" And he'll always ask me like and I'll be like, "Wow." Like or he just always makes sure to like see if I'm all right or like ask me things. Like, 'How did you like this?' Or, 'How was work?' Or...he'll just, he shows concern and I'm not used to that, at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say he's concerned that...he shows you that concern, what does that feel like to get that when you haven't had that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels good. But it's kind of like - it's just not anything I'm used to, so it's like it's a nice surprise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what to do with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not always.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Not always, so. (chuckling) You (ph) get me mixed up. I think he can tell. I think he's, he initially seemed to have a problem with me not being as open. He's like a very emotionally open person. He's easily - he can tell me how he feels really easily. He can tell me how he feels about me very easily. And I like sometimes find myself like struggling for words like and how to like say how I feel or how to - but he, I think he - I think he understands that about me and he seems to be trying, and I think he does see me as more of a closed off person than he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm curious Emma, how does it feel to have someone? Because you talk about, and in this session and other sessions we talk about how you've been the responsible one. You were the one who has typically taken on a parental role in relationships and things. How does it feel to be on the other side now, with Jerry being the one to show you concern? What is that like for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like it. And then like I don't want it to go away. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Do you at all feel, when he expresses that concern or you recognize he's concerned, do you at all feel... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (getting emotional)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well what's going on for you now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sniffing) It's just I don't, I really don't feel like I've had like - I don't feel like I've had a lot of - and like it's just funny to think like, 'Well do I really feel like most people haven't really been that interested in me? Well, yeah.' I do feel like that. And just talking about Jerry in that way, like I often wonder, 'Why do I get insecure about him?' And that probably is what it is, and it's like I am getting something I like from somebody for once and I'm feeling like support from somebody, and it's kind of like scary now to have it, and then not have it, you know? Or now that I have it I don't want to not have it again. And then I'm scared to like go back to that, feeling that way. So, I don't know. It's just kind of like, it's pretty true, you know? I really do care about him a lot and, you know? I am - I do get scared that one day he might take that away. [0:56:28.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would cause him to take it away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like he is a great person and he's going to attract great people in his life and he might meet somebody that he likes better or that might - he might perceive as being able to offer him more than I can offer him, and I feel like I might come up short somehow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you aren't one of the great people that he's attracted to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah! (chuckling) Exactly. Exactly. Some days I don't feel that way, but mostly I do. You know some days I feel pretty confident but, I know consciously when I'm feeling confident, like I know it's temporary. It's funny because I will - I'm like, 'This is a good day, go with it.' You know like, 'You're feeling good about stuff.' (chuckling) And it's like in the back of my head I know it's not like that every day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in this situation with Jerry, he gives and he takes it away, or there's the potential? He has the power to give or take it away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm like lucky that he's choosing to be with me right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're lucky that he's choosing to be with you right now? [silence from 0:57:44.4 to 0:57:54.9] In this situation Emma, why do you think he's with you? I'm just - I'm curious. Well why do you think he's with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (whispering) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think he's taken an interest in you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think I've put a lot of effort into relationships, like insomuch as that like somebody's caring for me and being concerned for me, I'm being the same for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does it start off that way, something that they have to do first before you do it or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think he's just not used to like a girl like - like I'm pretty easy going. I don't - I don't really have a lot of expectations of people. So like I don't put those expectations out there, and I'm pretty easy going. So, I mean he's a wonderful person, so I'm like surprised by all this. But I'm not like - I don't know. (chuckling) Like maybe it's because I'm easy going or I'm a pretty adaptable person. Like I don't need to like be babysat like in social situations I don't. I just sometimes worry about that I, maybe I'm not - maybe I'm not really very interesting. Like I feel like... [0:59:31.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think he's hanging out with you? Why do you think he's asking you about how your days going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My guess is that he probably is just seeing something that I don't see in myself. (chuckling) But - it's kind of hard, because he's like always in like - I'm not - I feel like I always - I'm always hanging around creative people, like musicians or artists, and I'm not a musician or an artist, so I feel like I fall short in that area. So I feel like he'll probably maybe one day meet like this musician girl, whose like just totally interesting and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But until then though, lets stay here and now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're with him. He's with you. He's been with you for eight months or so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He takes interest in your life. Why would he be spending his time with you, and not with other folks or other woman that he very well could be spending time with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sniffing) I know he thinks I'm a good person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know he thinks I'm funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get along well with his friends. You know I think the - I think I offer like the basics that people want in relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The basics?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like honesty and loyalty and...a general concern for the other person's well-being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes the basics are the most important thing because that's the foundation of relationships or the foundation of what we all long for and desire.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then he supposedly couldn't just get that from anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well everybody isn't honest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [I suppose.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody isn't loyal. Everybody doesn't get along with a lot of people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you said how you're adaptable and those sorts of things. So, what do you make of that? What do you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny to hear you say that, because it's like, yeah, that is true. I guess I was kind of, well looking at myself as like being anything like that is special, is just - I guess I just look at myself as having more like universal qualities that aren't really stand - they don't stand out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unique to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, this, everybody is like this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but probably everybody isn't like that. It just seems like there's never going to be enough. Like it's just like I'm never going to be enough. It's always going to be like - there's always going to be somebody better. That somebody he would want to be with more or...which again, is like why I would just like to get to a place where I look at myself now, in this time and place, and I can be like, 'I'm happy with who I am.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can be enough for anybody, just the same Emma? [1:02:34.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because my friend Annie... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's a status value?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] My friend Annie Taylor is 45 and she's really confident and she's like the coolest lady, like one of the coolest people I've ever met. And I was talking with her the other day and I'm like, "Was your self-confidence like something that you acquired with age?" She's like, "I think so." She's like, "I just kind of - it is what it is!" She's like, "I can't change who I am." She's like, "I can't change it, so you just have to - you know, we all have faults and you just really have to focus on your better qualities and just move forward."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm like, "I really hope one day I can say that." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you've been reaching to people and asking them, you look at folks who are confident and you kind of ask them? Because I think you mentioned that you did that with Jerry... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and now with this co-worker, is something that you've been doing here in the recent weeks or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But they really never know why I'm asking it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They don't get to like - I don't tell them that part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's definitely something I'm trying to like learn from other people. Like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...what do they tell themselves when they're feeling bad or like what do they... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that may be a good thing Emma. Because I mean, I've been always taught - I'm going to try and pass this on. If their's (ph) is a place that you're trying to go or a person you're trying to become or whatever the case is, you kind of look in the world for successful others who may be good at that or may be like that. And you kind of either observe or if you talk to them or whatever, try and find out what are their secrets to that part of... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...success. You know and that's how a lot of the athletes or...people who, the top leaders in the world, when they - when you read the interviews and things, they talk about mentors and role models or successful others that they kind of pattern themselves after or whatever the case is, especially when you sometimes can't see it for yourself, you see that it's possible because you have this example, you know. And you may not have had that example in the past but there are many people around you that can serve as an example and kind of pick their brain.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, so I think that's a proactive... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] I'm just sick of feeling that way you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But at the same time I have to tell myself, 'Well all those people have bad days, too. Everybody's self-confidence waivers.' Doesn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes'] What does it mean for you knowing that people's self-confidence - that people's self-confidence waivers? That other people's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It just makes me feel like, well we're all human and nobody's going to wake up feeling like a million bucks every day, and that it's totally normal. I mean there's lots of things affecting people day-to-day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So and somehow what you feel... </p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes me feel like I'm... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and experience... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like relatable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. [1:05:29.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But people aren't just going to come out and say, 'I'm feeling ugly today.' Or you know what I mean? 'You're ugly, not that smart today.' Or, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nobody's going to like - nobody talks about that kind of stuff. People keep it inside like I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But I think it's good to be able to see, on some level, what other people may be experiencing. Sometimes that's a curative...factor in our lives, to see other people and realize that they, too...sometimes struggle with confidence issues, but they continue to go on or they can still function or...those sorts of things, help us realize that maybe we are normal. You know? [1:06:13.5]</p>

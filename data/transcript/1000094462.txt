<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here you go. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ready when you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, sorry I am late. I left in time to get here but the cab system. 10th Avenue was clogged solid. So, uh, I had to come across. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well coming across town is always -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I finally just got out of the cab and walked the rest of the way in the middle of the day it is hard to get here. It's hard; it was hard to leave extra time to get here on time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in the middle of the day, so. Anyway. Glad you have returned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I came back. Yeah I stepped out for a minute because you weren't here yet. I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. It is no big deal; we can probably still fit in our usual session. 0:01:08.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well lets see. Well I am actually I am pretty distracted so I am not sure what to talk about. I don't know. I've got a lot going on in the outside world and it's left me exhausted and frustrated. And I'm sort of going to have to deal with a bunch of stuff out there. So I don't feel like I can kind of leave that behind in here today. And also we had a pretty tense session last time. I don't know if you remember it, but that didn't exactly float my boat. I mean so, I've got my instinct right now is to like tell everybody I know to just go take a hike, including the psychotherapy program because I am tired of all you name it. So, so there. 0:02:50.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you look tired and frustrated today. And you are right the last session was pretty intense for me too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't guess that we will break protocol and talk about the real world. 0:03:34.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or did I misunderstand something about the protocol is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I mean. It's not a misunderstanding; we do focus a lot on the process of what happens between me and you. Well I believe that is what it's all about, but. I never set the boundaries on what can be brought up. The thing is, I can see you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is not entirely true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I don't seem to remember having said that you need to talk about anything in particular. 0:04:13.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: No but the handout that it's the dynamics between you and me and our relationship are going to be representative of what happens. I mean it's the experimentation here. Presumably so basically the focus here is on our interaction. And so I suppose we could discuss, you know, my troubles with my home life or my troubles with my girlfriend. Quote, unquote. Or my troubles with my bosses. But that doesn't, I get the feeling that that's not linguistically defined and we haven't sort of - since what's primarily of interest is minute changes in our, the dynamic between us. That precludes the telling of a long story, half hour interaction. You can say that you don't put limits on what gets discussed, but situationally defined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you agree or not. 0:05:49.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I agree to that. You're, I mean. In other words, though I have never said talk about this don't talk about that. What I end up, what we end up talking about or pointing out because of where our attention is focused does guide the way the sessions go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you, you have a lot of thoughts about not being able to talk. To tell this half hour story.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's true. Well I am a little. I think what gets frustrating is when things are going badly out there, this seems, there is certain limits to this. And this has proved very, very effective in getting me to speak up outside. I mean believe me. I learned quickly, or at least I at least some of the dialogue that we had in here and the frankness with it you demand, or at least which I think you demand, has helped. Because I have become much franker and I like it. I do like it. But as I slip into the ink out there, I am not very much in the mood for this. Or it doesn't feel like what I want. But - 0:07:48.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I should. Yeah, well go ahead. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean let's be frank here. You want to come in and say look I've got all this shit going on and talking about that, you feel like this should be a forum where you can be able to do that, that that would give you some relief.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well maybe, okay well he pays your monies you takes your chances. I think they are the same. Well I will grant one thing here. It seems like the same situation that exists, there are some parallels between this and my other relationships which I am also finding frustrating. Which is that in those settings there are restrictions about what can be introduced and what can not be introduced as well. And so, again, I'm trying to come up with a reason to care today. 0:09:12.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's as close to one as I can get. In my home life, I am supposedly renting from my ex-boss. In fact, I moved up here because he needed help and he was willing to give me a job and some housing for a while. But it is a very strange sort of unequal power relationship, because I am living on his turf, on his terrain. And it is interesting because he's, the situation has defined the rules. You know. He may be a very democratic guy and gracious in some ways. But the fact is I am living there at the pleasure of the mayor. And I am having trouble. I've, not only have I accepted some housing with his but I have accepted some outside work with him. And it's gotten so, I've ended up working so fucking hard for this guy, that it is affecting my day job. I mean I am going in exhausted and they are becoming critical, or at least looking at me in scans, or at least I think this is going on. And I am finding myself unable to confront him. 0:11:04.5</p>

<p>I'm getting a little better at confronting Cynthia and although all that is happening there is essentially when I practice my new found skills here, fearless facing of the truth, micro-second by micro-second. What happens is a fucking war. And I suppose that I can pull that out with Eddie too and in fact that very thing. I was exhausted; I worked a three day weekend. I worked 3 ten twelve hour days doing on the weekend, I did some construction work. I used to do that, so I still do it sometimes. So I got done with my three day weekend, got in Sunday night 9:00 10:00. And then on Monday night, I was supposed to have dinner with my family. Jay and his daughter and me and Cynthia. And I was exhausted, I mean I put in a full day of working my regular job and I let my tongue loose after a glass and half of wine. I was tired and grumpy and so when, basically, I pulled out my new hand gun and started firing indiscriminately into the crowd. And spent Tuesday and Wednesday issuing apologies. 0:12:46.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Someone is in here.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN SPEAKER: How long is it going to take?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We are going to be at least another 45 minutes. Alright.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN SPEAKER: Can I just take that tape here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's alright, okay.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN SPEAKER: Okay speak to you later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Sorry for the interruption.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Happens sometimes when you've been around. So you were talking about this evening where you were sort of firing indiscriminately. I have to say, even as you describe it, it's almost hard for me to imagine, because you seem so restrained telling me about it. 0:13:35.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's because I am tired and I don't give a fuck. Well first of all, I don't believe that I did fire indiscriminately. I feel like, I fill like the table was filled with assholes, or people who were acting like assholes that night. I feel like all I did was, I happened to be the weakest member of the party, both because I was tired. And so basically I couldn't stick up for myself when, you know, silos. Well I guess you wouldn't understand this, you're how old?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How old are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes a difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well do you remember the cold war? Do you remember, I mean, are you old enough to remember that? 0:14:29.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of it. Well anyways, silos were being empty everywhere. I mean missile silos, that's an old cold war term indicating that missiles were launched. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And destruction was, uh, I didn't mean anything about your age, I just sometimes use cold warisms. The Cold War was a lot more fun then people portray.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of the isms? 0:15:03.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it was just a lot more fun having someone to hate. And nice evil other, [inaudible]. Now it's just the Arabs, and we are never quite sure who we are friends with and who we aren't. But anyway. So this dinner conversation was, well this dinner gathering, it was supposed to be a quiet dinner gathering and it ended up being a noisy one with more people at it. And once this, supposed to be a quite salad and watch Alley McBeal with just four people. A fifth came and a senior professor in the department of sociology. And so all of the sudden, it was posturing everywhere. You know we had turned on the TV, we're sitting down to eat dinner and this guy show up and all of the sudden, wow we never eat dinner and watch the TV. And it's like bullshit, we do it all the time, what are you saying. And, you know. Anyway, I was trying to make fun, but I was also being very revealing about the family secrets. Its like, you know. I mean this is what this family loves for. You know, sort of eating and watching TV and not talking much to one another. But anyway. Is this boring you to tears? 0:16:45.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You, I was wondering if you were curious about how I was reacting. I actually had the feeling earlier, you got more into the rhythm of telling the story. But I had the feeling earlier that you were wondering when I was going to jump in with something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] I just thought, oh this poor guy. I mean here he lives to micro monitor discussions and he is having to clam up for a good ten minutes while I get in my pound of history.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As if -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought maybe we should have anesthetized you first. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anesthetize me so that I can take it? 0:17:39.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it may not be as hard as you imagine for me to listen to the story about your outside life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is very gracious of you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it. I guess, gracious, but I don't know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I hate this. Well anyway, so in the short time that I have been in therapy here. [inaudible] I have gotten back with Cynthia, whom I was so happy to gotten rid of. And I drink more and I weigh more. This, things do not seem to be going, I don't feel, I don't feel like this is very much under control. The only thing that I think has benefited me so far as my ability to state what is happening while it is happening. Or two different people. 0:19:16.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that is a small thing in comparison to these other things that are important. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I will say, no you're right. Well I don't care. No, they're not. Being able to state it. Jesus, this just occurred to me this is mindfulness. Christ I have been bought off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, wait what is going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on? 0:19:54.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it just occurred to me, I have learned what I am supposed to learn. The pamphlet has bore fruition. No it has helped, well it has made me realize, it has created as many problems as its highlight. I mean I do now feel like, well what it's made its made confrontation more likely. Because mindfulness and being angry and uncomfortable. Well I am not going to use that term anymore, it's a disgusting term. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mindfulness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It sounds so, so thought out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I find you to be simultaneously praising and disparaging of this whole thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yes and no. 0:20:57.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't commit do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's so funny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was trying to be simultaneously disparaging -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's frustrating because there is no mechanism. Perhaps it is wrong to expect one, but. Its fairly low tech here. I mean in the sense that on the one hand I feel like I am being given a skill. Or at least I have learned one. At the same time it's, well the two things. I mean on the one hand, its creating little wars everywhere. And I'm not even, I didn't even realize that what is happening is that this loosening up my tongue, even more then my tongue was loosened. I mean I've always fairly, I mean I am quiet a lot, but when I speak up, I'm often pretty pointed. So this is sort of loosened me up a little bit. This is sort of, we fired a couple of editors. And so now it comes out a little more off the cuff then I am aware of you know the dynamics. 0:22:43.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that one of our goals?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, that's why, I don't know if it was or wasn't. I know that, I don't know how it couldn't be. Because that it certainly what we have done every session. I mean, you'll stop, I'll giggle, what is going on here. Okay we are doing it. What is going on here, you know. Seems like there is a power thing here. How would you explain it?. Well we will stop when something gets weird when the discussion. When you sense a dynamic, you'll stop and say, what's that all about? Or okay, now if, I don't know if it's a stated goal but it is certainly explicit in the process. Unless, well--go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like we have been paying attention to the process and when the dynamic, or part of my dynamic, or maybe something suggest the dynamic comes up and we start to talk about it. You are saying more then that though. You've taken that, you've actively tried to learn a skill out of that and apply it to what's happening in your interactions in life. And its lead to a lot of confrontation, slip of the tongue, firing editors. 0:24:12.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm not sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you're not sure that that is what we started off with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I am also, perhaps even more importantly, I'm not sure what you think of that result. I am not sure if you think that is good or bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's good. It clearly good because I think what, like I said. Well as I said even in the first sessions, you surprised me. I actually am perceiving things that I did not pick up before, both within myself and within others. Perhaps just within myself. You know, when Cynthia starts to play a game, I go stop, hey, you know. I am picking up something weird and I don't like, so why don't we just shake hands and call it even right here. Or whatever. I mean at the end of Monday, I said she's storms out of the apartment. Basically she's like "I'm out of here" and we were supposed to watch the Oscars. She just stormed out, "I'm out of here". And I said well let me walk you to the office, I was just a block and a half way. And thinking this is sort of gracious and [inaudible]. 0:25:42.0</p>

<p>And I realized here storming out is supposed to have the effect of withdraw affection like. It's basically a power play in some sort. And I didn't respond to it by saying oh please stay, I am so sorry. Grovel, grovel, grovel. I just said, "Well do what you need to do, but let me walk you out". You know. And she didn't like that so she continued. About fifteen feet outside the building, this cold shoulder stuff continues to come. I said you know what, you don't want me, there is going to be 300 more yards of you being pissed at me. You know, why don't we just stop it right here. And I am going to let you go. We'll check in or okay fine, it was exactly what was going on. And what it did was lead to another fight. Which leads to - </p>

<p>So on the one hand sure, great, I now have a little more access to Cynthia and to my, you know, to that setting and I am able to do it. On the other hand it's, you know, it was a war. There were wounded. I mean my week became more complex. I had a hard time sleeping for two or three nights. My boss is frustrated with me because I had to go the state capital and I was supposed to be attentive and alert and on it, and all that I am doing is trying to keep awake. So now I have been shit sitting at work. And I come to [the hospital] and you know, and its am I getting support on this end. You know, it like no. 0:27:47.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, you are not getting the support that you want, that's right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let talk about the war we are having in here then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is this a war? I'd rather not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Last week was a war. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Last week was a war but maybe that was just. Tell me what you think; my guess is just when it was most overt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean but what are we talking about? You're saying I got all this shit going on and I can't talk about and you are not helping me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I am saying this is how we do it. 0:28:27.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. You know this is the funny, the funny thing is, is that this sort of - you know one thing that I don't like about what happens in here is that it feels like there is a, I feel like we agreed this the thing now. But it has taken a long time to sort of state it opening. And I am not sure if that is my fault or your fault or just something that you're kind of playing with so that I get to realize some things, or whatever. But it seems like this is also the problem that I am facing in other relationships is there is something that is fairly clear to me, fairly obvious. </p>

<p>At the same time it is also fairly unapproachable for some reasons. And it is not unapproachable because it is part of an analytic psychiatry program. And that it falls outside of the paradigm of, you know, what's to be discussed in a day. But it is, what I am finding is that these, these subtexts that are floating around in my relationship with my "roommate", the man that has power of me. Or my girlfriend or my boss, all have these kinds of things which they're kind of trying to duck [inaudible]. But nobody wants to have a frank discussion. 0:30:23.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in some ways, I've felt like what has been frustrating is that you don't either. Or you will have a frank discussion but at the end of the hour, which is what I have been angry about in the past.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. Well this is interesting. This is part of our war. Let me stop actually right now and talk about it just what I see happening. And then you tell me what you think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I tried to focus us on what's happening immediately between the two of us and you acknowledge for a second. But then almost immediately start talking about kind of on a more abstract level, how this related. Almost how you might say theoretical level or noticing similarities. Which granted may be perfectly valid, but I'm trying to focus one way and you are saying lets talk about this. 0:31:12.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're laughing again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] I hope this isn't going to happen again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This happened, okay, you are trying to focus. I'm not, I'm focusing us Jim. I'm trying, I'm saying the same thing you are, I'm just talking about it. I'm not trying to distract you; I'm not trying to pull you off topic. I'm just saying the same thing is happening else where -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, it's true I do parallel task. Okay, I will have - maybe I need to slow down and just let us focus here, right here right now. And do this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem to, I just want to stop you for a second, because you seem to take what I was saying as critical. As if - 0:32:20.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well shall we play back the tape, I mean. I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No you really did, maybe what, I mean I don't know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No why I thought it was critical -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't intend it as critical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You just said we went off topic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I was trying to say as more that you seem to want to talk about one thing and I want to talk about something else. And that's where the conflict between us comes in. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's not true. It's not true; I did not want us to talk about something different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh okay right. Right, you're right. Okay granted -0:33:11.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was saying that I was trying to grant your point and make a side observation for myself. Gain some insight and then get back to what we were going. But the fact that I made the side observation, like unnerved you or something. Or it became something you focused on. And the same thing happened last time. I thought we were about ready to like make some observations. Or at least I wanted to make an observation about how being polite actually wasn't such a great idea because it created eight or nine minutes of discussion that was frivolous. And then I had to deal with both the original stupid comment and the eight or nine minutes. We didn't talk about that. We ended up talking about I can't even remember how it went before, but it was the same pattern. You know it was like, I say "oh yeah this is really interesting because the sounds a lot like this and this and this that happens out there". And now it has happened again. I feel like now we are off topic. Now we are talking about whatever we talking about, it's become a meta-discussion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I feel like now we are no topic and I felt like before was a meta-discussion. That's, this is what is frustrating for both of us. We are in disagreement of fundamental disagreement about what we should be talking about. It seems to me and I want to check in with you and see if you agree, if you disagree. 0:34:53.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I don't care again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't care?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well let me say that I might care but I don't feel like dealing with this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean last time I had the energy to recount the discussion. And now I just feel like washing my hands of the whole fucking thing. Because it just, it requires that I keep track of seven or eight minutes of dialogue and track it back through and show how my interpretation is better than yours or something like. I had the energy for it last week and I don't have the energy for it this week. And quiet frankly, I have forgotten what we were talking about, which is even more frustrating. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It feels like it's a lot of effort for you to do this. It takes a lot of energy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I find myself wondering, I don't have a good answer to this. Why it seems, even given this fundamental disagreement, that we are both seem to be working so hard at it. 0:36:12.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it easier with other patients?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's different. But it does seem that we are both -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hard, just easy elsewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But it does seem that we are working hard doesn't it? You seem to be saying that we are working hard. You seem to be saying this is tough for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is tough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe I can actually say it another way. I'm not why we're so much, why there seems to be so much. Why it seems so adversarial. It seems very adversarial to me, I don't know if it seems that way to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It started off being less so, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - last week, Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Last week was tough. And now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not quite as bad now, but its getting there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, so a little bit. Okay yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah sure. 0:37:05.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I feel like I come in and don't intend it to be adversarial and I don't think you are trying to make it adversarial either. So, do you have any ideas about what happens?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well last week I had a theory. I can't remember. I think last week I decided that, last week I got the distinct impression after I left that you had actually gotten insecure. I mean I can not, it wasn't last week, it was two weeks ago. And I actually can't remember the content anymore, but it was just like I was ready to sort of - I mean I felt like I was ready to learn something. I mean I felt like I had sort of made an insight and but somehow it ended up casting aspersions on. Or at least I was wondering if you felt like I had somehow attacked your credentials or abilities to conduct a discussion or something like that. </p>

<p>This week, this week seems different in that here again I am ready to sort of talk about I need to, I need to be in healthier situations with Cynthia and with Eddie, my archenemy. I need to. This stuff is wrong and its bad and I've got to get out of it. And I am just about ready to see a way through and all of the sudden you are back on like, you know, like we struggling a little, you know. Its like, I don't know. I just - 0:39:25.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So - </p>

<p>PATIENT: -I feel like you're not seeing that what I am bringing up at critical moments when we're having a discussion. What you are not seeing is my, something happens between us. You bring up a point. You make a point. You see something about our dialogue, the way that we are interacting. My first reaction is gee how does this relate to three problematic relationships that I have in my life? Okay, I go ahead and make those side observations and then you like freak out and go what's happened, wait, wait, why have you shifted the topic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. Okay. And I am like, I didn't shift the topic, I just wanted to see how it worked out there before moving on in here. And then I get pissed off because well I didn't shift the topic, but you just did. And then I am pissed off at you for you know, spoiling a perfectly good therapy session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well whatever it is. So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So -</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it seems like if there is any resolution it would be permission to have a side bar in the middle of this. Or some plausible reason why I shouldn't be thinking for these side relationships what we should be focusing on this thing in here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, yeah. So I was asking about the adversarial quality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you said a lot about it, but I am not sure exactly what you're answer was, so -</p>

<p>PATIENT: My answer was, you want to focus on our relationship in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to make us have a side bar. Look at what's going on in my outside world. Get some affirmation that yeah, what's happening in here might be also happening out there. And then return to what is happening in here. And that side trip, that side trip pisses you off and it pisses me off. And then we are adversaries. 0:41:49.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are we having a side bar now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we weren't until you just brought, what are you talking about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am wondering if we are having a side bar now where you are talking about a sidebar in which you talk about observations -</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the outside world?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the outside world. Well this isn't -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's your question Jim, how can you call this a sidebar. You asked me a question, I asked you a question. How can you call this a sidebar?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yes you did answer my question. You seem to, I think my last question -</p>

<p>PATIENT: pissed me off?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - pissed you off. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it just seems like this is like the forth time that I have been coming here that it makes some sense to ask a question and get an answer and then let the conversation wander for a little bit, and then ask another question. But you can't. It doesn't make sense to me to ask a question, get an answer and then ask a question, and then just, like I ask, you said. You asked me a question about what's going on here. I give you an assessment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it. I said we do this, then we do this. And then you come back with "and isn't this a sidebar?" And its like wait a minute, you just asked me a damn question, I answered your question. I mean if this is a sidebar, then it's as much your doing as it is mine. Or - 0:43:19.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that may, but I just. Lets backup for a second, because my question did piss you off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What difference does it make if it's a side bar? Why don't we resolve the issue first before having another meta-theoretical discussion about whether or not -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, go ahead and ask your question. [laughing] Jesus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually I don't have one right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're ready for my questions. Or at least now you are. That other one though pissed you off, that pissed you off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why do you always? That's like your four millionths of a millimeter away from an insight and you decide. You ever heard that joke the one about the Quakers, or no it's the friends, I don't know. It's a religious joke and you know you say that they come to a fork in the road on the way to heaven. One says to heaven, the other one is a discussion about heaven. I get the feeling that you are going to go towards the discussion about heaven. You know, and its like can we just have the insight first and then. I mean. 0:44:38.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What difference, lets get back to the sidebar. I mean that was where, why? What kind of sidebar would we be having the sidebar, I mean. That point came up originally -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just feel like we are talking about two different things. And I want to talk about one thing. Its not things, see we get confused about who's which topic. It's not really a topic. We are talking about the same topic, but you want to talk on one level that you think will be helpful. And I think another level will be helpful. And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what I don't get. Is because, is because for me, taking a brief aside to this other level is very valuable. For you it seems like a distraction or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, more to the point, I don't let you take the asides.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you are not usually so frank. But it was refreshing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that struck a cord with you, that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] there is no way that the outside world will, that this is the perfect program for going out and dealing with the outside world. I am now convinced. It is so Byzantine in here. That when I go back out there its child's play. [laughing] 0:46:25.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughing]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So is that rather insulting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't sure if that was insulting or a compliment to tell you the truth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] let me tell you. Neither was I, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Can you tell me what's, I'm not sure what you are laughing about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] well it basically seems suicidal, I mean. I mean, it feels like this can only go on for so long before we drive each other absolutely nuts. And so, I'm just laughing, it's like great, I'm not a suicide course here. For two or three more weeks maybe I'll be able to get some advantage these psycho-conflicts. And then I'll throw in the towel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you seem to be - do you get the feeling that we both feel kind of stuck. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know about you, but I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I do too. I think it would be fair to say that in some ways we are at impasse. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. An impasse. 0:48:04.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] sorry. I just remembered the movie, Princess Bride, where Wallace Shawn goes "ah then we are at an impasse". No it isn't Wallace Shawn, its Carey McAllister, Macaless [ph], "then we are at an impasse".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is very much like a discussion in that film. Have you seen the Princess Bride?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Many times.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You remember that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. "And never mess with a Sicilian when death is on the line". Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: are you Sicilian? 0:48:43.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, [inaudible].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughing] you were wondering though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's actually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's actually nice for us to take this little break and joke, I mean it's a stress relief. Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am enjoying it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am having all kinds of fun wondering who has got the iocain (sp) powder. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: uh huh. Right. It's hard to be at a, I think we are at an impasse. I know that we are joking about that. It's hard to be impasse, we have been I think maybe, we'll say at least last session and now. I mean we are kind of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there were a couple of good sessions and couple of, you know, [inaudible]. 0:49:26.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Ouch. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you didn't go home and love it either. I mean, I wasn't saying you were an unker [sp]. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I take responsibility though for what happens in these sessions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. Well you are not supposed to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You talked about two levels. Tell me about the level that you think, is there some, I mean well. One thing I am not sure of is when you said two levels, the only thing that I thought of is, I do hold people at a distance these days. Because it is for survival. And I am not sure if what you are wanting is for us to focus, you know. And that's the level that you want to stay at. And I am sort of keeping it out this sort of broad sociological psycho-social level of you know, oh this. I am not sure if that is what you are talking about. 0:50:59.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here's the trick, okay. Alright. Here's the impasse, or at least a really good example of it as far as I am concerned. For me to try to describe the two levels that I am talking about would be to be talking on your level. And I don't think that is going to be helpful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the dilemma that I am in. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and I get the feeling -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is there any theory in your world at all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - I get the feeling that you keep putting me in this position -</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] Okay, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - that's really why where I feel stuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what do you want to do? Tell me, without telling me your other level, tell me your other level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I want to do is talk to you about the question you just asked. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Which question?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do I want to do? Tell me about, without telling me about your level, tell me about your level.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want to basically, I can't talk out of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you know, you see but that's it, isn't it? I mean I think that's something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Basically, okay lets, lets just, you know, humor me for a few minutes. I mean basically you want unabstracted discussion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See you pull for me to make these observations on the same level that you want to make observations. And I resist, like I am resisting now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like I am resisting. 0:52:36.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I asked politely if you would humor me for a moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really feel like I am avoiding answering your questions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's because you're avoiding answering my questions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm avoiding. Okay, you feel so too, okay. So we can agree about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] Jesus Christ. You're a work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want to have, you actually want to have a certain kind of discussion, but you're completely unwilling to tell me what kind of discussion that is. You want to work at some level, but you can't tell me what that level is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All I am saying</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its too abstractified (sp), it's too alienating, it's too alienated. What it is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not alienating. But yeah there is a certain level of abstraction. Let me put it this way, okay. Ted, you are a very bright guy. You like to think things through. You like to make observations that you can use to guide yourself. One might call them generalizations. Something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And you're good at it. And I see you working in here to extrapolate things from the little interactions we have. But my guess is you've known that all your life. 0:54:00.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its not what I find is going to be helpful. And so I keep trying to focus on the immediate interaction -</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is probably when I giggle right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is often when you giggle. Yes. And it's tough. Because you are saying look at this, and I am saying look at this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] you are probably right. I appreciate it. You probably right. What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you say that is a fair characterization of the impasse that we are in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said you are probably right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. See I even struggle. Now I think about that question that I just asked you, not only, I mean in some ways it was necessary, as you're answer implies, but also that was a question about that's on your level.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a question about making observation, generalization about, is this fair to say that this is the kind of impasse we are in. That is not the question about the immediate dynamic between us. Are you seeing how I go back and forth with it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Been infected by theory Jim? 0:55:31.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughing] alright, well I think we're about 50 minutes. I think we have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. Lets see, next Thursday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, lets do next Thursday. And then maybe the week after we could try for a Wednesday, Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I will have increasing ability to do the doubling, especially if [inaudible] has gotten insurance stuff to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The money is actually becoming, if I don't get the insurance dealt with, I am in trouble. So that has to be done, so I'll make sure. I got an envelope from her when I got back; I haven't looked at it yet. But if the insurance is going okay, then we can start doubling up. If its not, we are at a whole different level. Different level. 0:56:32.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Different level. Well listen, let me know when it's going to be comfortable to do that. There's not a huge -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh you'll know immediately. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. There is no huge time pressure to starting the doubling up, so when it's better for you is when we'll do it. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Thanks a lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for coming in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks for letting it run over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take it easy. 0:56:59.0</p>

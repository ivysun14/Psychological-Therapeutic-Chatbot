<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay all along to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would depend—let's see, I will go back and look through the EOBs (ph) I have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's for the month of August. We paid out of pocket and I think that she was—I can't remember exactly what the accounting techniques was going to be but ever since we've been seeing her, essentially I've paid directly out of my bank account. We were going to see if there was some way of accounting for it that would take care of the deductible up front.</p>

<p>I can't remember exactly what she ended up doing, but my vague recollection was that we could foresee that our contribution for that, (pause), exchange was going to take care of the deductible. Now that I think about it, I'm not entirely sure why that was my impression, but, (clears throat),—[00:01:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so—</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's 500 bucks I think, right? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean the question is how much of that was kicked to the claims I submitted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't think it was much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had one claim come back and say that the total that I had billed for was going to the deductible, and another one that paid out partly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in theory that around $200 or so?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's less because they paid part of one, but it'll be something like that. I'll have to double check to make sure there were no earlier ones.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But those were the only ones I saw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what that would suggest is that they distribute the deductible across different sorts of services?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way it works, yeah—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically and it would—[00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it relates to who submits first.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see, okay. Well we'll work on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It comes up again and it makes more sense—</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I mean, I guess the next question is am I liable—I should be paying them, don't you—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you'd be paying me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because what they do is they say something like, the (pause) $X that would have gone to you Ethan, has gone to Galen's deductible to pay for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there essentially making you there collected—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. [inaudible at 00:02:35]. All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The typical fashion, but I'll, (pause), I'll go through the, (pause)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just go through when you generate the bill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I can probably do that this weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a shame, but so it goes. All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like I said, I'm pretty sure I've only seen a couple of them [fall my way] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) the deductible is distributed on the basis of first come, first serve—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or on the basis of pricing? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So like, (pause)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't think there's been another claim, which—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would have been—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would have raised a red flag in my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would have been stuff you submitted probably, to get reimbursed for seeing your couples's counselor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I see, all right. Sounds good, (pause). (Sighs), (pause), (sighs) [00:04:26]</p>

<p>(Pause). [00:05:28]</p>

<p>I'm not sure where our, (pause), conversation on Wednesday leaves me. (Pause), (sniffs), (pause), I mean my sense of the rhythm of our conversations is that, (pause), when I'm able to integrate discussions and I can kind of see the—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Sneezes).</p>

<p>CLIENT: The way it ought to work when I can't, (pause), when I can't integrate these discussions, when I don't have memory, (pause). But ultimately the usefulness is, (pause), is dependent on being able to, (pause), to appeal to that train of thought in that moment of stress. [00:06:43]</p>

<p>And I don't, (pause)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not actually—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ultimately, (pause), the way this works. That can be helpful and that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, (pause), it's as much, or more an issue actually of kind of working out, in here, in (ph), (pause), the difficulties with let's say memory or integration, that then helps you to do that, (pause), not because you remember to do it or you're cognizant of it, but because you've worked it out, (pause), in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean, I guess that's what I'm saying is that I don't, (pause), I mean we've been working it out for a little while now, and I feel, I feel stuck. I don't feel—I mean whether we're talking here or somewhere else, it wasn't as if that memory returned in the course of [inaudible at 00:08:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess I would say it sort of, pause—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what—I mean I guess, I guess the sticking point is really what working it out means. It means talking about it and I don't know, (pause), making a model, or, (pause), I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what it would mean and I don't really see, I don't really see the direction for it, and so I feel stuck. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe to put it a little bit less emphatically, I feel, I feel a sticking point. I feel a point of friction I think, and it's frustrating. It's frustrating to have a—I'd like to have a pretty good model at this stage that would have a big consensus on. And really that's having access to it when, (pause), even in this setting I feel like I need it. [00:09:12]</p>

<p>(Pause), so, (pause), I don't feel at ease now. (Pause), in that sense I feel, I feel some calm or, I don't know, (pause). I feel some stress, I'm usually more—it's a little bit curious actually, in the sense that normally, (pause), I'm struggling for a way to describe these two things. Normally the, (pause), the kind of deliberate, (pause), way of talking, and thinking, and assessing that I'm using right now, goes along with a sense of well being, in our interaction. [00:10:49]</p>

<p>(Pause), when I speak, it's not kind of examined meticulously. (Pause), so it's strange to be more or less fluent, and yet not to have that sense of well being—that's curious. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what else comes to mind? (Pause), I mean about that or (pause)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean a couple of things. First, in some sense I think that's good. I mean that's kind of what you would want, in a way, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), yesterday for the first time in this entire three month period or whatever, I actually missed, or half-missed an obligation. They had changed the time of my tutorial at the school and I had been blocking my e-mail, so I hadn't noticed it. And it didn't occur to me until about 12 minutes after tutorial had already started that I had done so. So I ended up being about 20 minutes late or maybe a little bit more. [00:12:16]</p>

<p>And they had gotten somebody to spell me, I'm not sure at what point that happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, to what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gotten somebody to stand in, I don't know if they got that at the beginning of the period or if the students had to let somebody know that I wasn't there. But I arrived at, (pause), 20, 25 minutes after, which as I say, (pause), I think a couple of the kids were pissed off and they evidenced it.</p>

<p>But I think the conversation went fine. I kind of handled the conversation okay. I wasn't feeling great about it obviously. (Pause), I wrote an apology to the course director and the person whom I know, (pause), who's like a close acquaintance that filled in for me. [00:13:19]</p>

<p>But (pause), yeah I felt bad about it, but I kind of kept my equipment with me. I guess in some sense of the way that I'm keeping it down. (Pause), in other words whatever it is that deranges me, as they would have put it 70, 80 years ago, whatever that deranging factor is, it's impact was less I guess. So that's interesting, (pause). (Sighs), (pause). [00:14:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's making me think of last year with the teaching, when oftentimes, (pause), the more kind of deranged you'd been before the class, is that how the class went? I'm just curious, sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so it's not—okay so it's a new bill (ph), (pause). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that's true, but I wasn't thinking that so much as, (pause), just striking that there's kind of this negative correlation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I know] (ph) it's negative. Sometimes it's not the case, (pause), (sigh), yeah, I don't know if there's a negative correlation, but (pause), (sigh)—I still don't have great memory of the last couple of weeks of our sessions. [00:15:45]</p>

<p>(Pause), bits and pieces. (Pause), I have a very, (pause), clear sense that we had, (pause), come to some consensus. But the different parts, I don't remember it. (Pause), and I also, I mean I guess my next thought is that, (pause), holding that model in my mind is probably not that important or maybe even counter productive on some level. It's just very kind of abstract, multipart.</p>

<p>(Pause), since we're taping, I could go back and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles). [00:16:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get the transcript. (Pause), anyway, (pause), yeah, so my next thought is that maybe in order to internalize it, I kind of need to cast that monoliths of the model away. (Pause), I tend to really hold very, (pause), energetically to those kinds of things. (Pause), but at any rate, I can't really put, (pause), (sigh), (pause), [00:18:29]</p>

<p>I guess I don't understand when you say that's not how this works, how that could possibly be the case. I mean if we're working something out, as you say, (pause), then the whole point is that at some point you dispense with, (pause), you dispense with this, (pause) analogy to, (pause), other kinds of interactions and then bring them back to a normal social setting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [So I don't bond?] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean in the whole idea of working it out implies that at some point I'm going to be able to deploy this sort of a dynamic on other relationships. [00:19:35]</p>

<p>It doesn't make much sense otherwise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles) All right, so get better in here but everything else is—</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's—I'm not really understanding the [your interaction] (ph) there. What do you mean that's not how this goes? What's not how this goes? (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What it seemed to me you were describing is a model in which you and I come up with a conceptual model—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of then how things work, which you then remember at key moments.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. No, no, I just misspoke. [I'm so used to] (ph)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what I was saying instead is that, (pause), the conditions here, (pause), make it easier to attend to and let's say, sort out what's going on, (pause), and kind of work through it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:20:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that, (pause), means you're not up against the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yep, yep, yep. No, no, no, we're in tune on that. (Sigh), (pause), no I didn't mean the specific whatever theoretical construct that we come up with. I just meant that I couldn't remember, (pause).</p>

<p>I was just talking about the phenomenon itself of having difficulty sort of placing myself chronologically, and in moments of stress, and, (pause), drawing on existing relationships, essentially. (Pause), and this seems like a subset of that. I don't know. I feel disconnected or, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think one thing we were talking about on Wednesday is the way that the break especially between Friday and Wednesday—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:21:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Plays a role in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that was something you suggested and I thought about it. On, (pause), I mean obviously that's the reason why, I assume, why you suggested we meet more frequently or proposed—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The possibility of meeting more frequently and why, (pause), routinely people who use this kind of therapeutic technique want to meet more often, rather than less. Isn't there a sense that meeting less than, less frequently than once a week for example, is pointless, right? Because you do—sorry, it's part of the process, so there is that, but—[00:22:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually you're right about that. I don't tend to see people less often than once a week, but (pause), you're not, (pause), quite right about the other part, which, (pause), I don't want to—I'm not bringing up because I think it's really important that you know this about psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, but because I think it's relevant to what we're talking about, (chuckles), which is yes, in a way, sure. </p>

<p>It helps keep things open and available to meet more frequently. However, this would be an issue. I mean in a way, this would be, this is an issue even when people come five days a week and have some space over the weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have space, I see, I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're sort of forgetting at one level or another. I mean honestly somebody can completely forget something that happened the day before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess that was my point. Essentially this is just a structural feat. It's not as if, what am I trying to say? (Pause), I mean it's a structural feature of this kind of approach, because in the sense that you're trying to model real life, or—that's not the right way of putting it, I agree.</p>

<p>(Laughs), it may affect the way you see that point, but in the sense that you're trying to create a relationship that can be relevant to other relationships. Obviously in the fact that most relationships—[00:24:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are continuous, creates a challenge. Okay? (Laughs), [inaudible at 00:24:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I don't think that this about—</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't like the way that I'm looking at this. (Laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles). Well I think it's actually probably [inaudible at 00:24.52]. I don't mean you're doing anything that's aggressive in sort of a critical way, but I think you're kind of pinning the responsibility for the forgetting on the nature of this process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No I didn't mean to. That was, maybe that was a Freudian slip, as you would say. I didn't intend to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I—what it didn't—I guess what I'm trying to say, and I don't want to be quibbling. I feel like I'm quibbling a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's just a defensive mechanism, but no, I just wanted to say that some of that is structural. It's like anytime you have a five day layoff, anytime you have a two day layoff, anytime you have a one layoff, there's going to be a challenge of sort of recreating the, (chuckles), the gestalt. Or whatever you're creating of what—of where you had arrived in the conversation. [00:26:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To me, (pause), I agree that that's a factor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I had,—somebody gave me some very good advice once, very simple advice. He attributed it to his father. He said, "When you're really feeling upset, sleep on it." And, (chuckles), initially I just sort of, whatever. It was offered in a good spirit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was happy to hear it. What I discovered though is that it's incredibly useful advice. It's really great advice and what I understood about why it was such good advice was that, when I'm very upset there's kind of an endocrine response, there's a state of mind and body that perpetuates itself. </p>

<p>And when you go to sleep, there are processes which are, for the lack of more precise language, kind of clean it out. My state of mind is replenished when I'm sleeping. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:27:25]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's this intervening state, the state of mind that I was in passes. (Pause), so I mean that's—there's an analogous structural phenomenon. I don't know, I'm getting a little tangled up I guess.</p>

<p>(Pause), I'm avoiding something. That's usually what happens when I'm tangled up. Do you think I'm avoiding the discussion of forgetting, (pause)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause), what this sounds—the way you [inaudible at 00:28:16] sounds similar to me is when we were having that discussion a couple of months ago, where you were quite insistent that, let's say your difficulties working, after having been at the end and, (pause), was something being done to you that you weren't—it was not deliberate, if not clearly unconscious action on your part, that was partly in opposition for—out of anger. But was just the result of being, I'd say, blown apart by somebody else's having abandoned you or done something else that was hurtful.</p>

<p>You were saying, "Oh, it's just me being upset and sort of at loose ends over that, not something I'm doing deliberately, in part, to get back at, (pause) someone else for—it's not sort of my countermove to what's being done to me." [00:29:31]</p>

<p>And when you talk about the forgetting this way, in terms of, the structural elements, (pause), of therapy, (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember what you're talking about. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or I—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I think in this case it's because the terms you're using to describe the discussion are either not familiar to me or that we weren't quite in consensus about. (Pause), I remember a discussion, this was not several months ago, maybe three weeks ago, that kind of initiated our latest kind of model. Is that what you're referring to—where my sense was that 00:30:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it would be better for me just to be more direct.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe that would help, (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Always a good approach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause), I think you don't want to take responsibility for the way that forgetting is something you do, (pause), to deliberately, if unconsciously, and for a particular reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh. I don't want to take responsibility, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to own that you're intentionally, a little unconsciously forgetting. You want to pin it on the nature of psychotherapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. I see your claim (ph). (Pause), (sniffs), and what's your proposition for what my motivation is for this deliberate act of forgetting? (Pause), (sniffs), (pause) [00:32:15].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something, (pause), that feels bad about what you don't want to remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. Huh, (pause), okay. I mean I guess that's a funny twist on deliberate, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to use an extreme example, if somebody, (chuckles), if somebody was in a bomb blast, and they couldn't remember anything, and the neurologist said, well, there's nothing really wrong with your, (pause), brain physically, so you must have PTSD. Would you say, and they said no, okay, maybe fine, but I actually just can't remember. </p>

<p>Would the psychiatrist that they sent them to thereafter say, well, you're deliberately forgetting this, and you don't want to take responsibility for it? (Pause), it seems like that's the same mechanism that you're describing here, even—regardless of whether or not—[00:33:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Wednesday, but especially today—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've said no to me—</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laugh), an unusually high percentage of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm open to the possibility that I've just been more incorrect and (chuckles), less in touch with things than I usually am.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles), but yet you've beat (ph) me a little bit, you're challenging me here, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're saying this is not just something that happens. You are doing this, and not only are you doing this, not only are you saying, well you're doing this, you're saying you're deliberately doing it.</p>

<p>(Chuckles), that's a little provocative, so okay, I confess that I'm not being a bit reactionary here. But I'm being reactionary. You're challenging me. This is a challenge. You're saying you're deliberately doing this.</p>

<p>It's one thing to say that you're repressing this or this is something that at some level, you're unconsciously you're engaged in it. It's another thing to say that you're deliberately doing this. You know? Am I reacting to a word in a way that you intend me to react? (Pause). [00:35:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about the sense of my challenging you, where it feels like I'm coming from or what that's like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay and then I had, a thought came to my mind as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, (sigh),—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, Let me put it another way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm, (pause), I am, (pause), disagreeing or I am sort of, of a different opinion, and I am voicing that. I'm not intending, at least that I'm aware of, to clearly be provocative or to get us into kind of a push and pull.</p>

<p>I guess you kind of could say that I'm trying to maybe call you on something that I see you doing, or that seems to me that you're doing. [inaudible at 36:27] wrong, but (pause), I don't know.</p>

<p>Maybe that does sort of equate with simply—I am challenging you in a sense. I guess what I'm puzzling over, I'm not sure about is whether, (pause), you're kind of experiencing or envisioning is sort of a conflictual way that—I—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean if you mean do I conceive your benevolence, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no I've had that—I mean it doesn't—[in the chart] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Otherwise [inaudible at 00:37:11].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah well, two things, I guess they go in different directions and then a third thing. Thing one, (pause), the way that you just presented this seems clearly like a challenge.</p>

<p>I mean you said, you, (pause), had the parallel that you were raising to describe our interaction over the last few minutes was you having the sense that things were done to you, and then realizing or conceding or something that you were actually doing it deliberately, which I don't know, maybe that vaguely describes what we were seeing in our sort of dissection of my response. [00:38:12]</p>

<p>But it's kind of a caricature, (pause). And it's a caricature that seems pitched to emphasize my responsibility and the premise, at least the premise that struck me immediately, whether or not you intended it, was that I'm trying to avoid responsibility, which I don't think that's unreasonable to take that as a bad thing, avoiding responsibility, avoiding agency, avoiding, (pause), owning up to, (pause), decisions or choices or responses, behaviors that in fact, you yourself or I myself am responsible for.</p>

<p>So (pause), and I think that's consistent with the way that you presented this. You're saying you are—it's not so much that you can't remember or that the, (pause), the therapy's responsible for your not remembering or there being some kind of structural weakness in the therapeutic approach, which Wednesday you took overtly as a challenge. [00:39:36]</p>

<p>Although once again, no you said, I can't remember how it was put between us on Wednesday. But it was like, (pause), (sigh), there's this thing that you do, you said, where, (pause), you can't remember the advances or discussions that we've had, and so you, (pause), emphasize the stuckness of the therapeutic interaction. There's this thing that you do, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like me, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I mean this has felt like a kind of repost or a kind of volaty (ph) of that challenge, and there's nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:40:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel like it's illegitimate, but it does feel provocative, and a little bit deliberately provocative, and a little—just as my presentation of our stuckness on Wednesday was a challenge. It feels like you're challenging me.</p>

<p>Now the countervailing observation that I wanted to make was that—as I think about it, when I came in on Wednesday, (pause), I remember having a very clear kind of cognition, (pause), which was that you were dissatisfied or—in other words, even before I sat down, feeling the way that I did, which was very kind of deranged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My sense was that you were feeling very critical. That you were, that you were not benevolent, but upset. Or maybe upset isn't quite the right word, but critical, a little bit threatening. [00:41:47]</p>

<p>And I don't really know what to make, (pause), I noted it I guess after I had left a little bit, but much more strongly just now. And I don't really know what to make of it. It's interesting. It's interesting that I would kind of construct a countervailing state of being for somebody else that just happens to be consonant with how I'm feeling at the time.</p>

<p>(Pause), and then there was a third thing that I'm remembering. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I know what it was. When we started, (pause), [can't remember quite where] (ph), when we started kind of—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Having some back and forth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having some back and forth—I felt a lot better. And I said initially that I kind of preserved my equanimity but—or maybe the opposite, when I kind of preserved my analytical space, but I didn't really feel as much equanimity as I normally do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:42:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the moment when we kind of started butting heads, I felt my sense of well being return, so that might be relevant, (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles), maybe. I suspect so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was kind of how I wrote my dissertation in graduate school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was very oppositional, (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you have a thought as to its relevance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sighs), well, I guess my global theory about a lot of this is that there's this whatever the etiology and whatever the various other, (pause), other dependent variables might be, so significant part of it can be described as a kind of, (pause), it's like my sense of myself fades out, (pause), in, (pause), in reaction to or interaction with the feelings of stress of certain kinds, in particular kinds of stressors. [00:44:15]</p>

<p>And I guess when I'm kind of interacting this way, volleying or however you want to put it, it's easier for me to kind of construct myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not construct myself, but at least touch it and sense its contours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, get a hold of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get a hold of myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can we stop for now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay, all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

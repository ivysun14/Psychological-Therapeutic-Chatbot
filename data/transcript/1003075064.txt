<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what have you been doing this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing?  What does nothing mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't know, sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sleeping through the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trying to?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You've had summer school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because of summer school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How did that go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It went okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you earn some credits?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I needed some, but I didn't get them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, but that's why you went, to get the extra credits?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then what's going to happen as far as when you get back to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Repeating last year or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, he just needed, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] English and so they made him, uh, pick that up, but he wasn't able to complete the assignments, so, I'm not sure where he stands with the credit or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If he still passed —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, he still passed, right, he can be in [DEIDENTIFIED] next year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  Otherwise doing okay [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was going to ask you do you think I can, like not take my medicine for a while, like, try to see how it works?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think it's a good idea, you know last time you tried —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I've been doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but remember last time when we tried that, just everything gets better from it, you remember that, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I want to try it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you want to we can, but it was a mess last time, and I'm trying to remember didn't [PATIENT NAME] end up in the hospital too?  Right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you know you don't want to get sent back in the hospital and now, you know, later, that may be the right time, but this is way too early even from that last time.  They say once you've tried it, then you should stick with it for at least five years, so, I think it's been what, two years now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A couple of years, so even if you said another year or two years, that would be the right time to do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Can we, maybe decrease some of his meds, you know, just kind of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We could, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if things kind of start going the wrong way then it's just not worth it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happens is once that process, you know, the, in the brain, the bipolar process, that kind of gets going.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It actually, not only does it create problems, then it actually sets you back a long time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you can try a little bit less, if it does okay, that's fine.  But, um —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He'll just stick with, with the regular one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Try a little bit less if you want, see how you do, that's okay, that's okay.  You sleeping okay [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do not see any problems right now then, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.  He has occasional, you know, like at school where he gets defiant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But other than that he does pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it looks like the last time I saw [PATIENT NAME] was last October, so has [PATIENT NAME] stayed on his meds?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Pretty much so, you know we spend a lot of time with him, he, you know, doesn't take them, but, um, he, at night had called in and gotten some new pills, but he's been doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So taking the —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The Concerta, I think he needs the Concerta for sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Depicor?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He, he most of the time he refuses to take that, because it he says it makes him drowsy and he feels funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Seroquel?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, he takes that pretty good; he takes everything but the Depicor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Remeron too?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well he could try and cut that Remeron down to half and then see if he can get rid of it, so that would be at least one less —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if we end up staying just on the Concerta and Seroquel that's fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  I always find the Depicor under his bed or under his pillow, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> In his drawers, he.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right [PATIENT NAME].</p>

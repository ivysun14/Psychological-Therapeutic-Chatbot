<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is actually a recording.  I'll just keep it there.  Go ahead and uh, tell me what's uh, going on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, well the um, uh, a good period um, seemed to come to a close.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm in too much of a hurry, I, I really I was um, um.  I was really optimistic that maybe the, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Changes that I was feeling were attributable to the medication.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That okay, the doctor, the doctor's onto something here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then, uh, all a sudden, it, it went away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In the course of about, uh, four to six weeks, it uh, took a swung backwards and um.   And then somewhere in that four to six week period had hit rock bottom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, and I thought that there'd be maybe a re, a rebound after that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And nothing did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I was, uh, extremely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, distraught over the whole thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Cause honestly, I thought you had the ah, the medication issue -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nailed.  So -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Because uh, you know, it uh, worked, uh, uh, uh, quite well, uh, for uh, several months, you know, it started uh, seeing some uh, physical and emotional improvements.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I thought so, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, that, that's why um, why when it came it was um, um, I was so distraught with the whole -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, promise of  -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Going back to square one again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, then I realized, well maybe it's not square one.  Maybe there just needs to be a tweaking of a, a medication here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, but, uh, it really has depressed the day lights out of me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And on top of it, um, as you can tell, my back is finally you get to see me what I'm like -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I'm really, really in pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  When uh, when did you really start uh, seeing uh the deterioration uh, uh, of uh, the back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, well, it's a -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not exactly coinciding with it, but pretty close -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To the time that uh, um, that my back began really, really bothering me a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, was when, uh, the physical pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  And ah, when was the last time uh, you know, and x-ray or an MRI, or uh something like that was done?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, last summer I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  When was the last time you had a complete blood work to see whether to, yknow, there are any other things, uh, uh that are uh affecting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, that's, probably would say six months maybe.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And uh, maybe, you know something that uh, we can do, is uh, some blood work, some organic work up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, and uh, uh, you are at an age where uh, you know, we have uh, keep track of uh, the prostate.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As uh, in uh, acting out also, sometimes, uh, you know, the uh, it's rather innocuous, the rate in presents and uh, then uh, you know, it will have uh, significant, uh, uh, in, uh, uh arthritis of the big bones, uh, especially this found and all that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, let's see what we can do.  Given all that, uh, uh, you know, you said you are a little more depressed then usual.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And uh, how would you uh, sort of symptom, uh, wise, how would you, uh, express that, uh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like interest in life, interest in doing things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, uh, this, the one thing I notice was uh, I really got to the point where, um, uh, I began thinking about um, uh, my devastating alternatives.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, the suicidal um, component -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> which is always there, but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seems like it's been pushed to the background -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With the medication.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thankfully.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, now with the depression coming back, um, now having trouble -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm now having trouble keeping it in check.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  You have difficulty sleeping uh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ye, yes I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am, for a while I wasn't getting sleeping difficulties -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B>  Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, um, now I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And uh, is that, uh, going to sleep or staying asleep, or uh, uh, you know, waking up too soon, or waking up too many times?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I would say that it is going to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then staying, excuse me, then staying asleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  And uh, how bout, uh, like uh, you know, now, going to family gatherings, or uh, church, and uh, other activities, uh, you, uh, seem to have some interest uh, in that, or uh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most assuredly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I enjoy -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seeing my family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and uh, uh recently had any uh, family gathering after the [DATE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, yes, as a matter of fact we did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, um, we had a uh, a family reunion, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The week of [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Out in [DEIDENTIFIER] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that right, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was amazing that uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everyone was able to coordinate their schedules -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that we could all be together.  My mother's wish for her [AGE] birthday was that we would all come together -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And have a family gathering in the [DEIDENTIFIER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we were able to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is remarkable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, was it uh, one of the places that you used to go to in uh, your -.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Younger years?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I think um, I think my mother has got so many pictures -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of us down  in the [DEIDENTIFIED] that, uh, she can almost track our growth -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And maturity as children into adults -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Through the photographs -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Down in the [DEIDENTIFIER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that sounds real good.  And uh, have uh, you know, at least uh, there are, uh, some uh, bright spots.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah, in the, uh, you know, entire scenario that uh, uh, but I guess with the, given uh, your physical condition, uh, that uh, sometimes uh, you know, uh, you have ah, to sort of suffer the pain and bear the consequences and all that.  Um, now um, um, uh, have you been uh, eating good, uh, uh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lost or, uh, gained any weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I've lost a, lost a little bit of weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Do you know approximately how much weigh right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I weigh about, uh, 189 pounds, I think.
DR; Uh-huh.  Okay, okay, uh, you know, an uh, ah, a little bit more then uh, what we want you to carry, but uh, uh, you know, uh, in uh, when it comes to pain, that also adds some, uh, a little bit.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And um, uh, any other things going on, like uh, any hallucinations or vivid dreams, nightmares, uh, uh, recollection of events, uh, you know, uh, unpleasant events in life?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't say that there is anything, uh, that's extraordinary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I guess the most, uh, the most significant thing is the, the recurrent um, suicidal idea on me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, that's just when it started to hurt.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I, all I kept thinking was, I just can not go through this again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just can't do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think, uh, what we need is a, a primary care and an orthopedic surgeon uh, take a look at it, and uh, see what uh, uh, you know, uh, needs to be, uh, done here, uh, to get uh, you know the pain under control.  Uh, and uh..</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> See what uh, you know, what can be done.  Um, uh, any other things uh, that uh, you can't tell, uh, uh, as far as the medications are concerned?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, [INAUDIBLE] And uh, any side effects from the medications?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, yeah, I, I think the uh, what is it called G, Geodon?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Geodon, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Geodon, um, Geodon makes me um, very lethargic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that right?  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, and um, with the lethargic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, Okay.  Well, uh, you know the, of course some of this medications can do that, and uh, um, uh, other than uh, lethargy, did you, uh, like anxiety wise, uh, do you see any improvement uh because the Geodon has a significant impact on uh, anxiety?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, well darn.  Um.  That just um, I went just the opposite way, where there should've been improvement -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Given the fact that that medication's tailored to that -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had some, a couple of episodes since the anxiety attacks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, and I did not know that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and uh, that is uh, also called an activation factors, that uh, Geodon also has, you know, the, uh, some people who have uh, uh, some anxiety, it can uh, sort of unmask that, and uh, bring it to the surface.  Uh, so it's called activation effect.  So maybe there's uh, something that uh, uh, you know, you experienced is uh, you don't need, need to take the Geodon anymore.  Because, uh, um, uh since we have given almost a month's trial, uh, so.  Uh, and uh, as far as the other medications have concerned, have you seen anything out of the ordinary?  Okay</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B>  All right and uh, ah, you take uh, uh, Cymbalta, and?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I take uh, uh, Symbyax.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh - and um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there Seroquel? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seroquel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, and um, uh, any other things you can tell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, just um, just this, just this, disgusted with the uh, uh, two steps forward -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Three steps back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And um, I keep waiting for that breakthrough, where -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, you realize that, um, in the end -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That person's gonna help you the most is you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, I'm waiting for the breakthrough where, that happens, where I am helping out for myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, and that has not happened.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, uh, let's uh, um, you know, uh, get some blood work done.  Okay?  See where there's uh, there are any uh, uh, things uh, that we can uh, look at it, uh, uh, from the medical point of view other than, you know, the MRI, and uh, the, x-ray of your back.  Uh, cause they, you know, there are uh, any uh, underlying conditions uh, that may also add, uh, uh, into your uh, current situation.  Uh, let's uh, see what we can come up.  Okay?  Okay.  And uh, uh, if uh, ha, looking at all these things, the, how do you see yourself uh, uh six months from now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, Well, I'm going to try to remain optimistic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, but, realizing that uh, there's difficulty in remaining optimistic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When you continually get uh, continually get pounded.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, emotionally, and that uh, I find myself wondering when in the world is this going to get better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, it's very discouraging.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, looks like, uh, you know, just like uh, you know, ups and downs in life, uh, you know, this is something that uh, uh, you know you have to uh, seeing uh, you know, there are, uh, uh, at least uh, you know, in the last uh, well, four, five months you had uh, pretty good, uh, uh, uh, time, as far as, uh, depression is concerned, as far as uh, uh, yknow, your ability to, uh, looking at it in optimistic, uh, uh, in uh, really, but uh, better things will come, come.  Uh, so I guess we have to see how good we can, uh, yknow, uh, maybe uh, look at things with a little bit of uh, medical it -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thing.  Okay, so, so let's se what we can do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm going to turn the recorder off.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I got my car. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ended up missing 45 minutes of an hour-long soccer practice on Friday doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I actually came out looking pretty good, because you put down $500 to reserve the car, and I was able to finance that so I get that back. They just put it on your credit card—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —- get my $500 back. And I had switched from the 2012 to the 2013 which was like $300-and-change more. I'm in the business office and the guy is going through the numbers, and the numbers sound familiar. All of the sudden, instead of having $500 left over, I've got $800-and-something left over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>[00:00:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They basically forgot to charge me the 2013 price.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they haven't picked this up yet, so they're mailing me a check for $300-and-something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it went well. It drives nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. How's the radio?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can just put it on Bluetooth and it will play my phone, so I don't even have to plug my phone in or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. There's probably no jack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The actual using the phone on Bluetooth is pretty cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm. Like you can talk through your speakers or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. There's a microphone, and then the voice comes out of the speakers. But it won't let you scroll through your contacts while you're driving. There's certain functions that get shut off while you're driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Can Siri do that for you? No?</p>

<p>[00:01:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, I can do it through the phone. So if I called someone on the phone, it would go through the Bluetooth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You just can't do it through the car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Like there are—- you can scroll through songs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, like contacts, so trying to call people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, no, I got that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The songs you have to scroll through on your phone. It doesn't—- it basically plays where you left off or wherever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like if Pandora was on—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I kind of—- is like how would you scroll through contacts in the car? Like—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh you just go—- there's a thing on the phone that says "call history," something else, and then "phone book."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And while you're driving, the phone book part is not lit up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's disabled, okay. Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I found out about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which then you could just do Siri.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or actually go through your phone book and—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[00:03:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had a pretty nasty cough this weekend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really got kind of sick on Friday. I think it was tempered by getting the new car. But I lost my voice Saturday morning, and I've just been coughing all weekend. Yesterday I decided not to go to practice. I figured I'd just be hacking up the whole time. So I missed hat league for three weeks now. I did my workout on Sunday, and I am sore. I hadn't done it in a week or so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That will kick your ass.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did my normal amount, but my quads have been really sore. My upper body has been fine. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:04:01]</p>

<p>So I had a kind of crazy Monday, and I was actually impressed with how well I handled adversity. I get to the—- I have a seller rep, and when I got the seller to sign the deed and power of attorney and all this stuff so they don't have to show up to the closing, he was supposed to give me some documents and he did not. And so there was this big scramble to get those documents, you know, to the law office so they could go on record for the sale. </p>

<p>And then on the purchase, there was kind of panicking. I made a mistake because the broker was like "Is it okay if I contact the attorney to push him along?" because I hadn't gotten back what I was, you know, we were getting a signed extension.</p>

<p>[00:05:00]</p>

<p>And I was like "Okay." Usually I talk to their secretary or whatever, you know. I mean, brokers call me all the time and e-mail me all the time, and this guy got really pissed off. Even though he'd already e-mailed me what I wanted, he told the broker, he was like "Have him call me." </p>

<p>So he calls me and he's like "Oh, we've had a good relationship. We've been doing fine" but just went off on the broker for like 15 minutes. Luckily I'm in the car on the Bluetooth and it's not like I actually could be doing something else. So that was kind of weird. I had to get—- this closing, you know, had gone from being one title to another. So all my bona fides, everything that would allow me to do a closing—- wire instructions, errors and omissions, the closing protection letter, all these different documents that get you approved—- this one lender wants them all to match up.</p>

<p>[00:06:12]</p>

<p>And I don't have—- or, I didn't have a bank account in my new firm name and they wouldn't wire it to the old one, even though I had been approved with this lender as the old one. But my E&O had expired, and of course my new E&O says the new firm name on it. So I had to scramble to open up a new (inaudible at 00:06:36) account with the new one, which they needed basically a d/b/a certificate, so I had to run to city hall and get a d/b/a certificate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was kind of a lot of running around and at the same time be productive and get stuff. There was actual work, you know, there was like a closing I hadn't even opened up since September. It's been a month I've had this file, and I haven't done anything on it. So I opened that up and did the title and it actually turned out to be a very productive day.</p>

<p>[00:07:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Without a lot of anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't really get stressed about anything there. So even though I still haven't done some of the work I sort of need to do—- I don't know why—- I'm, you know, pretty mellow. I don't know if it's being sick because right now I feel, you know, all stopped up and don't feel 100 percent. Like if I wanted to do my workout right now, I wouldn't feel like it and probably puke. (pause) Ian slept over.</p>

<p>[00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm. How was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was good. I asked him about the time he asked me about if I was ever going to move back in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And asked him how he felt about my answer, and he said something like some—- I don't remember exactly what he said, but something that suggested it didn't faze him. It really didn't, you know, sink in or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he saw America's Funniest Home Videos for the first time, and the kid could not stop laughing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: We found his new favorite TV show.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I'm glad that I found a TV show that's like appropriate for a six-year-old, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dogs doing funny things—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —- and people falling down, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[00:09:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he fell asleep in the middle of that, so I didn't get to brush his teeth. We woke up in the morning and I didn't have any breakfast for him. I was hoping there would be no confrontation with Jess on that. Though Jess did—- and I called her up to tell her I was going to be late for soccer, and she starts lecturing me like "You should've sent an e-mail out to everyone." It's like I basically got the call at like 3:30 that the car was ready. Soccer is at 5:00, and I'm like "Ian, get your clothes on. We're going."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he was with you when you got the car?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he loved it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He must've been psyched.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was just blown away how they get the cars inside the building.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that was amazing to him. He really enjoyed it. But it took a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[00:10:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They told me it would take an hour and that they'd expedite it, but it took well over an hour. Because it's like Friday afternoon and people are—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I got the impression they had a very busy day and were scrambling to get my car done. (pause) They got it registered. They inspected it while I was there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They gave me a voucher for a free tank of gas at the gas station around the corner. You know, that little gas station at the rotary there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They, you know, that's where they fill up and they just give you a little piece of paper. My free $55 auto oil change I get for free.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though they say if you bring in a coupon, they'll match coupons so I've to start collecting. It's going to be every 5,000 miles, so even if I pay $55 compared to $20 or $30, you know—- I know they're not going to leave the cap off or anything like that. </p>

<p>[00:11:19]</p>

<p>They give you a free five-year 100,000 mile extended warranty, but you've got to come in and do your maintenance with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's a solid car. It doesn't need a lot of maintenance, so it's not a big deal. It's all oil changes, you know, and stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it's nearby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's what's really nice. So I could either—- they have a shuttle, so they could like drop me off at home, but I'd probably just ride my bike. I need to get a bike rack for this. But it's a nice car, it drives nice. I'm having a little trouble parallel parking with it because the sidelines are different. But a major upgrade in my life. Now I've got to deal with the payments, you know, which is a major downgrade in my life.</p>

<p>[00:12:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but you're a little busier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just if I can keep this level of business, I will be okay, you know. But I have a feeling it's going to slow down a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. With the season?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, I mean, I'm busy through November, the end of November.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not busy, but I've got work through the end of November.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) The question I have is that I have this one-time approval from the bank, and I got the e-mail address contact information for the manager of the closing department for them. And I've been contemplating sending her an e-mail saying how I've been trying to get on the list.</p>

<p>[00:13:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of me says I'll never do it. Part of me says you've got to do it, you know. And kind of cc and bring in the people who are helping me to, you know, get on this list. But—- (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: The way they do it is they just give people a list of attorneys' names and you pick the attorney.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm. They say "Here are the 20 people we work with."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you just pick one—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- based on whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I don't know if they have anyone in the Center. But if people work in the Center, which a lot of them do, they would choose someone in the Center, you know. I think the one closing I do have, she works in the Center.</p>

<p>[00:14:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So it would make a lot of sense if you could get on the list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know who they have on the list.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I guess one of the questions was what makes it hard to write the e-mail?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, part of it is struggling what to write in the e-mail, you know. (pause) I've got to find my business cards for the names of those people that I dealt with before. In fact, there's a meeting at some point. I've got to put that on my schedule. Advisory meeting. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:15:21]</p>

<p>But if I could cc those people on the e-mail and then maybe they would take the proactive step of calling and saying they would put you on the list, that would—- (pause) So—- (pause) </p>

<p>One of the things—- I went into the office on Sunday but instead of doing the work, I just grabbed the piece of paper I needed and left. And then, of course, I know I'll do it Monday and realizing that I had no time to do it Monday. One of the things I had to do is an estate plan, and they're leaving town on Sunday, so I've got to do it today.</p>

<p>[00:16:17]</p>

<p>So it's like, you know, certain things that aren't due until I absolutely have to do them, so that's what I'll do this morning. (pause) I've got my big audit tomorrow, my title insurance company. I haven't done anything for it yet. I've got to reconcile my accounts, which is the big thing. The question I have is when you reconcile your accounts, it gives you the current balance, and I don't know if I can do the current—- because you're supposed to reconcile within 60 days, and I clearly haven't done that for June or July.</p>

<p>[00:17:19]</p>

<p>But I'm wondering if I could have them dated within 60 days, but giving the balance as of that date instead of the current balance. Because if not, I'm going to have to go back and delete everything and enter it, you know, which luckily I was not that busy that I—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —- could go through and do that. (chuckles) It's only a few months and a half a dozen closings. (pause) But the question is, do I have to go into the office tonight to do it, because I don't know how much I'm going to need my printer. I don't know what's wrong with my printer, whether I need a new drum. I've got to read the—- </p>

<p>[00:18:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the printer at home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the printer at home. If I could fix that, that would really improve my life a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it like a regular printer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's actually a fax machine that doubles as a copy machine and a printer, so it can do small batch copying. But after I get to like the fourth or fifth sheet that I print, it starts just having these black marks go across the page which may be the drum. The drum is what the toner cartridge fits into, so I don't know if that's what I need to change. It usually gives you some sort of warning, but—- I keep meaning to check the book at the office, but I probably can get the book online. </p>

<p>[00:19:16]</p>

<p>The owner's manual, which probably tells you if it's smearing like this, you need to get a new drum. Now that I actually have a little bit of cash, I've got to close—- this closing that was supposed to happen today, which isn't happening today, probably will end up happening on Friday, I should make decent money on. A $600,000 purchase. Or as a buddy of mine liked to use to call it White-bury. Is that racist? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it racist if it's true? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can be. But I don't know if that's racist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's offensive (inaudible at 00:20:09).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't say that to people. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:20:23]</p>

<p>I'm almost off the Trilafon. I'm taking that every other night, just a quarter of a pill, so I'll be done with that. (pause) I've been taking a cough suppressant. I still have these coughing fits. They were pretty bad this weekend. (pause) You're pensive.</p>

<p>[00:21:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm pensive. I'm thinking about you and work and what makes it hard to do something like e-mailing the bank...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- people. Or getting the printer fixed, although you talked about that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it makes you feel more alone to work. </p>

<p>[00:22:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you have the idea that if you don't work, you'll be taken care of. Which isn't necessarily true, but it may feel that way. Like kind of hoping for somebody to sort of step in or do some of it, or you want that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I don't know. (pause) I'm kind of just, you know, like today I've got to pick up Ian at 2:30 and go swimming. So it's like I have these things scheduled, and I put it in my mind that I can't get other things done because I've got that, you know. I know it's kind of a weird justification, but—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your thoughts—- go ahead.</p>

<p>[00:23:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like oh, I'll do everything tomorrow, Wednesday, which is wide open for me, and then I end up not doing everything, you know. I still have like five files to open. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your thoughts are "Okay, wait, I've got to pick up Ian at 2:30 and go swimming, so today is out."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That just sort of blankets the day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though I've got all morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like "Tomorrow is wide open. I can just get X, Y and Z done tomorrow. It's wide open."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Which doesn't get it done], it just—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know I won't get it done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then at some point I'll be like watching cable news.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[00:24:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) [I'm a little warm.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I had to borrow money from Jess. I had 18 cents in one bank account and $2.00 in the business account. I had to buy dinner for Ian, so I'm like "Can I borrow 40 bucks?" She gave me $100. I wrote her a check, but I wish I didn't have to do things like that.</p>

<p>[00:25:25]</p>

<p>In one respect, I don't want her to think that I have money, you know. But I don't want her to think I'm just not working, you know. I think she has this perception that I don't try or I'm not working as hard as I could be working. I don't know. </p>

<p>Then I started thinking about why I haven't been getting any business from Claire, and I'm wondering if Jess intervened. I mean, Jess has said to me, it's like "Why don't you follow up?" But I've just got this conspiracy theory in the back of my mind that somehow Jess intervened and said, you know, "I think Cameron likes you. Maybe you should not do business with him."</p>

<p>[00:26:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you ask Jess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. We barely talk, you know. That's why she, you know, gave me the boot. If I had ever talked to her in the beginning, you know, expressed my emotions. I've asked her many times. I'm like "What's up with Claire? Have you talked to Claire?" I need to—- it's just a conspiracy theory in my mind. I don't think it's really the reality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The idea is—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just kind of—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- that Jess had told Claire not to send you business. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe because you like her, liked her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or something to that effect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or something to that effect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just can't figure it out, you know. There's some reason. I can't believe that Claire hasn't had a buyer rep in two years, you know, a year and a half.</p>

<p>[00:27:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially as busy as it has been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) When I ran into her, she was like "Oh, we should get together" and I probably should send her an e-mail and maybe get together. Maybe to convince her that I'm competent. You know, I think maybe she's concerned that I'm not competent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) </p>

<p>[00:28:40]</p>

<p>I didn't watch the first debate, but I really kind of want to watch tonight's debate. But I don't know if I'm going to be stuck doing my banking, my reconciling and getting everything ready for tomorrow. My files are ready. The only thing is the reconciliations are [what I really need to do]. (pause) I've got to get up early to get into the office and look fresh. A lot of what they do is just, do things look right, does it look like I have a system, does it look like—- (pause) </p>

<p>[00:29:33]</p>

<p>The auditor—- I mean maybe she's picked up some things in the last few years over how the job works. But for the most part, she's just an auditor. She's not an attorney.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she even told me, she's like "Yeah, if you wanted to trick me, you could." Okay. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:30:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess—- I mean, you're talking about managing people's perceptions and tricking—- whether it was the auditor or managing Jess's perception of how much you make, or wondering about Claire's perception of you, or fooling yourself. Like telling yourself "Oh, I've got all day tomorrow," knowing full well that that's only a way to allow yourself not to do it today. And, you know, then I wonder like (chuckles) is Cameron fooling me at the moment? (chuckles) What 12 ways am I missing the boat? (chuckles) What's going on? (pause)</p>

<p>[00:32:04]</p>

<p>And—- (pause) There is some aspect of this where it kind of looks like you're not doing anything, but you're actually doing stuff. In other words, you're fooling this one, you're getting this—- I don't know. (pause) I guess I'm sort of hunting around still for like what makes it hard to work, or how do we understand why it's so tough to get yourself to get to stuff. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:33:05]</p>

<p>And—- (pause) Yeah, I guess, certainly part of it is the part that you're speaking to now, is like the way you fool other people and really fool yourself. Like almost kind of (inaudible at 00:33:28) basically a lot of the time. Not mean-spiritedly, that's not what I mean. But like "Well, I should do this, but I know I never will. And I'll have time to do that tomorrow, which I won't use to do that tomorrow." Or stuff like that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:34:07]</p>

<p>I mean, because I guess I—- I mean, clearly it causes trouble for you and it also feels pretty crummy, I think. I don't think you kind of want to be doing that, though in another way you do because you are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, it's like there's some kind of lack of something there. (pause) Some sense of rigor or discipline or just motivation is, I think, something else. (pause)</p>

<p>00:35:04</p>

<p>CLIENT: Boredom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There doesn't seem to be a lack of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There doesn't seem to be a lack of that. You mean, you are bored?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, in that the stuff I have to do is boring, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, you know, I have to write a letter and it's like—- and this is the thing that gets me. It's like the letter may take a little bit of time, but filling out this complaint, you know, should take me 10 minutes. Really no longer. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:36:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another thing I had the impression of is that if anybody else picks up the ball a little bit on any of these things, it's kind of like the kiss of death, you know. Like as soon as somebody else starts to get on you about it or starts to do some of the work for you, it's like then there's no chance. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you don't know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like as soon as Jess starts to tell you that you need to be doing something better, there's no way. Like whatever chance there was that you were—- because you probably agree. I mean, it's always something to do with—- let's say with 30 percent of the things that Jess says you should be doing better (chuckles) you agree that she's right, 70 percent you don't. But as soon as she opens her mouth about the 30 percent that you agree with, then there's like a negative chance. Like maybe there was a small chance before she opened her mouth. She opens her mouth, no way. </p>

<p>[00:37:02]</p>

<p>Or somebody else starts to give you ideas about how you should do something, or like picks up the ball a little bit on like some of the motivation, I think that kills whatever motivation you would've had. I don't know quite how that fits in, but it's something else that became part of this]. (pause) </p>

<p>I think I probably fall into that with you fairly often, where I say "Oh, what about this? How about that?" And like, you know, I think you want to be helped by the things I'm saying, and I want to help you with the things I'm saying. But when there are suggestions about stuff you're having trouble getting motivated—- like if I said "Oh, well, you know, why don't you bring the printer to Staples?" or like maybe—- [like if you started something on your own, that may be different]—- but like "The way to fix the printer is this, and you can look at that, and you can bring it here, and you can do this," I think that would sack some of your motivation to do it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>[00:38:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't like being told what to do. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No, the image I have is more like football. If somebody else takes the ball, you will not run. If fixing the printer is the ball, like if I'm quiet and I don't say anything and I'm not running, then you will move. If I like take the ball and start making suggestions and have ideas and all sorts of theories and stuff and start running down the field with it, you will stay put. "He's got the ball. I don't have to do anything." I think it's sort of like that. Not consciously, but—- </p>

<p>[00:39:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But who has the ball with my printer?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I haven't really said anything about—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think you're trying to be cool with the sports reference, but—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) No, I'm not. I'm completely hopeless when I make up these sports references.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I've noticed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) I'm sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Because it doesn't make any sense to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not like there are—- I mean, looking at work-related things, it's not like there are other people who are doing things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure there are. There's your father who has told you that you should be doing more of this. It was a while ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's Jess who says you've got to do this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think with work, it's mostly—- I think you're right. You're more on your own with work. I agree. I think you're right.</p>

<p>[00:40:03]</p>

<p>I mean, here's an example with work. If we're talking about writing this e-mail to the person at the bank—- although it's ironic to me that like—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: You're thinking of my title insurance company.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that's why I'm getting confused. It's funny to me, I'm thinking like a communist—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like this neighborhood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, when it's a bank which is (inaudible at 00:40:28). Anyway, with writing that e-mail, like I say "Okay, Cameron, let's make a plan. Let's put it on the calendar. Let's find a time that you're going to do it. Why don't you start thinking about what you want to say in the e-mail while you're here so it's actually less work when you're out there? Let's schedule it. Let's schedule time to look for those names that you want to cc on the e-mail.</p>

<p>[00:41:04]</p>

<p>Let's think how much bang you'd get for your buck. The e-mail is going to take 45 minutes to write and send, and you know, it could result in X thousand dollars a month if you get on the list. Like let's look at all the ways we can make this easier." I imagine that if we were to do that, it would make you less likely—- all that stuff—- it would make you less likely to write the e-mail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmmm. Especially if you told me that it would take 45 minutes to write the e-mail. (pause) So why is that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I've already got a mental block on my own about writing the e-mail, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [What do you think makes more work]? Writing e-mails is work, and if it turns out, then you have even more work. Which I know you also want, I'm not an idiot. Or at least not because of that.</p>

<p>[00:42:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's like scanning files. People keep telling me I should be scanning my files, you know, going all electronic. I resisted it because it's just—- maybe because of what you're saying. But for me, the justification is that I've been doing something a way for so long that I don't want to change. I don't want to have to buy a scanner. I don't want to have to deal with shredding. (pause) Just—- I don't know. It's such a paper-intensive business that I'm in that I feel like it should be in paper, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>[00:43:15]</p>

<p>Stubbornness. My brother has stubbornness. "the sky is blue." "No it's not. It's black." (pause) So maybe I have some of that too. I don't know. My parents don't seem very stubborn. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It could be generational. You know, skip a generation. (pause) Well if for some reason on—- I don't see why, but I've got the closing on Friday and I have to (inaudible at 00:44:03). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [But I think I'll be able to get it scheduled] so I won't have to cancel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I look forward to seeing you then.</p>

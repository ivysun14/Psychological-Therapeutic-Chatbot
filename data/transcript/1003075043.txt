<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, um, I was reviewing your record, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] writes that he made a diagnosis of major depression in 2003.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he made that in 2003, that was —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I was looking at the record that uh, one of the diagnosis —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it was in 2001 that I came to see him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but he wrote a formal note in 2003.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I tried to read his handwriting, I told him about this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Otherwise it was a printed letter, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Read it, and then I um, added a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder in March of 2005 —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I did it [INAUDIBLE] for at that time.  Uh, based on your accounting of some disorganization and thinking and not catching up, we added Ritalin in March of 2009, thinking that there might be an element of ADD as well.  And then we started, switched back, uh, it didn't work, so we tried Vyvanse, and we started the Vyvanse um, not January, uh, Ritalin in March, April, that's when we started the Vyvanse.  Initially it was 30 mg and as of our last visit, which was about 6 weeks ago you are currently on 50 mg in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me, um, you are on a whole bunch of medicine, and let me go through that, I was looking at it, and I said my gosh, Wellbutrin is an antidepressant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And in some cases of depression, Wellbutrin has been used for treatment of ADD as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because sometimes, most of the treatment that we offer in ADD are cycle stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, and stuff.  Potentially they can be addictive, so if I have somebody who has some kind of drug addiction, and that does not apply to you, but if I have somebody, and I need to treat that person with, for ADD, I said, I'm [INAUDIBLE] I cannot give Ritalin now or Adderall or something because that risk for abuse is there.  In that case, um, the second line of treatment is Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I had no idea, because I've been on that for —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That might have —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Many years, the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That might have given you some protection for the disorganization that we talked about.  And hard line of treatment is the Prozac group.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that was something I was on back in the 90s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you are still now on Celexa.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's in the Prozac group, we call it SSRI.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, both of them are antidepressants, so my question now is, why do we need two antidepressants?  What's your, justify, why should we continue forth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well we, we went off the, you had switched me to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pristiq?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Luvox.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum, because of the OCD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because of the [INAUDIBLE] you had, it was too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, well was it the, well before that though I was on Lexapro —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then you took me off the Lexapro and we went to Luvox, and Luvox is very expensive, even with my health insurance —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so recently with the economy, and then also adding the Vyvanse —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You, you've switched me over to the Celexa.  Now, whether or not that's helping me with my OCD or not, I don't, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  But in terms of last visit you mentioned that you are more organized in your thinking and getting the stuff done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where are you on that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well I mean, I, I, I, you know, I have lots of room for improvement, lots.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let's just say that we just got home from a holiday, and that was on Thursday and I still haven't even touched two suitcases.  So, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that because you are tired, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.  Um, oh, I, because I look at it and I think oh, my gosh this is going to, you know, just be forever, this is just so, it's overwhelming and it gives me anxiety, and I, so I start to stress out about it before I ever even get started.  And, but it, it used to be a lot worse.  Um, I'm like everybody else, I need so many more hours in the day and the, you know, to be able to have the energy to stay up and do it, and you know, I have so, with two kids and all their stuff that they have all the time.  They are always drawing, they're always making something and so, I'm really bad in that, sometimes I kind of feel like I'm a, a hoarder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, people are like, you know, your house is clean and everything, and it's like, okay, well don't open up any closets, don't open up any drawers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  And so, and don't go in the laundry room and um, so, and the basement isn't so great either, so, but anyways, so that's my, but now you know, of course there are so many days that you know, I'm like I, I feel so much better you know, I, I just don't want to take any of this medicine anymore.  So, if we want to do that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, how are you doing with your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it, it, it changes.  It alters.  I've been going to bed earlier, I've been making a effort —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To not stay up until 1:00 in the morning —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, in that sense it's been better, it's better for me to be on some type of a —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Routine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Routine, now that the kids aren't in school, I don't have to set the alarm and I'm enjoying that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And taking that as a luxury.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I usually go to the hospital at about 7:30, 8:00, and these kids that go out, 9:00, 9:30, I say what's wrong with you, I say this is summer —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't have to take my son to the school, so I can get up whenever I want to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I, so I am, you know, I'm being selfish and I'm taking, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why selfish?  Why do you think that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well because my husband doesn't get to.  My husband doesn't get to, you know,  we came back from a holiday and on Sunday, on Father's Day, we were at the swimming pool, because that's what he wanted to do for Father's Day, and he, he said "You know, I'm just in some funk."  And I said "It's because you have to go back to work, it's because you've just been, you know, off of work, you know, not driving a car, not fixing any meals, not cleaning anything up, you know, not worrying about any animals, not doing anything, except, you know, get up, eat, lay by the pool, go to the beach, and read."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, something good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, and so we did that for seven days, and you know, he, he, you know and I said that's what it is, I said it's that, you know, and, and he does this every time, you know, he'll say well, if I could figure out a way to never have to go to work again —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it's like, yeah, I do I say that selfishly because I don't work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If husband [INAUDIBLE], can you let me know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you husband finds that out —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you let me know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, we're going to market it, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So structure works for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, but I have a very hard time doing it, because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I will start on one thing, and then I'll go over here to go get something that I need to, to do with this thing, and then I get side tracked, and I never get back over there to it.  Out of sight, out of mind, I do that with everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, do I give you anything called sleep hygiene?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let me give you a piece of paper, it's kind of, and a lot of people believe that sleep is my right.  It is not.  It's a privilege, and one thing we call, it's called condition reflex.  Like say you are in a room, on a meeting or something, and you don't have no clock or anything.  And you know it's lunch time.  How do you know that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because my stomach is —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Giving me pains.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have it on that, auto timer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you are always going to eat around lunchtime and the stomach has been trained that that's about the time food comes, so the stomach is telling you, hey, you are not giving me good, what's the matter with you?  It's a kind of a condition reflex.  Certain other behavior of ours can do that.  And one of them is bowel movement, the other one is sleep.  If you train your body that I go to bed around 10:00, 10:30 every day, like anything, you have to spend a little time to train yourself, it takes four to six weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of time I give people sleeping medicine and I say you stay on if for six weeks, then we'll talk.  So they go at bed time, a certain time everyday, everyday, everyday, and then the, the brain incorporates that.  And then when I take them off of the sleeping pill, most of them do just fine because it's kind of resetting the clock.  If you try the sleep hygiene, it will tell some of the things you should do and some of the things you do not.  And that involves that I cannot go to bed 11:00 today and 1:00 tomorrow and then 9:00 the day after, it's not going to work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because the brain gets confused, okay, what's the bed time, tell me right —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what I mean?  If you do that, that can be a tremendous help.  But because you are on Wellbutrin, Celexa, um, Vyvanse, all three of them, at least Wellbutrin and Vyvanse are very stimulating.  They are present itself can be destructive to sleep, and that's why you give them in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Ambien you are taking for sleep —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, if you incorporate this routine that works during daytime for you, if we incorporate that routine for your sleep as well, you will find there's a big difference in terms of your energy and how much you can actually accomplish in a day.  Like you're distractibility when, what you just said, that I start something, went to get something, and like, it lasts —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's almost classical of ADD but people who have obsessive compulsive disorder, they will just carry that thing to a certain place, get that thing, even if the food is  burning, who cares, I am washing this dish, let me finish it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no I'm not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly the opposite of most, because ADD and OCD are almost, sound the same, but very different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One is obsessive about the structure and the other one does well with the structure but don't have it.  So try this sleep hygiene.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I really want you to think, if we did treat a Celexa because you are going to be on one, two, three, four, five, six medicines, that's, for a literally young person like you, that's way too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He keeps saying that every year and I keep getting older.  It's like I'm —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unfortunately, I'm getting older too, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's, it's you know, you know, it's in the, beholder of the eye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's right, that's right.  Now remember that the Trileptal is for the head, for my head —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For my surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, the Ambien, now that you, I, because I asked you to take me off of the CR Ambien because I couldn't break it in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, well but also because I wanted to be able to break it in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum, um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and um, it's not like, it's not every night that I get in bed and I'm like, I can't fall asleep and I have to have the Ambien.  It's, I, I can, I could be downstairs watching TV, and be dog tired but I'm still sitting there watching TV.  It just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is the [INAUDIBLE], I mean, if it is a weekend or something and you are want to get delayed off your routine, that's fine.  But the thing is that most of the weekday is when your household around, surrounds around your husband going to work, kids going to school and you have to run around dropping them off and think you might have to focus on the fact that no, I know this movie is very interesting, but it's 10:00, I have to go to bed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some of this discipline, like your daughter, if she wants to stay up until midnight on a school day, "Mom, this is such a good movie, you will say forget it, go to bed, you have school tomorrow."  You know we parents do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, yeah —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That can, should apply to us as well or otherwise we become hypocrites.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you can incorporate that, that my husband is going to bed, my kids are going to bed, I'm going to bed, because I'm part of the family.  When they wakeup tomorrow, I have to wake up as I'm the one that has to take my kids to the school and blah blah blah blah blah.  Summer, big deal, no routine, but for you might have to do some routine because of your husband, but the kids, if they don't have any routine, big deal.  But you might want to incorporate that sleep hygiene into it.  That can make a big difference how you're feeling in terms of energy, motivation, including organization of your thinking.  Do you think Vyvanse, um, well, current mg of 50, is it sufficient?  Is it doing the job?  The maximum recommended dose is 70.  So we little room to go up but I always try to give the minimum possible dose.  What's your feeling in terms of Vyvanse mg both from effort and cost factor?  It does not come in generics, I know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, currently I'm okay with the cost factor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, because you because you brought, uh, you put me on the Celexa and took me off of the Luvox.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and that was, uh, an expensive one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did I give you a card that gives you the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the Vyvanse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You did, but it was expired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you remember that?  It was like '08.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have to look it up, I, if it did —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe you got some new ones, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'll check with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, that, that would be awesome.  Um, this is the second month that I've been on the 50, because I couldn't come, I had to push my appointment back with you and, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I mean, I don't know.  I don't feel, I mean if we could make me even better, because I know, like you had said when we talked six weeks ago, I said you know, I'm feeling better with my depression, and you said well a lot of it has to do with the Vyvanse too, because it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I said well that makes sense, so, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was just talking to [NAME OTHER] on my way here telling him that the babysitter was at the house and uh, he said "Well, [PATIENT NAME], I've noticed you're, you're better."  Just in, you know, not that I'm, you know, this wonderful person —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To be around, I'm better in my depression of not wanting to stay in bed, and put the covers over my head, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But if you will, if you will go up then I want to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least try it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's your call.  The only problematic factor would be anytime we push a stimulant with Vyvanse one can have some panic attacks or more anxiety.  Did you have any of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have any, no, I don't have any panic, I've never had a panic attack, I don't, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my anxiety is not any more, in fact I almost feel like because I feel a little bit more in control because I don't feel like, I guess maybe because I am trying to get more of a you know, I have friends that, you know, we see at the pool and she's like, you know, well what are you fixing for dinner tonight?  And I'm like, what are you talking about, you know, just, whatever is on Wendy's drive through menu.  I'm like, you know, and she's like makes the whole meal from scratch and all this, and not that I'm trying to get there, but I'm trying to get, you know, get a, maybe get away from the drive through window.  I'm just trying to do better and it's making me feel better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Why don't we just try and uh, the Vyvanse to 60 mg then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And based on how you do in terms of your mood, anxiety, organization, accomplishment, if we have to go to 70, then I might want to take away the Celexa.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Down the road, because —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The number of medicines need to come down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I feel I think yet, oh my God, that, that's too many medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are not 94  years, so at 94 you cannot fix this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At 94?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Do you have enough Wellbutrin at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, in fact yes, all of those are ready for me to go pick up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pick up, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So after I provide you with the Vyvanse prescription, were you about to pick up Vyvanse as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That one I will do uh, yeah, I'll need it on the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so finish up the one that you have because Vyvanse, they will not give me any early refill.  So um, you need to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They will not do what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Early refill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Early refill, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, right, yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So um, you have to wait until the existing prescription is over.  But first, you know, there's not a, enough for 10 days, not even 10, maybe seven days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Today's [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's at the next, it's at the, I don't know how many days are in June, 30?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I guess it's next Tuesday?  No, next Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Next Wednesday is the [DATE], yes ma'am.  It's terribly hot outside, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Gosh, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's the temperature?  Did you notice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, no, actually I didn't, I didn't even pay attention.  It's, to me it's not as hot as it was yesterday.  But it could be, I don't, I know that I was in my husband's car at 6:30 last night, and it said it was 101.  But I know that you can't trust the car, in a way.  I don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, like now when I go, I go to my car to leave around 6:30 because it's sitting in the, the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, well I mean I was driving it, I had been driving it for a while, and I looked at it and um, we've gone to get some Chinese food and we're sitting inside [DEIDENTIFIED], and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My girlfriend and I, and we're just like so incredibly hot, it's kind of like, the air conditioners, you know, they're being —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doesn't work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Overrun and that's definitely for our house, we have a very old home and even though we had, we have two, two air conditioners, one for upstairs and one for down —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, yesterday it was 78 degrees upstairs and that was with the air conditioning running, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nonstop ever since we got home from holiday, so, uh, but it's, it's nice downstairs on the main level, but in —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Incredibly hot upstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know exactly what you mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same as in our house.  Okay, so the only prescription I wrote is Vyvanse, 60 mg in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll see you back in four to six weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And thank you very much for contributing to this research.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we have a lot of catching up to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we do, I don't even know, let me see, the last time I was here, the last time I was here was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's been a couple months I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think it was still the time I had complained [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it was [DATE], so it's been—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, so um, what we did with that was just decided to let it take its own course and not push either one of them either way and just keeping the both separated.  At times, I felt bad because he couldn't partake in some things with the family because, you know, [NAME OTHER] really doesn't like him, my son, so, um, but he's been, I think [NAME OTHER] has been accepting it pretty well but at times I notice that he will come out and say like he still can't accept that [NAME OTHER] hasn't said he was sorry for accusing him for [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So what kind of, I think too that helped us kind of like take the focus off of [NAME OTHER] was um, the death of my brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was such a terrible loss.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I lost, yeah, I lost my brother, he passed away [DATE] so that kind of took the focus and attention off and put the focus on that and, um, that wasn't too much fun for me because I didn't go, I didn't get a chance to go to the funeral because I was kind of exiled with my brother and sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was so tragic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but, um, the children came, what they did was they helped me plan and put together one of the most beautiful memorial service where we grew up in the playground that we played in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's so beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And everybody came out and they even got it catered—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So nobody had to worry about bringing food and some people spoke, we had gospel music, we made these beautiful bookmarkers to give to friends with his picture.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did people from the neighborhood come out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The neighborhood came—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you had it right there, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had it right there, [NAME OTHER], we called her, because she used to watch us when our mother worked so a lot of us were very close with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that helped me bring some closure and I felt very good about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful to honor his memory that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was and I was giving picture because I had pictures blown up of him and my children presented me with this beautiful plaque with his picture on it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was, um, actually placed on a chessboard because he was an excellent chess player—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was, and they bought the encasement for it and, um, a stand and they even had it roped off where people could walk around and look at it and it's in my living room, it is absolutely stunning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is so beautiful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, so I felt, we felt really good about that, I felt very good, I felt like I brought some closure.  Somebody did bring a picture to show me, um, what he looked like in his casket, that was kind of hard for me, but um, you know, that was kind of like, the memorial service really, really made me feel proud—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And good and the children just rallied right around me whenever I needed it, so that made me feel really good.  Um, but I had some unfinished business that I felt like in my heart that I really needed to do, it just kept bothering me and that was to let my brother and sister know how I felt so I wrote them a letter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I wrote them a letter—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why did they exclude you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is the second time because I told you they, my brother did that to with my mother—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's so strange.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, he's stranger than [NAME OTHER], this is the one I told you about that really felt as though he made it and somewhat blocked out where we grew up at—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was the only one that kind of, uh, didn't want to recognize that we grew up in the ghetto, per se—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He has achieved a lot.  He went on to college like everybody else did—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he became a principal to a school and I think, you know, he never partakes in the neighborhood too much but, um, he also controlled my mother's funeral and also exiled me out of that one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now why, I can't understand—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you've been a success also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, I don't know and my sister, she's another story but she, um, kind of took sides, I was really surprised and I called her and told her that but, um, and then it was just them two that kind of made all the arrangements and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my baby brother, he wasn't able to attend because he was sitting vigil with my brother before he died and all his clothing was in the apartment.  My sister was put down as the person that was in charge so she informed the apartment building not to let him in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he couldn't go because he didn't have clothes and he's also on medicine—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So his medicine was locked up in there, so what I did was I had to call, um, I went all the way up to the director of the apartment building—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, she was very supportive.  The funeral had been on, I had added him on to the memorial service, I felt like it was good for him to put his name down—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This was your youngest brother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My youngest brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that he could feel as though he was a part of it and bring closure too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, he sat vigil with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That brother all that time and then she closed the door.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She closed the door, won't let him in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because that's the type of person—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't understand it.  I don't understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's how she, that's how she is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's cold and callous and [NAME OTHER] always been, she's always been very miserable, she's always had a miserable life.  It would take us 20 sessions to talk about her but, um, she never had really one of the best lives either in our family but, um, I was really surprised at her and I called her one morning about 7 because I had woke up, it was on my mind, and she hung up, of course, she hung up on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, yeah, I said I'm really surprised at you.  She's like you've always been surprised at me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] disappointed.  She hung up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What a shame.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I felt good, I wrote a letter, I wrote them a letter and, uh, I CC'd a copy to [NAME OTHER] and I just wanted them to see that I cc'd a copy to [NAME OTHER].  I said some things that was kind of harsh but that's the way I felt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the way I felt, you know, that's the way I felt about it.  So, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think all of your siblings could ever find common ground again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  One is going, and what really prompted me to write the letter was that he sent me an invitation to a birthday party for my aunt that turned [AGE] and that really kind of pissed me off, like how dare you send me an invitation to a birthday party but you're excluding me from my brother's home going service, that really sparked the letter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I let him have it in the letter.  I came back twice, it was returned twice and I said, you know what, it's going back again.  We was playing mail tag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But this was funny and I said, and probably because I put it in a business ground envelope—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he, and I think what happened that it was me, I sent both of them a copy and her being in [DEIDENTIFIED], she probably got hers first, this is what I'm thinking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then she probably called him and told him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I sent this, you know, a pretty harsh letter.  It wasn't no cussing or anything, it was right to the point—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, sure</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of how I felt and I should have held back on her letter first because she was closer and I mailed it in [DEIDENTIFIED] but I didn't think about it at the time and, um, so I sent the letter, I sent the letter off and then when it came back like twice, I said, you know what, I didn't think about it, I said maybe if I put it back into this invitation envelope, he may then get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Clever, he thought you were RSVP'ing and in a sense you were.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, so um, I thought maybe when I send this back, he will see that it's his, you know, invitation and maybe he'll get a chance to open it because I really wanted him to see this letter—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course, of course you did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what's so funny was that I went to the post office and the postmaster, he said you look awfully mad today, I said you know I am, I said because this is like the third time I mailed this and he said what, what's going on, why you mailing it three times and I said, I kind of shared a little bit with him, I said my brother, you know, excluded me from my brother's funeral but yet he sends me an invitation to a party—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, he said, he sent you what, I said he sent me an invitation to a party—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As if nothing had happened.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and he said, he said how sad—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he said can I have the pleasure and he actually—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I will deliver it myself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think he, what had happened, and I said, he said, let me send it back for you and he put like a clear tape, you know, the clear when you send back a label and he wrote it in his handwriting so my brother probably didn't recognize it probably and I said well how much is it to and then he, what really got me was that he put a return to sender and put an arrow back up the top—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the left hand corner back on his label, right, so I said well how much is it, he said no, he said this is on me, so that was so funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I couldn't believe it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I was saying like, Lord you're really right here with me because that was the funniest thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know, it never came back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I don't know who may have received it but I think from hearing from the birthday party, the baby boy did get to go, he said he called and asked somebody to pick him up.  Um, maybe he's right, maybe they've gotten it because he said she was a little calmer, like laid back and kind of like not really into the party and, um, she knows we had a big blow up before—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And her family don't speak, my father and mother don't come to her house, so I'm pretty sure that some of the stuff, you know, that I said probably [INAUDIBLE] but, um, I don't know, I don't know who received it but it never came back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm praying that somebody read it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To know how I felt.  Well, you know what I felt before, you know, about him but, um, it's been a lot, it's been a lot going on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been a lot going on with that, um, and I felt good about that.  Then, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your relationship with the aunt who had the [AGE] birthday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She used to be my favorite aunt and, I mean, we used to be very close but I notice when I bought my home, she kind of pulled away from me and I have called her several times to invite her to stay the weekend and she always declines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I notice that my sister and her became closer, so um, you know, and then we had a cousin that passed away in April.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It might have been in April, my first cousin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she was there and I called her and she was very cold and callous, kind of cold to me and kind of abruptly hung up so I just kind of leave my aunt alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is so sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have just felt, I feel like now that, um, I don't, I feel like I don't even really care anymore, it really feels like I'm just bringing closure to all that and I think my letter kind of said that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, after my mother, father, now my brother is gone, my older brother who I loved dearly, I just feel like, you know, I'm just, it's just me and my children—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and my baby brother, of course, he's there, he needs things but, um, I just, you know, like I feel—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hello, oh, hi, um, I'm okay, I'm with a patient right now.  Yeah, oh no, no, I was mistaken, uh, maybe 9, yeah, okay, sorry about that, okay, bye bye.  Sorry about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's okay.  I just feel like it's just me and my children, you know, that's it, you know.  I'm at the point now where it's okay now.  It's not okay but it's okay, I'm kind of accepting that we will never come together or be together anymore and it's the strangest thing because, I think I mentioned this before, we all have the same mother and father and we grew up in the house and we would have been a good study because have never been close and we don't, I don't know what happened but we never ever been close.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we all grew up in the same house, same mother and father but we've never been that closed knitted 5 children and it's really, really unbelievable that we, you know, because my children often ask me that, they always say why did you all grow up and you all never, and you all not close, my daughter says like me and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said, I have, how did you get us, I said because I was determined that if I had children it wasn't going to be the way that I had to grow up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even if people start off differently and people do start off as individuals—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's strange though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They can be encouraged to find common ground and, you know, it's just sometimes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's weird, it's crazy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what that is.  My mother used to say that, she'd say I just don't understand, you know, she said I just don't understand, I did the best I could, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's only so much that a parent can do if people are that different and all it takes is one or two who really don't have the empathy for others—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If someone is just completely self centered—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's cold, my brother is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can't find common ground.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He is so cold, I mean he even took the family house and sold it for like $3000, the house now could get like, you know, [DEIDENTIFIED], like over $200,000 for that house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Without anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're right, that's prime real estate now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the youngest one, even though he has a degree, he's living in a shelter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know and it, you know, that could have been a home for someone to go to if they did fall on hard times and I often think about that and I think some of that is the reason why I feel the way the I do, so it's a lot of things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, he's very cold, um, he shows no emotion, he shows no emotions, I mean even to the point that, like I said, even his father in law and mother in law don't go to his house anymore, so um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a shame.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean any time and this is, I [INAUDIBLE] but any time that you have a revealing, he had a revealing for my mother's tombstone, um, which we didn't attend, I didn't attend, I really wasn't invited but when they took the white cloth off, his picture was on there with hers, is that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that permanently on the headstone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's carved in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With his birth date but not his death date, on with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did his wife know he did that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They said the woman almost passed out, she had no idea.  They said she almost fainted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not right, that's not right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I mean, that tells, that alone, when that happened and when I got the word of that, that's when my sister would call and talk to me, she attended, she said the woman almost passed out of her chair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When he revealed that tombstone and removed the white cloth off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There he is with his picture with my mother on there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With her birth date, her death date, his birth date and it's open for his death date.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He wants to be buried on top of her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And is your mother buried next to your father?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they at different cemeteries.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Isn't that something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And was that your mother's wish?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she had been paid for, um, that area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I paid for my father's funeral by myself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] so that might be [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I paid for everything, they refused to give me any money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] was in [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In school, I took his tuition money, called the financial aide office, ask them, because I knew they used to send him goodies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could they please postpone that next payment because I had to lay my father and they did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They did, they did for me and I worked 2 full time jobs and a part time when [NAME OTHER] was in college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had no time to myself and when, and I put in the letter, um, and that was important to me because twice I heard him say on the phone, while I was on the phone, just [NAME OTHER] and that just kind of like really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Echoed in my mind because he said it when I called—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Money for to help me with my father, he said, um, just burn him and then in my living room on that Saturday when they was meeting to plan my brother's funeral, I heard him again say it and it was, it just was stuck in my head—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I said this is the second time I heard him say that, just burn him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you imagine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you know, just burn him and I said that in the letter, I said, you know, twice I heard you say that and it echoes in my mind that you said that, you know, about two people that I love dearly—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said for you to say that about [NAME OTHER], I couldn't believe it, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And even if the decision is made to cremate, that's a group decision—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	By who is left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not one person saying—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's how he is, he's cold and callous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And um, that's the way he is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So um, so then you know, um, that happened and I had a really rough weekend that weekend because the [DATE], um, was my brother's funeral, um, it was my brother's funeral, [NAME OTHER] took my car and I think I told you that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was my birthday, it was Memorial Day, it was an absolutely, I can't even describe that weekend—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it wasn't for my daughter just being there, I'm serious, I don't know what I would do because I just couldn't take all that, that was, you know, it was very, my son came and laid on the floor with me, he was just like everything, not at the funeral, my car missing, you know, it was just too much to bear—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was my birthday and Memorial Day, everything was going, you know, it was just too much, it was just much but the kids rallied, I'll tell you, I got two dynamite children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When the going gets tough, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So um, you know that was that and that kind of worked out, you know, [NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE] three days a week he goes to school, he goes to church every Sunday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wanted to add that, and I felt like it was something he needed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	His English is getting good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He goes to the school and they let him up in the church.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, he's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And um, [NAME OTHER], he call him [NAME OTHER], he's a PhD retired professor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he teaches the English class and that Sunday I went and looked to see if [NAME OTHER] had my car, he wasn't and I cried and I told [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] said, when he came back and after he was in the hospital, um, he's doing much, much better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Is [NAME OTHER] taking any medication?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He is taking, he's taking Wellbutrin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Seroquel too I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they given him Trazodone at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are good medications that work well together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, he's doing, he's doing very well.  He went to his doctor, um, Tuesday, um, so the things we've been doing, we go to church every Sunday together, um, he goes to school and, um, you know, the little jobs don't last long and I think he gets frustrated—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And um, so you know, we have another place where somebody told him to go to, to [DEIDENTIFIED] distribution warehouse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's in [DEIDENTIFIED], not the store—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But where they actually get the boxes and take them to the store.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, you know, he could do a little part time with that, so we've got to go to that and, uh, he went with me 2 weeks ago to a friend that was very ill, I told you, he passed away today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I went Tuesday too—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went Tuesday and he passed away today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The strangest thing is I didn't go to work today, I didn't feel like it today, that was strange, I didn't, I just didn't feel like it today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll you're still bereaved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just didn't feel like it, um, but, uh, I just didn't feel like it, I just felt kind of like down, the day was kind of down but I just felt like I just wanted to rest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt a little fatigued and I started running, jogging—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You see I'm losing weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You look terrific.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm losing a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I didn't know if it was fatigue from my old body trying to run.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you, even speed walking is good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we do speed, I do that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes when I don't feel like picking up my feet, I do speed walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's over, right here, I go there, we go three times a week [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's where I go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, me and [NAME OTHER].  [NAME OTHER] is buying a home, she has settlement the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's another thing I have to disconnect but she's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE], she needs to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, she found the right situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She got a beautiful home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More power to her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Beautiful home, so she's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not far from me but she's around the corner from [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she's right off the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's beautiful, the same realtor [NAME OTHER] who's like a sister to us—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Terrific.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Found her home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A good realtor is like a member of the family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she is like a sister so she found [NAME OTHER] something that's absolutely stunning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you tell her congratulations for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I will tell her and that's kind of keeping me a little happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you know, working, that's about, you know, we know, it's been a lot, now that my friend passed away I've got to now prepare for that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's probably going to be Saturday, maybe, I don't know.  I went to see him Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you got to see him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, I kissed him, I said it's me [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did he recognize you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he was happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He [INAUDIBLE] because he had cancer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a very difficult process to go through with somebody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they gave him the strongest chemo they said, they said they had to increase his chemo to something different, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Poor guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so but he came out to the memorial service, that's why I had to be there for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had to be there for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was at my father's, my mother's and we dated a little bit back in the day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And um, but we always friends because we grew up together and my mother's, my father's funeral, my brothers, he went and called me and told me how he looked.  He said I went to [NAME OTHER]'s funeral, he was sick then but he wasn't as sick—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he came over to the memorial service in the playground.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he came, so I had to be there for him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I believe you, if you have to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got to be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] won't wait, you have to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He went to the hospital with me, um, and he met him um, because I think he has a little trust issue because he thought tonight I was going to meet somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, well, I'm glad you could prove to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's all he cared about, because I said I had to leave, no, no doctor gives appointments at 7:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They do if their clients work, you know, you've got to do what you've got to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said come on, you know, come on and go the ride with me then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He couldn't, now he's like, oh, you did have an appointment, I said I told you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He should know he can trust you by now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He'll come around, he's getting there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and again, he's opened his heart up to whatever [NAME OTHER] needs for her new home, to paint or now she's speaking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He says whatever you need, he said I'll come and paint, he said whatever you want me to do, fix anything and right by a little room, she has this gorgeous, it's like a little heater thing and she wants to block that off, so he said I will build you a door—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he said if you let me come to your house and she said, oh yeah, you can come, you can come to the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She says I want to repaint things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she's been nicer to him, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things have been quiet with [NAME OTHER] but very good with me and him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and I think it is better when they're not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think it's better when they're not, because he comes in to [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't like when he come to [DEIDENTIFIED], he's going to come to the house though, but he's says it's for his own family—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said, you know, when he stole my car—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the car back—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To snuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is a tough one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And um, like when he come to [DEIDENTIFIED], he'll call, like we go to dinner, me, him and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So when we went to the walk through her house, we're a team, um, we went to the walk through and he treated us to breakfast and we sat down and talked and he said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said we all three always together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a special, it is a special until but you have to respect foster that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's accepting this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think he's starting to, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He tried to do that little teenage protest thing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's not going to drive a wedge between you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And certainly not going to endear him anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No and he's said, you know, he encourages me like if [NAME OTHER] calls and says well mom I want you all to come and meet me at [DEIDENTIFIED], it's his favorite place, who cares, but that's a vice to guy, [INAUDIBLE] there, I love their wings anyway—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he'll say [NAME OTHER], go, go be with him, I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said go be with your son, I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's kind of like he's accepting it but one thing he said, he won't go in the house if he's there, he said I don't want, and I said no, she probably [INAUDIBLE] in the morning or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I would think so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's excited about getting started on helping her with her house too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wonderful</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said I'm going to go over, I'm going to paint, make everything beautiful for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's an artist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, I think, I can make my guest room my guest room, she can leave now and I put all these boxes in my living room and nothing has started to get packed yet, so I'm like when are we going to start.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A reflective [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My mother, what are all these boxes, she said to me when am I going to start packing.  Let's get it together here girl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're ready to start that guest room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's funny.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I'm real excited about that.  It's just a step right now for me, um, sometimes I feel like there is no real, I mean there is things to be happy about but I just can't feel that real excitement happiness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet, especially, you're mourning your friend, you're still mourning your brother—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, coming to terms with an estrangement—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you've said your piece—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope for their sakes, they'll come around because I think they're the ones missing out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't care though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it could be a personality thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it is, you know, I have just accepted it and, you know, and I think what keeps me going and I know, you know, my mother was a very religious woman—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was in [DEIDENTIFIED] over 40 years, holiness—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know, and I remember some things that she said and I'm pretty sure they do too but, um, she always talked about the story about the man in the town where nobody, nobody really like him, I'm not saying that they don't like me but it reminds me, and nobody would come to the funeral and the town bells was going off and everybody had their shutters closed and like there was this one man walking through the town and somebody opened the shutter and said, uh, I know you, where you going and he said well I'm going to the funeral and he goes no, nobody in the town liked him, nobody is going and he said well I'm here to represent and I'm going—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I always say, it is a beautiful story—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I don't really care—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If nobody is there, you know, if my children are there, if they live, you know, live near or whatever, you now, I really don't care, you know, that's it, you know, the man, he's a man nobody liked but one person, as long as the Lord is there, that's how I feel now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know maybe that's not a good feeling but that's really how I feel and I remember that story and I always thought about it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nobody cared but God showed up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's exactly right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you know, he didn't have, not one person in that town went she said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I always thought about that story when she told me that story—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the end, it's between you and God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really is, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know and I seen—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All the rest are just trappings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know and I put a copy of it in my bible and just folded it and put it in there and, um, I have a bible in my living room and I just put it in my big bible, all that I said, so to me it's like, you know, that's good, you know, say what I had to say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know you all read it probably and I know if my brother didn't, my sister did and she told him what was in it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm pretty sure they know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I just kind of like I have to go on, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh and what you weren't able to, you know, to change with your siblings, you've help make sure that it isn't that way between your children.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're there for each other, you know, their cousins—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They are very close.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're together and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That generation is very close, they are very close, they are very close, it's sad that we're not but, you know, that's the way it is I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can only control what you can control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And after a while, you kind of like say, you know, to yourself, you know, enough is enough of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm not going to keep hitting my head against the wall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, you never going to come to any level of peace if you're constantly thinking and constantly going over this, trying to make up, people today to me are just set in their ways and set in the way they're going to be, you can constantly push yourself but if they don't want to accept it, they're not going to accept it, I'm the same way, just leave it alone, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like the serenity prayer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At a certain point, you have to accept the things you can't change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's the way I'm starting to feel, you know, and just enjoy whatever I can, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's coming around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's coming around though, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's getting some of the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He really enjoyed going to church.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We go to church where he go to school—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we're the only brown faces in there.  But I love Pastor [NAME OTHER], he is awesome, we sat down and we talked.  He wanted to know my background and I talked about the children and they love [NAME OTHER] and [INAUDIBLE] women, hi [NAME OTHER], hello [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's got that Latin appeal, I love it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The ladies are hey [NAME OTHER], hi darling, hey [NAME OTHER] but all the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like you have [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can tell [NAME OTHER] I said that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They love him and he says hello, hello, do you remember my name, I'm [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.</p>

Oh, like he'll be coming, it's like all these older women—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a riot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And yeah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's [INAUDIBLE], I'm telling you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They love him, they love him, they love him and I was going to tell you about [NAME OTHER] said to him, he said you better not give her any more trouble or you're not going to be allowed her to confess, that's not what this church stands for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it's reasonable to say, you know, there's a community counting on you, you know, there's a way we do things and it's a good contrast to what was happening with [NAME OTHER] and his cousin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because he kept getting pulled back into that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hate when he goes to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he going less often to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's going less but I don't like that I have to use vacation time like a kid to go with him because when he goes, I'm at work and after his appointment, he really has nothing to do but gravitate to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yikes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and one time, since all of this, he went and he had a beer and that bothered me and I told him about with the medication—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What it can cause.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he's been, matter of fact, we went Monday, he had an appointment, or even Wednesday and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is he going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He went, he's going to [DEIDENTIFIED] for his psychiatric—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he doesn't have, it's hard to find therapy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With Medicare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Extremely difficult to find somebody, I have really tried to find somebody, a lot of people don't take Medicare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a shame.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're right, it's too much paperwork.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, he goes to a psychiatric, so that's good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he goes, he went, um, I think it was, it might have been on Wednesday and he went to [DEIDENTIFIED] to speak to his friends and he called me and I got off a little early because I be worried—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, he was at McDonald's where we normally and he said [PATIENT NAME], I'm here in McDonald's, I'm waiting and I said you did, because I really prepared myself that he wasn't coming back with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought he going to disappear—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad he didn't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he didn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was there, he was there, he was there, so that was good and the church has a lot of activities for us</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have movies—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wednesday night, so we don't have to spend any money, we went to see [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They had popcorn and soda at the church so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice and it's affordable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We don't have to pay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We just go and it was absolutely beautiful, we loved it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They always have a little something there, volley ball or something you can do, you know, it's always something that they have there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, we look forward to getting up in the morning and it's around the corner from us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, we get up and go to church and then if we have, if we can budget it, we go and have breakfast, if not, we come home and fix breakfast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, you're getting back on track.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So yeah, things is good so far, you know, um, and I think too that's going to help kind of be good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Staying kind of focused, that he knows [NAME OTHER] is about to move out—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because [NAME OTHER] feared, she shared this with me, she feared that for her leaving it may cause him to act up even more and I thought, I don't know, I think he wants to make sure I'm okay—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And um, maybe this will make our relationship stronger now that you're not there and she said, well I fear that he's going to act up more that I'm not going to be here and I said no, she said I'm telling you, you know, if he do, he has to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I said I don't think it'll be as bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you feel comfortable about saying it to him, this is what I'd like to say to him if I could—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You still have a bereavement process ahead of you, you've had two losses very close together—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of people who were a part of your life your whole life—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two of the most important men in your life—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He needs to be strong right now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He needs to be able to be someone you can depend on and who's going to trust you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And there are going to be time you may need quiet time to yourself, you may need time for prayer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You may need to go be with one of your children or with a friend, you know, just the two of you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so he needs to be strong, he needs to be trusting because, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you need even more support from your friends at that time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, it really annoys me when I do take time, like if I go downstairs, I know he don't sit in the living room and I'm going to sit there and he'll be constantly calling me, that annoys me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I kind of let him know that annoys me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Part of bereavement is having an opportunity to sit quietly and reflect—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, maybe read a poem about that person, listen to some music and there shouldn't be interruptions constantly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I love [INAUDIBLE] I love the park so much—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Up there walking around that whole, I just love it and, you know, sometimes me and [NAME OTHER] will get out and I notice he gets jealous because I won't invite and he'll say, no, I don't want to go because [NAME OTHER] is going but you and [NAME OTHER] are speaking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're all laughing and you're going to fix her house up, so what's the problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mother's and daughters like their time together too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, so we go running and stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then he'll, but he says to me, he says well you know what, go ahead, you and [NAME OTHER] go—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, he said I'm okay, he said you go and I'll water, you know, the grass or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He keeps the ground so beautiful but he'll say, you know, go ahead, you go running.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when he says that and he's good about it, you can say thank you for letting us have mother daughter time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because that's important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do say that to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do that and I tell him, I say thank you, I really enjoyed my run—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I made food for you now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Beans and rice and chicken or something he'll say, so he's trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He really is trying, he's really trying but, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And with getting treatment, he's probably in the best position now to listen to you and he needs to respect what you say to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because the bereavement process is going to be, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Things aren't going to feel as much fun for a while, just because you're still aware of what's, of what's missing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then over time, you know, you start to realize, you know, their spirit is still with you, the energy of them is still with you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you miss being able to pick up the phone—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or continue to go see them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think about my brother a lot, you know,  [INAUDIBLE], you know, and [INAUDIBLE] and I had started working on something [INAUDIBLE] because I, um, had wrote his name in magic marker to Xerox it at work and pass it out to clients and I said, give me some attributes for each letter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  And some of them were fantastic, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of put all them, maybe like 4 different ones for each letter, get it professionally done to present it to the family —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With like 2 angles on each side—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like doing stuff like that.  Usually we do that for all friends, we do, we make cards like that out of their names.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, and all different handwriting and, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we just put their names—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perspectives.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we put each letter, you know, like for R, you know, radiant, you know, we kind of come up with different—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we get it professionally done and, um, present it to the family.  That's kind of like what me and [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] as a family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's beautiful, it's like a one of a kind memorial.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what we do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm going to see if I can get a good picture that I can put in the middle.  You should see the, I have to bring the bookmakers with me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of my brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] absolutely gorgeous.  Um, so I'm going to do that, put his picture, maybe like with 2 doves on the side—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a great idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With his name, you know, going down and then the attributes going across, you know, R, U, whatever we can, you know, put together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So a lot of the patients really got into it at my job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I couldn't, like some of them asked for 2 pages, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they had more they wanted to put down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm going to sit down on the floor and just actually just put them all together and maybe pick like 4 for each letter and let them see that, you know, the outcome of it and stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you get people to be creative, it's amazing what they come up with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, I was like, oh my God—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is unbelievable, some of the, you know, the characteristics and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Y is not the easiest, what did they come up with for Y?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, Y was hard, everybody said that, um, what did they say for Y, it wasn't that much and I think that some of them said, youthful, youthful—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's good, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, um, um, some of them said like Y, your friend—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They put like Y, you know, they said that and U was hard for them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Y was very difficult, that's what everybody had a problem with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why it was smart to hand out—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because somebody will think of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Think of something that I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and you know, a lot of them was like, can I have 2 and one girl did 2 and hers was just like very descriptive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I have them at home and [NAME OTHER] said we can sit tomorrow and just go through them and just write our favorites for each letter and then we'll go and get it done professionally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can't wait to see a copy of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, okay, and, um, present it to the family on [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, probably put it in a frame or something, so you know, that's what we did and I feel so bad [INAUDIBLE] but I'm going to try to give it to her.  I'll probably give it to my son because she lives in his apartment building, just get him to run it over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they live way up there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you know but I'm just taking it all in and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, it takes time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think my meds really helped me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Come to terms with everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of help me cope with because I don't know like times when I would, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think getting the Prozac back in the picture, it's really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It really helps a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Giving that extra—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like 3 legs of a stool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Coping, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prozac, the Lamictal—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Clonazepam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE], but I sleep good, I mean it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You needed to, you need to be refreshed in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a very reasonable dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I know she wrote me a list and [NAME OTHER] said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—oh, a little stressful time there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She saw me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said why are you sleeping like that and I know one time she looked at me and I told her, I said I have something to ease me and kind of help me drift off.  I said nothing heavy and one time, I said [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did she admit it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She did, she said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, I'm glad she told the truth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said, she said mom, I had to, I was just so stressed, she went, but I got so sleepy and I said no, this don't make you that sleepy but she stays up a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I worry about her, because her TV be on late at night—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I know she does stay up a lot, yeah, I told her she really needs to see about that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because she really don't get enough sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if Clonazepam does work for her, if she takes it, you know, at a good bedtime and then is able to get enough sleep—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then she wouldn't be drowsy in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] a couple of times but I know and one time I told her, I said oh my God, must have been last week, two weeks ago, I had put in my prescription and forgot to get it until that Monday so went the weekend kind of out and it was pouring and I said, oh I forgot to pick up my prescription, go to the pharmacy and I was at work, and I said oh, you remember that sleeping medication, oh my God—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You better get to the pharmacy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I had more than just them, I think I have a couple of other prescriptions too [NAME OTHER] and, well let's add them in, you worried about that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You had one particular one in mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that's what I told her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's funny.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She gets stressful, nervous and upset but, you know, she's nervous about moving—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a lot, you know, a lot of changes, a lot of planning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I know her brother said he's going to come over and stay with her for, probably the weekend, for a week to help her get adjusted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said yeah, so and I told her, I said, you know, everything will fall into place because, you know, I told you that I had [INAUDIBLE] for their dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that should be coming soon for them.  They're already going to divide it, so I told her, you can take that money and put it in your home, you can buy something, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful and he would want it that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I told her that.  I said buy something big from dad, you know, whatever you need to get, you know, and she's really been blessed because they're leaving her like a lot of stuff in that home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two bedroom sets—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three TVs and a flat screen in the living room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're kidding, how can they afford to do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they just didn't want to deal with it, it probably reminds of each other of each other so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Beautiful girl, she's stunning, I seen her wedding pictures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you never know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you should see, it is absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and the kitchen is just so contemporary, it's actually with the lights inside the cabinets—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you pull them up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that sounds wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They redid that kitchen, they've got hardwood floors, everything in the kitchen, it's beautiful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you know, that's where I'm at right now, no vacation this summer, we can't afford it, of course, my car and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bless your heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just don't feel up to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like going to the beach, I don't even feel up to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When the time is right—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just don't feel like it this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can take those walks in the park—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that can be your little daily break.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I don't feel like, um, vacationing, I don't feel like going down to the beach, I felt like it in my mind but my body says no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So right now, I just don't feel like it and the backyard is absolutely stunning, everything is set up in case I wanted to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Use it for escape vacation, just enjoy being there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just don't feel like going, you know, [NAME OTHER] is a little upset about it, I said yeah, well you've got to remember, you did a lot of damage to [NAME OTHER] and that took a lot of money—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	True, true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For me to get her back so that was your vacation when you took her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you forget what you did to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you can always acknowledge the good things by saying, but the good news is you helped make the home more beautiful—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did tell him that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you know, it's not, it's not so bad to be here when it's so nice to enjoy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I tell him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just try to keep everything beautiful like that from now on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes and stay away from [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes indeed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh that was a real wildcard there, I was amazed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But no, so I have to, we're not going to go anywhere and that's it, I mean that's, it's okay this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we lost, um, [NAME OTHER] to help me raise my nephew, I don't know if I told you, she passed away the week after my brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes the one day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], I might have mentioned it to you.  She's the one that actually found my nephew when he was like [AGE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She kept him and she, the only thing she asked me was never take him out of her life—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, you know, remember when I would do the gingerbread houses—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Those were my grand kids, I would go down and get all the kids—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go to [NAME OTHER] house and get the kids—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She passed away, she had the same thing, cancer of her liver.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh God bless her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She died a week after my brother and believe it or not, she was already dead and a birthday card came from her that she mailed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that amazing when that happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have it in my bible, a birthday card from her came.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God bless her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	While she was dead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was one of the very last things she did on the earth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She sent me a birthday card.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In a yellow envelope, yeah, so I lost her too, see it's so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's an awful lot, you just need to regroup—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, the fewest variables the better—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As much as you have a routine, as much as you're comfortable at home—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Staying with the people you love, taking time for yourself when you need it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] needs to be strong and give you that space.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, he can be a strong, sometimes silent presence—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess, you know, he don't understand sometimes when I just want to go to sleep or come home, I'm exhausted, I'm tired, you know, I tell him sometimes I just don't, you know, I don't want to make him feel like I don't want to be bothered with him but I just sometimes want to take a shower—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And go to sleep—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you can tell him, [PHYSICIAN NAME] says—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes you need to let the bereavement process—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, take its course and sometimes that's going to be mean, you know, getting more rest or having some quiet time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I kind of got angry with him because how could you do this to me knowing that my brother had died and you took my car and then caused more grief on top of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it was his illness, I think that was like the last gasp of the illness before it's really clear—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He needs treatment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well he was in there for almost 2 weeks, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He needed to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was in there for 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because he can't look to you to fix it, that's a medical situation and that really, he almost lost everything he loved—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he was not rational.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was going to put him in a home or a shelter—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really was, I was just a minute, like this, hanging there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He wasn't rational at that time and that was no time for him to be selfish and this is no time for him to be selfish.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I try to explain to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're grieving and actually he can be a very important support to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He, you know, he's a man—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's getting treatment—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He can see that it's important, you know, this is no time to throw a tantrum—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And break things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, you know, he's been supportive, he's been okay, he's been okay, he went with me, like I said, but I think he went more [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], whatever he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's been sitting out there eating crow, you know, I hope he's a little bit, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Chastised and saying, she's telling me the truth—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, that's it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the only thing and, you know, he doing little things, more activities around the church we're doing, so that's fine, I enjoy that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they love him dearly, they want to promote him but he doesn't want to go to the, um, next level.  He's at the beginning, he wants to stay there for [NAME OTHER] but I told him you can't stay for the teacher, if they feel like you're progressing, you need to get, you know, that's like a step up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's like a grammar graduation—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they want to put him in the intermediate class now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, he's learning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's got his wordbook and everything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  He sounds so good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like a world of difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He even looks different, he looks more confident—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Better put together—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He lost some weight too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, he was calling me [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He looks healthier.  He just looks like he's taking better care of himself</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's good because right now you need him to be stronger.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think he can do it, you know.  He realizes he's doing it for you and he's being the man here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He can do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We watch a lot of movies and, you know, popcorn or sandwiches and stuff like that.  He says baby I want us to go on vacation, I said we can't go on vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said let's leave it like this, this is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's also fair to say, it wasn't even necessarily about the money, you're not in the mood right now</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm really not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't, you know, it's almost feeling like if somebody said, you just won $100,000, I'd probably just say, yeah, right, you know, like I can't seem to get that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can say—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Happiness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I might be able to have fun with that sometime, I'm going to put it in the bank but I don't feel like going to [DEIDENTIFIED] right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah or like yippee or like, I'm just not, my heart is not like that because now I've got to go through another process—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With him, you know, everybody calling to tell me, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness, just today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're a strong person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said I have to go see her because every time, I says I got to go in, you know, I don't want to call out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	God bless you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, 3:00 today he passed.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bless your heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I called my girlfriend in [DEIDENTIFIED] who is a very close friend of mine, she cried and she said I can't take this, she said, everybody that you love is dying, I just can't take it and I said to her, [NAME OTHER], you are being depressed too—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said you can't fight this alone—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said listen to me, you can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said I'm on my way to my doctor now and she said you say that all the time, I said you can't, you can't fight it, I said it's stronger than you, it really is, I said that depression is a, I said that depression is really difficult.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's like, I describe it, like I told her, I said it's like somebody weighing you down like cement boots and you just can't move.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, in my heart, in my heart, I told her, she said that's how I feel, I said I'm telling you [NAME OTHER], you really need to go to a doctor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I started explaining to her, I said you know we're losing hormones, different things is happening to us—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, coping is hard for us now, it's not like it used to be.  She was crying before I left, she said I just can't take this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Calling me telling me that [NAME OTHER] died, I can't take all this [PATIENT NAME], I said that's the way I was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does take strength to grieve—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It takes support, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, she said she can't take it, I've been there, I used to say that to her, I can't take it, I can't take it, God I can't take it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One thing that helps is to say, they may be gone but we're still here—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're bearing witness, we can keep their memories alive together but you have to be strong enough and you can't always do it on your own—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially if you have, I mean depression is a medical illness, nobody criticizes someone who's diabetic for taking insulin—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, nobody should criticize someone who's depressed for getting help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I tried to explain, I'm going to talk to her again when I go home because I told her I had to come and see her but I was going to talk to her.  I told her, I said we're going to talk tonight, I said don't cry, she's at her job, she said I just can't take this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's so hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's harder when you're not, she doesn't have a relationship—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, she kind of let herself go, she picked up a lot of weight, you know, her turned real gray and she's not feeling very good about herself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, you know, I think that has a lot to do with it and she's really lonely and she's one that always liked a relationship—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she doesn't have that and, you know, and she's there in her home by herself and, you know, her children are grown and she's, you know, I told her, hopefully, she'll come up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the funeral.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I told her to come and, you know, come up so we can go to the funeral together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm going to try to encourage her to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope she will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's a load off my back [INAUDIBLE] call her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know and, you know, that's where I'm at now, still [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] back together.  Oh, you survived [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] just left us today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phew, oh what a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You lose [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] is gone finally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They go everywhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, they are [INAUDIBLE] but they didn't even spank him, they, [DEIDENTIFIED], they just came and like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you run a tight ship there, you do a good job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you know, when you've got all your T's crossed and your I's dotted, it's just a formality.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They only have to look at one chart—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In our department.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just a formality.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh and that was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We had a closing party yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've had enough on your plate for one day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't feel like going today.  I didn't even know he was going to pass, it was just my heart, I just didn't feel like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just knew there was something, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just wanted to just kind of be home—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I just wanted to be home and it was strange because I started out and made a U turn, that was weird and I normally don't do that.  I was dressed and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were connected to him somehow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I just made a U turn, when I walked in the door, they was like, my daughter, because she works, she's a [INAUDIBLE] like teacher and she was working and she was saying, why, what happened, did your car break down.  I said I just didn't feel like it today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something told you to turn around because you don't want to be at work—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said I just want to be home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you heard that news.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I said I just wanted to be home today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'll just, you know, rest and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was out in the yard fiddling around and stuff.  [INAUDIBLE] and then we got that call he passed.  I'm going to try to find a picture of him.  I think I do have some pictures of him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That card is going to be wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we'll put it together.  We'll put it together, me and [NAME OTHER], we'll get it together for them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and the sad thing is that every year we give a big, in the playground—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we give a big picnic for everybody that grew up there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's going to, and it's Saturday, it's scheduled for this Saturday and [NAME OTHER] said last month, she said I bet you, she said I'm telling you, I got a feeling that, um, the once a year picnic that we all get together is probably going to be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said, [NAME OTHER], you think so, she said I really do, so most likely, instead of going to the playground, we're going to go probably to the playground but it's probably going to be the picnic with [INAUDIBLE] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If they have it on Saturday, it looks like they're going to have it Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because everybody is off work and they can make it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that could still be something joyous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it could be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In many ways, it could really be a celebration of him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, in a strange way, depending on what you believe, if he hadn't died when he did, he wouldn't be able to be there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He wouldn't have been there anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he can really be there in spirit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if his body is holding his spirit down to another place—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, because it doesn't sound like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More positive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He would have been able to get out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he wouldn't have been able to come.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We knew he wasn't going to be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, they had T shirts and we always do Ts every year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, so you know, it's a, it really, well it's a gang, I mean we grew up in a gang—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well of course you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we call come together, we come, all that's living—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We come together once a year and have this picnic—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be celebrating his life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At the playground where we all played and grew at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And every, that's why I wanted to give my memorial service at the playground.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was and right across the street from the playground is the house where we grew up at—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was hard for me to keep looking across the street, looking at the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I was brought home from the hospital at—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, you know, that was my mom and dad's first house they bought together—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and a lot of memories just looking at the door, still the same door, um, it was very difficult but there was joy too—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You brought him too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some emotion.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was the memorial he needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, everybody said it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I had a Caribbean catering service—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Smart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Caribbean and they just, you know, had it decorated so beautiful—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The kids helped me pay for it.  It was absolutely gorgeous, they day was just, and we got in a circle and, um, we purchased 100 balloons and we gave everybody one and, um, we had a Muslim guy say a prayer, a Christian guy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's beautiful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wasn't, we wanted everybody included—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I had this, um, uh, group, singing group, um, they was fantastic, they had [INAUDIBLE] we let the balloons go and they all went in sequence—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every last one of them, nobody strayed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then when they, we let them go, the band started singing, it was just so touching—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	People cried—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure, I'm getting tearful—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hearing about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I had, um, hired, he is fantastic, a blonde gentleman and he was on electric piano and he sung gospel, it was all gospel—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That makes me thing of [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I had like really good entertainment, everything was set up beautiful—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what you're doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was beautiful, it was absolutely stunning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everybody kept telling me how beautiful, but the balloons, just watching all of them until they disappeared—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's an amazing thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Usually one will go this way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One will, they all went almost like in a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You couldn't believe it, everybody is like clapping, they couldn't believe, they were crying, they said not one stray away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was absolutely beautiful and I said good bye bro, I said good bye, he's free.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said I love you, it was beautiful, it was just absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So here we go again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, his spirit is going to be there for [NAME OTHER] too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  Yeah, my [NAME OTHER], I called him [NAME OTHER].  He'd say why you calling me [NAME OTHER], I said because I hate sometimes saying a whole name, I get lazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's important, if he gets to be the letter R, that's a big responsibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You must be important if you call him that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did, I called him [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I called him [NAME OTHER] but you know, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My condolences.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be nice to yourself and let people know how to let you be nice to yourself and that they're important to you when they let you do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, especially my time, my space and time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly and that's part of bereavement and, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't love me, it's not that I don't love you, right now I just don't feel like, I just want to be by myself sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can love him more if he can support you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I just want to go to sleep—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just want to lay down and my heart is heavy right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you need the authority of [PHYSICIAN NAME] saying that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I hope he knows I like him because I know he's got a lot of potential he's starting to realize that potential.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now is the time for him to step up and be a strong man, not a needy teenager.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You only have so much to give and right now you need to use that to heal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To come to terms with what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've had at least a triple whammy, if not more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're still standing, yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is, it is so tough, it is, you know, but you've got to press on and, you know, I think this church thing is helping me a lot with my coping skills, helping me, you know, my medicine is helping me, so I don't know, it gets tough but I need this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I thought I was stronger but no, I need this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All of these are very reasonable, very low doses—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just fine tuning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you've got all the basics, this just helps the basics—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, work more effectively.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, [INAUDIBLE] trying to talk to her about it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Try to see [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The best medicine helps you use what you have naturally in a more effective way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because what Prozac does is it just lets your body use that serotonin that's produced to cope with stress—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Longer—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because what happened was you were just soaking it up so quickly—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wasn't there to help you the whole time you needed it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It made a difference in me, I tell you, it makes a difference in me and it was strange because, uh, I seen a paper when I went to clean my brother's apartment out, where the doctor had ordered him Prozac.  I looked at it and laughed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said brother, we are so much alike.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said we're exactly alike.  Our genes are so much alike.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's always tough when families don't communicate about that kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because sometimes what works for one family member may work for another because they have that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm sure it did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That similar metabolism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Me and him was more alike, being shaped alike, everything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I seen it on the paper on his thing, I said oh my God, somebody prescribed him Prozac, I laughed, I just smiled—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe that thing over in [DEIDENTIFIED] could use some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You never know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That could be something that's missing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But she's got to come to it in her own time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she likes to bother, my sister, but him, he's very rigid, he's just flat affect, you never see him smile, it's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, he's always just there, just no affect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's the one including himself on his mother's headstone, without discussing that with his wife, there is an issue with relationships there—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, there's room for improvement here, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's cold.  When my sister told me, she said, when he [INAUDIBLE] she said, this is when she would speak to me, she said sis, she should you wouldn't believe the day and that's when she told me, I said what happened, she said, oh my God, she said when he revealed mom's headstone, do you know his picture was carved in there.  I said in where?  She said on the black headstone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm amazed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With his date, birth date and no death date and her picture.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not nice to spring that on your spouse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said the woman almost fell out of the chair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course she did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said she had no idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She had no idea.  He never told her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's not, that's not right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I bet [INAUDIBLE], you know, is like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just shows how he is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just wish it would send him a message, wait a minute, there's something wrong with this picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's one thing if you have a discussion with your spouse and come to a mutual agreement—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a whole other thing to put it in stone before she has a chance to have any input, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh and it's like, it was a message for everybody, you act like she didn't have any other children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's another strange thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, you just include just you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's very strange.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wasn't that strange, that's the way I took it, like you, that's the way the funeral was, all they talked about or his pastor talked about was his relationship and I'm like something is wrong here, how about me and my brothers, how about that, how about [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How about [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh [NAME OTHER], he's this and [NAME OTHER] he's that, and every day [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], that's all we heard, they was making us like we wasn't nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, uh—huh, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He couldn't have her all to himself in life—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But by golly, he was going to have their remains be as close to each other as possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I can't believe he can't even see right through that, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never gave one—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not a soul—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But even her belongings, you think he would like, her favorite paten leather pocketbook, I know she loved and he has that, you think he would have gave me that, so I could pass it to my daughter or something, no, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, so that's okay, it's all good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like you say, it's just stuff, nobody can take the memories away from you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when you're looking to consolation, you're looking to that story—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of the man who walked to the funeral by himself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, the presence, that's what your mother really wanted to hand over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right, I always think about that, that keeps me [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It gives you strength when you have, when you need to walk alone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like that old song, you don't walk alone with your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.  So you know, that's it, [INAUDIBLE] go back, when I go back home [NAME OTHER] said she's going to order pizza—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  These are the refill prescriptions but my main prescription for you is be nice to yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you can tell everybody around you I said that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was real nice last week to myself, we went to [DEIDENTIFIED], he took me out [DEIDENTIFIED] and I was going like this with my feet, my [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I love it.  Mango is the best, what's your favorite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh, mine is the, uh, I like the black cherry and mango.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, me too.  The banana chocolate chip one is good too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never had that one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, there's a banana chocolate chip.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get the gelati with the ice cream on top, oh, I love that one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We went last week to go to [DEIDENTIFIED], me and her, and she said let's stop and get you, um, oh, something from [DEIDENTIFIED], let's get us some [DEIDENTIFIED].  We got a [DEIDENTIFIED] and went out the [DEIDENTIFIED], out there to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I like the black raspberry mango idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I never thought of that, good thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait a minute, it's black cherry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, black cherry, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They got the chips of little cherries in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that sounds really good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I love it, man I love it and I like the mango because, you know, they have mixed too for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nice, they can swirl it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the best.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I love it.  I don't know, I've just been walking and being quiet—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's when I go to think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes you feel, you know, the divine and the spiritual even more in nature than anywhere else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that makes me feel good and I'm like, sometimes I use the word safe but, uh, it do feel safe, it feels good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's perfectly okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it doesn't, it's not a lot of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever your instinct tells you is the thing to do, it's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because pastor [NAME OTHER], when we sit down and talk and he said to me, he said well why are you not going to, you know, like your church, your people church or, you know, he said I know you all have a lot of activity, a lot of music and I said that's what I don't need all that right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes you just need some quiet time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't need all that, all that singing and tambourine, I just want to hear the words—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said you deliver the word and we sing a couple of songs and that's it, it ain't 5 times they passing around the plate—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Somebody is getting up out of the middle of the aisle shouting all over you and I said I don't feel like that right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's not where I'm at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just want to hear the words—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And hear the choir, I don't need all that, that's too much extra stuff for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right now, I don't need that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so he just said, that's good, so that's where I'm at and I love our church.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're Cinderella [INAUDIBLE] I'm telling you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh please.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Everybody else in line.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't know the problems they're going to get.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I'll tell you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Well, let me get another appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, should we set one up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what's good for you, what would be a good time frame?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, uh, I'm going to be yawning, see, I'm so used to being home sleeping, watching movies, that's all I want to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] September, yeah, we could do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't mind after work or whatever is good for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could do a month, 6 weeks, what's good for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe 6 weeks would be good for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a little bit of improvement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, how about, we could do, um, do you want to do [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that sound okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That sounds good.  Give me your latest appointment though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What time is good for you, like 6:30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 6:30 is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'll give me a chance to come from home, from, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, terrific, do you want me to write it on a little—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know I'm going to call you again about it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You might as well give it to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need to clean out my pocketbook, my pocketbook is a mess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've had a few other things on your plate recently, but yeah, you can just take your time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, if you get to do over the guest room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I am, I'm going to get that done as soon as I can get her out of there, everybody is out of there.  I, uh, she gets a little mad when I say, I said, yeah, I think I'm going to move this over here.  She said mom, dang, I ain't out yet.  I said, I know, okay baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my.  I'll be thinking of you.  Call me anytime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you don't think we need to do anything else, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

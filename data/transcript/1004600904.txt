<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) [sorry you didn't get back to me] (ph) (inaudible)—Well, hopefully, I didn't fuck everything up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you didn't fuck everything up. So the—I may (ph) have misunderstood but I (inaudible) so —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would be out of network.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's a few (ph) months waiting period before I can get off the thing (ph). So it will probably be like early September.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before you'll be in network?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before I'll be out of network.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you're in network now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Currently, I'm in network, yes. And I'm currently billing your HMO. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, today starts the day of the PPO.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know what my co-pay would be for out of network and I think you're supposed to bill me and I'm supposed to get reimbursed from them, for out of network; I think that's how that works. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. (pause) [I see] (ph) a number of people on the Blue Cross PPO and, so far, where I'm in network, it works exactly the same...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...as with the HMO.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's funny, though, because you don't come up (inaudible)—I was only searching PPO; I wasn't—I didn't search the HMO Blue (ph). You're not the only Lowenstein (ph); there's an ophthalmologist and some other doctors, (ph) and someone else. [I've been all by] (ph) myself this morning. We played Extreme out in (inaudible) [00:02:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [the ophthalmologist] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that your dad?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I could use an (ph) ophthalmologist. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) And he's a pretty good ophthalmologist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, now, that I'm taking lesser dosage of the Perphenazine (ph), that I don't have the blurry vision that I was having.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was looking for an ophthalmologist. It's probably good that I didn't go and have them—well, he probably would have said, "Take less of the Perphenazine (ph)."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not a general ophthalmologist, so he (ph) probably would have been—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, he's like a super-expensive specialist?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Why didn't you want to go into medical doctor-ness (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I like this better. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the grass was so tall yesterday that I, literally, think it wore me out, just to try to run through the grass. It didn't seem to affect everybody else as much, but I was dying. And I, literally, get to a point where I'm seeing black spots.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: By the end of the game, I was literally ready—I was like—like when I have low blood pressure, I was ready to pass out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really bizarre. I played—there's a position in the zone. And what happens is, when you go into a zone defense...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the usual zone offense is three handlers, three players, spread off across the field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In, sort of, a little smile-like formation. And they, literally, throw back and forth between each other, as you in the "cup" are running, chasing them. So it's a lot of running.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't have—I really don't have the quickness for it but, every once in a while, they get me to do it. And I did it twice and I was just—and, one of them—one of them—I, actually, did it three times; two times was very short points. [00:04:01] The third time was a very long point. And the longer the point, the more they're throwing it back and forth and the more you're running. And —</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —a point isn't (ph) until somebody scores.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. How many players match up on each side?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seven.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's various mixtures of all-male, all-female, five-two (ph), which is five men and two females, and then four-three (ph), which is the offense chooses gender. So the offense would choose whether its four males, three males, or four women, three males.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, typically, its four males, three—because there —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just because of the numbers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's not enough women out there. But if (ph) you have a lot of women just standing around...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ....and female subs, the offense would call it. [00:05:00] (sighs) I got into a lot of bickering with Jess (ph) over this insurance business, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't—I didn't realize that once she—because she's trying to get on [the Insurance] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She keeps sending me these weird e-mails, like something about absent parent and whatever. I don't know. But I didn't know there has to be a qualifying event for me to go from family to individual. And I did not know that a spouse getting insurance is a qualifying event.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—because I was like, "I don't want to sign up for family and be stuck with it." And, then, when I got the PPO rates, mine was going up from $12.20 to $14-something—the HMO Blue (ph). And the lowest—now, my deductible's going up. [00:06:01] And it's cost-sharing with the hospital, so they charge you more to go to certain hospitals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's like a thousand bucks. So it's like $400.00 cheaper, which you make that up on the deductible in a couple months. And my G.I. (ph) guy, who I really need to make an appointment for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...goes to [the hospital] (ph) (inaudible) and, surprisingly, it's not one of the hospitals that is on the list. And, you know, I should have asked them about this one. But the other Hospital, I can, literally, spit on. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'd, probably, go there first before anything, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not good at hospitals (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For [dealing with the] (ph) mental health or for —</p>

<p>CLIENT: For anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For mental health, they're great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:07:00] They were nice when I went there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, everybody (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—though, they did a cop that frisked me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, to make sure I didn't have any (inaudible) (sighs) I had my hearing yesterday for the summary judgment motion. And I did —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Let me ask you one other...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...quick (ph) question. Usually, when you switch plans within Blue Cross, they don't change your number. Is that the case?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I will have to wait to get my card. I think what will change is the leading...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...three letters would change, that's just my guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll get the (inaudible) for me to look it up. So don't even worry about it. In fact, is there anything about your new plan that you're not sure about? Because (inaudible) I can look it up, as a provider, and get all the information (inaudible) probably easier than you. (Chuckles) [00:08:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I kind of understand. My dad, he's always said you'd rather—you want to be in a PPO...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...rather than an HMO.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, for some reason, they've always been more expensive. And, now, they're cheaper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Weird.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it's because of the hospital cost-sharing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...has brought the rates down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would have been about the same if I chose the non-cost-sharing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or (ph) the no-pay, or whatever. But I don't—I mean, I have no reason to go to General or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...unless it's an (inaudible), anything important. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) (chuckles) All right, yes, so I should be all set, then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I had my hearing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I, kind of, waited until yesterday morning to get it done. [00:09:01] And I had to get a title done. And, so, it's just putting everything together. And I never really, kind of, read fully through the opposition's motion. And they had a case in there. And, so, I was scrambling to get this case—to read the case. And I, finally, got it after just being stupid. And I read the case and I was able to distinguish it but, you know, I had my presentation all set out on—thinking I was going to go up there and just talk. And the judge would ask me questions...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...along the way. And the judge was really prepared; he had already read the papers. (inaudible) had a question for me. I felt I answered it well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the things is that they want you to create a statement. Basically, what the summary judgment is that you say, "There's no facts that are in dispute, so let's just grant judgment (inaudible)—if you're entitled. And, so, you've got to create, according to the rule, this statement of facts, where there's no general—material facts, where there's no genuine, tri-able (ph) issue. [00:10:11] And, basically, they want the judge to be able to hold this piece of paper and have all the important facts. And the moving (ph) party creates it, e-mails it to the other party, and the other party opposes what they think is not a—and they e-mail it back to them. So you have...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...each parties position. Well, they never controverted any of my facts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I said, "Your Honor, you have to accept...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...under the rule, these material facts as [I admitted] (ph); that's point number one." And I used that every time—I brought that every time he had asked me a question. I said, "Well, first of all —" And—but he brought up an argument that I really didn't think of, which...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "He" (ph)—the judge?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, which is a good learning experience. But, basically, the statute says that you have to pay your (inaudible) fees first, then complain about it. [00:11:01] So, if he follows that rule, that statute and that logic and doesn't try and—I mean, he could say that I waived (ph) that argument; he could say that. Then, I should win. And, basically, he would say, "Pay your (ph) fees. Dismiss her (ph) claims." [And that] (ph) she would have to bring a separate lawsuit to complain about the fees, or [bring up] (ph) the fees and complain about them (ph) at trial. I don't know.</p>

<p>So I'm cautiously optimistic that it went well. The other attorney was crazy. She, literally, walked in right as they called us up there. And, because her (ph) client's crazy, she's a bit overwhelmed. And she's just one of these people that just tries—you ask her a question and she tries to get in as much information as she can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (ph), really, is not answering the question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt that this judge was really on the ball. [00:12:03] And, so, even if I get a decision against me, I know at least I got a fair crack at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, the worst case is that I got (ph) a really good experience. And—because I'm going to be doing—you know, I'm trying to get more of this condominium business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the whole thing has been a good learning experience because I've made several mistakes along the way; none fatal but I should have approached it differently. I should have just brought the suit for fees, for common (ph) expenses. And then, I thought that, if I just did that, they would fight it. So I—you know, whatever. Its (sighs) we'll see what the decision is. But that was a big load off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. (ph) [00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, it was very stressful, Tuesday night, getting this e-mail from Jess (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, in the e-mail, she's like, "You know, I'm fine with how things are but if you want to get a divorce or order for separation or —" You know, she wants to break up the firm. And it's like I don't want to do any of this stuff. First of all, I think there's value in being what it is rather than being the Law Offices of [Joe Schmoe] (ph), or [Joe Schmoe] (ph) Law Office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that works and is, actually, more effective for certain kinds of law, like personal injury or divorce; that that's more—but I'm dealing with more business savvy people, very—you know, foreclosings (ph) and stuff like that. And I just feel like having a firm gives me a little more—[00:14:02]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —makes me look bigger than I really am. And then there's just the pain in the ass of changing everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, it's nice to have one of our incomes, kind of, cover the other income. June is going to be a good month for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now, she's covering—she covered my rent. She doesn't know it, but she covered my rent. And, so, I just—I don't want to lose that. We met with the tax lawyer right after...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...on Tuesday. And he's like, "Go ahead." You know, because she's holding all this cash and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) dollar check, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he wants her to—wants us to pay our estimated taxes, which I went ahead and paid April, and I'm going to pay June, which will have us caught up—actually, caught up on our estimated taxes, which is a brand-new concept. [00:15:03] And he says the IRS is going to want to see that we're taking steps to correct our shit. So that was an idea I didn't think of. So I was a little more comfortable with him, just based on that advice alone. I was a little wary before. Nice guy; he's a real nice guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—but he and Jess (ph) are, kind of, good friends and I'm a lawyer. And, so, it was more chit-chatty than it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...down to business. But—so, hopefully, he'll get—should get the paperwork over to the IRS at the beginning of next week, and that will stop the collection activity, which I really need to happen...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, my tenants send me two checks; one I can cash, one I have to wait.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm four months behind in rent. [00:16:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel really bad. And some collector called my landlord, looking for Jess (ph) and I. He said (ph) he has Google voice-mail, whatever the hell that is, and he forwarded it to me. And I'm just like, "Who the fuck's calling my landlord?" I mean, all I owe are student loans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The student loans and the IRS; [that should be] (ph) the only outstanding debt I have. And if my fucking student loans are calling my landlord, I'm going to fucking flip out on them. It's just ridiculous. But I'm going to try and get them some money this month, too. It's like—I don't know when the money—the money's going to start coming in. I have [a closing] (ph) on June 6th. So, wait three business days and then, that gets funded. And that's going to be about a thousand bucks. And I should be getting all these $175.00 checks; a few of them from the closings...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at the end of the month, for May. And, then, I've got a sale in on the 15th, which will probably be about a thousand bucks. And a sale at the end of the month, on the 27th,...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...which should be closer to $2,000.00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, then, maybe one or two more re-fis (ph), that will close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And any business that comes up in between, you know? And I, kind of, in my e-mail—I probably shouldn't have done this, but I'm just tired of being the one who is constantly put down. And I told Jess (ph), I said, "You're doing absolutely nothing." This is (inaudible) I'm at a bar —I'm at a tavern on the square, on the Square, just completely bummed out, while all the (inaudible) are having a good time. And I'm just like—just livid. And I'm just like, "You know, you're doing nothing to grow your business, absolutely nothing. You need to do more to grow your business. I'll watch the kids, but you need to be doing more to grow your business." [00:18:05]</p>

<p>I don't think she understands what I mean by that. And her response was, "You don't know what I'm doing." And it's just like, you need to be out there, going to Chamber events. You don't have to join a (inaudible) group, but you've got to be in some type of group, where people are looking to give business to each other. You know, networking with people who do the same thing as you, is not going to get business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to get you occasional business that they can't take and, so, they're going to refer it over to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if you want consistent business, you've got to become part of some—you've got to join the PTA. You've got to tell your friends what you do. You've got to just—people in Extreme know that I'm a real estate attorney and I get business out of that, you know? And it's only a couple of deals a year, but it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that's—that can be anywhere from four to five thousand dollars, which is more than she brings in, based on networking. [00:19:08] She's got the woman next door, who sends her some business. But, still, it's like if you want to—she wants to have her parents refinance the house. And it's like, "If you want to keep that house, you've got to figure out how to make more money and how to bring down the costs of everything. You need to make more money. You want to live in that neighborhood and afford rent there, you need to make more money." </p>

<p>And she just doesn't get it. She doesn't get it, you know? And, at some point, we're going to have to have a talk about everything and—which I'm not looking forward to. (pause) My friend, she was fired from her lawyer job, with one of the bigger firms. [00:20:03] And she—because she was a big shot in a death penalty case, she's on the news all the time. She's always down in the city, going on the news, as one of these legal commentators. And, so, she's now, kind of, set up a business to do—to be (ph) that. And has an actual business of going and consulting for TV.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so she has a website, and had a picture done for her website. And has her hair really done well and makeup on. She's an attractive woman without that, but this was like a stunning picture. And, so, I—you know, all these comments, "you look great." She posted it up on Facebook. And I wrote (chuckles) something to the effect of, "So, would you consider dating an old, fat, balding guy with occasional bouts of severe depression and anxiety, who is technically married? [00:21:13] And, also, in full disclosure, I'm a drunk with an Ultimate handball problem." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she replied that I need to work on my marketing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It wouldn't work anyway. She lives in (inaudible). So she's, kind of, out of my league a little bit. So we're good friends. She's the one who visited me when I was at the hospital.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) But (pause) Yes, if I wake up every morning before my alarm goes off, and it's cool—it's (ph) five o'clock and it's cool in the apartment. [00:22:01] I just have a flannel sheet over me and my first thought is calling a dog to snuggle. Every morning it happens. And it happened this morning. It just bums me out. And I really—I just—I can't get a new dog, at least right now. I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...can't get a puppy, can't do the things you need to do with a puppy. There's a freedom I now have, not having to worry about there being a dog. I mean, I hate to look at him as a burden, but he was a burden...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, even a cat, I just—I don't know. I just want to be animal free for a while. [00:23:00] So that means I need to find a person, which I find very difficult. I don't run into people my age, who are interested in old, fat, balding guys with—you know—so—but I'm trying to—it would help if I drank less beer, but I'm trying to get rid of my gut; trying to eat better. After my mom came into town, I just ate constantly and went to the barbecue. </p>

<p>And I'm just trying to—And I went to Subway and I got a 6-inch sub, instead of getting a full sub. And, after Extreme, I'm ordering salads. I'm drinking beer but I'm ordering salads. [00:24:00] And I need to get—start riding my bike, maybe just on the weekend, just going out to [the Pond] (ph), or something, and getting some extra exercise that isn't Extreme. There was an interview on NPR about a guy who wrote the book—this book. I can't remember what the book was called. But he basically went and looked through all these studies about diet and eating and health and all these pills and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...looked at everything. And, basically, everything has been debunked, even stretching.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yoga and stretching has been debunked. Not that some of these things can't help you, but he basically boiled it down to two things in the interview. I'm sure that the book's a little more extensive but he basically says, "You need to eat less and you need to eat healthy. The occasional fast food, or whatever, is unavoidable, but you need to eat healthy all the time and you need to eat less. And you need vigorous exercise, not just —" [00:25:19] He says, "It's nice for people who don't do anything, to get out and walk, but they're not—you're not burning calories or anything (ph)." So I do the vigorous exercise twice a week in the summer and I've just got to start eating less. And being poor helps that a little bit. I've just got to stop going to the [inaudible] and (inaudible)—(inaudible) food. [00:26:00] I mean, getting a 6-inch sub at Subway is—that's fairly healthy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Better than a burger or —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—but I would get the—I would get the foot-long and a bag of chips. So that was, probably, too much. So I just keep only healthy food in the house. Jess (ph) has got some money coming in, so I'm going to borrow a little bit and go to Trader Joe's, like I had been—I haven't been to Trader Joe's, shopping, in a long while. And I'm going to buy some salad stuff and snacks that are healthy; carrots, apples—I don't mind eating that stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds (ph) great. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I seem less angry today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST (?): (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure why, probably because I exercised so much last night I almost killed myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It sounds like] (ph) the summary judgment motion went well, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that was a big —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My clients, they just don't understand that—I try and explain things to them and they just don't get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're like, "I just thought you were going for the collection, but it seems like you're going for the full thing." And it's like, "the summary judgment motion was just about the collection." It's—just dumb people. And the thing is, is when I cut through to get to the office, I always drive by the condo. So it always reminds me of these fricking (ph) idiots. So—[00:28:00] </p>

<p>And I've got to pick Ian up from school today. So, hopefully, I can get in a little bit of work. And I've got two clients, who are—have good reason to nag me. So, maybe, I can get their work done today or at least try and work on them. (sighs)—take a shower—(pause) I need to get my air conditioning in my car fixed. I might commit some money to that, if I'm—if I can catch up with—I need to make some payments to my student loans and get them off my back. My biggest fear is that July is going to come and it's going to be (inaudible) —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the one, sort of, anxiousness that I've got. [00:29:00] Just, "Okay, great, I've got all this business now but what about July?" (inaudible) keep it up. And June's not going to get me out of the hole, where I'm going to have extra money. It's going to help me get to a certain point, but it's not going...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to be enough. And I still have some of the bills to pay for the upfront costs of moving my office. I don't know what to do about keeping my office, because it's a little hard to find in the [Center] (ph). [I like to] (ph) have a lot of people come to my office, so its—it really may not be that big a deal. I—it's like my rep from the title company was bringing me folders to put copies of documents...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in to give to borrowers. And she got lost. [00:30:00] And I just really need to tell people which door to come into and which elevator to take and, "bring your cell phone and call if you get lost." But I don't do a lot of stuff in the office. I do closings at borrower's homes. The estate planning, I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't have witnesses so, with the new uniform code, you don't need to have a witness that's present at the signing. You can send them home with an affidavit and have them have two witnesses sign that, affirming that the—that they signed a will, which I may start doing.</p>

<p>There's part of me that says, "Well, I'm doing a bad job because—are they really going to do it? Are they going to get two people to sign it?" [00:31:02] But, I think, what I should do is set up some sort of system where they send me copies back. And, so, I can, every month, send out a letter, "I haven't got the copy of your self-proving (ph) affidavit." It's called a "self-proving (ph) affidavit". And, that way, when the will is probated, you don't have to prove that it's a genuine will; it's automatically accepted by court, if you have the two witnesses sign an affidavit.</p>

<p>So—but, if I do it at their home, I can have them have two friends show up. I don't know. And I just don't want to—I just—I don't like change. I don't want to change. It's stressful enough...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...coming (ph) into this space. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, so, I need a couple more chairs for the conference room table. [00:32:03] And, if I have a bigger closing—[they do have] (ph) a conference room that's huge, but I could use the conference room for that. And I can use it four times a year but, then, I'd have to pay for it. But I prefer to do most closings at the registry (ph), the broker's office, you know? I don't even have a copy machine. So I've got to—are you wandering off on me, here? You closed your eyes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No, I'm thinking about what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to get a copy machine, which is another, added expense. Ill (ph) probably rent one, because I need something a little heavy-duty. (sighs) Then there's (inaudible). You know, we—they added some extra charges on us at the nice place we went to for two weeks. [00:33:07] And, in order to afford that place, we'd need 20-plus members and we're at 13. And I want (ph) to send an e-mail out today, that people need to bring in visitors and get us new members, that's (ph) over 20. And, if we do that, then we can move to the [Club] (ph), as it's called now, and have a nicer setup; more professional.</p>

<p>But that's (ph) easier said than done. I mean, we were able to bring in three new members, which saved us from going down to 10. My assistant director, who knows we're struggling, doesn't even know we have 13; he thinks we have like 15 or 16. [00:34:04] But (sighs)—at least, for some reason, today, I'm not worried about all that stuff. I think it's because I had a few drinks last night, too; it's helping—I'm self-medicating. Maybe my regular medications aren't working as well as they should or—I don't know. </p>

<p>But—[Long Trail Ale] (ph) has a beer called ["Double Bag"] (ph) (inaudible)—its, kind of, a thick (ph) ale, it has a high alcohol volume. They make ["Triple Bag"] (ph), and that's a very good beer. I had like three of those. [00:35:00] Then, when I got home, I drank a little scotch. I felt fine this morning, though; not really hung-over or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Are you going to say, "See, I told you so" (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm just saying that—you know, I think that it is helping with my stress, you know? I mean, I'm sure the exercising helps too. (pause) But I'm just trying to plot (ph) some way to figure out if that woman, Barbara (ph), would go out with me. [00:36:00] It's hard to tell. She's, kind of, like a—I wouldn't say a "closed book" but I don't know her that well enough to—I don't know. We had some—we had a game on Tuesday and, so, there were people there who hadn't met her yet. And they said, "be nice to Barbara (ph)." And I was walking by and I said, "Oh, man. I've got to be nice to you now." She's like, "Oh, no. You don't have to be nice to me." So it's like, "Oh, how do I take that?" So I don't know. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>It's like I'm hoping on—it just seems counterintuitive that I'm relying on someone being desperate, you know? She's 30 years old and mildly attractive and I'm hoping that I've got desperation on my side. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And she doesn't always drink when she comes out afterwards, which—I'd always have a designated driver, which would make you happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Yes, it would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a brew-off (ph)—people who play Ultimate and some of their friends and coworkers all are—brew their own beers. [00:38:11] And they're, surprisingly, good. And this is ["Brew-Off Five"] (ph); I went to ["Brew-Off Four"] (ph). And the—they're all making Belgium (ph) beers, which I really like Belgium (ph) beer. I like it. And its high alcohol volume beer, too. Gotta (ph) love those Belgians (ph). But that's this Saturday, so ill have—I think I make it through the weekend a little easier when I have something to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My friend, (inaudible), called me last night. He was going to a show but—its funny, I was at a bar in his—literally, blocks from his house. [00:39:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like in the South.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I proposed getting together to watch the game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—because, when I sit at home, all I do is—there's this station called ["Cool TV"] (ph), which is just music videos.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like listening to the radio...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but with videos. And it's got all eclectic stuff; old stuff, new stuff. I really don't know any of the new music; all these young, hot, attractive women, with nice voices, who—you know, they're like a dime a dozen. [They all] (ph)—and play poker on my phone. So I feel like I'm getting better at poker but I know that—I wouldn't say I have a problem but any money I would win at a casino, I would lose. [00:40:04] And I like to play craps. And I know that, number one, I don't have money to be gambling with. And, number two, that I might have a problem, if I went to a casino, of losing all my money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though—you know, because the odds are against you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: When you're playing poker against other people...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the odds are not against you; it's basically your skill and the cards you're thrown. But it's a little different—people play differently when its fake money versus real money. And I would probably play differently, too. But I just think casinos are bad places to go to, in general, because they give you free booze and—you know, I think it's a bad move on the state's part, to have casinos [come in here]. (ph) [00:41:04] And I'm a person who loves casinos. I've never been to Las Vegas and I don't ever want to go there. I'm not a prostitute kind of guy so [I'll not be able] (ph) to take any advantage of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, just, casinos everywhere would just—I'd lose all my money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the thing is, I wouldn't just lose the money I planned on losing. I would —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The cash—well, now, I have nothing to cash advance on, but I would borrow money to lose. So I know there's other things to do in Vegas than gamble, but it's just all around you. (inaudible) a couple slot machines, a couple poker machines—you know, it's hard to go to a casino and not want to play craps; its where all the action is. So I know there's people that have bachelor parties and all kinds of events, now, at these casinos. [00:42:03] And [just go] (ph) walk in, without any money—just enough money for some drinks and food and that's it.</p>

<p>I was able to do that. My buddy, had his bachelor party at a casino. And I played a couple of roulette games and that was it. I didn't play craps at all. So I think I do have the ability to go into a casino and not gamble. But that was before I was crazy. Or, I might have been crazy—who knows when I became crazy? (pause) [00:43:01] Also, I got a little stressed out driving the car here, trying to find parking, having to pay for parking. When (ph) I'm riding the bike...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...its clean, it's easy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I'm getting a lot of exercise out of it, but I'm moving (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially after running, I was very stiff this morning. So that helped loosen me up a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. [We'll need to] (ph) stop, for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since I get my new card, I'll give it to you to make a copy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. I'll just—I can look up the information instead of (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Luckily, the ["brew-off"] is in the area...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so I won't [need a ride] (ph) home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that is good.</p>

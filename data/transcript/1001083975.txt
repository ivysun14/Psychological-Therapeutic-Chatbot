<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, [PATIENT NAME], you were here what two weeks ago?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, two weeks ago and a week before that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wait was it two weeks ago?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DATE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, two weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DATE], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I am out of the two weeks of the Risperdal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, let's see.  We had cut that down to 0.5 right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm out of it now, but I was hoping to get off of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Well, we'll talk about that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, tell me about cutting the dose.  No problems there at all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I feel like I'm ten percent better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe fifteen percent better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is a step up that I welcome.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I was in hell -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Three weeks ago. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I'm only eighty percent in hell.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's going on with the moods?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm still depleted and I still don't know who I am and I am still unwilling to get up in the morning and I'm still, um, very psycho alienated.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  You feel depressed, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Depressed is a word that I choose not to use.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay well tell me - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But in ordinary parlance I think it has meaning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's so, uh, so commonly used today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm disoriented.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. Well - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I feel like I'm going to - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I could prove you are not disoriented.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hmm?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I could prove you're not disoriented.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, we, when we, you know again in the medical parlance we are oriented to time, place or person.  I would almost guarantee you that there's no doubt in my mind that you are not disoriented to time, place or person, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what are, how are you disoriented?  Maybe we should choose a different word.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know where my vitality is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do not know what I want to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the things that I have to do, occupy a third of my time, something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The things that I, uh, try to organize in order to fill time I work very hard at trying to fill time, trying to be occupied.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I have a list of about a dozen people that I can call - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And organize a, an outing, a trip - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> An overnight, a dinner - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Something.  And I work on that, everyday I work on that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. You know, [PATIENT NAME], when we talk about depression it's easy to see somebody, you know, crying in a corner and you ask them are you sad are you depressed he says yes, you know, whatever he's not eating, he's not sleeping, but especially as we age, uh, you know sometimes depression is not about somebody crying, uh, or even acknowledging or admitting that they are,  they feel depressed, but you notice that, you know, they're isolate themselves or they have lost motivation, lost interest - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're sleeping too much or they're not sleeping enough, um, maybe they're not taking care of themselves, maybe they are having problems staying focused, you know, those - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think those are characteristics that I, that I have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  It's very difficult sometimes when we found, when we, you know, you talk about people who are unmotivated, as let's say somebody in their seventies or eighties they're not motivated, they have no interest, you think, ah, well until proven otherwise they are depressed, but there are cases where that's not true where they have some kind of, you know, amotivational syndrome - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But they're not depressed and is this part of a dementia, is this something else, I mean maybe ten years from now we'll give it a name I don't know, um, but, you know, you have been on mood stabilizers that supposedly keep your moods, you know, from being huge up and down swings - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, the last time you were here we cut the, um, the Risperdal down to 0.5 and we said we were going to start the lithium, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And we also cut back on the Depakote.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right?  And so the changes of decreasing the Depakote and decreasing the Risperdal, um, have not been negative or harmful to you in anyway?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you had been on lithium for many years -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And done well on lithium, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Reasonably well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Reasonably well, yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And so, so you are taking the 300 mg of lithium?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the 250 and I think we talked about - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it's 300, it's one tablet a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it's 300, yeah.  And we talked about maybe going off of the Risperdal and, or the Depakote, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, you still wanna follow - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.   You're, and you know, [PATIENT NAME], gosh it would be nice if none of us had to take any medication at any time, but, you know, we believe or we're led to believe that that medicine X, Y or Z is going to help us with our problem, you know, whether it's our heart or our head or our foot or our whatever, kidneys, and we hope that it does help it does improve the quality of our life and we also hope that it doesn't hurt us in anyway and cause us side effects or, you know, short term or long term.  Um, so sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  I know, boy, I wish you didn't have to take any medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm looking seriously in the next year or two of getting into herbal - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's this psychiatrist that I've heard about, but I haven't followed up on that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There are, I have some, I will loan you some information if you'd like to take a look at some stuff that is, um, propriety stuff from a place called, I've used their products before Metagenics.  I'll loan this to you and you'll give it back to me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, Metagenics has, um, they produce pharmaceuticals and medical foods.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, um, they do a very nice job.  Um, I've used, I've used some of their products myself and I've used some for patients.  I, I don't want to be practicing, you know, homeopathic medicine.  The people that I do this stuff with are people, I'm very selective about who I use this stuff with, you know?  Um, I've used some of their products for, um, for sleep, I've used some for ADD for, there's a product they have, which is very good for, uh, women with their menses and stuff.  I've not used any of these things here, [PATIENT NAME], yet.  These are new stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, but one day I think, I may do that.  There's been more things, oh, actually I'll tell you something interesting.  Did you ever, I have a woman who is bipolar who actually drinks some kind of a juice called, I'm going to mess it up now, Goji juice or something like that, Goji juice - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And she, it's expensive, it's expensive stuff.  She drinks this juice, ah, which is an all natural juice from some berry of some kind and she read about this stuff and she swears by the stuff as far as a mood stabilizer goes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, and she said I can get you some literature on it if you'd like and I can, um, but I'd tell anybody, she told me, your bipolar patients it's worth trying.  Now she's still taking some mood stabilizers, but she's cut her dosage back, she's doing great.  So I can get information from her if you'd like about that stuff if you want to look at it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not ready to take the plunge yet. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I may do some inquiries through [DEIDENTIFIED] or something - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know where, but right now I'm happy that I'm fifteen percent better than I was two weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we'll see what happens though in the next two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, um, the next step for us, [PATIENT NAME], is to, you want to dump the, ah - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Risperdal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Risperdal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or do you want to cut it down to half of what you're taking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm already taking half of what I was taking - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.  Understood.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'd like to get off of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, do you want to dump that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll leave the Depakote for this week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At the 250 and the 300 on the lithium?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds, that feels right to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You strike me, this is our third visit right? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You strike me as somebody who, if nothing else, has, besides your intellectual curiosity you have a lot of integrity and you are an honest person, right? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, what I'm leading up to here is that I need for you to talk to me, to communicate with me, to be honest with me so that if in going off of medicine X, Y or Z that there is a change that is moving you in the wrong direction that you let me know about it.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I agree with you a hundred percent and I will do everything in my power to be as candid and forthright and honest as I can. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My circumstances, my economic circumstances are in such bad shape right now - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, yes. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That that emotional situation is having an effect on my whole being.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, I understand.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the fact that I'm desperate for companionship, I'm a very lonely person, is another contributing factor and then the fact that I'm giving up my farm - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where I live, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you selling it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying to, yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, uh - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that's a big farm you have, right? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, those are all big issues with me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they're very emotional issues.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And just Tuesday of last week the township planning commission rejected the conditional use plan that we spent six months preparing. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What didn't they like about that? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, it's entirely political.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, always is, isn't it? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, um, it's, um, one of those huge subjects.  So those are emotional things that have effect on my stability and my sense of well being. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, we had spoken to your daughter - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I'm sure she keeps in touch with you and if there was something going on, she would - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We were together this past weekend. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you have a nice time with her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she felt that I was very lucid and very plugged in. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was nice and her - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sure she would let me know if there was a problem, too. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Her husband and I had a very good, we were together for two hours going down and two hours coming, we were together for four hours and we had the best time we've ever had. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  What do you attribute that to, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Dowsing. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Meaning? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Breaking through the barrier of the ordinary reality. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He was very open to things that I've never heard him say before. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Talking about the paranormal.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Speaking of the paranormal.  Give me the name, if you would, of that philosopher that you mentioned last week, I want to do some reading on.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  You went to the place that he has, a group that he runs, there's a group -  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  He runs, I almost thought it was some kind of an enclay that you had gone to, it was someplace fairly local around here, a group of you that get together.  You were talking about camping or a trip or something, uh, it was like a, was it a Scandinavian name, or a German name?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Isn't that interesting because the top philosophical people in my life are [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER], okay, spell that for me, please? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can't?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] or something like that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And he is what nationality or - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He spent most of his life in Paris, France. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But his ethnic background is probably German.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and, um, any recommendations for reading? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> As a matter fact, [NAME OTHER] was his greatest student, um, I could very easily find a book and leave it on your message machine. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  I like to read about him, about some of this stuff, okay? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Um, you look healthy to me, uh, I hope that if you, if the best option for you is to sell the farm, I'm sure you would have some mixed regrets in doing that, but if it works out for you that opens up a whole lot more opportunities for you to do other things and certainly would vastly improve your financial situation and I guess that's the primary motivation for you to sell the farm, right? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  One of the potential buyers of the homestead and the barn would be a woman who's a world class musician - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Who wants to create a retreat for musicians.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very nice. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That also interacts with mentorship of inner city kids. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.  What does she play?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She is, her voice. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah, good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she is highly premiated, anyway, and there were two dowsers on my farm a week ago. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's a dowser?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two dowsers.  People who go around with fork sticks or - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Dowsing rods. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One of them is a prominent architect in [DEIDENTIFIED] - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the other is an engineer, a [INAUDIBLE] engineer, who is head of the planning commission of the adjacent township and, um - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You wouldn't believe it, it was like something Walt Disney put together.  It was, the day we spent together. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  You're in [DEIDENTIFIED], right? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think there's some bad politics going on in [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know about that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But anyway, there are some amazingly positive potentials in my life.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Such as? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> As the future of the farm. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Do you got a, uh, how is it up for sale?  Do you have a word of mouth or do you have a realtor or what? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's a conditional use plan, which means that we have hired a hundred thousand dollars worth of professional to put together a conditional use plan and present that to the township and that would allow eighty three percent of the land to remain open. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How may acres do you have? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Close to a hundred acres. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, God I'd hate to see another housing development go on there. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Well, anyway, that's a very big subject and it's, it's part and partial to my spiritual wellbeing. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it feel good for you, [PATIENT NAME], to, sounds like if this woman could take the barn and the home that would be a nice thing, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We'll see.  The difficulty is your questions come from a line of reasoning. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my entire life is controlled by a line of reasoning and a line of intuition. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's where intuition and reason come together that the barriers of ordinary science begin to disappear.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the book that I have for you is called [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's written by the uncle - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of my childhood best friend. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No kidding?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he wrote it in nineteen ninety. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he was president and founder of the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it gets into the way the brain works - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And how dowsing interacts with, in, in a piece of the cerebral cortex the size of a head of a pin, there are 30 to 100,000 neurons and they're connected by one mile of axon.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One mile of axon in something that big - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a million to one ratio. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now we're beginning to talk about the borderlines of natural science and biology. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They just don't understand.  They don't know how these things work. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum, sure. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mycelium is only one cell wide and in a cubic inch of earth there are eight miles of mycelium. Mycelium has intelligence. It can seek for and solve through a maze way a source of food.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now these are things that ordinary science just, they just - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you talk about intelligent design?  What is more intelligent design than these neurons and axons and the mycelium.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, [PATIENT NAME], how much do you read in a day or a week?  I mean, are you constantly reading?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm a very slow reader.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Slow reader?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Very slow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mentioned the first time I saw you, I think, that you had some problems with retaining or grasping information now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes concentration is a problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  But you still read, though?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I still read, but I'm scared most of the time.  I'm afraid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Afraid of what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I'm afraid of death.  I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of, what am I afraid of the most?  I'm afraid of loss of my reputation, loss of my credibility, loss of my sense of purpose. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Loss of my sense of deity.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have any sense, [PATIENT NAME], of the most, one of the most pressing at least, if not superficial and tangible things right now is the finances. Do you have any sense for how much time it's going to be before you have any kind of an answer about the farm?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I keep saying it's only another six weeks and then it works out to be another six weeks and then it works out to be another three months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so it's not in your hands I guess to - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But my responsibility for the future of the farm has been passed on to my children.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Through the creation of a family trust. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my son-in-law and my son are copresidents.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So they have just done a spectacular job of shouldering that burden.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm able to keep a homeopathic profile.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the homeopathic profile, which is just a phrase that I coined for the sake of a conversation is the mycelium and it's the axon.  It is the neurological connection to the universe and it says that when you, when you breathe on one little piece over here it effects the entire system. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm having lunch with a wonderful person today who is the executive director of the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nice. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she's a genius.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's an absolute genius.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I hope you have a wonderful time with her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.  It's a nice day to be out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She can talk about these things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, excellent.  You should have an enjoyable afternoon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then I get a blood test this afternoon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where you going for that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To, um, up near the hospital there's a place called [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  That's where a lot of people around here go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I think my time's up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Hey, [PATIENT NAME], um, you, we're done with the Risperdal then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Do you need anything from me?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Love and compassion.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay you got it.  How about lithium or Depakote?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm okay with lithium and Depakote.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good all right and we're gonna see you in, when?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two weeks, okay.  All right, you call me if you have any questions or any problems, will you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I certainly shall.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Good, good, good.  All right.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lucy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi, hello.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you doing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm doing ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Things are good? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I'm preparing, doing all kinds of research for the trip that we're going to take and getting excited about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good. And what about your abstinence? You doing ok with quality, quantity, surrender?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since I lose weight so exceptionally slowly, what it'll be a year of abstinence in August?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I've only lost ten pounds. (chuckles) I mean obviously you know I'm not getting enough cardio exercise. And  the other day I was in that cardio class and my knees started to kill me so I quit doing that. And I went back to Yoga again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think when I start doing more cardio, I'll start losing a little more weight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me ask you a couple of questions. Where are your meals in the moderate range?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like most of the time I'm mid-moderate. Sometimes I'm high moderate, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. And have we talked about ever having Dr. Carpenter check out your thyroid, hormones, and all the other stuff... was that was ok?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. He prescribed the homeopathic hormone drops. And he's also got me on folic acid, and some Vitamin B's. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. But he checked the adrenals and the insulin levels were ok and the thyroid was ok, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I believe so, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok good deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since they didn't mention it I'm assuming it was fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Usually those are the ones that I usually tell client to ask them to check and those were ok. Right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know the thyroid was ok. . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The adrenals I don't know. I don't know if I specifically asked them to check for those or not. Does he, what do they check for when you send your sample in? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually only the things that you ask to be checked. But if you said I'm a client of Josephine's then they might have done the whole thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They know I'm a client of yours. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok then they probably did check it. They probably checked it because that's usually what I have clients check. So you've been doing that just two months? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know I did it, what, last year. I did it I think July or August. And then I didn't do it again until a couple of months ago. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And have you done it consistently now for about two months or? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The things he's given me I have, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know if it's been two months. Probably you know maybe a month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. One month, ok. And that's the drops right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: The drops and the folic acid and the vitamins.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't know if you remember. I talked to you after Heather said you know he told her she was insulin resistant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh and you were delighted he didn't say that to you</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean it was funny. Because it was a double edged sword. Because in a way I was almost hoping that I was, but then hoping I wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I was pre-diabetic or insulin resistant it would be like, "Well, now I have to do something," you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But there wasn't any of that... which I'm actually extremely grateful for. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you bet. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to be diabetic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You bet. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or pre-diabetic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you bet. And it's so hard to make dietary changes of any major way in our first year. And particularly if the dietary changes that look or feel at all like dieting... then it's very, very hard on us. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's true.  You know I still have the temptation to just have somebody give me my food. You know something like a Nutrisystem or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a place I can't be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Since you're going to be going on a trip, let's get some ideas about restaurant eating. For quality and quantity... because we don't have to gain weight on trips. And in fact if our weight is slowly going down it can continue to go slowly down even if we're traveling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so, usually we do a lot more walking when we're traveling. Is that going to be true for you guys? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And we're doing a whole week of this place where there's Yoga.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh that's right. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yoga and hiking</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, I'm planning on getting a lot of exercise. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok and that's one of the weeks that you're there and then the other, you're going two or three more weeks somewhere else, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, we plan on doing a lot of walking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. And I think one of the first things you said was that when you do your old cardio stuff your knees hurt? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so what is your old cardio stuff again? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like step class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's hard for me. And then you know, after a while I feel like you know my knees are hurting and on fire.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like ugh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about a recumbent bike? The ones where you sit down and... do those put pressure on your knees? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So that might be something to kinda switch over to for a while... because you do want your legs to be as strong as possible for all the walking that you are going to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know preparing for a little more of the trip... endurance for the trip. But I certainly wouldn't let the knee problem stop you from getting the cardio that you need. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Ok. So I think you've told me in the past that your body really does respond strongly to cardio as a way to bring your weight into balance, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. And I think I told you when I trained and ran the half marathon which, you know significantly changes how much cardio I was doing in one week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I trained with a group one day a week and we'd do one long run on the weekend. And my weight never changed at all, you know? But I'm fitter, and I can tell I'm stronger et cetera, et cetera, but it doesn't change me weight wise in any noticeable way. And other people, I notice their body immediately responds to it from a weight standpoint. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm just not one of them so. So if you know that your body does quickly and positively respond to cardio, then that's going to be the good news. My weight's been stable all these years of abstinence, but I've really had to make my exercising about my insurance policy against osteoporosis. My insurance policy against you know aging and keeping really fit so that as I, as we get older, you know I've been a senior citizen a while now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know what the huge resistance is for me. I think it's probably laziness or I don't know. But that's how I lost 60 pounds several years ago. And more than anything it was that I walked seven days a week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think we have to walk seven days a week. But probably four is good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when you walked for seven days a week how long did you walk?</p>

<p>CLIENT: An hour. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So how about four for 45 minutes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think if we can get that in. And certainly you'll be doing that when you're on vacation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, oh yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's for sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, on vacation</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. So but at home if you can figure out a routine that lets you get in four times where you're doing something cardio for 45 minutes. Does that seem like that's going to be possible? To have a routine that does that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just have to do it. Yes it's possible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, so in general we just want to work toward that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the most important component in consistent exercise is, "Does it fit into my routine." And as you know we go through lifestyle changes and you know in my case from having a family to not having a family... from working a lot to not working much. You know I've just had to change the form it takes but I try to stay on the task. And it's changing the form. So do you want to brainstorm ways to keep it in, once you've finished your traveling... kind of keeping it in your every day routine.  Let's figure out how you can do it. So that it really fits in logistically. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If I carve out a specific time of day you know, and try and get my husband in on it so I have a partner... that would be the best. You know that's how it worked for me before. I had girlfriends that we would just meet every morning at different places and that was highly motivating to know that I was going to meet somebody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok yeah, yeah. And with your husband, is he more passive or more assertive about getting back walking? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Passive. We've done it you know, we'll do it for a while and then we'll quit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if the four times a week, I'd only put him in as a partner one time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because to try to get him to do it, when he's already resistant and you're struggling with getting your resistance and your routine going. Having a partner who's resistant is very, very tough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So of the, the gal you went with before are you anywhere around her any more? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that was a whole different town. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So do you have anybody else you think might be a partner?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not off the top of my head. Not with people's schedules, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you were going to do it by yourself, do you see a way that you can do it that's safe?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok so you've got safe trails, safe routines.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Do you work from a day timer? </p>

<p>CLIENT: A schedule book, yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Can you start by putting three times in and then one time with your husband when you can work that in with your time together? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you put the three times in, what days would you pick? See if you just opened up your book and looked, you know looked at last weeks, or two weeks ago, what does your normal routine looked like. Which days or times would you pick? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd have to think about that a little bit because I have to work around my clients. Or else I have to make the time I walk, you know I have to schedule that in and then schedule my clients around that., which is probably what I would have to do to make it really consistent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, so in general do your clients book between eight and five? Or is it between seven in the morning and ten at night? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, between eight and five. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eight and five mostly, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eight and five thirty, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well nine to five thirty. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nine to five thirty. Ok. And for you, what's your getting up time and going to bed time? What's your schedule? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I get up about seven and I go to bed, try and go to bed about ten. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. And if you get up at seven is that usually slow time, meditation time, husband time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the problem with right now is it's really cold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: At morning and at night. So you know the best time would probably be in later afternoon when it's a little bit warmer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's like zero degrees in the morning and at night. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh God. Oh God. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that's not real motivating to get out there. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'd rather you know, at least it warms up to about 30, 32 on a nice day this time of year and it's tolerable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then so what you 'd like to plan then is walking in nature it sounds like. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, outside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be probably the best because then you don't get bored. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. And so if it's walking in nature, afternoons are going to be the best, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even noon. You know even like noon or something would probably work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in general do your clients want your noon times? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Right now that would work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is your husband at work at that time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: His schedule varies as well. But most of the time he is at work. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. And so it it's around the noon time, can you get your lunch in and a walk say three days a week? Get both of them in without much of a problem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes when it's three days a week, is it every other day that would work the best for you? or maybe two days in a row? Like sometimes people, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday is a little more booked. So pick one of those but then Thursday and Friday are a lighter... anything like that to your schedule? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not necessarily. Ok. So can you look at this week and see any times that are kinda natural? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You want me to do that right now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. I could do it; I couldn't do it at noon tomorrow. But I could do it at 2:00.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't do it Wednesday until, well no Wednesday is not really good. Thursday I could do it, well I'm not sure because I might have clients book on Thursday morning so I'm not sure about Thursday of this week. Friday I could do it after like 1:30. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely. I'll put that in. And so for this week I could do Tuesday and Friday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tuesday and Friday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly Thursday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, Thursday with a question mark. And then if you picked up the fourth time with your husband over the weekend, would that work at all? Or are you guys pretty committed to something else? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, Sunday I'm committed to something else but Saturday I could. Any time on Saturday I think we could both do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. All right. So did you write them in as you talked about them? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I have three times. I have Tuesday, Friday and now Saturday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, all right. And a question mark with possibly Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need a fourth time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I could possibly do on Thursday, yeah. </p>

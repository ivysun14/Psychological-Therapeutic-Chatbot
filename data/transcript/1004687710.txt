<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for talking to me last night. (inaudible at 00:00:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:17) I don't know why the last few days have not been so good. I mean, today has been actually fine this morning. I kind of had to do some work before I came here and that was really good. The couple days before that were rough. One theory which I came up with talking with James last night is that as soon as I have like a project, I go into... I start to do things that make me feel you know, complete projects in the past which is bully myself constantly. (LAUGHTER) [00:00:59]</p>

<p>That's how I go through high school and college and grad school and teaching. You know, either this paper gets on time, in on time or the world's going to end. Like (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't take any incompletes as a master's student. (LAUGHTER) That's not really working anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, thank you from the rest of us who would have suffered the consequences of the world ending that you got your work done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (LAUGHTER) You know, for the world ending, substitute like my utter failure as a person or whatever. But I kind of think of it in terms of the world ending. (LAUGHTER) But I mean I do that now and I just crumble. Like you know. I mean, it doesn't make me... [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: more successful. It doesn't motivate me to get my shit together. It's just it makes me fall apart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST I crushed you. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, working on new motivational strategies. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah last night, it was very funny. It was kind of... We were kind of all set up to have one of those like horrible long fights where like you're both exhausted and you can't, you know you can't stop talking until you've reached some kind of resolution and you just want to fucking go to bed. And like just do it. Great. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know we're in a tough spot in terms of like talking in some ways you know because like I really rely on him for you know being the person I can talk to about the way I'm feeling. [00:03:11] (PAUSE)</p>

<p>And I'm also really afraid that I'm going to wear him out and that he's going to you know turn away from me. He's not worried about that but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's not at all but he's really afraid that in trying to talk with me about things he's going make things worse for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which to be fair he does sometimes. And so like the last... This... Last night was like the third time that he said something like, "You know since I'm just not good at..." And he also had a horrible day yesterday. [00:03:57]</p>

<p>Something like, "I'm not good at talking to you about your emotions so I'm just not going to talk about this now." And I was just like, "Okay. You can't do that." (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm. [00:04:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like... So, so I got that straightened out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know as soon as I said, "You know the worst thing you can do it to disengage." You know. And He said that but, you know, he feels like when I get into situations when we talk in a certain pattern of conversation he feels like anything he says just makes it worse. So he's just trying to not have those conversations. But I'm like, "Yeah but, not having a conversation also makes it worse."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Probably (inaudible at 00:04:53) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "You know. When you say I'm just not going to have this conversation what I do is I say â€˜okay' and then I hang up and then I fall to pieces."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're just not present for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't want to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want to make him go through that. [00:05:11]</p>

<p>You know in some ways it's like I am using him to, to bully myself and neither of us really wants that to be what's going on. It's not fair to him and it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean you're using him to bully yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (PAUSE) It's hard to describe but I mean what kind of set this up last night was... So my sister in law just got a job which is fantastic. [00:05:55]</p>

<p>She's got a job at the school you know in the town that she lives in which is like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's been working for the last year and a half. She's been doing an online education program. Like, she's the one who's married to a soldier. They have been separated. He's got real issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They've got a toddler. Have I told you about her? I think I have but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:06:21)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But basically she's in this situation where she's married. Her husband's pretty unreliable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She can't guarantee that he'll be able to support their kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she has to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has to find a career. And she is really young. They got married when they were 20. She had a kid when she was 22. She's like 24 now. And it was like, we were all like, "Oh Gee! They're pregnant! No!" (LAUGHTER) It was the worst idea ever but actually like being a mother I think has been incredibly good for her. She just grew up really fast. [00:07:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yeah has worked really hard to get her shit together. But you know she got a good job and I'm really jealous of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I've... And I'm also right now really scared about what the next year is going to look like and you know whether I will be able to support myself at all. So (PAUSE) I thought, "God, I'm so scared about what's going to happen. Oh, but good news for someone." So I was like. I asked James if he'd heard about Jessica's new job and which he hadn't. She posted it on Facebook and he doesn't use Facebook. So I know everything about her and he doesn't. And he's like, "That's fantastic." And he said, "I wonder how that's going to affect Vivienne," who's her sister and is not working now and is really in a slump. [00:08:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Yeah I wonder how that's going to affect me. I'm trying not to be jealous here." And he was like, "Yeah it's okay to be jealous, I think." And I was like, "Yeah it's okay. It's just not very pleasant." And he was like, "Okay. I'm just..." That was when he like, "I can't do this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like. I was, to him it seemed like I was bent on not letting myself feel this way when all you know what we've talked about as like when I've described to him what you and I are talking about is don't do that. Like, it's not... Don't push the emotions away. So... [00:08:57]</p>

<p>So, what I was actually doing in that case was kind of trying to introduce a way to talk about how I was feeling because I was anxious about talking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:09:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I suspect that the really tough part is not the jealousy per se but it's the guilt about feeling jealous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I don't think that it's you're so green with envy that you just can bear it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I'm really very happy with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's more like you feel like some guilt, I mean some jealousy and then you're really getting ready to tee off on yourself for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. (PAUSE) So anyway, you know, we talked about it and I kind of said, "You know sometimes when I bring things up in that way... Sometimes it's because I am trying to talk about the way I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:10:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel like I'm allowed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, it's hard for me to bring it up. And sometimes I just can't face feeling like acknowledging emotions because it will just be overwhelming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So you're trying to entre (ph) into a topic about your feeling jealous, about your worries about the next year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All sorts of things like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you're, you're kind of putting yourself out there in a risky way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean not because you're worried about his reaction exactly but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's any time I say things like that to anybody (inaudible at 10:53).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah right. Like you're kind of (PAUSE) saying like, "Okay I'm going to take up some emotional space here with this. I'm leery about that." Like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I think he got that, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was a good talk. I felt like much much better afterwards so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) So (LAUGHTER) before that yesterday I was... I had been anxious, you know occasionally, to the point of panic that you were going to stop working with me because I am not getting better. [00:11:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) You know... I recognize that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're letting me know that you're worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're letting me know that you're worried</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I thought it was important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know that's actually how therapy works, generally. I think so. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have your worries been? What are you thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that I feel like in the... Or I think that probably in the larger scope, things are getting better for me to some degree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, James said that I think that's probably the case. [00:12:59]</p>

<p>But I have a really hard time seeing anything beyond the 24 hour span that I'm living in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I... You know the last few days, you know I cut myself. I was suicidal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was kind of right back down there. (PAUSE) And talking with you on Monday didn't really help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also got the sense on Monday both talking to you during the day and at night that you kind of didn't really know what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which that, you know, may be making a signal out of noise or not. (LAUGHTER) [00:13:59]</p>

<p>But I don't know how I jumped from there to the other. [00:14:01] (PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From?</p>

<p>CLIENT: From feeling like you didn't know what to do to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess feeling, imaging that you were going to be too overwhelmed by this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And have you had... Ss this kind of a general feeling or worry? Do you have sort of fantasies about people or scenarios in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, if I... If I start to picture a scenario I immediately say, "Oh well no. That's no really... That wouldn't happen." [00:15:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A scenario like what? That won't happen but still like it could be useful to know what you, you start to worry about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like you saying, "I'm sorry. I think you should see someone else."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I'm sorry. I think you should go elsewhere."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And part of this is that I don't know what happens when patients, you know, when a patient therapist relationship isn't helping the patient and that becomes apparent to the therapist but not to not the patient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:15:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I don't know what you do. And... (PAUSE) You know, I don't want to be in a situation where, you know, where I'm kind of wasting both of our times, not that I think we are but I don't want that to happen. But I don't... I don't know how I would recognize that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like, I feel like meeting with Dr. Heitz  hasn't been really useful for the last couple of months. Just because I've only met with him once every two weeks. And it's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not really what to do other than me telling him where I am at that moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's kind of all that is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like, you know he's very good and we have a very good relationship and it was very helpful for a while to work with him. And so I don't... I just don't know what... [00:17:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what happens with that. (PAUSE) But it's kind of like, as soon as the thought entered my head, I was like, "Oh God. No." (LAUGHTER) And so you know then that's something else to obsess over. You should have seen how (inaudible at 00:17:43).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. (PAUSE) [00:18:01]</p>

<p>I think (PAUSE) I think this is terribly scary and difficult for you. [00:19:03]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) I mean people in general and un- in generally uncanny ways construct therapy in terms of (PAUSE) the issues they're conflicted about. But I think the way that that's working for you is around your ambivalence about kind of taking up emotional space. Like on one hand of being in so much pain and in so need of, in so much in need of you know someone or talking to people and being able to put out there how you feel, really how you feel, and really what's going on. [00:20:03]</p>

<p>And yet, you're scared to death of that. And you feel that like (inaudible) burden's going to walk away. Or that, in a more subtle or more gross fashion won't be able to sort of stay there with you with it. You know like, either by literally stopping the conversation or relating to platitudes. You know, anything else that involved not taking in what you're talking about. And you feel so guilty I think about (PAUSE) wanting to take up that kind of space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (LAUGHTER) [00:20:57]</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:20:03)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (PAUSE) Yeah so so guilty for it, I think. And that's... (PAUSE) That's really hard to bear. I mean, because (PAUSE) it does (PAUSE) seem increasingly to me that like (PAUSE) [00:22:05]</p>

<p>...you're feeling guilty about things that you want or need or have, you know plays very centrally to what's going on with you that on the one hand in something you're feeling anxious and start to feel and on the other side it's something you'll start to cause to punish yourself devastatingly. And I think what you're doing is, yeah, bringing it up in terms of your worries about therapy. Honestly, I suspect that there's probably a bit of ambivalence in your wish that there's a part of you that's terrified that I'm going to say that, "Well yeah you know? This isn't working." And I'm just unilaterally telling you that. Then I'm going to kind of walk away. [00:23:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you mean walk away?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the other side of ambivalence. Is that, I think on another level I know it's not super consciously what you want. I think it would be a relief for you. I think it would be devastating but I think you wouldn't have to worry so much about burdening me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is an anxious and difficult process and I think mostly that's, you don't want out. But I could imagine that there's some part of you that's like, "At least that way, I wouldn't have to deal with this any more." (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I worry less about burdening you than anybody else. [00:24:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that doesn't mean it goes away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. My impression is that you were, yeah, anxious, upset, guilty, or worried about calling me the other night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably the more so if you felt like I didn't know what to say about what was going on.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I mean... You know, the comfortable part of being alone is that, you know, I don't have to worry about the fact that I'm having (ph) other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I know (inaudible at 00:25:39) What does happen when, you know (PAUSE) you know, when a patient is not being helped and does not realize this or doesn't feel like they can say that or... [00:26:05]</p>

<p>I mean because, my experience from the other patients, which is, you know, pretty extensive is that most people don't know that it's okay to find another therapist if it's not working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people are afraid to do that and won't do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm. Like, because they feel sort of guilty or loyal or disempowered in some way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Disempowered especially. Yeah. It's awfulness. This woman was in the hospital with me who had, you know, was kind of in and out a lot for alcoholism and other things. [00:27:09]</p>

<p>And her, the therapist, the person she was working with like on a regular basis was like one of the people on staff. And she told me one day, right before our meeting. She was like, "I hate him" She was like, "He bullies me and he doesn't listen to me and it doesn't work." And I was like, "Tell him that you want to see somebody else!" (LAUGHTER) Like, stand up for yourself! (inaudible at 00:27:31)</p>

<p>I tried to say, "No. That's your right. That's your responsibility even. Like, you are in charge of this relationship. Like this is something that you can do." And she just couldn't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She just couldn't say anything. [00:27:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would have advised her a little different because it's... (PAUSE) If in fact that's what was going on, that he wasn't listening to her and was by any reasonable standard bullying her, I entirely agree with you that she should have gotten the fuck out of there and found somebody else. But it can be (PAUSE) at least sort of in principle like, I think it would have been really important for them to have a conversation about it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm Hmm. [00:29:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I mean, (inaudible at 00:29:17) is remarkably sort of difficult to disentangle and... It's certainly possible that she was misreading or misunderstanding or that they were having some mutual misunderstanding of what was going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was at least significantly a function of where she was coming from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying that to try and blame her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I understand completely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that's part of what was going on, Aâ€”it's the point of the therapy that she should learn about it, and Bâ€”it's probably going to happen or at least have a very significant effect on what happens in her next treatment too. [00:30:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I mean, when I've switched therapists...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's most often been either because I didn't feel like they were keeping up or because I didn't... (PAUSE) I felt like we were just moving past each other. You know and I was saying, "I feel like this is happening." Not that you're not keeping up because that's mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like, yeah. And I try to work through and then say, "You know I really don't think this is working."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:31:01)</p>

<p>But I don't know what happens from the other side.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean like if it seems to me that the treatment doesn't seem to be helping and yet that doesn't seem clear to them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you asking me in part if I were to think that how would you get warning at when to bat (ph) at some point? I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe not. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I mean Dr. Vaughn you know a few months ago said...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You know let's... Let's have... I'm going to refer you to somebody."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so she's still my primary person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This was the consultation you had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I did have a consultation with somebody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you told me about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt like this was in part because she was like, "I'm not really sure where to go from here. I need another pair of eyes."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Et cetera. But you know, the kind of medical side of things seems different. I don't know. (PAUSE) I guess I just see people who go to therapy for years and from admittedly like a very much an outsider's perspective...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it seems like they're not getting anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know how that happens.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>But you know I tend to be pretty focused on results anyway. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well... (PAUSE) [00:33:01]</p>

<p>[00:34:01]</p>

<p>I think... (PAUSE) I think there must be something at the moment that's really like worrying you a lot. This is reminding me of a time a few months ago where I felt like you were asking me a question in a way that felt similar (PAUSE) though I'm not sure a lot... I feel like I have some sense of the reasons why but not all of them. [00:35:11]</p>

<p>So, you had asked me maybe a few weeks after we had started working together something, you wanted to know like something about why I did this kind of work, I think. And I think you were sort of worried about starting with me and how I was going to respond and what was going to happen and just and worried about talking about all sort of awful stuff that you were feeling and that was happening. [00:35:49]</p>

<p>And I felt like this sort of powerful experience of kind of you know like on a news show where they're like, "And now, over to you." [00:36:01] (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>And (LAUGHTER) I feel like that a little bit as far as the question you're asking me now. On the heels of telling me you're worried, I guess, that we're not getting anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think there's a... I don't really know where to go from the last thing. Yeah, I'm scared shitless right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like at this moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Less of this moment than like over the past couple of days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah right now also applies. Just so you know I'm doing the intellectual distancing to some degree and also like I'm... I guess I'm just trying to ask about like the way that mental health care works because it's something that I'm in and have to put my faith in and I have no idea how it works really. And so yeah. [00:37:21]</p>

<p>You know, I don't and I trust you and so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're asking me... (inaudible at 00:37:35)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's partly a way to dodge a question and to ask a bigger question in some ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The bigger question being?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, should I trust this system?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see. Like, part of the invitation of what you're asking about is like, "Look. Gosh. I've seen the people who were in therapy forever and seemingly getting nowhere and whose therapist didn't seem to do anything about it and that seems untrustworthy to me so (PAUSE) what's your take on it? [00:38:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You also don't have to answer. Like. (LAUGHTER) I have friends who are therapists who aren't you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can ask them what they do with their patients.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (LAUGHTER) I mean I, if I thought that was going on, or there are times I've felt, when something like that's going on, I would just bring it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:39:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You came here for X. It isn't really happening. I think you know like there's some things I think maybe going on always getting in the way. You know. Are you? It seems like you may be getting Y but that's not really X which is what you came here for. Like. Just bring it up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That seems simple. [00:39:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (PAUSE) I guess I have a question that I'll throw out there although we probably don't have too much time for it now and then some thoughts. I guess (inaudible at 00:40:15) like (PAUSE) you know, I may be missing it but to me it seems like... (PAUSE) I think it goes further for you as far as therapy than just being worried about taking up emotional space. I think that's a big worry that you have and it's one that's pretty close to your mind a lot of the time. [00:41:01]</p>

<p>I think there's an additional one that, that's big or is bigger. Which is...</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I think you're worried that this will work. I think you seem to target to some extent things that are helpful or make you feel satisfied or successful or proud or (PAUSE) at ease. Not all of them. Not all the things that do that. [00:41:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you're probably right about that. I'm not... I hadn't thought about that in terms of therapy specifically but I think yeah. I'm pretty conflicted, you know because I... At least to me it's... Yeah as I said before it's really hard to think about and talk about. But if I get... If I feel good about myself (PAUSE) that Aâ€”it makes me much for vulnerable and B is it's false.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not, that's not where I belong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and you told me the other night. In a way, I think it's one of the things you called to tell me although it came up in sort of a (inaudible 00:43:09) way. Things actually got bad when you had the stuff you wanted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what you said earlier today about. (inaudible) You know, the world was going to end if I didn't get stuff done. I hear that as partly a... (PAUSE)</p>

<p>The fantasy that you needed to have to be able to do something that really was for yourself was that really you were saving the world. [00:44:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that sounds like guilt about being able to do for yourself to me. There are other aspects to it and so forth but that's a piece of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm Hmm. Yeah if I don't like a professor, my motivation to do well in that class just plummets. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The question I have and I guess I'll just have to leave you with it and we can come back to it tomorrow (inaudible at 00:44:43) I've wondered what gave that impression and I'm not saying that's not true but I'm just wondering what conveyed to you a sense that I didn't know what to say or do on Monday. What it was that I did or said or what felt like an error or was sort of conveying that.[00:45:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Do we need to stop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop in a minute. So, if you have a quick answer that's fine or we can talk more about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The quick answer is that I'm not sure that I can articulate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you have another thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No not really. I mean, it was kind of tone and posture.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. More so than content. Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see you tomorrow but then not Monday right? I think I mentioned I'm out Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're out Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I not say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You did say that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. We can talk schedule (inaudible).</p>

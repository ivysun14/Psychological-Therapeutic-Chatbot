<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And what was done about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I was put into like this place, like a treatment center.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.  Was it in [DEIDENTIFIED] or somewhere else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], and there was another different place, but I don't remember what it was called.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I knew you stayed there one week each of the time roughly, give or take.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I think I stayed there for like a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I could think about a month one time and then the next time I stayed there for a long time, because I, I switched to different areas of the place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Roughly what, six months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably like two or three months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two or three months, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was still, I don't really remember exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't?  Did the treatment help you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean they put me on medication, but then that didn't work, so then I stopped taking the medicine.  And then, um, my mom and dad got divorced, so then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old were you when that happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like [AGE], not [AGE], they were, they got separated, whenever I was like [AGE] or something like that.  But then, yeah, but when I moved back down here to [DEIDENTIFIED], then I just stopped doing everything, like, when I moved in with my Grandma, I just stopped taking medication and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old were you when that happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I was, from all the way from when I was like [AGE] all the way till I was like [AGE], like I moved back and forth all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but finally you said you moved in with Grandma and you stopped doing everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that was like when I was about [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, then no more treatment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, but then I moved back with my mom, but then I moved back with my Grandma.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're kind of back —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Back and forth between mom and Grandmother.  Grandmother is mom's mother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, and, uh, what happened subsequently, you started taking some treatment, different medication, counseling, when did you start, how did you start?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Again?  Like the next time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, about two years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A year and a half to two years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I just started, um, getting like real depressed again, and like, um, just started going through like mood changes, like with like a, within a split second, like, um, I could just be like happy and then I'll just get all mad, and I'll just go back to being happy, or then I'll just start crying.  Just like, I would just, started going through all these —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All these mood changes in the same day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did any of these moods last longer than a day?  Either happy mood or sad mood —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or crying mood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like sometimes —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's the longest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The longest, like about three or four days, like I would just be mad or sometimes I would be like just crying for like, like two days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like all the time, but then I would get like, I would just be like, then I would just be like really, really, really happy, and then everyone would be like, "Why are you so happy, you were just mad, but" —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long did that last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just do that.  Um, like a couple of days.  It just depends, like it's different all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you can never tell what kind of mood you're going to be the next minute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or like if, um, it just depends on how, and then it's, it's like sometimes I'll just wake up, just like real angry and then I'll just be angry like all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you do when you get angry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does it show?  In your behavior.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How does it show?  Um, I like yell, or like, I'll like throw something, or just, or sometimes when I'm really, really at my worst, I'll just like, just start, like, like, just throwing everything in my room or stuff like that, and just yelling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you break things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or put holes in the walls?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've done both.  I've, uh, but a long time, well not a long time ago, about a year ago, like, I'll get mad, I would just scratch myself.  I mean it's not funny, but I would get so angry I would just like, you know, like take my nail, just like scratch my whole body to where like my face, and my arms, and my legs, and my stomach were just like totally wrecked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean that's a reaction to anger or is this a reaction that you wanted to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that was a reaction to anger.  I used to be so mad, like I didn't know what else to do, so I would just like scratch everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So this about, started about two years ago and that's when —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You started, uh, seeing the doctor —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] you said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is a psychiatrist you said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  There was one that would in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?  What town is he in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, at the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then there's a, a psychiatrist that goes in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean counselor, like an MD?  I don't know.  Okay.  Who prescribes your medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], okay —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably in contact with the counselor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah, and it was, because, she had to prescribe them, because it was so hard there to get into appointments and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So and then I had to try to get into to see a psychiatrist, but then, um, I didn't have any more insurance, so then I had to wait again, so finally —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] is the one who like, uh, got me to talk to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So right now are you taking these medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Except for the Paxil, because the Paxil, I'll take it every now and then, because it's just, I just hate it; it just makes me like, like, it just, like I just sit there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know how to put it, like I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sit there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It makes you feel like, describe what it makes you feel like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It makes me real nauseated and just I can't, it just, I don't like it at all.  So I was thinking maybe there's something else, but the Paxil, it's just horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, the other 2 medicines you're taking are what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't really know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think she's like [AGE] or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and your biological father?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know how old he is.  I don't even know him.</p>

So, in two weeks, I'll make an appointment and, please sir, thank you, bye.  Sorry about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, sorry, where were we?  How many siblings you have?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> These are full?  And all older than you, younger than you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One older, one younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're right in the middle, okay.  Anybody in your blood relatives, uh, aunts, uncles, cousins, uh, siblings on either side of your, I know you said you don't know a whole lot about your biological father, but, uh, anybody have any diagnosis of psych or mental?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I know that my dad is bipolar schizophrenic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does that mean to you, bipolar?  What does that word mean to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, that's just what my doctors told me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my mom had told me that's what my doctors said you were a long time ago, so, I mean I know it means like, I don't really know.  Like mood changes or something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Uh, I'll explain it to you in a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, anybody else you know of in your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anybody, uh, substance abuse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Alcohol or drugs, or both?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Both, my, he, I know he was like a really bad alcoholic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let me ask you a few questions to check your memory and your concentration, okay?  Some of the questions there's no right or wrong answer, whatever comes to your mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, first of all I'm going to tell you three words, I want you to repeat each one with me and try to remember them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Brown, say it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Brown.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Honesty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Honesty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tulip.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tulip.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, how many hours of sleep do you get with the temazepam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With it, I'll probably get like about five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Without it?  None, well without it I'll stay up till like 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning, and wake up like 7:00 or 8:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  And your appetite has, has it increased —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's increased.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Increased, stayed the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's increased, I've gained like 12 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In about, I don't know, like two or three months, but what happens is it goes up, like when I start eating a lot, when I get really, really stressed out or depressed or whatever, I eat like, I overeat.  And then whenever I start doing okay, like, of course I'll stop and then I'll go down and go up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Energy, too much, too little?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have no energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does it fluctuate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why I'm like really —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does it fluctuate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah it fluctuates, because like sometimes I get really hyper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you have more energy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, your sex drive, does it fluctuate based on your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I don't really have a sex drive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have any.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, well now, because I just don't like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did it ever happen to you, that when you're out by yourself, nobody around you,  do you every hear voices or noises that other people don't hear?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, except no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> During sex?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because, that's what I mean, it's, I don't know, no, I just, one time I had [INAUDIBLE], my other doctor, like whenever, just one time, not one time, but a couple of times, like I was like probably in the bathtub, not bathtub, like in the shower and then like I was like washing my hair, whatever, and then like, I thought that I was having conversation with my daughter.  And then my mom was like, "Who are you talking to, like what are you talking about?"  I was like, "Well wasn't she right there?"  Like I actually like thought I was talking to her.  I don't know, that's why I don't like to tell that story though because it's kind of weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, weird or not I think I need to know the symptoms to treat you the best way I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about feelings of paranoia, thinking people are out to get you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the only thing, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or they get you for no reason?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That like, I just always feel like, like, I don't know, I just always feel like I'm really paranoid all the time, especially now it's getting where that if I'm driving, like I'm just real paranoid or I'm always thinking like someone's like, um, like watching me or people are following me, or if I go out into public, I always think like people are like talking about me or like I just feel paranoid lately.  Real nervous, nervous and paranoid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People talking about you?  Or is that plotting against you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, talking and then, but when I'm driving by myself, I think like someone's like in the back seat or something, someone's trying to like get me or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get you, you mean kill you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but that's only like when I'm by myself.  And I now have like this little ritual that I've been doing, like if I'm by myself, I'll go around and like lock both of the locks, and then I'll go to my room, I'll go into my room and then I'll lock that door and then I'll come back out and then I'll lock the bathroom door, because it connects to my room.  And then I'll come back out again and make sure that that bathroom, I mean that the front door is locked, and then I have to keep checking that the locks are locked, because I keep thinking like someone's in there, but there's really not, you know.  I'm just kind of weird these days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever felt that the television or radio is sending some kind of special messages just intended for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, okay, um, what day is today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The day is Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The date?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> July.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> '09.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I want you to subtract 3 from 20 and keep subtracting 3 from the number you get going backwards out loud.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three from 20?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh, 20 minus 3.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that will be 17.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 0.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  How are apples and oranges alike?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're fruits.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A table and a chair?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're furniture.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Airplane and a bicycle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Transportation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who's our president now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Obama.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And who was before him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bush.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Before him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Clinton?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember, I remember Clinton.  I mean not Clinton, that was dumb.  Uh, I don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well he wasn't too dumb, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I don't know, I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I want some of the names of five large cities anywhere in America.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What was the question?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five large cities, big cities anywhere in America.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [DEIDENTIFIED], is that a big city?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Dallas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How many more do I need?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One more.  Um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very good.  If you are walking on the street and on the street, you find lying down on the street an addressed, stamped, sealed envelope, what are you going to do with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Put it, I'd probably just leave it there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And those three words I asked you to remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, brown —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Brown, tulip, and healthy?  Right?  What do you mean?  I thought it was brown, tulip, and healthy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, brown, tulip are the same ones, but the third one has, it has the same meaning as being truthful, but it's a different word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, honesty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said healthy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now let me explain this to you, what bipolar means.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, we all have good days and bad days; some days are good, the other days are not as good.  So that normal fluctuation in the mood is, uh, is not a psychotic diagnosis, it's, no treatment is needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if somebody's mood is going down to where his health falls, if you put it on the map, this is going south.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Meaning, uh, their mood is sad, they feel down, depressed all day long, day in and day out, day after day after day.  They have practically no energy, their sleep and appetite are either too much or too little, uh, they're feeling hopeless, they feel helpless, uh, they feel guilty, they can't make decisions, and unfortunately somehow these individuals who have a major depression, attempt and some even actually do kill themselves.  This is a major depressive episode in mental depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If the same individual has another episode sometime later in their lifetime, this is major depressive episode number two, sometime another episode number three, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is not bipolar; this is a major depression that's recurring, meaning keeps happening time after time, after time, after time.  Whereas in bipolar individuals they have the similar kind of depressions, but sometime in their lifetime, uh, usually after the depression, which happens first, but sometimes it can even happen before, their mood goes the other way, the exact opposite way.  They feel euphoric, if you know what that means.  Euphoric, they feel extremely happy for no reason —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they feel like they're on the top of the world, they can, uh, um, they have bundles of energy —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't need to sleep, it's not they can't sleep, they don't need it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If they keep loads of sleep they can keep on going like the Energizer bunny for the next 22 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I understand this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They feel grandiose, they feel too much of themselves, they indulge in activities which are potentially dangerous, but they still do it anyway, like, uh, spending sprees, shopping sprees, spend the money they don't have.  Um, and there are sexual indiscretions, uh, having sex with multiple partners, substance abuse, all these activities, they know that they're going to get them in trouble, but they do it anyway.  They can't control it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're highly impulsive, they act before they think, uh, these are the, the mind is racing, you know, it's, uh, going too fast for them and they can't, uh, calm it down and that's when they don't sleep, they, they're talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, you know, then nobody can interrupt them from talking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even when they're talking, they don't really, uh, stick to one subject, they jump from one topic to another topic to another topic.  This is called a manic, manic episode.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If somebody has one manic episode sometime in their lifetime, it's called bipolar, if it's a full blown mania, meaning lasting at least a week without treatment it's called bipolar I.  But if they have some of the symptoms, but not as severe, but and they're less dysfunctional, lasting less number of days, meaning maybe four, that's called bipolar II.  But sometimes they have some symptoms, but they don't fit into I or II, meaning mania, hypomania, then we call them bipolar, they do have the symptoms —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they can't fit into either category, so they're not otherwise specified, uh, bipolar definitely keep, have to keep in mind, and the, these, sometimes the moods, they do usually have a period of time in between mania or depression where they don't feel either symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're asymptomatic, no symptoms what so ever.  But some people have the symptoms of mania and depression, the same day, it's called a mixed episode, and, uh, usually with bipolar individuals, they have their mood shift from one pole to the other pole, or with the person with mania, about four to six times a year.  Um, actually four, if it is more than four times a year, they're called a rapid cyclers.  So, here again in, uh, picture wise —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He sees the symptoms of the depression, that's what it looks like, and it is the same depression here in the bipolar [INAUDIBLE], but the rest of them are the manic symptoms.  Looking at this and from what I told you, and what you understood from what I told you, do you think you have these kinds of symptoms in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.  Yeah, well I have been looking it, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like both of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Both of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Both, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think you have more depressed episodes or more manic episodes, or are they 50/50?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like 50/50, 50/50.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifty, fifty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I would say that your main diagnosis at this point is bipolar disorder and uh, the symptoms of inattention and lack of concentration, and impulsivity are kind of common both for bipolar disorder and ADHD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They, both groups of people have the symptoms, so it's kind of very thin line.  But if you, there's this concern that you may be bipolar in addition to ADHD, we should not treat the ADHD with the ADHD medication until we get the bipolar symptoms under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because the ADHD medications can make, actually make the bipolar symptoms worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we better make sure we're getting a handle —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On your bipolar symptoms first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so we had history of alcohol and cocaine problems —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  And you said you have asthma, okay.  Did, uh, the doctor do a blood test to check your lithium level?  Do you have anything about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've done that once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know what the number was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't know the numbers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know the numbers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But it was a while ago though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was like a long time ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, if you are not happy with the, uh, Paxil, the way it's making you feel, um, there alternatives.  Paxil, for some reason, does tend to make people gain weight and some people, it makes them sleepy, and the way you're describing, you're having your "blah" like feeling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's just horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't want it to do that.  Um, okay, we'll really continue the lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably you need more than, uh, 900 mg, but I don't want to increase the dose until I know where your blood level is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, the lithium works best between 0.4 and 1.2 for, if you are floridly acutely manic, I need to get you to the level of 1.0.  If you are, uh, intermittent, it can be anywhere about 4 and 6.7; this is in the circulation, in the blood circulation.  Uh, the only way to figure out to what the level, to do the blood test —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's no other way to find out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I want you to take the medicine regularly at least for 5 days and then do the blood test.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you do the blood test, I want you to be fasting from midnight, nothing to eat or drink after midnight or no, breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No medicine in the morning until they get the blood from you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, I really don't know, I just said, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So like when will, I have like, when will I see you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to come back in four weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless there's some problems and you need to come sooner, you can always —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I think that like, um, I don't know, like if I could come like in two weeks, or can I say that or no?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh sure you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure you can say that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean just for this time and then we'll see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure, sure, sure, I don't have a problem.  And actually I can recommend for you to somebody who you can see every week to talk to counseling wise if you are interested.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, I don't need that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'm real —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The best treatment for any major mental manic psychiatric diagnosis is bio—psycho—social mental treatment.  Biological, we use medications, psychological counseling, and social needs, if they have any social deficits; they need to be addressed too.  Again, we can talk more about it and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have to commit yourself one way or the other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But keep your mind open.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Open to that kind of treatment also, don't shut it down, don't, don't close the door.  Lexapro, have you ever taken Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's, uh, Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, Lexapro, they all come in the same group of medicines called SSRI, that's serotonin antidepressants.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lexapro supposedly has, um, least amount of side effects and same amount of beneficial effects than the others.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, let me give you that to help you with your depressed mood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now how, now this is really, really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Please do ask, you're here to ask questions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well last week, well because I had to run out of my temazepam, but I got some now, but, um, I was having trouble sleeping so my friend, she gave me some, um, I haven't taken them though, because I wasn't sure, because I don't do good with stuff like, she gave me some Xanax, so is that going to, I still have all of them, because I didn't, I was scared to take them.  But is that really help you sleep?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, well, even, even if it helps you sleep, Xanax is a very tricky medication in that, uh, it's very habit forming, more than the others that come in the same group of medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's not like a sleep aid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The reason being, no it's not a sleep aid, it's an antianxiety medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, that's what I was wondering, I was like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The reason it's more so habit forming is because it's such a short acting drug.  Uh, half life, what that means is the amount of time the body takes to eliminate half of the drug —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is, it's called half life, but Xanax is three hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no wonder why they —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So after those hours you usually feel that you need, in three or four hours you need the next dose to have symptom control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I was just wondering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But as the temazepam for example, the half life is about, uh, 15, 20 hours, you sleep all through the night, uh, Xanax is really habit forming, it has a street value to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, I don't want it then, no, she just gave it to me, but, um, I haven't taken any of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The bar, the bar sells for $5 and the blue football sells for $2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So don't, the Xanax is a solid alcohol, they call it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's no different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, just wondering, I just thought of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you mind if you give me one more signature there?</p>

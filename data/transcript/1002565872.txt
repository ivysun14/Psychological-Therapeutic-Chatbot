<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so, um, so you got all kinds of stuff going on then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, with school starting and the boys are leaving for a week vacation with Dad and Grandpa.  They're going to go driving to Disneyland.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I mean that's, I don't know how they're going to do it.  It'll be a good eye opener for both of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm kind of bummed because it's, I wanted to be there the first time they go to Disneyland.  That was like my thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I thought it was kind of interesting he chose that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, he's been doing a lot of these what I call one ups.  Whatever he knows that would affect me the most, he tries to do one up of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So if I bought the boys a pair of shoes, he'll buy them shoes that are more expensive, that are identical, and he'll just, he'll keep doing that to kind of like well mine are better, mine are better.  That just drives me crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I got to a point where I'm just trying to ignore that, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, what else are you going to do, and he knows Disneyland or Disney World was my big thing, dream vacation with the kids, so he chose that.  I mean before they had been going to Mt.  Rushmore and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you can take them to Disney World then, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hope that someday if I get the money to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so I'm just been really stressed, really irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The last 2 weeks, 3 weeks, going through the same patterns of not needing much sleep and then now this week it's like I can't wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much sleep are you getting now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the past 4 or 5 days, I've been getting about 9 hours of sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, and still feel tired when you wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and then before that, last week, it was like 4 hours of sleep, couldn't go to sleep, and then when I finally go to sleep, it'd be 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and then I'd have to get up usually by 7:00 or 8:00, bring the kids [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you were then getting from 3:00 to 4:00 to 7:00 or 8:00, so you're only getting about 4 hours a night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Four hours a night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And were you tired then when you woke up or do you have energy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I woke up just feeling the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that was how long ago that that was happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was about a week ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that lasted for a few days, um, just really short periods of sleep and fine, during the day doing stuff.  I mean I don't know if I'm more irritable during the day or not, it's hard to tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it's really been trying being home with the kids during summer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because there's 3 and [NAME OTHER] right now is way out of control with his behavior.  He's real disrespectful.  He causes problems all the time, and yesterday he almost got thrown out of a swimming lesson because he wouldn't stop splashing the other kids or trying to dunk his brother, which I shouldn't have put them in the same class, but that's what they had available, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I didn't think twice about it, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That shouldn't be a problem normally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no.  I mean the teacher actually had him, had [NAME OTHER] get out and come and get me to have to, to find a way to control [NAME OTHER] because he wouldn't stay on the wall or do his part and he was getting in the way of the other kids learning their lesson.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, and then he took off.  He was supposed to, we were supposed to leave, and he took off and went back into the pool while we were all getting dressed in the locker room and then left, came out and there he's still in the pool.  And so I'm having a lot of trouble with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Who's his doctor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, her name's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we have done, I mean for years, gone through different doctors and tried different medications.  He's been on pretty much everything, and we just started this Depakote thing because his aggression got really high with Lamictal and what's the other thing.  I don't remember what else he took.  Um, and so we thought the Depakote was going to help, but I'm just seeing this, he's real easily agitated too—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he just likes to pick on people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just all day, it's just na, na, na, na.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Hopefully she finds something that'll help him calm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] what about during that time when you were not sleeping as much, um, how was your mood during that time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it depends.  Sometimes it's just regular and normal.  If I have the kids, I'm too, like I said, I'm really irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I don't have that stress around me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood's okay even when you're not sleeping much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The moods.  Well, I don't know, I guess it goes up and down.  Sometimes I feel really low.  Sometimes I feel really hyper and, and, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are there times where your mood's like above average, where it's like your feeling is euphoric or elated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, where, where I've got a lot of energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, where I've got a lot of energy and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More than average?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll give you an example.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went to a, um, I wanted to buy a mountain bike.  I went to, we had, I had looked at other Wal—Marts, um, before, so I thought they had the same bikes, the same, all the same stores, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I went to the one up in [DEIDENTIFIED] and it was about 11:00 at night.  Um, I just decided I needed to go grocery shopping then.  So I went and I looked for the bike and it wasn't there.  They didn't have that model.  So I decided that well, I'm up.  I don't have children and so I went to each Wal—Mart to see which one had it.  I ended up going to the one in [DEIDENTIFIED], the one on [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I drove all the way down to the one on, I think it's [DEIDENTIFIED] or way down there because that's where I saw it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so by 2:30 in the morning I was down there buying my own bike.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Holy cow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I texted, um, [NAME OTHER] who was working at [DEIDENTIFIED] right by there and that's his shift.  He works at night and, um, he's like what are you doing out at 2:30 in the morning buying a mountain bike.  I don't know.  So, you know, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm very active after about 11:00.  I don't know if it's because the kids go to sleep and now I feel like I have time to myself, but I get really, um, I just start doing stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're more active at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mornings are horribly hard to get up for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you having any racing thoughts where your mind is going really fast?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lately yeah.  Yeah, I've had a lot of, um, I got a lot on my plate right now, just school starting, trying to find a job.  Still haven't committed to my health insurance, Cobra, which the deadline is the [DATE].  What I'm trying to do is find a job that has health insurance so I don't have to back pay all of that.  It's over $1,000 and I didn't even use it because I'm trying to find something first, um, or at least get on a new plan so I don't have to start, you know, back pay all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, my car started going out because it had 155,000 miles on it, and you could tell the transmission wasn't working.  So I ended up trading that in last week and got something else that I could afford.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and, you know, there's just stuff [INAUDIBLE] going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, what I'm wondering about, are you having bipolar kind of mood swings almost.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I feel like.  I mean one minute I'm just fine.  Even [NAME OTHER] has noticed.  He's like you're, you're fine when you don't have a lot of stress mainly, when I've just got too much to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he tells me, he's like quit looking for a job, quit trying to do this, just relax and try to get through the summer and it's too hard.  I can't do that.  So, um, you know, like one minute I'll be really doing well one day and then the next day I'm just, like right now, I'm all over [NAME OTHER] about he needs to stop this and that and I catch myself going on a tangent and just, he's like why are you giving him this long speech?  He's [AGE].  He's not going to get it, but I do.  It's like I guess I'm, I put him in Tai Kwon Do because I'm hoping that he'll learn this respect thing and [NAME OTHER] picked it up.  He's got it.  He knows what he's to do.  But [NAME OTHER] is just, that's him, and it's his mental condition too I think that you just can't get through to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about, are there times, when you're, you know those times where you're not sleeping as much and your energy level's higher and your mood's higher, are you eating less—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or does your appetite stay the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right now my appetite is higher than normal.  I mean normal being, what normally it's like I usually eat, I have some coffee when I wake up and then one meal, and then maybe a snack later in the day.  I don't have much of an appetite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the past few days when I've been doing more sleeping, I've been eating more I've noticed, like I'll wake up hungry which is not normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, what about during those times where you don't sleep as much and maybe you go out shopping and buy a mountain bike at 2:30 in the morning—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, do you do other things more impulsively?  Do you do more spending, more shopping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably yeah because when I went into each Wal—Mart, I bought something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And even if it, I mean it was something small, but, um, like I had found something to go on the bike, a bottle holder or something.  Well, I'll get it here in case they don't have it at the other one.  I know I want it here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I'll do, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you drive more aggressively during those times, faster or more aggressively?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not where I'm speeding or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does your sex drive go up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, during those times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh, okay.  Yeah, it does sound like you're having some, some significant mood swings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it just, I don't know.  It's really hard and I know the kids are like we can't tell what day is going to be a good day or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, one of the things we may want to think about is do we want to try a mood stabilizer to help you level off some of the ups and downs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and that's certainly something to think about because it would probably help you feel better if you had not the, not as significant up and downs.  I mean you'll still have good days and bad days, but maybe a little bit more even.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Yeah.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to think about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah because I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel, a long time actually, I felt like I'm just kind of out of control.  It's like I don't know what the day's going to bring and I get so easily frustrated and irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm feeling like back when I was working at my last job, that's what I'm feeling now.  It's that there's so much like piling on me that I'm able to do little bits and pieces of everything, and I've just kind of in a whirlwind and I can't concentrate or focus on any one thing, and it shouldn't be that difficult.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I get mad at myself because I'm like it's not that hard.  What's wrong?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why can't I just get it done?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, yeah, it sounds like it might be worth trying a mood stabilizer.  What I'm thinking is if we could find out that would not cause a lot of side effects, would stabilize your mood, also reduce the irritability—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, the ideal one would be Abilify.  You've never taken Abilify I don't believe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took it a little bit.  That was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], the one that, um, I saw after my, after I quit working at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the fibromyalgia and I had that sickness that we couldn't figure out what was wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I saw him and he, he asked me a bunch of long questions about my previous history and stuff, mentioned bipolar, but he was like, I said well I am seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm sure he would know, and he, he asked me to try it.  He gave me a couple of samples.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you remember—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I didn't try it long enough because it wasn't, I think it was only like a week and a half that I had tried it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well if you decide you want to try it again, the reasons that it might as a mood stabilizer to stabilize your mood.  It also boosts the effectiveness of antidepressants.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it might help them work more effectively, and it reduces irritability.  So it kind of targets all the symptoms you're having.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to try it and see if it would help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, because I wasn't on the nortriptyline then either.  This is way back in like January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I took it for a little bit.  The only thing I remembered taking it was, it kind of made me tired, but I don't, I don't know if that was a side effect that starts and then it goes away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it can go either way.  Some people get a boost in energy.  Some people get a decrease in energy, but usually that levels off after a week or so.  What we might do is start you on an extra low dose to start with just to try to avoid that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see if I've got some samples of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's really expensive too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, yeah, it can be now.  That's an issue especially with your insurance situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I know with [NAME OTHER] they had tried Abilify with him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And his monthly prescription with insurance is $100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, and you have the same insurance, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I'm not using it because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you're not using it at all now.  So maybe we should think about something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need to decide whether to do the Cobra.  I'm trying to get on something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  You know, maybe we should pick something that's not so expensive because it would be with, without insurance it'll be hundreds of dollars a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh gosh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I'm thinking what other options do we have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm hoping to get the insurance thing handled because like I said I'm just trying to get something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Even a prescription plan at this point.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, Lamictal just went generic.  That's one we could think about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah that's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or Topamax is generic, I believe.  Um, Depakote's generic, but I'm not a big fan of Depakote because then you have to have blood tests and all.  So it's expensive in that way, and Lithium is the cheapest, but you need blood tests with that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Does that, that causes weight gain too?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can cause weight gain.  That's another possible side effect of it.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lamictal would be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to try the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah because it did go generic and I know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It just did this month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let me get you a prescription.  I don't know how expensive it'll be, but we can see.  Hopefully it's not too expensive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You haven't heard anybody pricing it since it went generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no I don't think it is because it wasn't too bad.  Well it wasn't terrible when it was regular.  And then I know [NAME OTHER] that's, he went from Lamictal to Depakote right when this happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, does Lamictal help with the, um, irritability too?  Do you think it'll—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, indirectly in terms of it stabilizes the mood swings and as the mood swings stabilize, then people tend to feel less irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So I'll try that and then like I said, I'll try to get my health insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tried to apply with, uh, Colorado something.  It's Colorado state, um, insurance for people who can't get insurance and things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I've been waiting to hear from a broker whether she got me accepted by anybody else first, and then if not, then I'll go with that route.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, at least until you get a job that has benefits.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I, I've been searching everywhere, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm hoping that I'll hear from somebody soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I know it's a tough job market right now.  I'm hearing from a lot of people that it's really tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And you know, I'm probably not going to find much of it, but trying to find something part time that does have some medical benefits just because I have the kids—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when school starts, I have them except for every other weekend.  I have them during every school night because that was not working out before.  So now I've committed to doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which was like a catch 22, you know, I want the best for them, but at the same time, where am I going to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, match up with that time, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  I know.  Let me just show this.  There's Lamictal 25 mg.  Take 1 a day for the first 14 days, then go up to 2 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now that may not be enough.  We may have to go higher, but that, we need to stay at the 2 a day for at least a month, and then check back and see how it's working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it's working, we'll stay at the 50 mg a day.  If it's not, then we'll go up to 100.  We can even go up to 200 if we need to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But let's give this a try first, and the reason we have to increase this also [PATIENT NAME] there's, there's a rare side effect with this medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like a rash.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Rash, yes.  You know about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I heard about that, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, one, about 1 in 1,000 people can get a rash with this medicine, which means 999 out of 1,000 don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you get a rash, it's usually not serious, but you still need to stop the medicine and call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay because there is even a more rare form of the rash, of a rash the people get that can be serious, and if you were to keep taking the medicine, you could get really sick and end up in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so if you get any, I mean if you get any rash, if you're not sure, just call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Again, the chances are you won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Okay.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, uh, but if you do, just stop it and call me and we'll talk about what to do, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any questions about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, are there any other side effects?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At this dose, not usually, but there can be a few.  Occasionally a little bit of tiredness, but again not usually at this dose.  Um, occasionally people can feel like it slows down their thinking a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But again, not usually at this dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'd be better for me then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well yeah, if you have racing thoughts, it'd be a good thing to slow it down a little bit, as long as it's not too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean yeah because I catch myself thinking about stuff.  Just out of the blue, all of a sudden they'll be something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah, so hopefully it'll actually slow those down to kind of a normal level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but probably if there are going to be any side effects, a little tiredness is probably the most common one, but again, at this dose that usually doesn't happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if it does, it's usually very short term, like a day or 2 and then it goes away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you have any problems with any side effects, call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And is this the morning or night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can take it any time of day.  Um, if it's easier to remember taking in the morning, then I'd say take it in the morning.  If it does make you a little tired, then switch and take it in the evening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's equally effective.  You just want to try to take it about the same time every day, although that's not critical.  If you're taking it in the mornings and one day, it's 12:00 and you forgot to take it, go ahead and take it.  It won't hurt anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or even evening you could take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially at this low dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'll take that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And try the sample of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, any other questions about the medicine at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's leave everything else alone for now.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, what about the, um, Adderall?  Still just do like a half a tablet in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's been helping me with these mornings that I just like cannot get up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you take it even morning or just on the days where you're feeling really struggling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'll take it every morning except when I, those few times where I get very little sleep and I'm just like real energetic and I won't take it anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I try not to add any more to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the way to do it.  You don't want to on those days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'd say we can keep using it as needed.  My hope is that maybe if Lamictal works, maybe you won't need it as much because the moods may level off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, do you need another prescription for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I only got a few tablets left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before I would see you next.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Does the Xanax that I'm on, because we switched from the XR to the, the normal, what is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The immediate release?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the immediate release, um, does that, the more you take, does that calm you more down, but it makes you tired, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, that's exactly right.  You'll feel calmer, but the more you take, the more sedating it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay [INAUDIBLE] real, you know, I just take my 1 in the morning and 1 at night and just have been doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I just didn't know when I get like really flustered and overstressed, if that would help or if it would make it worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it'll probably help you feel calmer, but again, you'll also probably feel more, you may feel more tired depending on how much you take.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can try it.  Just be aware that if, especially if you're going to be driving or you got the boys or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be real careful because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really could wipe you out or you can have an accident.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's try the Lamictal and get this stabilized rather than—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's my hope.  If we can get the Lamictal working, you may need less of the other medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we get you on less medicine and feeling better is what I'm hoping we can do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Okay.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so there's the Adderall prescription.  Any other prescriptions do you need?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think that because the nortriptyline, that's all good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Okay.	"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it looks like we're good at least for another month.  So, all right, any other questions then before we set up another appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, why don't we check back in about a month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About 4 weeks actually before you run out of Lamictal to see how you're doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see, so if we start today, it'll be 1, 2, 3 4 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep, so by [DATE], a Tuesday.  So we can meet that Monday or Tuesday if that would work for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have a preference for Monday—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Tuesday would be better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, uh, morning or afternoon.  I've got like 10:00 or 10:30, or I've got like 1:00 or 1:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One thirty would be best.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One thirty, okay.  So, 1:30, or I've got like 4:00 if that's any better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, let's, let's do 4:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would be better because that would be, yeah.  [NAME OTHER] would be awake because he does his sleeping during the day when he gets home at 5:00 in the morning, he sleeps until like 2:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, Tuesday that's [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't believe school's starting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, the summer's flown by, hasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm kind of excited school's starting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think most parents are.  The kids are saying oh, I want to see my friends, but I don't want to go back to school.  Most parents are saying phew—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Trying to do everything, keeping them busy all, all summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, they've been in Tai Kwon Do this week.  They have Tao Kwon Do and swimming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's kind of a chore because their Tai Kwon Do ends 15 minutes before their swimming starts on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Wow.	"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  I didn't plan for that.  I had signed them up for Tao Kwon Do first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, then the swim lessons came available, so we just kind of went through with that, but, um, you know, it'll, it'll work out.  It's only one more week so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Yeah, yeah, you're getting through it.	"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they're staying busy, even though it seems like they're not busy enough for some reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"I don't know.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, hang in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With [NAME OTHER] I just hope I get him under control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a lot easier when the kids are doing well, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does.  Just I don't know what's changed with him, and he's [AGE] so his personality and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] or less boundaries and he's getting older, but I, I need him to control his temper because I'm afraid that he might hit somebody in school [INAUDIBLE] or he might get beat up because he doesn't talk.  He's socially behind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He just doesn't get the whole being respectful and how to act in public kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't know what to do about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes [INAUDIBLE] but hopefully it'll get better so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, well call if you have any questions about the medicine, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you bet, bye bye.</p>

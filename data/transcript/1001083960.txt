<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so let me just kind of review last time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, oh you said the Zoloft seemed good but then you got sick and couldn't keep anything down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you went off the week, felt that this helped, you feel more calm and it's helped the panicky feeling and you've had some stressors going on with your brother coming to stay with you, SSI was being viewed and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm okay with that, that part where they go over, they just passed the new review.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm happy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got your SSI, okay, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I just had one bad thing happen and it kind of affected my medicine again when I had to start again.  I don't know what happened to me a long time ago when I was starting to have problems because I think there's something the doctors just aren't getting because when they see anything about depression, they tend to throw everything out in the garbage and just say oh well she's....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm having problems where I feel like lead and I'm in pain all the time and sometimes I can't think and I used to get spasms like really bad.  Sometimes I still do, like in the whole upper body.  It's so hurtful like when I first started getting sick and this was years back I'd get it all along the spine, all the muscles would cramp up and I'd be like this and in pain and it hasn't happened for a while.  I was in about the fifth week of taking the Zoloft and I'm not blaming it but I wanted, I should have called and asked you if I should continue. I went into such a spasm, it felt like somebody chucked like a spear through my back.  Right into the back and like into here and all the muscles in that part of the body, the upper, they were tighter and tighter and tighter and it hurt so bad, I just felt like dying, I felt like I was being crushed and what it feels like to me is hard to explain, it's like something in my head and something goes down my spine because that's where all your nerves are.  It feels like something shoots through there and then I go into spasms and I was in so much pain and the only thing I was thinking of, it sounds crazy, I don't know if this makes sense, my body feels lousy most of the time and when I'm taking medicine and I start to feel good, just I was thinking, I was doing the Zoloft, doing pretty good and I start to be, what I call normal, trying to do all the chores, trying to do the running around because I feel like I can handle it and then I think it was just too much for my body and, or it could have also been the thing with my brother and everything just, I was doing a lot and then that hit.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE], too much tension or pressure, you think it might kind of trigger it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm thinking it might.  I mean originally it started off when there was emotional stress, bad relationships and I used to get that attack going down my spine, but that's when I first started getting sick anyway.  It was years ago but I had something happen with my brother then where somebody got shot.  I had the truck accident, I got hit by a big truck, after that I always started having this problem where someone would confront me and I'd get that, you know, stunned panic thing.  That's when it all started but I haven't had those bad spasms for a long time and that was just, I mean had it to where even the next day I couldn't get up and if I did, it was like threatening to do it again, and I was scared and I really didn't take my medication during that time.  What I did do, I don't know if I should have not, but it worked, there was something, I had a [INAUDIBLE] in the closet.  I had them from sometime way before and they were old but I took it to relieve that muscle spasm and I just stayed in bed with a heating pad and just rested.  I had to be, like for three days, and then after...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because even the third day I said, I'm getting up, like I can't lay here, you feel like you're wasting your life.  You know, you get up and it still hinted like it wanted to come back and something in here wanted to twist.  Even this morning, just a hint, like not as bad as, but I was scared to even move and then after that, knots, you could actually feel the spot where it actually, I guess first, but then you're like real sore, you feel like you got beat up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I ended up in bed for almost a week and I didn't take my medicine and then even went into the next week and I didn't.  I said lately though I feel kind of starting to feel so mopey where I'm not really doing nothing so I started taking it again.  I'm not blaming it but I don't know if it's because I started to feel too good and do too much.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know.  I mean, I...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think the fact that you've had it predating this, I kind of don't think it's the medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, because I feel like when I push my body.  I'm always thinking the medication is masking the problem that they're not getting for some reason.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, you know, it's making me feel good but I'm really still pushing myself.  I don't know if that's it but that's what I was feeling.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've seen doctors in the past like for fibromyalgia, things like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My problem is I'll get a good doctor, which I've got to get out of the clinic, because I found a good doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was helping me.  He says there is a reason you have this chronic fatigue and all this stuff and we're going to find it.  One believes it had to do with that past infection I might have had with the Epstein-Barr, but because so many people end up having the antibodies, they just kind of, he went away, he believed in that and he was helping me with stuff and then you get a new doctor who's like oh well that's just all in your mind, maybe you should see your psychiatrist for stuff like that.  And like I've been going all these years.  I know that I physically have problems, like even lately my heart's been pounding more.  I've been getting like where it starts to speed up.  I wake up in the middle of the night and it's just like I wake up suddenly and my heart is pounding or when I'm lying on the bed I can feel the bed pounding.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what else is-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's scary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So aside from this one episode which sounded like it was a bad one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel overall the Zoloft has been helpful?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I felt like it had and it was the only one that I could take for a longer period of time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, I mean if your theory's right, so maybe what you need to do is to take it but to try and gradually increase your activity in moderation so it's not like, you know, such a shock for your system that's not used to doing a lot because you've been, you know, I don't...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the problem with the chronic fatigue thing as far as what I've been following, even online a lot about it...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All the symptoms I have except for, I think the cold feeling, feeling cold or something.  They say you have to pace yourself because then you'll get good days and you'll feel good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] make up for lost time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wonder if that's been happening all these years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a few good days and then I end up in bed and that's why I was going to the Wellbutrin, to get me out of bed like when I feel lethargic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's crazy, it's like a cycle.  I'm up and down and I'm not necessarily feeling depressed.  These are time when, at lot of times I was tired and still when things were good but this time it was, yeah emotionally, it could have been just as well my brother, feeling like I'm obligated and I've got other things.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happened with the brother in the end?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well we decided I'll let him stay two days a week.  He'll come over and he'll stay at my mothers.  Now she's not supposed to have anyone living there.  I don't want her to get in trouble, but if he's there like a few days and they think he's just going in and out because she likes his company anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he's going to officially be like...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well what happened, it's a terrible, it's a weird situation.  He was living with this woman who's not quite right herself and there was an incident with the son.  He attacked my brother.  He's got autism, the son, and he disrupted his thinking or something and he went off on my brother and went and pulled a knife.  And she's saying that you can't be here because [NAME OTHER] is going to go to jail if you come back because they said you've got to be separate so he has an address but he's kind of temporarily in limbo and my brother's got problems too where he's on antidepressants and it's just messed up and I don't...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does he spend more time with you than he has in the past?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He'll just maybe like Thursday and Friday night so the way I can cope with it is, we get movies and we make pizza or something where we make it like it's a child coming over and you have something to do fun and then it's not stressful for me and I felt relieved but then I've got the ex husband calling me.  He went away to prison for stupid little things like fighting with my, it's just a crazy mess, that's probably why I'm not right.  [NAME OTHER], my youngest son has a biological father but [NAME OTHER] my ex husband raised him because he's dad to everybody but he always gets into stupid trouble, motor vehicle, this and that.  This time he went after [NAME OTHER] dad and now he's in there.  Now he wants to come back to my house.  He always does that to me.  That's because I've always mothered him.  You know, when he lived on his own, do you have, does dad have enough groceries, dad needs a ride, now dad comes to me like he's my son and I think the day I had this spasm if I remember, he might have called me the day before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE], yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because I'm like, oh my God, I want to help but yet it's such a heavy burden to take care of all these grown people when I'm trying to get well myself. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's really interesting.  You know, a lot of people in America suffer from low back pain.  I know that's not what you're having. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have disc problems thought.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There was a, it was very interesting, there's a lot written about people who have chronic back pain, when they, it says carrying a big load, a big burden...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it's addressed, you know, therapy or whatever, do they realize even if that's what contributing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is they get a great relief from the pain. It's just interesting, I mean it's like you talk about this guy being this big burden, then he calls, then he gets a spasm. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, they may be related.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That too many, there's just too many going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So did you say yes or no to him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I kind of just didn't answer.  I said I'm not supposed to have anybody here, that's my thing.  I don't want to lose my rent, you know, and I left it in the air and then he goes well I don't have any other place.  Then I guess I shouldn't have said it but I said well you try to find a place, I said and see what happens as a last resort, I says I'll think about it and I says if you do come, you have to find a place.  Now that kind of said yes to him I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I'm sure that's what he heard. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm sorry I said it and at that same time, you know what causes me to feel like that spasmy thing too, saying no because then I feel heartbroken like what's going to happen to that person because he's so needy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I mean, there are shelters...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There are shelters in the world, you know, there are people, places to go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to take a chance, like, I wouldn't mind if he came and it took maybe six weeks at the most, you know, find a job, save up, get a place, but is that going to happen, that's the thing. It hasn't happened before but then he had problems before, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's got this all out of the way.  I'm hoping he'll just, and it's not even me.  I wouldn't even associate with him at all if it wasn't for the kids.  Gosh [INAUDIBLE], you know it's like if it wasn't for them, because they love him, especially the little guy, I wouldn't even answer the phone.  Not that I hate him, you know, but it's just like I don't need the extra, so I was thinking today to just put a block on the collect calls and just let it ride.  Okay, you can't contact me.  If you get out and show up then I'll have to deal with it but otherwise, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a lot easier to deal with it when he's not showing up with all his stuff by your door.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I tell many people, he can always blame me.  I have a lot of times, I've heard people saying to just tell him that your psychiatrist said you can't handle it, that there's too much stress and you're not supposed to do it. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel like it's killing me, I really do. It's... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The weight problem I think is a symbol of all the weight that I feel because I'm thinking that if I can clear all this up, I'd probably slim down.  I went away for a week to this retreat and I lost 20 pounds right away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it kind of...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you were stressed puts weight on you, you know the whole, and the [INAUDIBLE] cortisol, that abdominal....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] I can't even breathe.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You kind of, you know what, you have to think of it not as you're saying no to him but that you're saying yes to your family and to yourself that you need to be healthy, everyone counts on you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you are like, you know, in bed for three days because the burden is too much and you go into spasms, that's just, you know...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know that you're very giving and forgiving.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you also have to think about your ability to function as a mother if you're totally bedridden.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes I get trapped too because I'll think, well he's going to be here and even though he doesn't contribute a real lot, even just the help with lifting things, fixing things, or a little bit of extra money, that kind of makes me feel like I'm going to feel better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  If there's ways, only you can know the risks and the benefits and it sounds like your first reaction is probably the true reaction.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought I was going to have a stroke or something, that's how bad it was, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.  I think you've got to listen to your body, it sounds like it knows more than your brain sometimes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah. So...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have to listen to yourself and, you know, you can say it in a nice way, I'd love to but I just can't, my doctor said I can't handle the stress or it's just too much or whatever, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you know, sometimes you have to say no because you've got to take care of yourself.  They count on you, they truly have no one else to count on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's true.  It's just too many things mixed up with it.  I haven't done him a favor I guess by helping him in the past because he always depends on me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the thing, if you see that it helps a person get back on their feet but if it just....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only thing that helps is when, this is an awful thing to have to live like this, but when I don't help and he goes off and stays with the wrong people, that's when he'll get back in to doing things he shouldn't, like drugs and drinking and that's where, why he ends up there and it's almost like I feel like he comes with us, he goes to church, he gets back on track but it's almost like if he's not with me, he's not on track so I feel like what do you do with that, like you know, you feel like you're helping him to stay on the right track and stay away from the wrong people. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you were signing up for a six week stint, if that's a lifetime stint, then it's a little bit less.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not married to him anymore...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For twenty something years, and I can never win, so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me, now you get your Neurontin, [INAUDIBLE] Wellbutrin enough until [DATE] and Zoloft we are kind of holding off.  How are you taking it now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I was taking it for that, I got into like the fourth or fifth week and then, I think lately when I started up again, I'll take it like for a few days and then take a break for a day or two.  The unfortunate thing is like, all the medications end up the same where I take them but I have to like skip a day or two.  It seems like when they build up I feel like it's too much.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, you've always had that where you kind of...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Adjust your dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's like I thought this was going to be the magic bullet, you know, where I could just keep...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, this is a one time episode.  I wouldn't say that has anything to do with the Zoloft, especially with all these things that you're telling me.  You know, I think you have to kind of keep giving it a chance...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And maybe gradually increase the dose but you said you were feeling pretty good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I figured.  I was afraid to start it up again but I did but it's like okay, so I had it for about a month, that one week was out completely, maybe a week and a half, then I started again, took it three or four days, maybe forgot a day but still felt okay but that's what happens, I'll skip a day or two, even with the Neurontin, it helps me more when I skip a day or two, believe it or not.  When I keep taking it, I just feel kind of weird. I'll skip a day or two, then I'll take it fresh again and then it'll really help me feel relaxed and sleep. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So when you take Zoloft, how much do you take?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Still the 50 I'm up to.  I haven't gone up any higher really, that's the only thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, the other meds you mail away, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The other medications?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or you do them locally?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Locally, yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you need everything.  I think you're getting close to being out I believe.  So I think we need to give you everything and you're just doing 50 mg.  You never went higher?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wonder if I tried it the 75 or...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I might have tried 75 and I think I might have gone up to 75 just before this happened because remember you said to try to gradually increase it but I don't think I got past like a day or two of that and then this, if I go back on 50, I could try to go up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll just write one to one and a half because I know you do things gradually.  Okay and I'll give you refills.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just felt bad to have to come in and tell you this.  I'm like here I am again with the medicine and not...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I start it and stop and I don't mean to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you know what, I think that, you know, again there's these other factors that play a role...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you kind of have to, and I have to, no point in taking, if you have doubt about a medicine, you're not going to feel good when you're taking it, so you take your little break and go back on it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, do it gradually again getting to get back.  Are you back on now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I'm on 50 so I could try to go up in maybe another week, you know, and try to go up and see what happens, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Look it, if you're feeling okay on the 50, you don't have to go up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And this thing too, since I've been on this, I haven't been really taking the Wellbutrin much so I don't know if I should just keep it on hand or...  I took it a couple of times with it but not regularly so I don't know what to do with that.  That's like when I really get that lethargic thing where I'll take that to get me up.  I don't know why that works.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it is stimulating.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it is almost like a little speed effect.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I take it for that reason and maybe I'll just leave it that way for now.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's fine. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, just to keep, each day is so different and it's like I have to take what I need to take to get me through.  It's like, or to function.  There's days where I will just say, you know what, I've got to stay in bed and rest because I'm not going to be any good but I've still got to get all the work done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Well, that's overwhelming too for one person to have to do everything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.  The girls are not contributing like they should so, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What a surprise huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh gosh.  I don't know how they can, my mother never asked me and she did everything but, I mean, if she had asked I would have done it.  Kids are something else.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so I'm putting refills on.  I usually see you about every couple, every month or, I'm thinking about a month so anywhere between four and six weeks is fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, Wellbutrin, Neurontin and Zoloft.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Other things could have been a factor too because they went up a little on the Synthroid.  I know that speeds your heart rate up so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  That's where I'm confused.  Too many doctors, too many switches.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know the thing is...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've got to find some, one good guy or something to go to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So where are you going to be looking for another doctor?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't even know where to begin.  I really don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well if you ever want to bring in your Medicare list, I'll be glad to look and see if there are some names of people that I've heard are good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, okay.  I just want somebody that'll listen and not just...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know some doctors like that but I don't know if they're on the list or not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if you, like I said, if you want to you...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll do that.  I need help with it because I'm really getting discouraged and lot of me feeling off is because I get upset going there.  When I go there and try to talk and they don't want to really...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the problem is that everybody-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My blood pressure goes up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're so overbooked that they don't have that much time. </p>

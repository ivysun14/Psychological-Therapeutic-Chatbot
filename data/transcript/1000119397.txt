<p>TRANSCRIPT OF VIDEO/AUDIO PRESENTATION:</p>

<p>RESOLVING SHAME</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>(music)

</p><p>FEMALE SPEAKER: In recent years, shame has been called the hidden emotion because those who experience it typically don't talk about it. Shame has also been implicated as a root cause in a number of other difficulties including alcoholism, drug abuse and codependence. 

</p><p>In early 1989, my husband, Steve Andreas, and I decided to explore the mental processes involved in shame. Out of this, we developed a pattern for resolving shame and transforming those experiences into positive opportunities for resourcefully examining standards and deciding what to do. [:51] This shame resolution process can often be learned in one session and usually generalized to all or most of a client's experiences of shame throughout his or her life.

</p><p>Next, Steve Andreas demonstrates this process in an advanced training in March 1990.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: First, I presume you already have in your mind something that causes you to feel shame.

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes, it's ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And you don't need to tell them ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... any content. 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: They'll get nosy and their brains will get derailed and they won't notice ...

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... what we're doing up here. (chuckling) OK? You got one?

</p><p>FEMALE: Uh-huh.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Is it a specific time or is it a period of time?

</p><p>FEMALE: Period of time. [1:30]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. How about just taking - because we will apply it to the whole period of time, I guarantee you, before we're done.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: But for right now, how about thinking about a specific incident? It will make it easier for you to - for us to explore ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... what the situation is. OK? Good. Now, put that one on a shelf for a minute. And think of some other situation in which you violated someone else's standards or you didn't meet someone else's standards but, for whatever reasons, you didn't feel shame. 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Got one?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: How come you didn't feel shame there? [2:12]

</p><p>FEMALE: Because I was - I was doing what I wanted to do. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. (Patient chuckles) Well, how come you did feel shame in the other one?

</p><p>FEMALE: Because it seemed like it had more to do with my personage. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: My self. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. This is an important distinction between whether a certain situation reflects on yourself - your self concept, your being - or whether it reflects only on your behavior. And this is something Leslie was doing seems like a million years ago; making a distinction between self and behavior. That's a very nice first step in general when you're doing a lot of work; to make the distinction that if someone insults you or they say you did wrong or something like that that they're only commenting on your behavior. Makes it a lot easier to deal with. [3:07]

</p><p>However, when you're young and you're in a family of perhaps less than total resources, it's hard to know that. But we can go back and fix it.

</p><p>FEMALE: Good.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Now, if you compare those two experiences - the one of shame and the one of, we'll just say not shame - where, again, you knew you were not meeting someone's standards in some way but you didn't experience shame. What are the differences? Submodality differences ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... in particular. 

</p><p>FEMALE: Well, the shame one's over here.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. 

</p><p>FEMALE: And it's round. Oval.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: It's - the brightness is a little less than normal brightness.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, it's a little dim.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm. It's 3D.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Which way is it oval, by the way? (inaudible at 3:55]

</p><p>FEMALE: It's like this.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: You're tilting a little. 

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Is it kind of like that?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes, except the people in it are standing up. But the part of it that I see is like this.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. [4:05] So it's kind of wide (ph). OK. 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And so there are people in there?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>FEMALE: I'm one of the people

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: You're one of the people.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: So you see yourself in this? So it's dissociated. 

</p><p>FEMALE: And there's ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: That's a wise move, by the way. (chuckling) Just for a moment, just for their edification ...

</p><p>FEMALE: Ah. (snickering)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... what would happen if you stepped in ... (patient snickers) No way. (group laughs) OK, that's fine. That's enough. You understand the difference? OK. OK. Now ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. [4:40]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now, let's think about the other one for a moment. So it's on the other side?

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. It's - yes. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Tell me about that one.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. It's more to the right over here. It's, I guess, square. Although it's three-dimensional and (pause) the brightness is normal. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: It's further back. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: And I'm in and out. I mean I...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. So you step in or not.

</p><p>FEMALE: Right.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. 

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm. [5:24]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Now ...

</p><p>FEMALE: There's also - the auditory part is - the tones are real pleasant over here.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: And on the shame one it's more of a - what I would call a cackling. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Cackling. Ooh, good.

</p><p>FEMALE: There's words but there's kind of a cackling to the tone. Tonality.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. OK. So, let's see. Now you spoke of this - the not shame as being 3D. Is the other flat? Or is it 3D, too?

</p><p>FEMALE: No, they're both - they're both 3D.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, they're both 3D so we won't pay attention to that since they're both the same. Any other differences between - oh, this one's farther away, right?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes. This is ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: How far away is this?

</p><p>FEMALE: It's like about out where Keith is. Which that's my normal ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Twenty, thirty feet?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Say 25 feet.

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes. Yes, and this one's like more - like about eight feet. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. [6:32] Any other differences you notice between those?

</p><p>FEMALE: In this one I have - it's interesting. I have a sensation but it's not midline. It's just to the right of midline. Of pleasant sensation.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: That's the way I would describe it.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. I'll just code this by right here. So, positively feeling - right.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm. Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK? What emergency responders would call right lower quadrant. (patient chuckles) [7:11]

</p><p>FEMALE: And ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Any other differences between the two?

</p><p>FEMALE: (sighs) For - this one would be (clears throat) - if I were to step into this (chuckles) ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes, I understand.

</p><p>FEMALE: ... which I'm not going to, there's an off balance; a spinning sensation.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: If you were to step into this for a moment you would get off balance and spinning.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. OK. But you don't get - over here, if you step into it you get the nice, warm sensation.

</p><p>FEMALE: Right, right.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. (pause) [8:00] OK. Now, I want to ask you something else. Well first, any other submodality differences you notice between the ...

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes, that's ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: No. OK. That's plenty. There are people in both of these? Are there or not?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes? OK. I want you to give me - these are actually - well, let me ask you specifically.

</p><p>FEMALE: Sure.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: As you see yourself in this one ...

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... is there any difference in the size between you and the other people?

</p><p>FEMALE: No. There's ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Because you're real size and they're real size. Or they're proportional or whatever.

</p><p>FEMALE: Well, they are proportional to each other but they are bigger than the background. I just noticed that.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: They're bigger than the background.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: So, like unrealistically bigger? [8:43] Or just more prominent?

</p><p>FEMALE: Maybe it's more prominent is what it is. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: You notice them all.

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes. Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Now, where are they looking?

</p><p>FEMALE: Well (clears throat), it's hard for me to get that because the content of it was literally a swinging around.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: So there's a ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: So you were swinging around in the picture itself?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes, mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Like on a swing or something like that?

</p><p>FEMALE: No, somebody picking me up.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Somebody picking you up and swinging you around? 

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. And that was not pleasant, right? [9:32]

</p><p>FEMALE: No. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Now over here, how many other people, roughly, over here?

</p><p>FEMALE: A couple.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Just a couple?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm, yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And over here?

</p><p>FEMALE: Two. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Two?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Two in both. Let me just explain what I'm fishing for a little bit.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. [9:52]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Sometimes, in the experience of shame, there's some kind of distortions. Sometimes the other people are larger. Sometimes the person - yourself, in this case - 

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: - would be - sometimes there's - it's not real in some way; that the person is deformed or without clothes or in some way there's a representation of not being fully yourself. 

</p><p>Yes?

</p><p>MALE VOICE: If you're a kid and they are bigger ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE VOICE: ... (inaudible at 10:22]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes. Well no, I mean bigger proportionally.

</p><p>MALE VOICE: Oh, proportionally.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes. Unrealistically bigger. I used that earlier. That sometimes, you know, you feel very small [like there's these] (ph) giants around you. And - although kids could experience that just with a normal size. Often there's a distortion of this nature. So I gather there aren't any of these in that.

</p><p>FEMALE: No.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Fine. Good. Now, just as an aside, if there were distortions like that, right now I would change those, in this, before I did anything else. [10:53] Just as in the grief pattern, if someone sees the lost person in a coffin, you make it into the live person; the person that they miss. The person that they loved and cared for; not the person in the coffin. You would make it a specific content change in the picture, at this point. If that were the case.

</p><p>OK. (clears throat)

</p><p>MALE VOICE: So, those are not only content distortions but also size distortions that we're talking about?

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: I'm talking about that as a size distortion - content distortion - because it's specific to content. 

</p><p>MALE VOICE: Right.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: It's - I mean you can think of size as a submodality but if the whole picture changes they call it a submodality. Maybe there's a middle ground. I don't know what to call it. But anyway, if there was a big little distortion, I would have them change that at this point.

</p><p>MALE VOICE: And also looking (inaudible at 11:38) distortion?

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE VOICE: (inaudible)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Often the person over here, everyone's looking at them and laughing or criticizing or doing whatever they're doing. And typically, in the resource one, it's just like normal; you know, where people are looking at each other, at the wall or whatever's going on. 

</p><p>OK? [11:56]

</p><p>MALE VOICE: (inaudible)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE VOICE: (inaudible) 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE VOICE: (inaudible)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Just say, "Make them bigger or make them smaller. Make yourself bigger. Make the other people smaller" until they're appropriate - you just tell them to do it. I've never had any problem with it yet. Tell them to do it and they go (splat sound), "Yes, sir." Go ahead and do it. 

</p><p>FEMALE: Just, you know, they were - I guess they were bigger because I did that when you just said that. And it opened up the frame enough to where it's not nearly as ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, so they were probably a little bit.

</p><p>FEMALE: ... panicky as it was. Yes. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, great. So, here's a nice example. (group chuckles) I didn't even tell her to do it and she did it. 

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckles) It just is like, "Oh." OK. [12:41]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, great. So you say it opened out the frame. Did it actually make it larger?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes, and it ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And makes it less impactful?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes, because it made it square all of a sudden.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Made it square.

</p><p>FEMALE: It's not oval anymore. (chuckling)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Alright.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now, the next thing we want to do is map across. And usually the easiest thing to do is to change location. So take this picture and move it out to that location and find out what else changes at the same time. It's already got a square frame over here, right? OK. And as it goes over there, does it brighten up a little?

</p><p>FEMALE: OK, the - yes, it brightens up and all of a sudden the sound goes from cackling to more like a ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Normal sound?

</p><p>FEMALE: Or like a merry-go-round. You know, it's ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: It's like now it's fun.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now it's fun.

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. That's a difference, huh? (chuckling)

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) Yes. [13:25]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, do you see that there? About where Keith was? He's gone now.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm. Kind of behind Nelson and ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Behind Nelson. OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: And Clinton. Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK, great. And you hear - the sound changed already. And now what happens if you were to step into it? Briefly. [13:51] (pause) It sure turns your head around, doesn't it? (chuckling)

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) Yes. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now come back out. (chuckling) 

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: You'll get dizzy. Did you see her head going around? (chuckling)

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) It just - it doesn't - you know, I could dizzy. But it doesn't have the scary feeling to it.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>FEMALE: The off balance feeling and out of control feeling.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: How about shame? 

</p><p>FEMALE: Well, the same comments are being said that we're shaming. But it's like I'm not reacting as though ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Is that fairly obvious just looking at her? She's kind of smiling and she's talking about (overlapping conversation).

</p><p>FEMALE: (overlapping voices) You know, it's kind of like I could say, you know, "Up yours." You know? (chuckling)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: There you go. (chuckling) There you go. OK. That looks real good to me. 

</p><p>Now, at this point, I want you to do something else. Now the shame is gone, right?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now, keeping that picture over there - and I don't imagine you want to ever move it back, right?

</p><p>FEMALE: No.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Just keep it over there. And now I want you to consider what was the standard that was not met in that situation?

</p><p>FEMALE: It had - OK. Do you want the content?

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: If you don't mind.

</p><p>FEMALE: No, it just had to do with body image.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Body image?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Now, is that a standard that you want to meet? Is that a standard that you want to have for yourself? [15:20]

</p><p>FEMALE: It - OK, how can I say this? (pause) I do but not with that person's criteria.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Fine. 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: So you want to have your own criteria ...

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... for body image. So in terms of this specific situation, you're essentially saying their standards, given their criteria, are not something you want to have for yourself. Is that correct?

</p><p>FEMALE: Right.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Great. 

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now, at this point, take a moment to consider what are the standards and criteria. You may have thought of this already and it may be just ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... just a matter of accessing it and just briefly thinking about it. (throat clearing in background) What standards do you want to meet?

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK? [16:08] Good. Given that this happened in childhood, it's possible that this may never occur again. But just in case ...

</p><p>FEMALE: This one was about like - as a teenager.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Teenager?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm. Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Now, given that that happened so long ago, it may be that nothing like this will ever happen again. But if it - if it were to happen again or anything similar to it, we want to be prepared (coughing in background). Given that those other people have this different standard than you have, how do you want to respond to them? Is it enough to just know that you have a different set of standards and that you can now say, "Up yours" or something like that inside or outside if you want to? But just whatever ...

</p><p>FEMALE: (clearing throat) OK. [16:48]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... whatever response you want to have in that situation. Just think about that.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And think about that if that should ever happen again that that's - in this situation, that's what you would be satisfied doing.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK? And that looks pretty good. [Any parts object to] (ph) ...

</p><p>FEMALE: No.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: (chuckling) No, it doesn't look like it.

</p><p>FEMALE: It's nice to people "Up yours." (group laughs) 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. And there are times for doing that. It's like, "Off my suedes." (ph) You know? (group laughs) "Back off." OK?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes. OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK? OK. Now, do you have any questions about this?

</p><p>FEMALE: No, I just want to take it back (inaudible at 17:33].

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: We will do that next. 

</p><p>FEMALE: (laughing) Good. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: (laughing) (inaudible) OK. Now, you've done the timeline stuff.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: The decision destroyer and all those things. Now, I want you to first take a moment to just think about this situation and the fact that by perceiving this in this area rather than over here you can have all these resources of being able to notice the other people's demands or standards and cheerfully just say, "Well, this is not one I want to meet." And I want you to consider that there might be some situations in which you would want to meet their standards ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... and the person - or somehow deal with in a different way than "Up yours." 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK. [18:15]

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: It might be special friends of yours ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... in which at least you would want to be a little more political about it. (group chuckles) Or that you might even, at some point, be willing to make certain concessions to their standards because you value the friendship or their relationship sufficiently that ...

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: ... that was important to you and that on balance, given all your different criteria, that would be good for you.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK?

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Can you think of - you've already thought of a couple of situations like that.

</p><p>FEMALE: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Great.

</p><p>FEMALE: And it - I just - I mean how I can respond differently.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

</p><p>FEMALE: You know.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Right. Mm-hmm. I want you to have the full range of response to this. 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: We don't want you to just - we don't want to just send you out into the world (female chuckles) raising your middle finger. (group laughs) All day long.

</p><p>FEMALE: Aw, shucks. (laughing)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: This is - this is not life supporting in the long run. (group laughs) OK. Now, think about this whole situation. And I want you to feel that in your whole body. Feel that whole situation and these resources and your ability to evaluate a situation or respond the way you want to.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And I want you to float up above your timeline. And go back; as far back as you want to go. It could be to birth or conception or wherever you want to go, as long as it's way back there.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And then come right up through time carrying these resources. And each time you get to one of these times where you felt ashamed that can change - and most of this will take place on the unconscious level - go at your own speed and your own tempo and come right up to the present. [19:52] (long pause) [20:06]

</p><p>FEMALE: Hmm. Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And now, see yourself in the future going on in the same way. In any such situations where other people are attempting to impose their standards, consider them and decide if that's something that you want to accommodate to or not. 

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now, that looked pretty good.

</p><p>FEMALE: That's - yes, that's real nice. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Is that good?

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes. (coughing in background) 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: You want to do it again? 

</p><p>FEMALE: (clearing throat) [20:35] Yes. (clearing throat)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Take a double dose back now.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Again, float up above. Go back to wherever you went. This time, come up a little faster. Just kind of zip [in up] (ph). [20:46] And when you get up to the present, like look out into the future and see yourself in the future with these resources in all the appropriate situations.

</p><p>FEMALE: OK.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK? 

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) I have to share the auditory part that I'm seeing with that.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK.

</p><p>FEMALE: It's kind of like, "Eat your heart out, buddy." (group laughs)

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. [21:10] 

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) Oh.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. 

</p><p>FEMALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Well, have any questions?

</p><p>FEMALE: It feels good.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes, it looks good. 

</p><p>FEMALE: (chuckling) Yes. No questions from me.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: OK. Go forth in the world and be shamed no more.

</p><p>FEMALE: Wow. Thank you. (group laughs) 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Now, if you - if you read any John Bradshaw or any of these other people, they will tell you that shame - there's two kinds of shame. There is useful shame that gets you to change your behavior and there is toxic shame which eats your heart out. In a bad way. And I think they have made a valid distinction. 

</p><p>There is - there is one kind of shame in which it's basically based on behavior. You did something; you screwed up; you know, somebody caught you naked or whatever it is. And (clears throat) it's a specific behavior and you are ashamed of that behavior. But you're not ashamed of yourself. It doesn't become a comment on your being. [22:16] What they call toxic shame is when it's a comment on your being. It's actually a reflection on your self; your very being. And that is certainly much more harmful.

</p><p>But I don't think you need either kind. And as we demonstrated here, if you - if you're in touch with your own criteria and you realize when you want to meet someone else's standards and compromise in some way or dovetail outcomes in some way - this person is your spouse or your boss or someone that you do need to have ongoing relationships with - then you simply decide what are you going to do. And life does face you sometimes with difficult decisions. But you just do what you do and you know, you pays your money and you takes your choice, as they used to say. The whole thing of submodalities are very, very powerful. It changes how you code things. It changes how you access resources. And, as you saw here, as soon as she moved that picture over, it made a huge difference.

</p><p>And notice that even though she initially said there was no size difference, when I started talking about that - and that's why I did it, just in case - when she changed that, the picture opened up and she already had a changed feeling for it. It was still not - it was already not as bad even before mapping across to the new location.

</p><p>So, that's a little preamble. Any questions? Yes?

</p><p>MALE: Yes, if the person does believe that they - you know, when they look at it and (inaudible at 23:39] and they still go, "Yes, I really violated my standards ..."

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: My own standards.

</p><p>MALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE: Is that ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Then what do you have? If you violate your own standards what do you have?

</p><p>GROUP: Guilt.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Guilt. Right. So that's what happens. That's why we're going to do guilt next.

</p><p>MALE: Great.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Because sometimes when you do this and you map across, now you feel guilty. Well, then there's another way to deal with that. It's very parallel and very similar but it's different enough. And to keep things simple, let's just stay with shame now. But that is the next step.

</p><p>Very often, people just say, "Well, you know, those standards are not ones I want to meet." Or - and they're other people's standards. Or "If I want to meet them then I just figure out what I want to do." And sometimes, you know, you can fluff it and you can just - sometimes you just say, "Well, you know, you and I have different standards. Can we still remain friends?" There's a wide range of possible responses in there.

</p><p>MALE: They really liked it when you mentioned that part about, you know, the times when you want to allow for the ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE: ... people [that have] (ph) different standards.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes. Yes. Well, if you're sloppy then you get sloppy stuff. And if - seriously, it is possible. And people used to go to assertiveness training seminars and all it did was teach them to be a prick. You know? (group laughs) And they just went out in the world, "Up yours" and "I demand and I want my demands and to hell with yours." I mean it really does happen. And we want to build in all the forks so the person has the full range of response and the full range of choices. And if you don't explicitly build it in that way, it may not get in there. Some people will do it anyway, but we like to - in this case, we like to think of other people as not competent and make sure that we are competent so that just in case they're not competent, we can cover the bases.

</p><p>MALE: I was thinking that in that some situations you have shame, the parent reimprinting might be real helpful ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

</p><p>MALE: ... for the process. 

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

</p><p>MALE: (inaudible at 25:33) up might be helpful (inaudible).

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

</p><p>MALE: So there's a lot of things we've already done that ...

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

</p><p>MALE: ... blend in with this, you know?

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: That's true. 

</p><p>MALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely. Now, so far, every time - this has been enough, so far, every time we've done it; that we didn't need to do those other things. But I have no objection.

</p><p>MALE: Yes.

</p><p>MALE SPEAKER: And you see, when you - when you build this thing in and you make this transition then you take it back through time, you're making it into a through-time characteristic of the person. So you are, in fact, building a piece of self concept. You're building a piece of self resource that the person will carry through time. And that's an important distinction because you can change a single event and not, thereby, build it into the person as a capability. It's a real important distinction. 

</p><p>That's one of the lovely things about the decision destroyer or any of these things that are the timeline reimprinting and so on where you go back and you bring all that stuff with you. Then it's there with you all the time. It's just like your name. You're never without your name. It's always there. [26:35] You don't think about it, but if somebody asks you or you have a challenge that relates to that then, boom, that stuff is there. 

</p><p>Any other questions before we go through the steps? 

</p><p>Pick an experience of shame, a parallel experience of not meeting someone else's standards but meeting that in some kind of resourceful way. Do contrast of analysis. Now it says here to test to find out which of the differences are most powerful. I would like you to do that. I don't do it anymore because I've done it enough that it's not interesting to me. But you could have taken one thing at a time. Like make this a square frame over here. Before we did the thing of making the people different. Then making the people different, changing the brightness and doing things one at a time. [27:20] Every time we have done this location it's been such a powerful driver for this one that we just shift location and typically everything else shifts with it. So, we've gotten lazy. 

</p><p>But I encourage you to practice a little bit and test out just so that you know more about what's going on in someone else's mind. It's a learning - just as a learning experience. It will take you only 30 seconds or a minute or two to do this. 

</p><p>Any questions so far?

</p><p>So we're on step two. And there's a list of things that we often find there. (pause) Do notice if the person sees themselves deformed, naked, very small, et cetera, this is more likely - just for your information, the pattern will work just as well. But for your information, if there are a lot of these kinds of distortions, then typically the person experiences this as a self image thing rather than a behavior. If someone just did a behavior and they screwed up or something like that, typically everything will be normal; be representational; parallel to reality. [28:32]

</p><p>So transform, map across and move it over, making any content adjustments first. So if there's size differences or nakedness or any of that stuff, put clothes on and grow them up to the right size. Then if they're deformed, make them look like they really look or looked at the time or whatever. And this basically eliminates the shame.

</p><p>The next part - the whole back side on page four - number four, evaluating standards - this is to make sure that the person has the capacity, as I have spoken already, to have a wide range of responses so that they can pick and choose; so that they don't just go, "Up yours" to everyone who has other standards but they simply can take a look at it. Much as in the criticism strategy, you take the input as data. Is this a standard that seems important to me or valuable to follow? And given your criteria and your - what's important to you, including the value of this relationship, pick a response. [29:42] You want to - sometimes it's just enough to apologize. If you're in a foreign country and you violate someone else's standards, just go, "Excuse me. I didn't realize that this was something that was important to you." And it's not that big a deal to change so you just change it. If it doesn't really affect your life that much. Drive on the left side of the road instead of the right. That's a little tough, actually.

</p><p>But a lot of standards are kind of arbitrary and they don't really matter what you do and it's easy to conform. At other times, they're very important to preserve your own sense of integrity and your own values. [30:17]

</p><p>And then future pace. Imagine doing this in the future. Imagine the situation in the future. 

</p><p>And then generalizing; using, essentially, the decision destroyer, the time process. Go back to the beginning, carrying all these resources. It's good to say some things like, "Pay attention to what you did here." Have that come right into your body so you carry it with you. This is an additional suggestion; to carry it with you through time. And then go back as far as you want to go and come up through time, changing all those experiences that are relevant.

</p><p>FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes. So what have you noticed?

</p><p>FEMALE: (clearing throat) Well immediately - and as you know (chuckles), I have been one of those people that a lot of times things didn't generalize. And immediately I could feel a whole lot of other stuff recoding. The piece was about a shame incident with peers and I just immediately, and for about the next eight hours, there were a lot of other recoding pieces around shame with parents and, you know, other situations. [31:30]

</p><p>My overall sense is that there's a clear separation now between what other people think is their stuff and it has nothing to do with me and that what I do, if I don't live up to their expectations, that's their stuff, too. So ...

</p><p>FEMALE SPEAKER: Great. Yes. Sounds good.

</p><p>In the demonstration you just saw, Alana's (sp) shame was uncomplicated by other closely related problems so the process went smoothly and easily, as it often does. Many people who experience shame can also benefit by other NLP methods designed to work with related difficulties. It's important to be able to sort out the difference between shame and other limitations that have a different structure and therefore require a different process in order to deal with them effectively. [32:19]

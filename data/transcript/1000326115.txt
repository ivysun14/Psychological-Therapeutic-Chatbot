<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I called yesterday at first I thought that I didn't mind at all getting you and then I realized once I found that you weren't here that I was relieved that I didn't have to tell you directly that I couldn't come in.  (Coughs) And so I began to think well why again, and it, it's the same type of feeling that I had when I asked if I could change the time or discuss the time with you almost again as if I thought there'd be some disapproval.  And this whole thing of my getting a cold like I did, it all tied right in with my being back at my family and it, I I've lost the ability to judge when I'm really sick from, just anybody would get sick and when I'm getting sick because that's what my mind sort of prepares me to be.  And then once I am, whatever the reason, I can see myself using it for things that I might not want to do.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Like coming here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's one thing.  I don't know about going to school.  I can't tell whether I feel that way about that too or not.  Because on the one hand I feel I can't not be at school, as if they couldn't get along without me and they could probably do very well without me and maybe I'm afraid of finding that out too.  Because I really made myself go in today and I probably shouldn't have.  And I would never certainly in high school maybe I did this in college too, but I would never allow myself to be absent unless I absolutely had to be in high school.  Again this fear of missing something too I suppose.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Was that part of what you'd mentioned when you called, that you felt ill?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I was just wondering if I had missed something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't say.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I consciously didn't say.  Just like sometimes if I've been late I consciously don't say why I was late, because I feel then it's just making excuses and I can feel myself needing to make excuses so then I won't let myself do it.  But even yesterday I hated calling the school too.  The only person I don't mind calling is the girl who's my assistant.  And I just for some reason hate calling anybody else, telling them that I can't do something and I don't know quite why I feel that way.  Because they're always very understanding and in fact are often surprised that I come back as soon as I do.  And I think I used to do something more than I do now, that I would get a certain pleasure out of being on a job or in a class when I felt sort of ill and other people who wouldn't be there if they felt that ill would look at you as if, well you know, my goodness you've got stamina or something, or sort of, my stoical qualities and then I feel like some kind of a martyr and, and that I'm getting admiration in a sort of perverse way.  I'm not sure they look upon it that way and so then when I ever felt ill I would make it very clear how ill I felt so they again could appreciate the fact that I was there.  But I think in the last year or so I've realized I do that and I've tried not to because I know how annoying it is to have somebody around who always has some physical complaint.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But still I was wondering when I got this cold how much it was my so-ca—, it my mind's preparing me for it that I had it, because it just seemed so, used to be that every time I'd come home for a vacation I'd get an awful cold and at the time I'd tell myself well that's because you were under a lot of tension and you were staying up late getting your work done and now that you're back home and can relax you just sort of fall apart.  But sometimes I wouldn't even feel like I was going to have a cold until I'd get home and suddenly I'd have one.  And then having a cold and feeling kind of sick can excuse you for really participating in things.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you feel you especially wanted a reason this weekend?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To figure out why I got this?</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, I mean to not participate in certain things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't really, as a matter of fact, I was surprised, I mean I really didn't want to be sick and there were some relatives there that I enjoy and I don't know, it was the type of situation since I wasn't just alone with my parents, that I can, and none of my sisters were there, it was just my brother, that I can get along quite well and, and so I really was kind of annoyed when I got this.  But I know I misjudge things because I can remember in high school there was a conference that a history teacher had asked me if I'd attend and it was really quite an honor for her to want me to and in that way I did want to go, but on the other hand I was very much afraid of it because it meant being with a lot of people I didn't know and having to speak out and sort of holding my own and so I kept thinking, I think, to myself that the only way I could get out of it was to be sick but I wasn't sick.  And then the day came and I felt quite funny that morning but then I just told myself well it must be because you wanted to be sick, and so, now you're trying to make yourself think you are.  So I made myself go to the conference and by the time I got home, I was, I had awful fever and turned out I had the asian flu.  It was during one of those epidemics and again, how do I know which came first.  But I do know my mind was prepared for me to be ill.  (Pause)</p>

<p>When I was home it came out, I was thinking in terms of something I said at the end of last week, I can't remember which day, about being sent to my grandmother's and feeling that my mother had wanted me out of the house.  And uhm, my, yo—, the youngest son of my grandmother, my youngest uncle at one point mentioned did I remember picking up sea shells with him one day and then I realized that that would have been around the same time that I was sent to my grandmother's and so I was able to find out that it was, I think I was probably 6 and it was after my brother had been born, maybe not more than a year, perhaps within that first year, but long enough after so my mother didn't think that this problem she was having with me came from his birth but she said it was just awful because we just couldn't get along.  And I don't remember that time at all, I just remember later not getting along with her.  But she said that I, somehow, whatever each the other said, grated on the other one and, and she, she just felt it would be better if, if I could, went away for a while.</p>

<p>ANALYST: This was in the summer you went to your grandmother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It must have been or, because I thought well, then I would have been going to school, and I don't remember missing school, so it must have been but then that means it wasn't long after my brother was born.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.  So, I was going to, when was your brother, when was he born?  What month?</p>

<p>PATIENT: May 7.</p>

<p>ANALYST: May.  So he might have been very small.  And you were 6 the following October?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was 6 in April.</p>

<p>ANALYST: In April.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was 6 right before he was born.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's why I don't understand when I did go exactly, but because if it were within 3 or 4 months it seems to me very clear it could have been a reaction, if, although I, the only feeling I remember having about my brother at that time was delight that I had a baby brother.  And I enjoyed taking care of him and I was delighted that it was a boy and I had, when my mother was pregnant I remember being aware of her being pregnant for l and I can remember wishing very hard that she'd have a boy.  (Pause) But then later on when he was 4 or 5 I can remember feeling he was the only one of my family that I ever thought consciously that I wanted to kill him or think or say I wish you were dead to.  And for nobody else was that kind of emotion on the surface as it was for him, so there must have been some kind of feeling that I had, I'm so—, must have been due to the fact that he was a boy too and that I wasn't.  But I was never the kind of girl that wanted to do a lot of things boys were dong so, I don't, I don't know quite why I wanted to be a boy.  Because I, I wasn't a tom-girl type.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I know I was kind of interested in just the fact that boys had penises because I can remember in, even in nursery school or kindergarten being in the bathroom with you know, mixed boys and girls and being very interested in looking at them and I know that was one reason why I wanted my brother to be a boy.  So that I could have a good reason to be looking at him and see what he was like and I used to, but so did my other sisters play around on the toilet seat in j—, sitting different ways.  (Cough) So I suppose it all concentrated on his having something I didn't have.  And maybe too my mother's attitude was somewhat different because I think, I maybe my parents would have had four children not matter what, but I know my father wanted a boy very much, he's never really said so but I'm just positive he did.  And I'm quite sure my mother did.  Because it just seems something that how, however much people pretend they don't feel that way, they really do want a boy.  And so I think maybe there was a sort of a special attitude toward him.  I also found out that there was a picture of me when I must have been at least 7 and I still hadn't gained weight, so I must have gained weight when I was around 8.  But now I don't even know how much I really gained weight and how much I just thought of myself as being fat.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And there was another thing I noticed, that the time I talked about the fact that picking nails bothers me or doing anything with your nails.  The sounds sometimes you make that makes me think of that.  I never associated, I associated it with my sister but actually I think that that feeling comes because of something my father does.  He always will pick away at his thumb at the skin and his skin is so hard and coarse now around his nail but it makes an awful sound when he's doing it.  And there used to be times when I just thought I was going to scream if he didn't stop.  But I just have to bite my lip and turn away and not look and then he'd still be doing it, and I could still visualize him doing it.  It used to just upset me very much and and I, I know I wanted to hit him, and I just had all sorts of emotions and anyway it just bothered me because of the ferocity that he would pick at it and his skin was just so hard that he couldn't make a dent in it.  And I know he used to do it when we'd be sitting in church and there'd be no escape from that.  And I sat next to him at dinner and he would do it while he, we were just sitting around at the dinner table.  And I think the frustration of not being able to stop it and feeling that I couldn't stand it would just build up in me so much that I just felt full of negative feelings and hatred and everything.  Then later on when he'd do it at the dinner table I'd just get up and leave or somehow I'd find a reason not to stay around if he did.  Or else I think sometimes I probably got myself so I could ask him nicely not to do it.  And I think he did it unconsciously.  I don't think he even realized he was doing it and he'd feel badly if he knew it'd had been bothering me, but when it, the time that it bothered me most I couldn't ask him not to do it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I something else occurred to me which occurred to me after I left on Friday the whole time I was here then I think what I wanted to do was to talk about my grandmother again and the image that had, I had of her that had upset me so much on Thursday.  Because I wanted to prove to myself that I could talk about it without becoming emotional.  And that I'd gotten myself back in hand.  (Pause) But I didn't say anything because I then felt that getting myself back in hand that way might not be such a good thing after all and I should perhaps I shouldn't indulge myself in proving that kind of self-control to myself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Of course there is something else that happened here Friday that you don't mention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean when the lights went out?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm, that's just what I was thinking of (chuckle) then.  I can't remember now what reasons I gave for feeling panicked but I know one must be that I would be in the dark lying here like this much more vulnerable than I am in the light.  And it's whole part of the thing that I don't feel I can close my eyes while I'm lying here either.  Somehow I have more control if I keep them open.  And I don't always feel this way but sometimes I think I feel that your being in here with me lying here is a threat to me.  So that it just makes it much more of a threat if it's dark in here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you think of something specific that might happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of being raped.  (Chuckle) And I know I have a fixation on that.  (Pause) Because just something that's constantly coming before my attention now is hearing during wars and the women that are raped in towns when soldiers come through.  And that i—, that, thought has just been extremely upsetting to me.  And I, when I am coming across a story like that then I try to visualize what I would do in that situation, and I just can't imagine being able to stand it.  But it's just like the thought about death I, instead of just leaving it because it isn't happening to me, I have to keep when I come across it and it's, I'm in the mood for it to upset me then I do dwell on it.  And one time again this is probably partly out of just being cautious but when I was in PEC sometimes they, they have a, well, well you know, hours are just different there and you start later and stay out later and sometimes I'd be coming home quite late, really early in the morning about 3 or 4 in the morning and nobody else lived up my way so often I'd come home alone on the bus and then there's a little bit of walking I had to do.  And I never met anybody on the way and generally I didn't feel fearful or anything about it but one time I was coming home and it was if anything lighter than other times and I was just walking along in the middle of this road and then I just suddenly had this feeling that there was somebody behind me and I walked faster and I just had this feeling, I don't know if I heard anything or whether it was just my footsteps or what but I just suddenly was seized before I even knew I was going to do it with this terrific serge or wave of panic and and I just whirled around and made some noise and I didn't expect to do that, I wasn't, I thought I was just going to keep going fast up to the house.  There was nobody there.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Maybe there was a man, way down, now I can't remember.  Can't remember whether I thought then wouldn't it be embarrassing if there had been some innocent man walking along and I did that to him.  Or maybe there really was somebody just innocently walking along.  (Pause) And the other thing that makes me feel as if it's bound to happen to me sometime or a threat of it is because my mother and my 2 sisters have all had incidents according to the way they tell them which were very threatening in that way and so I just keep thinking well, it's just a matter of time before I do too.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking back to when either before or right after my brother was born but I know I was quite young and I can just remember sort of vaguely playing in the room that was a playroom then for us all.  And I, I know that other people were in there with me but I don't know who, whether it was my friends or my family, my sisters, but I had something that I used as a penis and I was playing that it was part of me, I can remember that.  (Pause) And I think that something that all these years I've been very ashamed of and very upset to think about that I ever did something like that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And another thing that's I think has been extremely upsetting to me to think about is something I did with the girl FN that I ostracized, helped ostracize later on from our group, and this might have been one reason why I wanted to ostracize her.  She had a, her family had a summer home in er on the lake and I used to go up there for a few days after camp most summers and again, I don't know how much I did this but I do know one summer I can remember a specific time when we were in the water swimming and we just stopped and it seems to me in my instigation not hers, that we began exploring each other's bodies and I just have always felt very shameful to think of it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I can also sort of vaguely remember a time when we were in t and it must have been around 1952 or 53 my uhm, we were up to, we were, it was just before we could move into the house my parents have in t so we were staying in an inn and as I remember I was in the same room with my brother and may—, maybe we were even in the same bed but in any case, he ended up in the same bed with me and the kind of feeling I had for him was something more than just having my brother in bed with me.  And it was extremely upsetting to me too and I think I must have put it out of my mind immediately because I can't remember very well what actually did happen except feeling very upset at whatever reaction I did have.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you say something more, do you have any recollection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean he just might have been lying next to me or maybe I was hugging him I, you know, I don't think too much happened, I think it was more of a feeling, I had —</p>

<p>ANALYST: I meant what you felt, do you remember?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.  I don't know because I think that might have been around the time that, or sometime in my early teens I began having dreams about having babies and it was almost like, I found out through my dreams how people actually had babies before I actually found out from somebody telling me and so it might have been during that time I was, so that the whole thing began to be connected.  I don't know.  But I was very afraid of those dreams too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Now, you said this must have been around 52 or 53.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I, yes, that we were up in t.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you would have been 12 or 13.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was simply that maybe it was cold and so I encouraged him to come into my bed and then we just cuddled up to each other and slept that way.  But I felt guilty about having slept in the same bed with him after it was over and maybe having my arms around him.  And it, it almost seems like I really kept a distance from him after that.  Because I really never was very close to him and certainly in the last years of high school and then when I went to college I never felt I knew him.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking more about how things that have happened with my brother or thoughts I've had about him and I, right now anyway, draw a blank.  And the only thing I can remember about my brother other than things I've said is that he and my sister, younger sister FNA, were very close and they'd often in the morning, especially on weekends when we'd be sleeping late be together in his bedroom, playing and eventually the thing would blow up and they'd start having a fight, but they'd always start out by playing together and they were quite close.  And I was just wondering now whether at the time I, I, I'm not conscious now of having felt jealousy then, but I'm just wondering now whether I probably didn't, that they were so close and I used to enjoy, as so did FYC, getting them to fight each other down in the living room for instance, we, it's almost like sicking one on the other, getting them going and then antagonized and then encouraging them to keep up fighting.  And we'd sit back and enjoy it.  And then something else just occurred to me too, when we went to PZW, uhm, which was at the end of my senior year in co—, in high school.  On the whole I think the family got along quite well considering how we could have gotten along and my memory of the trip is a pleasant one overall, so I don't recall any times when it was unpleasant.  But one thing I do remember because people talked about it afterwards was that at some time I was mad at my brother I don't know why, but I just used my fingernails and gauged his arms.  Once I started I just couldn't stop.  Which is I think a feeling I often had that I was afraid of getting physical in any argument because I was afraid once I started I wouldn't be able to stop.  Or that I'd keep going past what I wanted to do.  And I think he's the only one that I fought physically with at that point.  Because I think I'd long given up trying to fight physically with either of my sisters.  I don't know if I ever did with FNA.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And while I was saying that for some reason it made me think of my grandmother's funeral and the I kept trying to, when I looked at the coffin which was closed, think of how she looked, would look inside, instead of thinking about her in a sort of an abstract way.  I had this compulsion to think about her in, as her body and what it would look like and how they dressed her and I wanted more than any thing else to ask my mother what they'd put on her when they put her in it's closed, and since nobody was going to see.  But generally I could control myself until the minister mentioned her name and I found that the hardest thing not to cry at.  And again it's almost as though I'm attaching something great to names.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes, you don't mention her name.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I always spoke of her as grandma.</p>

<p>ANALYST: No but I mean, I mean -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mention her name as the minister did?</p>

<p>ANALYST: — No, yes.  You said it was the name that started you feeling and trying to imagine, but you don't mention the name here, that's what I mean, when you say that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  Just thinking of it, it gives me a sort of a funny feeling again.  It's FKD NSL.  And I think somehow knowing that her name was FKD always made, instead of just grandma, made me always feel she was much more real.  Even when she'd talk about her childhood, I think of her as a person having a name FKD and then it would make me feel it was possible, that associate to names.  I don't know exactly what it is, but I've always heard my name said in different ways and in high school I used to hate for people to call me FAJ, because it always seemed like they kind of dragged it out and said it, I don't know exactly how to describe the feeling it gave me, but kind of exasperated and well, exactly how I thought of my mother saying it, I'm sure of that.  But it just had a kind of an ugly quality to it.  But I suppose in a way that's the way I thought of people thinking of me so then it would make me hear them saying my name in that way.  Really saying my name about as harshly as you can would be the way I thought I heard it.  So I used to love to be called any nickname and I think part of that comes from anybody's desire to be called a nickname because it makes you feel you belong more, but it also meant then I wouldn't have to be a FAJ.  (Pause) And I just hated my middle name, QNC, I wouldn't tell anybody that's what it was.  Because again it was a name that well, just the association with the bird and although there was no real reason to be that upset at having that for a middle name but somehow again it was one of these names that had a very harsh quality to it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is that your mother's maiden name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's some place in my father's side of the family.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhuh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I never was too, my whole name is, in fact, I think that used to bother me too.  I never have heard of any relatives with either, the na—, the name FAJ or QNC, but I was told they both were people on my father's side of the family that had them and I think I always preferred by mother's side of the family so that it upset me in a way that nothing came from her side.  Whereas all my other, the rest of my family had something from her side.  (Pause) And yet in a way I really liked my first name better than anybody else's.  I just didn't like it the way it was spoken.  (Pause) In fact, even I think this feeling about my name in as far as my last name which is also sort of sho—, short and choppy and it's vulgar in a way, I guess I think that part of it is, or common, or something, I don't know, but it just it didn't have any music to it, or rhythm or anything, it just, well there it was, wasn't nice to hear.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So bad you can hardly mention it?  Your referring of your maiden name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: HRC.  Yes.  Plus then you have to go through all the jokes that people always felt that were fresh for them to give you and, anyhow, just by having the whole name said, FAJ HRC, just focused all the attention on me and I didn't like that either.  It was almost like somebody pulling me up by my collar or something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

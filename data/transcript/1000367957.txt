<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I wanted to check: it's this Thursday and Friday that you're closed or that I'm not to come?  
ANALYST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  (Pause) Something that surprised me when I woke up this morning and I just didn't really want to think about it or I couldn't decide quite what to make of it.  But I was aware of — school closed early so I didn't have to go in today.  And, uhm, and it almost seemed like I was feeling guilty that I didn't have school today.  And, and almost the feeling that I had to fill my time up with something else and if I felt leisured or just felt like doing something that was completely unconstructive or had nothing to do with any of the other things I still have to do to get ready for Christmas, I would feel guilty.  And almost a feeling, too of I should get up at practically the same time, even though there was no need to.</p>

<p>(Silence) And I also was aware then of a dream that I had had just before I woke up that was connected with my sister, FYC, and her husband.  And what happened in it is sort of vague now but the feeling I had was that I was seeking their approval and their acceptance.  And whatever was happening in the dream was part of this feeling included.  And I was just thinking that in tr—, trying to find a present for them I'm really trying to find something that I think will help me to be accepted by them or somehow included in more favorable thinking.  (Silence) I was thinking also of the fact that if I decide quickly on a gift for somebody I feel very uneasy afterwards that the choice I made really isn't the one I wanted.  And I often have to keep putting off deciding until I think I've seen just about everything that could be possible to see.  And then I weigh over and over again the choices.  (3-minute silence) I was just thinking that it's, the way I approach finding gifts is just like I approach any kind of a job: trying to be very thorough in everything.  But so often, I don't know, I just somehow will miss the point.  And I was thinking in particular with buying gifts I'll miss sort of the feeling of the person I'm buying it for, I somehow lose touch with that.  Or, because I think I worry too much about the impression the gift will have and how it'll reflect back on me.  Or any other kind of a job, I, with all intention of approaching it carefully, will do something, have an accident or be careless over something.  And, and I suppose it's always because I'm worried about some aspect of how the thing is going to reflect on me.</p>

<p>And just the th—, came to my mind something that upset me on Saturday when it happened.  I was already feeling, I don't know, somewhat upset, although I was trying not to let it get into my mind too much.  And when it came time to leave the table after supper, after dinner, uhm, the girl who was giving the dinner always clears the table completely and generally doesn't like anyone to help.  But since there were other cou—, there was another couple there I thought it would be nice to help and just did.  And then I knocked over a glass in doing this, even though I was trying to be careful not to.</p>

<p>ANALYST: This is the, eh, girl you're jealous of, you say, or envious.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  Oh, I know I was feeling clumsy and awkward.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.  Does she have nice crystal or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  I didn't break anything.  I just spilled wine on the table.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It wasn't anything very serious.  It just made me feel even more obviously awkward and clumsy than I was already.  And that, I had felt awkward about offering my help and then I did that, which made my help even less welcome.  (Pause) But there was no reason for that to happen except that I was thinking about myself then and I suppose not just about what I was doing.  Or, somehow what I was doing had too much importance and made me nervous to be doing it.  The same thing used to happen one summer when I was in PBRD.  And, ah, I was on the experiment staying with a family that was sort of an odd kind of a family.  There was no father, he had died.  And, uhm, the woman was a very peculiar kind of a woman, quite bitter in some ways.  And, I don't know, she, she just would approach you in a strange, appr—, anybody in a strange way and wasn't that gracious at all.  And I liked her once I got to know her quite well and used to her way of talking to different people but at first it made me feel very uncomfortable.  And when I tried to help in the kitchen there I'd always break things and knock things over.  And then it got to the point where every time I went in there, I would expect to have an accident (laughs) and I'd get nervous about doing anything.  Then of course something would happen.</p>

<p>(Pause) But this often happens if I'm nervous and then have to do anything with the table or in the kitchen.  (Pause) But I think on Saturday night, it was — I, I was just amazed that I'd done it because there was, the table wasn't that crowded with things so that I could have, could not avoid knocking something over.  And the way I took it it almost seemed like — I don't think I did it on purpose but it was almost as if I was saying, "  see, you're right in thinking of me what you do."  (Pause) And I even felt that way — I think I've already said this but the thought comes again — when I stayed with FYC and MEIR right after MDI was born and I felt that MEIR was being so critical of what I was doing, it just made me again feel very nervous and that probably I was going to do the wrong thing.  And so I'd do something and then I'd wait to have him descend on me.  And, and my reaction was to be either very apologetic or else making excuses for why I did it.  And even when MSCZ and I are entertaining, it used to be, until MSCZ started starting out the evening before a guest came by asking me not to do it, that I would find something to apologize for during the evening.  And I wouldn't even be aware that I'd be doing it but I just had that attitude.</p>

<p>(Pause) And it just seems so strange.  I was thinking today, I was in the bank and the teller made a mistake to the man in front of me and he made it very clear to her what mistake she'd made in rather a nasty way, I thought.  But she became so apologetic and kept saying, "Forgive me, I'm sorry."  And it just bothered me terribly that, seemed to me all she had to do was say it once.  And I'm always annoyed at people who're overly apologetic of making excuses for themself (sic) and yet that's exactly what I'll do.  (Pause) And it just seems strange that I can be so unaware of it or see it as being something so different.  Because somehow I feel whatever it is, that something that needs apologizing for badly.  And I was also thinking of something else MSCZ has always complained about to me that I do.  And it's true, I do.  I find taking compliments on something very difficult too.  It makes me feel very awkward and I have to always sort of belittle the compliment, whether it's on how I look or something I've cooked or something I did in the apartment.  And I'm also inclined to, if MSCZ had anything to do with it at all, sort of give the impression that he did it all and so the compliment would go to him.  And then I feel much easier.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence) I was thinking of my reaction to being on vacation, again, from the standpoint that when people will say to me, "Oh isn't it wonderful being on vacation?"  Invariably I have to react with some reason why there's something not so good about it.  Even, too, when school, when it was announced school would close early I had to find reasons why it wasn't so good that school was closing early and why I didn't particularly care for that decision.  (Pause) I just somehow can't allow myself to do whatever it would be to just enjoy the time.  So then it just becomes a matter of making up a lot of odd jobs or be—, feeling guilty if I'm not and either way, not enjoying it.  And of course, for about a month ahead of this vacation I was thinking of all the things I'd have to do during the vacation, things that I put off until now, probably just to ensure that I'd have things to do.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Your saying this, eh, reminds me of your first question today and the fact that you didn't mention any ideas that you had about the hours that I cancelled.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm sorry, I don't —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You di—, you didn't say what you thought about the, eh, appointments that I've cancelled.  And here you've been talking how you feel about things that are — school closing and —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you mean, now I'll have that time free too?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I, I don't know.  I'm just I'm really asking if you had any —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Thoughts about it at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it did, when you first announced it my reaction was sort of feeling at loose ends enough so that I wasn't even sure which Thursday and Friday you had said would, you wouldn't be here.  Because I was already probably thinking well, what will I do with myself then.  (Pause) It's almost as if that frees the — well, it should have been that tomorrow would be the first day I'd be on vacation.  And then it was almost as if that would, not having to come here too would free the day up too much.  And then I'd be left being able to do absolutely anything I wanted to do with it with no — well, I have my class at night so that wouldn't be true.  But still, just having a free day — I always find the beginning of vacation very hard and it's not simply unwinding from a terrific amount of pressure at my job but being so tired.  Because I might, I don't really felt that tired this time.  (Pause) I also have to make myself get out of the house because otherwise I just won't get out of it at all.  And it's sort of what I will do here with this Christmas vacation is typical of what I'll do in any time and the choices I allow myself to make in the summer vacation.  Either I want to go somewhere where I can be on the beach and just sort of lie around and read literature that's really escape literature or else I want to go somewhere I've never been before.  And then it's sort of, I don't know, it's almost like I make a job out of finding a—, out about the new place and going to all the things you should see and feeling very frustrated if I haven't seen certain things.  And I end up feeling dissatisfied either way.  Because if I'm sitting around reading escape literature, then I feel dissatisfied since I'm just escaping and I know it.  And if I do the other, then I don't really enjoy it because I'm just kind of using some kind of a grim determination to push myself and see all these things that I never even stopped to think if I were interested in.</p>

<p>(Pause) And I know, for this vacation I'll probably somehow delay getting all my gifts until Tuesday so that up until Christmas I'm Christmas shopping.  And then I have some papers I have to do for my course and that will take the rest of the time.  And if MSCZ suddenly said, "Le—, I'll take 2 days off and let's go skiing or something."  I'd, I'd, even if I finally agreed to it, I know I'd put up a fight and I wouldn't want to.  And if I did go it would be mainly because, well, even if he didn't make a big issue of it I would almost feel that he wanted to enough so he was making me go.  And I would probably gather up a whole load of books to read while I was there for my course and do everything I could to spoil just enjoying that.  It's what I've always done.</p>

<p>(Silence) I was just thinking of the difference it is now for me from when I first started working at LKC and had very little responsibility, so that once I left in the afternoon I was free and it was only occasionally, when I was working out some project, that I would have things to do at home and how this had been quite nice for me.  I think in the end the job at school was sort of boring.  I'd like something in between the amount of work I make it for myself now and the responsibility I have.  Because I think I like being able to make decisions but if I'm making them then I always create endless amounts of work for myself.  And I also like taking courses just in the summer when it would be concentrated and I could work as hard as I wanted.  Because in a way you had to in that short time.  But then it would be over and there'd be no extending it so that I couldn't do anything more.  And I think I liked that very much as opposed to having something during the year, when it can just go on forever.  (Pause) But then I still feel confused, since when I first worked here in PKW, I'd made the decision to take a kind of job that would be easier for myself, on whether or not, that's not, in a way, giving in to something.  And it's not really going to solve the problem at all.  It's just getting away from it for a while.</p>

<p>(Silence) And practically everything I've said today, I keep thinking that none of it would be bothering me if I could, whenever I'm in any of those situations, stop thinking about myself and well, if I'm with other people, think about them or if I'm doing a paper or research or something, just thinking about that.  (3-minute silence) On the one hand, I'm trying, or I want very much to not care what people think even though I, right now, do very much.  And yet it just occurred to me that there've been some days when the feeling I've had is wanting people to feel that I'm worth something, a worthwhile human being and, and I don't feel that way.  So in one way I don't want to care how people think but in another way I do want to care.  And I don't know quite how to — well, I guess what it would be is if I thought I was, then perhaps it wouldn't bother me.</p>

<p>(Silence) I suppose that's part of what bothers me that I'm 28.  Because I, when I think about the fact that until I feel better about myself I can't really feel better about so many other things, I don't see how I can feel better about myself until I've felt good about things I'm doing or made or created or whatever.  I don't know, it just seems like a cycle that I can't get out of.  There's no, I don't have any, very much time left to make up for all those years when I didn't feel good about anything that I was doing.  (Silence) The only thing that's occurred to me just right now is that from some of the things I talked about here, I can see where I, where it is, the feelings I have are of guilt feelings and that sometimes there's no reason for them to be there.  So perhaps by breaking down those somewhat I would feel better about myself.  But this is still, I don't know, I just, I almost feel that it's useless to even be worrying about because that'll just keep me from doing whatever it is I could do.  (Pause) And it's just an example, again, of what I've been talking about all day today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

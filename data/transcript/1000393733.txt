<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I was wondering if I could come, uhm, this Friday at 5:00 instead of 2:00 — uh, what is it, 2:00?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah, no, I'm afraid it wouldn't be possible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sniff, Sigh, Silence) In a way I'm feeling I don't know where to start today, as opposed to yesterday when I felt there was nothing.  Today I, or at least, since I was here yesterday, I've just been aware of a million things.  But just then, because I'd asked about changing the time I was thinking of the fact that I was supposed to go to a d—, the gynecologist today, and he had to cancel at the very last minute.  And I, I think, well part of the reason I wanted to go as soon as possible was, that I, I don't know whether it matters, but he wanted to see me four months after I started taking the medication he gave me and if I don't see him within this week, then I probably can't see him for another 2 or 3 weeks.</p>

<p>But I think also I was feeling that I just wanted to hurry and make another appointment, because I hadn't really wanted to make one.  And I don't know, somehow I think I'm afraid that I might just kind of keep putting it off until I just never do it.  I mean it wouldn't really be that way, because I'd just make another appointment later.  But in a way, I don't want to go.  And I was surprised when I realized it, I guess this morning, that I hadn't thought of the fact I was going to the doctor yesterday, when I was here.  Or at least, I connected the fact that I was going today to the way I felt today.  And I don't know whether it really was connected, but last night when I got home, at one point I just suddenly thought of something which I think was either connected with what was on my mind here or was very much part of what I wasn't getting at, but what was on my mind.</p>

<p>Because it just suddenly occurred to me, it was a vague feeling that I would be inadequate as a mother, because I somehow wouldn't be able to do things with children I had that other mothers can.  And I d—, I didn't know exactly how I meant that, except i—  had something to do with having fun with them, and, and being imaginative with them, and helping develop them in a good healthy way.  And then this, well, I don't know, last night I didn't sleep well, I do—, and I don't remember what I was dreaming.  I did when I woke up, but then I, by the time I was getting dressed and tried to remember, I couldn't.</p>

<p>But then, today at school I got in a very bad mood very quickly and I wanted the children to be very obedient.  And one child is the kind who, he's really trying to get attention.  But whenever you're being particularly strict, he just gets (Sniff) well, it's not really bad so much as kind of silly.  But it really bothered me today, and I got awfully mad at him.  And it was just occurring to me a little while ago, that it was the exact opposite of what I, or it was exactly what I was afraid I'd be as a mother.  Or certainly the way I behaved with this boy today was the opposite of what I was hoping I could be, but thinking I probably couldn't be.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm not clear ah whether you meant to imply you were making some connection between this and the going to the gynecologist, and wanting to change the time on Friday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, I don't know.  I somehow, when I realized how I was feeling today at school, connected the feeling I had with the fact I had to go to the gynecologist.   And I was very upset when he had to change.  Because it was one of those things where I wasn't thinking about going there, because I didn't want to think about it.  But yet, I was glad that it finally had come, so it would be over.  (Sniff) And I want, and the reason I wanted to change Friday was so I could go then.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What is the connection then that you feel as p—, I mean how do you connect the way you felt with the boys and going to the gynecologist?  The way you felt about yourself as a mother-to-be.  What was the connection you made?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only thing I can think of is a feeling of being very inadequate and therefore, it makes me feel awful.  But (Pause) I don't quite understand how I feel inadequate in terms of going to a gynecologist, but I, I think I do in some way.  And I know I was feeling inadequate today as a teacher, as far as behaving with the children the way an adult should; in a way it would be meaningful for them.  And it wasn't the whole day so bad as just I knew I was right on the brink.  And then when this boy just kept behaving poorly, I just lost control.</p>

<p>And (Sniff) I don't, I, again I, I may have just assumed there was a connection between the way I was feeling today and going to the gynecologist, when there really wasn't.  But there's certainly the same feeling between that, how I felt last night when I suddenly just thought I ca—, I'll be inadequate as a mother.  And then the way I was feeling today at school, because it's, it's the feeling I can't, I won't be able to handle things.  Or today at school I felt I couldn't.  (Clears throat, Pause)</p>

<p>Pardon me (Clears throat).  Well I just, something else just occurred to me that (Sniff) yesterday I had decided that I would try to get, at least speak to the headmaster's secretary today and ask to see him.  Because right around this time he likes to know who's going to come back.  And FHYZ knows I don't want to, but well, she really suggested this but I, I agreed that he has liked me, and so it would be polite as well as a wise thing on my part to do, go in and tell him personally.  But I felt sort of awkward about it and I was seeing, but, so yesterday I had already, when I came here, knew I was going to do that, too.  And (Sigh) I don't know, in a way I think even though I'd made up my mind and told FHYZ, it's something else to tell him.</p>

<p>And so today when I was seeing his secretary, he walked in.  And she said, "Well why don't you see him now if he can see you?"  And you know, there we both were.  So I saw him today and it was, it was just suddenly there I was.  And I realized I was finding it rather awkward, or it wasn't an easy thing in any case, for me.  And I don't know whether it wasn't easy because he doesn't accept, well in this case he kept saying, here's what you get for a raise and don't make this final, and this and that and the other thing.  Or whether it's because it's really the final step.  Telling FHYZ I could always say, well FHYZ, I've changed my mind.  But telling him, then it's final.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So what you're saying, is that yesterday there were two men that you were thinking about ah seeing.  First the gynecologist and headmaster, and you didn't think about either one.  Here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I don't know, I, I think, all I'm thinking, whatever I think of I think in these terms today, of how inadequate I am.  Because I was thinking of both that while I was talking to the headmaster he kept saying, "Well, you'll be a terrible loss" and I don't know, "We'll never be able to get a teacher that will come up to you," and things like this.  And all I could think is, why doesn't he see me the way I really am?  And it made me feel very uncomfortable.  Because I felt, even if he believes it, and I don't know whether he really does, whether he was just trying to persuade me.  But even if he does, to me it's a lie.</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, just w—, things w—, well, just like the incident today with the boy, that I feel so strongly I mishandled it.  All these times when I do the wrong thing or mishandle situations, would occur to me.  And it was sort of, I wonder why he's saying that.</p>

<p>And the other thing that I think of is, with the gynecologist, I don't know, I just hadn't thought about the fact that he would be examining me just the way I don't like.  But then, I was thinking about the fact that since I'm going to stop taking the pill, both MSCZ and I'd agreed I should start using the diaphragm again.  And I have one, but I haven't ever used it.  Because I started the pill right away.  So I was going to bring that in to see if it still fit, and also to really learn how to use it again, because I don't think I can remember.</p>

<p>And somehow, that really made me, well I don't know what word to use.  I didn't want to think about that aspect of my going in to see the doctor.  And I couldn't find the uhm, diaphragm last night, and I got very upset.  And I just sort of wanted MSCZ to take over.  And I didn't know what I wanted him to do, find it or tell me not to bother, or what.  But somehow, I don't know, it was just not being able to find it I couldn't handle.  Well I did handle it, but I felt as if it were m—, I was making it into a much bigger thing than it was.</p>

<p>And I also noticed, I was cleaning last night and I, I think I felt really angry and I don't know at what.  Because I wanted to get the house clean and, I don't know, in a way I don't mind cleaning that much as long as I have time for it.  But I found last night I was really crashing around and I broke something I like.  And it was almost as if in a way I had no control over my body, and so that I would be clumsy with the vacuum cleaner.  But on the other hand, it was almost as if I were purposely breaking things or nicking things, and that type of thing. (Sniff)</p>

<p>And that makes me think of, well I went to bed feeling angry, I think.  And then at sometime in the night, I don't remember when, the telephone rang and MSCZ answered it.  It was a wrong number and it made me think of several calls I've had recently that have been the wrong number.  And I think the same person has been calling and that he's been doing it on purpose.  And last night when this call came in, I immediately thought of that and wondered if it were the same person again, and began to get really worried that, almost as if I'm thinking he's after me and he'll just do something to me when MSCZ's not here.  And it was after that that I began to have all sorts of nightmares and it seemed like I just steadily had nightmares from then on.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking again of, the way I felt at school, and the incident that ah, really has bothered me happened near the end of the day.  But yet, I can't distinguish between when I began to feel so angry that any little thing was going to make me lose control, and when things have been going better.  Because the boys really did some very good things in the morning and, and yet I think I felt that way then and,  just wondering what I was so angry about.  Because I know I had nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, already you said you were angry last night.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) But I don't understand what made me feel so angry last night, either.  Except, unless it had something to do with feeling so inadequate.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>What I keep thinking now too, is that whatever I was angry at, it did have nothing to do with the children and it was really disturbing me that I do take it out on them that way.  That I can't feel nice toward them or be nice to them when I am feeling angry like that.  And I, I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that they're smaller and younger and sort of defenseless that I behave the way I do.  Because they can't fight back, really.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think what I'm thinking about now, is how I d—, well, sort of,  it's almost win back, and not just behave nicely to the boys, and so forth.  But almost to win them back.  And I think I felt very much, whether or not this is really true of FYLR, that she was disapproving of my behavior, because I was.  So I assumed she was.  Although I don't know what she thought, because she never said anything.  And, and so it's sort of a combination of after behaving the way I did, I think I must, I don't know, lessened myself in everyone's eyes, and how to sort of build myself back again.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, I know if I felt adequate, I wouldn't think in those terms at all.  Or even if tomorrow I felt adequate, I doubt, I'd be thinking well, today I've got to be nice because yesterday I was so awful.  I just would know I was doing the right thing.  And it's feeling inadequate that, that just seems like wasting, well just wasting everything.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I keep thinking too, yesterday, at school anyway, things went quite nicely.  And so I, it must be something that I began to think about when I was here that led me to feel so inadequate or to have let the feeling come to the surface.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And what comes to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Interrupts) I, I, I can't remember what I talked about yesterday.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But what comes to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) It seems like nothing.  (Silence) Well then I thought (Clears throat), how can I be adequate, if my mother wasn't?  And then I (Clears throat) remembered at least that I was talking about my father's family, I think it was yesterday, anyway.  But I, that's what I was recalling.  And that made me just feel the feeling is also, not just how could I be adequate if my mother wasn't.  As if I have to be exactly the same.</p>

<p>But how can I escape what my parents and their families are, and what I've known?  And it's almost like just the way I used to feel when I would think of FEIZ, last year's assistant, and her outlook on things, and what life must have been like for her at home.  And it was just so alien.  I don't know, it was almost as if I couldn't imagine it.  And (Swallows), and I know then, I used to sometimes wonder how could I almost be like it, not that I want to be exactly like it, but the things I liked about it, I, I didn't understand how they could be mine.  Because that hadn't been what I had grown up with.  And so, it's somehow this feeling I can't escape from, something that I want to. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: It occurs to me that uhm, right at the beginning today, you asked me to change uh the appointment on Friday.  Now you're telling me that you feel very strongly right now, that you feel you really can't escape you're past.  Which is to say, in effect, that you feel you can't change the way you feel.  That it isn't changing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) I guess I (Clears throat), I understand the connection, but I don't know what to make of it.  And that, I can see where that, saying that is hostile to you.  But I don't know whether that's the only way I meant it, or if I meant it that way at all.  Or if the feeling about my past is part of what bothered me last night, or just what.  Or whether everything, or that comment in particular came from the fact that today you couldn't change Friday.  (Pause)</p>

<p>So anyway, right now I was thinking that whatever, uh, wh—, just trying to look at whatever that might mean is more than I want to handle.  And I was thinking almost I have this feeling right now of not being able to handle things.  And the,n it struck me that it's really, I don't want to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't, I know it's connected, but I don't quite know in what way.  Instead of feeling exactly inadequate when I wh—, thought of just not being able to handle things, right now, I also was feeling, I don't know, almost undesirable or unloved, or something, and that type of feeling.  It's al—, it's almost as if what's the point of trying to handle things?  But last night it was connected with feeling angry.  And I suppose today it could be too, if w—, that comment came purely out of being hostile to you.  (Silence, Stomach growls)</p>

<p>I was just thinking too that when you said you couldn't change the time Friday, I know for awhile I was quiet.  And one of the things on my mind, it was really a question, of how do I feel about the fact that you've really refused something I asked of you.  And then I started thinking it was sort of (Stomach growls), I must have, I, I don't know, I didn't really feel I was feeling it.  But yet, I wanted to talk about how I didn't know how I felt about going to this doctor.  Wh—, I don't know, i—, in a way it was almost, a way to tell you I had very good reason to ask what I did.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

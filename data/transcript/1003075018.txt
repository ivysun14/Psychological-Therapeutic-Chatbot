<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Anyway, so what's doing?  So when did you have those, they last for a while?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They start growing out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are those your nails or they're —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, they're fake.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're fake, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  I was going to say that's pretty amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever grow nails that long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, over the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They don't, like, chip or break or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They did, that's why I just cut them all off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Yeah.  Um, it's hard to hit people —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With long nails because they break or you would scratch somebody.  No, I'm kidding.  Um, all right.  Anyway, you know I have secret, um, signals with your father —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you come in.  Did you ever see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING] I always look at him, and I go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he goes like that.  So that's good.  Right.  Okay.  You're doing pretty well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  How's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, all right.  So how did you do, how many are you taking, how many classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean 8.  I have 4 a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four?  I'm reading the wrong thing.  Your, your, um, what am I doing here?  No wonder, it's like this makes absolutely no sense.  Yeah, you have 4 blocks —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, all right.  I already took your temp, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let me try that again.  All right, let's start over.  You know I have this secret code with your father.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, all right, here we go.  So, um, what did we do?  We did something because you were, your mother was, uh, did we call her —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Last time when you were here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so, we went back on the Focalin and added the Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I only tried the Focalin.  I didn't try the Provigil yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  So, but we did the, we do the pills?  We did the pills, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Focalin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not the capsules?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're., like, little white pills, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  And we just, we just did one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that last long enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  How about homework?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do homework in school, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so what, did we start on a half?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, I took a whole pill I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you just, um, yeah.  I mean, it, uh, right away you took a whole pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's fine.  Um, so the biggest thing was making sure it works.  And it does last, um, the whole day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and you do your homework in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum, in Study Hall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have to have Study Hall every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Basically, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Basically.  What's basically mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a class that I don't do anything, so it's just like a Study Hall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's in, something about child development, something like that.  We don't do anything in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just sit there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The teacher doesn't talk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She does, but we don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you just do your own —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just do other things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, are you eating?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  That's the biggest impediment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right?  That was the biggest problem.  Um, all right.  That's, uh, and you're eating, like, a normal amount?  Which if my memory serves me well, is a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have a big ap, good appetite, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This was really, all these things were, you know, I think we were on the higher dose at one point of the Focalin, and it was really, um, like the Vyvanse, I mean it was knocking out your appetite.  Eat lunch even?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes, it depends what they have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you weren't on the medicine —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would I eat lunch?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably not, because the food's nasty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's the sa, I mean, uh, it would depend on what they have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So there's no difference in terms of —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you'd eat for lunch if you were on or not on the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, like, what do you eat there and what don't you eat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing I eat, really, is their pizza.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's all?  So what do you do the other days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.  I don't eat anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't bring stuff?  Or they don't have like, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or I'll just eat a cookie.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Um, I think, if I, if I remember right, I think they made pizza almost every day; that was one of the choices when I was in high school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think so.  Do you eat breakfast?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes you're rushing —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or something.  Do you eat dinner?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mother's a good cook?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's okay?  [LAUGHING], um, I don't know why I'm laughing, but, um, I can just picture her giving you some kind of look if you, if she was here when you said that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I know, my mother was not, she, she could bake, she was a reasonable baker, but she wasn't much of a cook.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like, my father usually worked 4, at least 4 nights a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She would, like, throw in a bag of, like, Pennsylvania Dutch Noodles —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then stick in half a thing of cottage cheese —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And mix it together, and that's what we'd have.  Or boil a cabbage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or something.  But, um, I don't know, my wife on the other hand, um, is way too good of a cook, way too good, uh, my God.  So no headache, stomachache?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, this is excellent.  So this is helping.  Your, your grades are okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get in, yeah, you got interims; do you have finals soon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We have them in January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, finals?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you got exams and then, all right.  How were your interims?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They were pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When did you get them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How do you remember that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was looking at it today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's impressive.  I was going to say, God, something's working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and, of course the fact that you didn't know the date today was perfectly understandable —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Since you're on vacation.  So, um, all right, finals in January.  All right, so I don't know, I mean, it just sounds really, um, I guess you can hold off, do you get up in the morning okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  As long as, um, as the 5 mg Focalin works, let's stick with that.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So do you, I don't know.  If there's problems with studying, or something for finals, call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, because you can always take an extra half in the early, or the mid afternoon or something when you get home, if you need to study, and it shouldn't keep you up late.  Um, do you take it on, uh, are you taking it on vacation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Are you all right driving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not, like, jamming the brakes on at the last minute?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You pay attention?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's, um, that's one of the more dangerous things.  You got to be careful.  You know.  All right.  For now, we'll leave you alone.  I mean, do you think you're going to need more when you're studying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So we'll hold the Provigil.  We'll give, I'll give you another script.  And if you want to come back in, like, I don't know, 5 weeks or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something like that.  You take it, like, right before you leave the house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  There's that.  Um, all right.  What are you doing next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably going to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?  For 2 years, or 1 year, or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably for 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then what are you looking at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably going to [DEIDENTIFIED] for criminal justice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Criminal justice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, in [DEIDENTIFIED], in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Close to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Close to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Where is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  I think we talked about this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Several time probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I probably, the first time you said this, I probably said, "[DEIDENTIFIED]?"  I never, didn't I say that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I never heard of that.  Yeah, I remember.  All right, um, that's good, you have goals, things are good.  All right, so let's see you in around 5 weeks or so, let me turn this off.</p>

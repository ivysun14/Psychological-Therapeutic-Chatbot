<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That clock is - I've been to this - I'm sorry it stays. It's starting at 6:07 on the counter. Interview Three. Interview Three. Try this for me, it's like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I'm sorry if I'm a little short (ph) of time because it feeling real hot here today...doing this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Isn't this place air conditioned?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is but they don't have it on yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like it's on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know there's some sun shining through the glass in the window, not in the afternoon though. [inaudible at 0:00:37.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Kind of rough going back to work today (chuckling) after being off a week, especially when the sun's shining. We've started already huh? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pardon?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said you started it already.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Right on time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm quick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't waste any time. (chuckling) You skip all formalities. (chuckling) Let's talk about today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You're in love?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Always, hoping I can learn to overcome.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel, you can feel, is it essentially nervous in here, because [I know we talked this week because I know you and then it gets more so in here?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: More so in here you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it a general kind of feeling (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really. Depending on who I'm talking to and what kind of situation I'm...meeting new people for the first time, it's a, it's a nervousness on my part...but usually...it doesn't take long for me to kind forget it...but the first time, yes, it is nervous when you're talking to people for the first time. I don't know why. (chuckling) I never really thought about it before, I'm glad you asked the question. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's something to think about. (chuckling) I think it's...sometimes maybe I'm afraid that...what they're thinking of me...and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you look... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like what kind of a reception you're going to get... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or something that you, how you come across?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not just kind of [normally to be there without...] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know freely and spontaneously?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I never had really an opportunity to be free and spontaneous though... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's either...strained. I mean during school or anything like that it was pretty, it's spontaneous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By the time you get to meet it's back in the right... [inaudible at 0:02:47.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...really... [inaudible] ...because you're never feeling really just relaxed and able... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to do whatever occurs to you, perhaps wondering about what, how you'll be seen for doing something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, really. (chuckling) So I always have to...always wear your tie. (chuckling) Just like mom says, "It's your like proof." But I don't know why they do it. I don't know. At any rate I'm feeling better now. (chuckling) [0:03:21.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You must, I mean talking about the mood (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (chuckling) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...at such times mood can be everything (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not there or...it's not as settling (ph) as it was before. I don't know, it's kind of bad. You know they're crying about my homosexual problem. I don't know how they got this...really wide-eyed (ph) about that too. I often wondered about that too, why? They...like it's always...well you blame it on your, your parents or your, or your father or something like this you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if he's the answer... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...it's really kind of thing, and I thought...it's kind of like a number of things that kind of like add to everything, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can I do this, these tremendous (ph) things you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. Well when I was in, when I went, when I was working downtown and I was a senior and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in college or high school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: High school and I worked all through, a senior in high school and I worked also before I went to college. And I was working in a department store and I used to work a lot...like after school and like everybody would be gone...and then just...and at first...like I was really kind of wrapped around the job...and always doing my job, I was getting like that, and then it got to the point where I knew the job so well that I could get it done so quickly and...like I had time on my hands. And when it started there was a Chris on the floor that tuned out to be a gay Chris...and...had been in there and was going...[and this, the guy was up close to you] (ph)...it's a bummed (ph) way to feel and I think...it really kind of felt good...so that's how it all got started there, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like that you would be like that with this person. [inaudible at 0:05:33.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You walked around him or... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and tremendous guilt feelings though afterwards, you know, I'll never go back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, how do you, how do you deal with... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...this sensitive issue, moral codes are all strange (ph) there for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. What I should have done was quit. (chuckling) But it was really...it was a really easy job (chuckling) and it was nice because...you could figure out... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it made diversions in your job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...and you could, I could pick my hours when I...when, after class and the only other thing was having...in this job that I knew of where...you could pick your hours and come in when you want to and leave when you want to as long as you worked there...and I was getting good at it so there was really no problem, so that's how it all got started there. And it got...it got to be...to the point...well, one time there was this one guy who invited me up to his place, he lived downtown so I went over there...and I slept with him and it was kind of nice too, you know. [0:06:40.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was never able to perform fellatio on anyone else...I can, just can never do that and so, and I still don't but it's just kind of really...relieves me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I understand, it's like now somehow it's done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don, yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you fell it's... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of...breathe freely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's sort of done (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about when you were speaking with...at first you just said... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, about the same thing...I mean not that we were really into it. Well just...like I knew, I got to know this guy kind of quite well...and I had went up to his place a number of times and all this stuff, and then - how many years ago - he didn't go, he didn't go, yeah, he was acting (ph) something like that. It turned out that I had syphilis, came up with syphilis from this guy and he had tried to perform anal intercourse and he didn't really but he did enough damage (chuckling) to have...for me to contract syphilis, so that was another problem (ph) and going through the...it was I ended up in the hospital I mean because I had to take the colon... [inaudible at 0:08:07.3] ...and...operate and all this stuff and it had kind of fallen in and I wasn't, so now then I broke out from all this kind of, kind of sore and it was really a mess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just kind of like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really. But then I really, and...I never could... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's an ordeal to go through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was, it really way. And then...you have to go down and do the health thing and all this stuff and report this guy and...all this stuff...so that was kind of really an ordeal. And then I vowed of course never again (chuckling) and that didn't work either; never learn, but, so. That was...I just...I just often wondered why...and I would kind of...say, "Why! Why! Why!" You know. And despite the fact that oh, I'd never, I never would perform fellatio on anyone else...they'd say, oh well then I really couldn't be a homosexual and I said, "Well, no, that's not right."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know you're still having this thing with men and I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of hard to just...where you kind of like, it's been really like a long time and...you've kind of thought to yourself a homosexual life is really just the person you love is a man and you realize... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you have to go [through this kind of pain.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. (chuckling) And just and I, and the way, and I...I was thinking about the way...the way it is, not the way - what I am and....how I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible] [0:09:45.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when we were younger...and it was, so it was like...I was never good in sports or anything like that...another...college...football and they'd say - I always went out...I always went out (chuckling) but I was never picked...and it was like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you wanted to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I always wanted to be...and I was never picked... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of felt like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because I was never good enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so you were down kind of with things more considering (ph) that... [overlapping voices at 0:10:13.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, feel masculine about, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that's right, if you were feeling masculine and you could've had... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...masculine and you would be good for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, really. And that, and then the thing was I have a younger brother whose, oh, he's only a year and a half younger than I and we were really like, when we were younger...we always played baseball and things together and he was always picked and I wasn't...because he was better than I was in baseball...and little league was so big then it was just unbelievable...it was really kind of a kick in the pants...I was on the team but I'd - he'd be out there playing and I'd be on the bench...and I just said, "Oh, Christ!" And then...it got to the point where I...couldn't be bothered...if I'm going to sit here and wait, well I'd just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you are kind of sitting on the edge of being (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and kind of well this is not for me to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So and kind of feeling... [inaudible at 0:11:00.9] ...you know what I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I can wait as long as it's your abilities in that... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the truth, really, to really know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the problem, you're really kind of hurting inside at the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was, yeah. And even when, and I always have looked young for my age and I...I...[I see for these in the right spot] (ph) well also it was in high school...so I was...I was really a late bloomer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of felt like something was wrong with you more... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, right, just something was wrong with me (chuckling) there too, right. That...like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just weren't like all the others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, that's the truth...just wasn't like all the other boys and...it's kind of a shame that that's true, you know. So, but after, well and then even when I was in high school I remember...you had to take gym, of course you had to swim in the raw...and I hadn't reached puberty yet, so I wouldn't take swim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just kind of be in the water, you'd be just sitting around... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...feeling really down... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like you were undeveloped?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. But then after I, I remember I'd...like I'd sign up for ROTC and then, but after I was, after I was like a junior I quit...I quit and then I went into the gym program...for my junior and senior year...and by that time I was in bed with Kirsten and so there was really no hassle there (chuckling) but until then. I don't know it's just, well...like the whole family, well my brother looks older than I do...and he's doing really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but just kind of like I can really kind of get a taste...with [he teased me...he younger and I think so I need to get over it and keep moving forward and I mean coming there was something more to it... [0:12:50.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean like a re-blooming (ph) or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So something about you in the masculine and you in touch with what you're missing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, (chuckling) that's the truth. You know it's like...like I never really had any really - well - in grammar school we were always kind of...just close...we had like a, there was a group of kids in the old neighborhood and we were always kind of close, but...as, then high school came along and I went to a public high school and actually friends with girls throughout high school. And then...I had...there were friends in school but no friends from the neighborhood that were really close...they were real...but then, then...they were...we'd go out...and we'd just hang around the park and things like that but they were...they were - and then after that then the neighborhood scene started to change...and everybody was moving away and this is...my latter part of high school I think it was...and then there was no on left...and I really, there wasn't, there aren't any really close friends I have that are male...male friends. So like, I mean...there's some that I do... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like...you weren't when you were younger but...now that you're several years older it's just like you weren't the boy among the boys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, that's it, yeah, right, (chuckling) a boy among boys, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know or...kind of like...like you were kind of alone and so like didn't, kind of metaphorically sitting on the bench where you didn't have to do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, that's it, (chuckling) because you couldn't play baseball well and...you couldn't play football well and all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you felt left out from this... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and feeling like this... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...well what will you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the truth, yeah. You know and this...why...the picking of teams and you're always the last one standing there... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...all saying, "You can have him." (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like no one was...going to have you on their team.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like that sinking feeling like that nobody wants you and like you're just inept in it...so it's hard to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I wasn't good. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can gather that...like in how that feels with you [when you were in high school.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I must have been really awful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it was, it was...really kind of bad. But I mean I...like I'd play...I just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd play in this pretender's role but for you it was kind of a... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...for you it was something you needed from them and so like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, I could never...really - but that...like and then just, and then and even like even today...I meet...[it's pretty on a Thursday] (ph) so I'm like in the old neighborhood and things like that...no, but I mean I think I was, I looked at, I'm one of few who went on to college...and went through college and no one has gone to college and I thought, "Well here I go again..." [0:15:57.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "...being the strange one."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just because you're the only one going to college? [overlapping voices at 0:15:59.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that...it was police in a lot places, a lot of policemen and...a lot of...mechanics and stuff like that...and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And here you are being this mechanic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, (chuckling) just different all over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And it's really true, like if you were away from that whole life you'd been like having to play for this... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and look where I am now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, that's the truth. That's the truth, always just being kind of different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess kind of like they looked at you from when you left and I get this kind of sense you're feeling just like...my feel is...that they've kind of drilled into me masculine like...all their, like a boy among other boys...feeling like, like I'm like them... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of had something to do with kind of like pushing you towards homosexuality... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...somehow like you just can feel a sense of your maleness... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and wanted to relate to women... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and relate to them sexually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. Because of...just, it's frightening (ph). But I...I, I was in...I want to say, I...I always got along well with...women, of course that was another thing, when I was younger and my mom always worked...at night both of my parents always worked, so and my older sister, she was kind of like left in charge, so...it was like she was the one...who told you what to do and she was the one who took care of all the, all the matters (chuckling) and you just kind of depended upon her...she was there...she was always the one who did this. And so I don't remember, I just never had anybody...like my mother had said...that she used to send me to school with her...and she'd just wouldn't let me go...just to really get started. You know she, my mother said, "Okay, you're responsible for your brother." And she just...she takes responsibility very, too hard, and...she wouldn't let me go. And finally...had to come up and say, you know, "Well would you tell her to let him alone."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And she did not like to hear that.] (ph) [0:18:07.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was...we always, I was always with her...and she was, she always watched over all three of us more often and there's really not that much difference, age difference, she's probably two and half years...now it's nothing but then of course it was something they'd, she being that much older than me, which is just kind of strange though. (chuckling) And then kind of that my brother is the complete opposite of me, he's the rebel (chuckling) and I was always afraid to do something wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it kind of felt like you were always, was just kind of... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...always there to do something, like a goodie-goodie.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the goodie-goodie, yeah, always just...always afraid to do something wrong...I was afraid of getting caught (chuckling) and usually if I tried something I did. It felt...I was always afraid...of getting caught in doing something really. [0:19:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's just kind of like, kind of stifling and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like any kind of expression of your own... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...individuality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, like I just wanted to do it and...and but always afraid of doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was all kind of just like you coming through your childhood knowing at times that that's happening... [inaudible at 0:19:20.3] ...like this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's the truth, that's the truth. You know like I don't know, sort of...like my brother always did things wrong (chuckling) and it didn't bother him though, it still doesn't bother him. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [But it's not the same.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know, but at any rate, I mean I'm wondering in close...has this, this, this all added up to my homosexuality or whatever. I don't know...I just...I'm just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes sense in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it...right...I just am trying to - and...now well use the word 'justify', you know in my head, you know, "Well this is the way I was and this is the way I will be." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I've got a sense that you feel like you've sort of, you feel really lousy, you feel lousy about kind of being...homosexual, meaning that you've let... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of feeling as if you have to explain it to both, to three-quarters of the... [inaudible at 0:20:25.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and three-quarters you've explained... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...and I just don't have enough male hormones (chuckling) or something...right...I just am trying to explain it and I really or...I just think, all these reasons go through my head and I get - then I think back to what I'm saying, you know, "Well does that make any sense? Well I don't know." (chuckling) You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...I guess it can make, it makes a whole lot of sense... [inaudible at 0:20:49.0] ...I mean it's clear to yourself how you like to be on [my own.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whereas with I mean sitting on the bench and really always being the last picked...having boyfriends to rough around with... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or just what you are, what you do now with those boys... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean may have turned you into this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember playing with my sister's dolls and my mother saying, oh, she threw a fit...and I remember just feeling upset about that one time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you know... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that is what you really wanted to do... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and it must have been awful for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really. (chuckling) So, I don't know maybe - I don't know...I mean what brings it out further clearer than that...but, yeah, I still can't stifle my...it's just...like I, I still need some form of sexual relief...and I can't...I still can't stifle it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and don't keep changing and just be who you've always wanted... [overlapping 0:21:52.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...that's true, right, because I feel...it feels good, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but I guess...the question is for you to get...will it feel good in your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...that's true, that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And...you do see it's not like...it isn't like you're not attracted to men, I mean you are. [0:22:09.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And having it kind of like where you learned that you can have that sexual relief again is...you've probably found that you have it with women too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I hope so. (chuckling) It's something to hope about. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:22:39.5]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (chuckling) right, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I mean it's like that.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. (chuckling) And you're right. But it's like, and then Tanya came home yesterday but...like she was, and she had been to the Bahamas last year...and she met this guy there in the Bahamas...and she never really came out and talked to me about it...more or less. It was kind of like...I knew about it but, so what...it wasn't...like anything allowed to...she didn't say, "well I met this guy in the Bahamas", and all this stuff and...she just brang up the question about marrying this guy and all this stuff...and then she went back and then, she went back twice, she was there like twice last year, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And he knew she was coming?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Let's see when was it. [I mean it was very common] (ph), I think from... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That she goes to the Bahamas?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, Bahamas, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she's a native of the Bahamas there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's a native, I think he's from Nassau, yeah, from Nassau, he's a native Nassuian (ph) of the Bahamas or whatever it is. Anyway, he lives down there and so, so it's...she went down twice last year...and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [To see this guy?] (ph) [0:24:12.3]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's, I...she's really serious about this guy, at least she was last year...and she only went down twice last year. And then this year she just...just came back this year and she...like she won't, never really came out and...said anything to me...or, but...like her, my old friend Katie will say something to me...like...and, and her...her mother is just up in the air about the whole thing and her mother cries every time she is with that man because...he's black and she doesn't want her mother upset with it and all this stuff. (chuckling) Now, well this time...she was, she, she mentions his name all the time saying good things about it...and she gets all, how really weird this time and things...the people have really changed...like she didn't even mention anything about him being changed or anything like that really. I think it's...just kind of, I imagine she's kind of like in between too...she doesn't know which way to turn... [0:25:16.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so like... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...unsure of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe it's just like, yeah... </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know it feels kind of, you get kind of anxious when you think about her... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...traveling with this... </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I thought to myself, "Okay, you know you can go down to the Bahamas and see him, well go ahead then, just forget it." You know that's what I felt like yesterday...forget our... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Our relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. You know, "Okay, you can go down there and go to the Bahamas."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it really made you angry kind of... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...just that there might be someone else for her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, and I just said, "Okay." But of course...and of course that would be letting me off the hook too...and maybe I, I'd be...kind of like justifying this and say, "Okay."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:25:52.5]...your reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then, then there wouldn't be any threat at all...as far as Tanya is concerned there wouldn't be any threat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [There wouldn't be any sense that you'd lost something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's right, yeah, I realized that too, but...like they're two things, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like one part of you would be lost and I think the other part is could you lose your way or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, that's it...that's, that's her thing. (chuckling) And I thought about that last night...and I said...I don't know, maybe she won't...go down there and I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it sounds like maybe you're using her and...it's like you don't want her to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't want her to do that, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really do want her in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And while her... [inaudible at 0:26:32.7] ...is nothing, you want her to want you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but...then again like I said...just her being more or less poses a threat as far as sexually is concerned...and the big question that's there...and, and then I...I thought..."well why should I be...so selfish...she, she doesn't...I'm not satisfying her...no way", so, like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what right do I have... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...is what you're thinking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, what right, yeah, what right do I have to resent her for...doing what she wants.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess in a way...like it's, you're dependent (ph) with her... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...when really you just want to have a real... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...full relation with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] You know there is, it...it's just and then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know... [inaudible at 0:27:21.7] ...feel bad, kind of makes you feel all...like when you, when it's...at first you turn back see them, it kind of makes you feel worse about [the ending you know] (ph)... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I you get to feeling you're hang-ups...[maybe a little more.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think she's...like went down with her sister and her girlfriend and they came back a day earlier than she did...she stayed on another day and I thought, "Oh...well so she's probably just going to stay down there." Then I'd think, "Well this is it...she's, she's just gone." (chuckling) But she admitted someday...yesterday... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know? You think she will?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know her, and her sister, now her sister had said...that she had talked to her mother and her mother was just...up in the air (chuckling) that...she had stayed down an extra day and all this stuff, but she's very... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of bothered you too? [0:28:16.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, it bothered me...and it really...it did and, but then I thought... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...then I thought, "Well...well then..." And then I just kind of like...when I heard that I thought, "Well that's it." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like more... [inaudible at 0:28:32.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right...like the plane was late and all this stuff and I was sitting there and I said, "Well that's it." (chuckling) You know but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were having a feeling of loss, yeah, is that what it was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] But...she didn't, it was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've seen so many complexes (ph)...therapy reminds you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then...I'm sure it could be like that and...I'm really...I'm sure it could happen. (chuckling) But because I never did, like I said I never, she never really discussed it with me...I mean she never really, I mean she talked on but there's never really a... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She hasn't said this, just talks around it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Around it, yeah, right...about...while he was with her, that he was with her the first night and all this stuff...and she never really said anything to me about...her feelings toward him...but then...there are certain, you can pick it up and all this stuff. And... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you sense it and you know... [overlapping voices at 0:29:22.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah, I know he's some fine...mad affair (chuckling) and good for her. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you say, you get fired (ph) by the fact she comes in and tempts (ph) you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This always leads to attempts on you it seems like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I also sense how you feel bad, like you don't feel like you should be this kind of guy... [overlapping voices at 0:29:38.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like you should feel bad about the fact that she's leading you on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, (chuckling) I really seem to. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's kind of just like...you maybe don't want her to be seeing him so often... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you want her to stay with you and see what happens between you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[and that it's safer there.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) You know, because...and then I'd keep on saying to myself, "Well...it's her right...she's an independent person, she can do what she...wants to do...in her relations." I've got hang-ups about that but at any rate, that's a story there. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I'd ask you the same thing.] (ph) [0:30:17.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what else to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that kind of make you feel awkward having some concerns like, like you're doing things and how you know it's going to look to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I understand it though (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's about half. Does it kind of make you feel nervous and see the possibility of your being different talking with her and kind of makes you want to know her enough to say it, not unless she's... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I miss her, I never really thought about it. Really. I, I mean maybe...I'm...it's like say for instance if he were...like if he wasn't in the Bahamas and he were like here...it probably would be an entirely different story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just incredible stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, really...like it wouldn't be like...like you have to hop a plane and go thousands of miles away...it would be different, yeah, and I don't know, yeah. If you, if he were here probably...I really probably would then...but like now it really doesn't pose that much of a big problem...because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's just an objection over... [overlapping voices at ]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...until... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because that's just a minor... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you told me, so she's there... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, goes again, right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and here she is just having come back and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you're living your life and feeling okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you seen her since she's come back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You picked her up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I picked her up or...like...it's, she's just...she's talking about...her coming down there and so there was some problem about some, some girl he was going out with or something and this girl says that she was married to him and his size was... [inaudible at 0:32:23.2] (ph), some big lie or something. And she was saying that - oh, and she came out and they, they were on motorcycles...coming to get her and Robert and this other, her girlfriend and this other guy or something, and this girl comes out and then he sees her waiting out in the front for him or her with two bottles in her hand...and ready to kill him, (chuckling) and he was standing there...and just really pissed because she had gotten herself pregnant all of this stuff, and she goes that she thought it was rude of him...to involve her in this type of a situation and she's, "You knew that I was coming down." And all this stuff, so they wrote...that he really should've gotten all his matters straightened out and all that stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not involved her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, and not involved her in this stuff. Because...she just is, I guess - but...like it's...she tells me about all the, she tells me about...all these instant (ph) things, I mean she didn't mention anything about the fact that she planned out to see him again or...she was really serious about him or anything like that...she never really said it or anything like that you know. I mean I'm just, well I know she had talked, she's talked to Katie...her best friend about it...and but she's never...said anything to anyone else I don't believe. And her mother found one of her letters one time when she was away in Europe last year...or was it - I don't know when, but...she calls up in tears and all this stuff, (chuckling) so I wasn't crazy about that. I don't know, (chuckling) so, I had no way to sift through that, talking to her and she called me up and said that...she was home and that she was coming in later and well something about [abuse, abuse] (ph) or something like that, yeah. But I don't know, and then she probably, Tanya probably...has this, Tanya probably has this thing about...like she would be completely outside her family...them...and leaving New York and all that stuff, she has lots of things wrong probably too, so. I think this is, this is the first time that she's ever had a sexual relationship with any man. [0:34:38.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Oh, you think?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so it's a big thing for her too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean she's had sex with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, probably. I don't know she might have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm...[she might have.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of a big thing for her in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, it is...it's a big thing for her...too many big things [to hide.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hiding (ph) the fact that this is... [inaudible at 0:34:54.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like deal with the truth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I should be, yes. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like this time in the Bahamas she was there and watching... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, watching it all go by.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Viewing it like the Romans.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And...feeling kind of more and more intense about it...her own shortcomings, uncertainties... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...sexual uncertainties.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because...like I thought to myself, "You know when I pick her up I should at least kiss her hello." Then I thought to myself, "Well why...she's been, just gotten, gone down and saw another fellow!" I mean, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then so, so... [inaudible at 0:35:38.1] ...kind of lady?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. I thought, "Well, what the hell, why should I give her the satisfaction." Which is kind of rotten on my part, I mean...she probably sensed it though, I know she did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) I know she did, but she would never say anything to me about it or maybe just not to give me the satisfaction knowing that she will. I don't know. (chuckling) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of sounds as though Tanya [wants you to fight for her.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here you were picking her up and so it's kind of she's dealing with you and sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have the kind of relationship that you don't have but you want to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like, like with you respecting class.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know who would travel over thousands of miles to see me? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe if she had to maybe, like if she had trouble and she needed to travel... [overlapping voices at 0:36:38.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of like just to talk to me about these things... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...maybe he'll sense it while I'm gone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:36:46.0]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that even when, before she left, we were sitting, and her brother-in-law was supposed to go with her and her brother-in-law cancelled out, so she was, "Well he's going to school too and he's doing this paper so he wasn't able to go." So because she also was telling...this friend of hers that wanted to go, so they wanted...the three of them, but...we were sitting around, it was after dinner and her mom was there and her mom goes, "Oh, well why aren't you going to the Bahamas?" And I said, "Well I wasn't asked." I mean...it wasn't and her mother...turns to her, "Well why didn't you ask Connor to go?" And, "Are you afraid..." something like, what was it - "Are you going to do something down there that you don't want him to see?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's, "I don't know how you..." She said, "No." And that was all. She said 'no' and that was all...I mean, "No, it's none of your business." or something...to that effect, you know. [0:37:45.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you felt left on the... [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really...I wasn't asked to go...I couldn't have gone anyway I don't have the money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I mean once, but you sounded like...like you're asking yourself, "Well what's she doing with that man down in the Bahamas?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really, yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why wasn't I asked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...I would've cramped her style. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. Kind of like that's what you feel like that I mean you're cramping her style... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you don't have money or anything... [overlapping voices at 0:38:09.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. So that would be it. But I don't know what's going to happen, no one can tell. I don't know how I'll feel the next time I see her...I don't know how long it's been really - I don't know, well (chuckling) that's...I... [0:38:32.3]</p>

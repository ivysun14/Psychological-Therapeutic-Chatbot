<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How was your week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was good. It was really good. Wish it had been a little warmer. Other than that it was good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:15.2) I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how did that go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well here's the thing. I didn't have a whole lot of opportunity to use it. There was only one time where I really felt like I was going off the edge. So —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There were a couple of times when I did the "don't talk to me now." Like we had the whole "don't talk while I'm panicked" mode kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So there were a few times where I got a little bit panicky and I was just like, "All right. Just give me a second."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then you know, breathe. Kind of walk away. I did the water thing once.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I could come back. And it felt really different. It felt like I was able to stop that kind of thought process from going on. Like it allowed me to just disassociate for a second and then come back. There was only time I was really over the edge and felt really frustrated. And I actually consciously was like, "Okay. These are the things I'm supposed to be doing. I'm supposed to be walking away, saying I can't talk right now, splashing water in my face, (inaudible at 0:01:27.0).</p>

<p>And it really — it was so frustrating because I went, "This is the perfect opportunity." And we literally, my fianc� and I, were walking out the door to meet people literally two minutes later. And I'd just done my makeup. So I was like, "I can't splash water on my face." (Laughing) (inaudible at 0:01:46.0) So I really thought in my head, "You're in panic mode. Be silent for a second." [0:01:53.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I was quiet. Even though I was wishing I could go splash my face. I was just quiet for a second. Took a deep breath. And then just forced myself, just kissed my fianc�, "Okay let's go out and have fun." And we went out and had fun. And it like stopped there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that was the one time — it would have been a great excuse to actually do it. And I really thought about it. I really like those techniques. (inaudible at 0:02:21.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what's amazing? You were able to think about this in the moment of the heat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know! I know! It was crazy. It was. It totally was because I feel like I'm so on board with this. Like this makes a lot of sense to me. And things like I was doing to a smaller degree before but I didn't really realize how powerful they could be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so it just makes sense to me that they would work. And so I was really excited to kind of try it out. (Laughs) But the few times where I was like, "Okay. Be quiet. Don't say anything for a minute." And then it's miraculous because I thought I would sulk. I thought I would be quiet. Go somewhere to be by myself. And like, ugh. [0:03:02.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be kind of whiny. But I told myself it was proactively being alone. I was choosing to be alone. To be quiet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was something I surprised myself with my ability to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So when you're quiet, what was going with your thoughts?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really I was like, "This is panic mode. This is where I have to calm down and step back. Don't talk. Don't say something right now because we know it never goes well when you say something. So just don't talk. Breathe for a second." Breathe. And then I would just do it for a few seconds. And be like, "Okay." So this is while I was in panic mode. Like this is while I was freaked out. [0:03:49.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, that's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right. When you're talking and yelling in panic mode you're not really communicating well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No it's panic that's communicating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible at 0:04:00.7) out of my control. There is nothing you can say to a person who is out of control. (inaudible) doesn't understand like they're in control of their faculties.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's really helpful because now like my fianc�I can be like a couple of seconds, "Okay this is why I just acted like that." So now he's not like (inaudible 0:04:23.8), he's like "Oh." Because before it just seemed random to him. Like of all of a sudden I would just freak out. Because he didn't understand what was going on in my head. So I now I feel like he's getting a better sense of what's going on in my head. And me talking about it is giving me a better understanding of what's going on in my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. So I think that's really good. (inaudible at 0:04:44.5) relationship too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're letting out your anger or whatever is going on with your fianc� and he has to come to you. (inaudible at 0:04:53.9) You have different strategies to work on. Like managing your panic mode. [0:04:57.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now what about the cognitive process that gets you into the panic mode? How is that going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's been going pretty well. I feel amazingly in control of my thoughts. Recently.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is an exception that I find kind of frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that is my dreams. Because I feel like when I'm awake I still do the stop it, stop it, stop thing when I start going down a bad road. And I can stop myself from thinking that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when I have a dream about (inaudible at 0:05:34.6), it's hard because I don't feel like I have any control over what's going on in the dreams. And (inaudible at 0:05:43.0) situations. It's about stuff that no longer is really affecting me in my everyday life. But when I dream about it, I feel like I go back to my old way that hurt me. So then I wake up and I'm down. Which is just kind of hard to keep having to pick yourself up. It'd be great after a night's sleep if I could just be — happy would be wonderful. But even just neutral. But it's hard for me to start from a low point and then have to build up. [0:06:14.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (inaudible at 0:06:15.8) You know your dreams are not real but you feel that it's real. And when you wake up and (inaudible at 0:06:22.0) because you feel like it's real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. And felt that. I had to talk myself down from just wanting to wring my fianc�s neck because of something that happened in the dream. It's something that we've talked about before. Back when I was really concerned about my relationship with my fianc� and was like I needed this perfect love. I felt so threatened by all this stuff. This ex-girlfriend of his really symbolized to me like his willingness to leave and choose someone else and all that kind of stuff. [0:06:57.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So now like when I'm awake I'm okay with it. And if I start feeling it I'm able to stop myself. Whereas it used to be all those repetitive cycles. Now the dreams. It's so weird because three nights in a row I've dreamed about this same person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Are the dreams the same contact?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's not the same contact. It's just varying degrees of the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. The varying degrees of the same thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's always the same person who has always represented this feeling to me. And it's really like, "Oh come on!" I just kind of, not mastered, but took the reins in what's going on in my conscious but I don't want to be undermined by (inaudible at 0:07:45.0) dreams.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. You had three nights in a row.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually very interesting. This is sort of different but the way to treat this is sort of the same thing. People who lived through trauma. They have a mega flashback. But these are people (inaudible at 0:08:02.5) nightmares and they'll wake up from it and they feel like they're reliving it. [0:08:06.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So people with those nightmares, we make up like a narrative of the dream. So you write the narrative of the dream. And the only difference is we change the outcome or the ending.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're recreating the ending. And when you go to sleep at night, you review the end that you created for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because a dream is a creation of your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you could almost have a control over it. (inaudible at 0:08:38.1) with your dream as well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:08:38.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's amazing. You could be (inaudible from 0:08:42.3 to 0:08:46.3). We did this. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's phenomenal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Because you're changing the outcome. The reason we have a (inaudible at 0:08:52.8) feeling afterwards is because of outcome. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened in the dream. So it's really powerful because you can rewrite the dream. [0:08:58.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you want it to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like that. So (inaudible at 0:09:02.4) outcomes aren't even that horrible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that feeling of being powerless to control where my mind is at. That powerless is what's really irking me. Because I feel like I'm doing so well at being able to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like her sheer presence in my dream automatically brings me down. It's not necessarily a bad outcome like George leaves me and goes to her or something like that. She's just there. And she's just the symbol of so much that caused me so much pain. And so then—I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let's talk about what she means to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why has she so symbolized the hurt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because it was really, really hard when she was in the picture. Like when she was involved in the picture I didn't know how my fianc� felt about me at that time. So it felt like a lot one sided. I mean he didn't know how I felt about him either. But I felt like asking (inaudible at 0:10:12.9) and then he had this other person who I had this history with. And so then it just kind of came to symbolize like him choosing something over me or him thinking something was so much better for him than me. So that's what it really reminded me of. Just how easy it would be for him to like leave and find something else that was good. I guess. [0:10:35.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's why back a few months ago I would be having these dreams every night. And so that's why they were so draining. Because I would just wake up and feel like shit. Especially because back then I thought that would signify like yeah he can he leave you. He didn't choose you. And now I realize that that was me. He obviously did choose me. And stuff like that. It's just kind of the emotion that's attached to what they used to mean to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:11:08.2) going on here. You're really triggered by emotion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. (inaudible at 0:11:13.8) I want to break that tie. Because I can, like in my waking life, I can think her name and not be like, "Oh my God!" When I used to — that would've been my reaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible at 0:11:24.4) You'll retrain yourself that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you think of her and then not have a reaction?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because what are you telling yourself now? [0:11:30.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's weird. Because literally George means something different to me now. Like that light switch moment of like I am okay without him. I can survive without him. It really was freeing for me. And so now I view him in a totally different way. And I'm like, "Wow. He does love me." Like "Wow. He is choosing to be here." And it's so like, "Okay that was in the past, but he's making the active decision day after day after day to be here." So it really doesn't faze me as much anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I mean I guess I just have to somehow train myself not to associate or to have the disconnect between the dream and the emotion again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. How would you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean—I guess if really going over the stuff in your head before you sleep works, like reviewing that stuff that I know now. [0:12:34.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Honestly it's fine. This is where he wants to be. This is where he is. I'm very secure in where we are. I'm very secure in what my understanding of love is, what he means to me and what I mean to him. Just kind of like repeat those things. Which I do sometimes during the day if I get a little freaked out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe if I do that before I go to sleep. Does that really help if you do it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm trying to see what the association with the girl is. Do you think about her a lot during the day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I used to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Used to. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't anymore. It's frickin' awesome. I did. I used to think about her all the time. Like she really was the personification of all that was bad in my life. Like she was the personification of all (inaudible at 0:13:20.8). I put her on a pedestal. Like she is perfect. But he has me. This whole comparison thing. Like her judging me being inadequate kind of stuff. [0:13:34.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I thought about her all the time. I was always comparing myself to her. What did she do for her Mother's birthday? I have to do something ten times better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you talk about her with him now or did you in the past?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have in the past. It was mostly during those like freak out moments. Because I would go at her. Because she was just like literally the personification of evil. Like she was the easiest thing to return to. I knew I could hurt him the fastest. I knew I could vent my pain. So yeah. (inaudible at 0:14:10.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you still personify her as the ideal (inaudible at 0:14:13.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well to some extent. Not to the same extent. I totally recognize she's human and has a ton of failings. But there is a little bit of like — because we're different. I'm like well she has a lot of these qualities that I don't have. So I recognize the qualities that she possesses that I don't have and like kind of wish I had some of those. But I don't think she's perfect by any means anymore. It's not like, "Oh my God. She's stunning. And brilliant." And you know. [0:14:52.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's much more human.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:15:02.3) pedestal. Then you kind of compare it to an ideal. Of course you're going to fail then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're never going to meet up to the standards.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible at 0:15:11.9) But you are not in her shoes. You're making assumptions. (inaudible at 0:15:18.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Horribly way off assumptions. (inaudible at 0:15:22.8) "Oh my God. She's perfect." And (inaudible) mad. And I know it's not true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just needed to make somebody perfect to compare myself to and make myself feel shittier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Now when you think about her, what pops into your head automatically?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now it's just her name. Her face. And just the fact that she was associated a little bit with pain. But it's not like the living pain. Like literally when I used to see her I freaked out. But now I just think name, face, that little bit of ugh, you know. (Laughter) [0:15:58.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. How long has it been since she was in the picture?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A year. Okay. So now you're engaged. There's no need for her to come into the picture.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So (inaudible at 0:16:17.0) What do you try to do when she comes into your head? Acknowledge it? Like next?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That was the "stop it, stop it, stop it" thing. Because I know I get worked up. If I let myself think about her, I get worked up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible at 0:16:28.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So basically you're acknowledging that it pops into your head. Okay acknowledge it. Like next thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:16:39.6) car passing by.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because thoughts, you can have a thought. Right, that's natural.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're in a fight against it you just get more stressed out and worked up. So just acknowledge it. (inaudible at 0:16:49.3) Hold on. Next one. Next one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:53.6) your thoughts that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I like that. I feel like I have been able to effectively do that. (inaudible at 0:17:01.9) This is was like a stumbling block I wasn't sure I was ever going to get over. I didn't ever think I would become okay with it. It's almost like I honestly thought of it as people do an affair. Like how am I ever going to trust this person again? How could they have betrayed me like this? Will I ever be able to see them in a certain light? And so that was a like a really big part of what was concerning me about our relationship. And now I can. And it happened so much more easily. I thought maybe in ten years the pain will start to diminish. [0:17:34.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But really, it is now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So what changed in you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was the fact that I didn't have to idealize love anymore. Like that's what it was. I wanted somebody like so perfectly. Like virginal in all senses. Never ever liked anybody before. Never touched. Like having somebody that didn't live in the real world. (inaudible at 0:18:03.5) You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And knowing like okay, he has needs like he wanted other friends. Like makes perfect sense. You did the same thing. And it's just much more real world. And I'm like okay. And I'm able to get over it. It's not a huge obstacle. It's just part of normal, everyday life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. And it's more based on reality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>I :(inaudible at 0:18:32.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right exactly. Which I'm very slowly realizing. (inaudible at 0:18:36.5) I'm kind of learning that throughout my life. And love was honestly my last stronghold. It was the one thing I had left that was idealized. And so now I'm just starting to finally be real about that too. [0:18:48.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All those fairy tales. (Laughing — inaudible conversation at 0:18:52.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: They do. They do. It's horrible. But this is great. I like real love.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And real relationships. So now if you want to recreate the dreams, what would it look like? Like what happens? We're supposed to rewrite the ending?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well rewrite the dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rewrite the dream.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's do an example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So in my example dream. (inaudible at 0:19:26.6) I was having a dream that (inaudible) still there. Now my fianc�s ex-roommate — it's his best friend who going to be his best man. I had sex with this guy too. He is still friends with this ex-girlfriend and her friends. And he brings them as his dates to the wedding. [0:19:50.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So he's at the rehearsal dinner making his best man speech with this ex-girlfriend right beside him like "Oh you know, they were a great couple." And making a speech. Because it's kind of well understood how (inaudible at 0:20:06.3) in that so it would be a betrayal to me if the best man brought these people. In the dream George, he starts to stand up for me, "You know, Matt you can't bring these people here. They can't be part of our wedding." You know, like, oh that's so great. And then the best man, Matt, is like, "You've really changed. You're whipped. You wouldn't have been like this before." And then that was the dream.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That was the dream. So how could we rewrite that dream? [0:20:40.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't just (inaudible at 0:20:46.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) You're rewriting it. It's your dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh my God. I would choose not to dream about that at all. (Laughing) Okay. So like honestly I would dream — I mean I'm fine with having wedding dreams even though they're stressful. We're having my rehearsal dinner. Even having Matt, this guy who I'm a little bit nervous about making a speech, stand up and make a speech. Even if he just said something simple and brief and not even personal, I'm just going to breathe this huge sigh of relief. (Laughs) (inaudible at 0:21:24.0) horrible. So like even that would be an okay dream.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like completely writing her out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Write her in and then change it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's her fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's not like she's doing anything horrible. It's just the fact that she's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:21:40.0) dream like I hope she's there at the rehearsal dinner and then catches on fire spontaneously. [0:21:44.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:21:48.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're cutting off the ties with your negative mind right? (inaudible at 0:21:56.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) She's going to be really gracious, okay? She's going to come and she'll pull me aside and say, "Thank you so much for allowing me to be here. I was really concerned about coming because I wasn't sure if it was appropriate. I wasn't sure where we stood. But you guys are so meant for each other. I am so happy for you and I want to be here to celebrate your special day."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:22.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think what would make me happiest is if she was not in my dream.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To be perfectly honest. But if she has to be in my dream I would rather her be nice. And it would be good too if I were gracious. Like, "Thank you for coming." Or that you could be here or whatever. And don't worry about the past. It's all behind us and we're all good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that could be one. There are so many different things too. (inaudible at 0:22:53.4) He brings her and your fianc� says, "This is not appropriate." And he asks her to leave. And she comes to you like, "I'm really sorry. I just sincerely congratulate you guys. I give you a million dollars and leave you guys to be happy." (Laughter)</p>

<p>(inaudible at 0:23:08.2) This is your dream. (inaudible) But you could do different things that makes you feel okay. (inaudible at 0:23:17.7) Sort of cut the tie. [0:23:22.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I got you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:23:26.6) past. I'm moving on. You moving on kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do too. That's really good. And that's what I really want. She's not hung up on the past. So something like that where it's like "Cool, good luck you guys." (inaudible at 0:23:40.2) I'm not going to be around anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's good. I feel bad saying that. I feel like I'm demonizing this poor person who doesn't deserve it. But you know what I mean? I think just the separation of the past. Just be like that was all it was. That's cool. We both get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And you could even imagine her turning around and walking away with somebody else. (inaudible at 0:24:10.7) She's walking away from your life. That's the past.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I like that. The walking away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Turning around walking away. She could be walking with somebody else. She's gone. She's gone to her life. [0:24:21.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. So if I think about these things before — I mean that's really supposed to help?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Are you having this dream three nights in a row? Is it all the time you're having these dreams? Like was it just unique to this week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really weird. It was unique to this week because I haven't had them in awhile since I was really low.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:24:50.5) If you're not having it everyday. If it's not a habitual thing, don't worry about it. But this is something you can do if it ever happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it ever happens you can just wake up and rewrite the dream. (inaudible at 0:25:04.7) imageries in your head.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't have to practice every night or anything like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Good. I like that. Because honestly that was my one real downfall this week—was that just the presence of the dreams because I felt so good in my waking moments. I felt like really together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So tell me like how many times you went up to that cliff. You said there was a decrease from before to now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you classify it? [0:25:34.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Before I was going up to that cliff multiple times a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I would lose it at least once a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And more often a lot of times. And now it was only that Friday night one where I was really like — I got the physical symptoms. That was the only time this week I got physical symptoms.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even then you were able to stop it a little, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Stop it from getting full blown out. Right and like I've started to get (inaudible at 0:26:11.4) I don't even know what to say. And then I cooled down. I have little ones obviously. But I don't feel they're like cliff ones. I'll get a little sad. Or something like that. But it's not just completely irrational. Just anger and physically draining.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that's good. (inaudible at 0:26:33.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really enjoying this. [0:26:35.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's excellent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Life is really good again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm really glad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you're used to doing certain things for so long, like you're learning a new behavior or a new way of thinking which is really great and powerful, what happens is then you kind of let go—things get better which is great. And you kind of let go of the new way of thinking and the old way kind of creeps up on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I'm scared of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's good to think of ways—it's good to think of obstacles. What will be the time when the old way of thinking will kind of creep up? Prepare for it ahead of time so that you know when to expect it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And that's something I've really liked about having this what to do if I go off the cliff, because knowing I have those strategies made me so much less likely to even start going off the cliff. You know what I mean? Knowing I could just nip it in the bud.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So let's see. Situations where — let's see. So I haven't talked about this. (inaudible at 0:27:43.9) stress recently. And my boss is a vocal person who very strongly believes in constructive criticism. [0:27:52.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I appreciate that because I really want to learn and get better. I've never been particularly awesome at taking criticism. Mostly because of my tendency to want to be perfect all the time so it's really hard when people point out I'm not. And so recently she's been giving me a lot of constructive criticism and a lot of criticism. Just flat out criticism. To both myself but mostly my direct boss. And I find myself in moments like that — I get really worked up. It's me being attacked and it's someone I really care about. I really care about my boss. My direct boss. Getting attacked. Like no recourse really. I mean there is nothing you can really say. You just have to sit there and take it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do? Like what's your job? [0:28:51.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I'm sorry. (inaudible at 0:28:55.1) I work at (inaudible) Discovery Channel. I'm a telecommunications officer. So I work with the employees for those networks. Like this is computer systems and that kind of stuff. So I found recently that's a big stressor. My immediate boss, who I like so much, now can't take all this criticism anymore and has told me privately that she's leaving because she can't take it anymore. So like now I'm just feeling really (inaudible at 0:29:30.9). Now it's not like the personal relationships that are at the forefront of where my stressors are coming from but really in the professional sphere where I don't have somebody who I can say things to. Like I'm starting to get really upset.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I'm kind of doing the "don't panic" thing in my head. Like just breathe, don't panic. This will be over. She'll say what she's wants to say then you're out. But I'm finding that harder to deal with because it's not somebody you can communicate with about it. [0:30:05.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I can see that becoming an issue. Well there have been a couple of times where I just go in the bathroom after work and cry. Or my boss just tells me about her (inaudible at 0:30:16.4) and like cries on my shoulder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my gosh. It's not good. It's not good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like I don't want to deal with that kind of thing as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay so what kind of criticism is she giving you? Is it your work? Got to do better or - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Work. (inaudible at 0:30:34.4) person out. It's so unprofessional. Horrible. My direct boss will offer some kind of suggestion or her point of view and she'll be like "Why are you so resistant? Have you always been such a resistant child? Did you treat your parents like this?" Like it's not appropriate. And I recognize that. And yet she just does these things. It's like attack, attack, attack. Or if she says you said something and you're like, "I don't believe I said that. I was trying to say this." She'll say "I heard you say it. Let me call people on the phone and ask how many people heard you say what I heard you say." You're like, "All right." (inaudible) [0:31:15.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long have you been working there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Eight months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do other people cope with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My boss and I are the only two that directly report in to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People are afraid to go to her because she does have kind of snappish responses. Which is sad because we're the training department so people are supposed to come to us and ask questions. But people hesitate to do so because they kind of get criticized or scolded. She's the kind of person in a meeting where she'll be like "Shhh. Stop talking. Is there something you want to share with the group?" And you're like, "All these people are over the age of eight!" (Laughs) It's just kind of like a fearful atmosphere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like it's just hard because it's not something — you can't be like, "You know, this is really unprofessional." So it's being able to hold in my feelings of what I feel to be just outrage. Because I have to. [0:32:20.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you able to not, up to now, for six months?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I sit there. And I do have times when she's looking at me and I have tears welling in my eyes. And I look down and I'm just like, breathe. You'll be out of here in a few minutes. Breathe. You can do this. Like saying that in my head. And then I get out and I'm like so drained. Like we cry. My boss and I go out and get lunch. And just be like, "Oh my God. Can you believe we're working there?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's kind of how I deal with it. The thing is I'm worried to do some of the things in my head like where I talk to myself. Like stop it. Stop thinking this. Where I'm talking to myself. Because often I have to respond quite quickly to what she's saying to me. So I don't want to stop paying attention to what she's saying to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's kind of what I've been struggling with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:33:13.9) lately.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay I think you're right. You have to be alert to respond back to what she's saying. So I think (inaudible at 0:33:21.1) concentration.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:33:23.5) like Oh my God. (Laughing) I think the fact that you're losing your boss too that has probably been tough on you. [0:33:31.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that means they're going to have to hire somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably not. We're in a hiring freeze. I think I'm going to have report directly in to this crazy lady.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I think that by acknowledging that it's her. And not take it personally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's her. It is. It's her. And I'm able to say that. Like this (inaudible at 0:33:51.4) This isn't you. This is decent work you're doing. You're not trying to be resistant. Or stuff like that. And that does help to some extent. But especially since my self confidence has been kind of eh lately. And then to have somebody be like, "You suck. You suck. You suck." You're like — no matter how much you don't respect that person hearing it enough you're like, "Oh shit, do I suck?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so that's kind of where I worry about my strength faltering a little bit. [0:34:22.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. And I feel like that's a tough one. Because it's not (inaudible at 0:34:28.1). It's a power difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not like you talk about it. You kind of have to suck it up and deal with it. I think the best is (inaudible at 0:34:40.4). (inaudible) talking about it. After hours you don't feel good about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we could talk about (inaudible at 0:34:49.6 to 0:34:53.4). Disappointment. Annoyance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like frustration.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I think anybody in that situation would feel that way. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then you don't want to get panicky.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're really anxious and you're really depressed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you want to learn how to manage that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That would be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:08.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That makes perfect sense. I just want to get to that point where I'm not—like I'm somebody who is kind of vocal. Like if something is not fair, I'm just kind of like, "Come on, that's not fair." And so I'm just worried that I'll be so drawn up in my panic that I'll be like, "Hey that's not fair to my boss." And I'll be like axed. (Laughs) [0:35:30.9]</p>

<p>So I think those emotions, those negative emotions are more (inaudible at 0:35:39.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's the thing. I don't want to get into a situation where I say something I don't want to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And what happens if you tear up and stuff? Does she get (inaudible at 0:35:49.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or does it bother her at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes she recognizes it and backs off a little bit. More often she'll be like, "Oh can you handle this?" Like, "Are you okay?" And you're just kind of like, "Oh, yes."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How often does this happen? The criticisms?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fairly frequently. They seem worse on my poor boss. Like I kind of feel guilty that she bears the brunt of this. But I mean multiple times a week. So like  - - (inaudible at 0:36:26.2). But I mean it's a job. And I'm thankful I have a job. And I don't want to seem like ungrateful. [0:36:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. I agree. But (inaudible at 0:36:37.7) negative emotions. It could be frustrated. It could be annoyed. It could be disturbed. It could be bothered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But let's not get to the (inaudible at 0:36:44.3) depression.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need to kind of remind yourself all the time it's her. (inaudible at 0:36:50.0) imperfections. I'm not like that. I can't do this perfectly. I'll never be able to live up to her standards.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even if you're perfect she'll find ways to criticize you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Kind of always bring that to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. Because no matter — like if I did something perfectly, she'd (inaudible at 0:37:11.9) So like I think that's a good way to think about it. It takes some of the responsibility off my shoulders.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that'll help a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not a perfect human being. There is no way to be perfect. Remind yourself you ain't perfect and that's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay. Because (inaudible at 0:37:30.7). She's not going to be happy with anybody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. And it's comforting to know it's not like me she's judging. It's not me that's creating these negative feelings in her. I know that. [0:37:42.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:37:44.2) It's like hard to remove yourself from that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I think before going in, remind yourself of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Remind yourself of that again. And that helps. A lot actually. Every job you work with people who could be like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:04.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now before I go in I tell myself (inaudible at 0:38:09.5). It's nothing personal. It's really not. If she's in a good mood, she's in a good mood. If she's not then (inaudible at 0:38:15.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remind myself of that before going in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I got in a better mental state.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:22.9) again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I like that a lot. Yeah because it's weird that that's kind of nice actually. That that's become my primary focus. I'm no longer concerned with my personal relationships and it's my work relationships which I value less. If that makes sense. You know what I mean? [0:38:41.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's kind of a nice break.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be good to get some control over that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So (inaudible at 0:38:48.4) this week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So if had a dream — I'm not going to do this super proactively — but if I do have a dream, rework it in my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rewrite like the walking away. I like that one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If you have a dream, rewrite the dream. And then walking away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really like the idea with the boss of just bringing some perspective to it before and after. [0:39:26.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Before and after the meeting. How should I phrase this? Before and after the meeting think of - -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not you or it's — maybe it's not you, it's her. That sounds horrible and childish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What you're saying is no matter what you do she'll find ways to—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Find something wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think in her way she thinks she's being helpful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. So I don't think—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say it's (inaudible at 0:40:14.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. What you're saying is, she thinks she's being helpful by criticizing and not just being critical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Which is good — (inaudible at 0:40:23.0) In her way. So no matter what you do, she'll find a way to say something is wrong. [0:40:28.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's really not about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's about her way of communicating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. That makes sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's nothing personal to you. (inaudible at 0:40:38.1) the same thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In short, it's not you. It's her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like that. It's short and snappy. It really worked well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Even though it's cute it'll help you (inaudible at 0:40:38.5) these things. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. And like it's something I can repeat in my head. All right. I like it. And then I'm just going to keep trying like my whole not trying to get to the cliff thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just try not. And even if you go over the cliff, try the same skills. You need to practice these things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Exactly. Exactly. I'm not going to make myself (inaudible at 0:41:14.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And that's perfectly good. But when you get there you have tools to help you with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:41:22.7) Can I ask what you guys do with those?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. I was going to show you. So basically week after week is to chart symptom distress and to chart your interpersonal relations. And we track how well you do each session. So I'll actually show you how you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be really cool. Because you know some days I can feel like all right sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel like I have a general trend towards getting better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you kind of know. (inaudible at 0:41:53.7) And I feel like I have a general trend.</p>

<p>(inaudible conversation from 0:41:55.7 to 0:42:01.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really cool. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No problem. All right. And I will see you next week. Have a good one. [0:42:13.2]</p>

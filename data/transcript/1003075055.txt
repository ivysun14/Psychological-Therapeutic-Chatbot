<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Laid back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not going anywhere?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, we're going to the mountains this week, and then I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] too, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you love it there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum, [DEIDENTIFIED] is a lot of fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I went with my best friends to the Country Music Festival.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Saturday, got to see, like, [INAUDIBLE] concert and it was a lot of fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wishing you were up there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm good, pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> School?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> School's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How'd things turn out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got scholarships so, everything is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd you take last term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I took Anthropology, which I hated, um, Developmental Psyche, which I liked, um, Acting, which I'd say I liked.  Um, what was the other class I took, Writing and that was it, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did you do in acting, did you guys have a play or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We did like, uh, different kinds of scenes, like you know, a soap opera scene, and then we played Shakespearean scene, and different, you know, genres.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How'd you do at it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did you handle the criticism?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd be fine, you know, that stuff doesn't, I've gotten used to, so I can take it as long as it's not like, you know, malicious, as long as it's like actually going to help me out then I don't mind it, so yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't get too malicious, too much, um, malicious, uh, criticism?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of competition?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it, is it a competitive, uh, kind of environment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm, I would say so, I mean, the majority of the kids at my school are theater people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or dancers, so then the dancers don't talk to anybody else but dancers, so that's a little, you know, but, uh, yeah, I would say like, I don't know, yeah, but the majority of the kids are theater people, and so we all kind of want the same thing.  Overall, I wouldn't say it's necessarily competitive on a daily basis, but knowing everybody else in the room wants to do the same thing as you —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Makes it a little competitive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, do you guys socialize outside?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Go see shows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's a bit of camaraderie there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is, I mean it is, it's, it's always smart to befriend people who are not your type, like to, for me to be friends with a blonde, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because then I know that it's not quite as competitive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's too bad the dancers don't talk to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That'd make it even easier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well the dancers, I don't really need them talking to me anyway, they're, I mean, no one in school likes them, so, but yeah, so it's not too bad.  I still don't have a boyfriend, which is like the one thing that I remain to be unhappy about.  But that's kind of only the only thing right now that bothers me still, but I guess it will happen one day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It bothers you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it bothers me a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most of the girls seeing somebody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, I would say so, and like even if they're not dating people, you know, they at least have done something, not, I'm not saying that they'll only have sex with somebody, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would like some attention from, you know, the opposite sex.  I don't really get any, so that is kind of hard.  But, and I kind of thought it would happen in college since it didn't happen in high school for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But not yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you feeling about yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, that makes it not good, you know what I mean, because like well, "Why should I think that I'm pretty, why should I think that I'm fun if a guy won't like me" —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've gotten plenty of female friends, I don't need any more friends, I want, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Actually guy, so that makes it harder, but I mean I feel like I'm not quite as down on myself as I used to be, but it's, yeah, it's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, not really much, just kind of hanging out, um, then helping out at the theater with like the little kid's dance classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And taking dance and that's really kind of it.  Not too much going on for me this summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do you have to go back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, school doesn't start until [DATE], but my lease starts [DATE], so any time between then and September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, mom doesn't want you to leave until September.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I mean I really have, I mean once all my friends go back to school, like down here, once they all go back to school, there's really no reason to be back here.  So I was going to go back sometime in August, but, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you taking in the fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, oh, a lot of like communication type classes, like Personal Communication, and um, [INAUDIBLE], film, and video which should be fun.  Just you know, it's because of like my focus is —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  So, I'm actually starting those classes now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your major?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Communication arts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Art.  What exactly is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's an [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or whatever, so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's the theater where you want to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, but I'm not in the theater program, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That doesn't matter does it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really to me, I mean, I mean I'm getting really good training outside of school, so I don't really mind.  I've got great teachers outside of school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing outside?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm taking voice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still taking your voice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You love that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have, I mean my teacher is awesome and I'm really lucky to have her, she, uh, I took one of her workshops.  It's like an action [INAUDIBLE], and I took one of her workshops that she did, and then e—mailed her, just joking.  So, like, "Oh I wish you did private lessons," and she was like, "Well I will do a private lesson," so now I've got her, which is really cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When'd you start with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I started with her I guess in March and then before her I had a different voice teacher.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, um, dance lessons, just whenever I get a chance I go take dance at a private dance center.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I need to get some sort of acting thing going, although I'm taking it at school, because I took it at school last month, now I have to find a class somewhere, so, yeah, I mean, we're taking dialect this semester, too, outside of school so I can get rid of the accent.  But —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That may take a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, a long time, but I think it will be worth it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where's the actress studio?  Is it in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, it's, uh, downtown near, like at the edge of the city, I can't think of where exactly where it is, but yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they have classes you can take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They probably do, I'm, I know that I was signed up to go to like an audition for the thing there —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then I didn't get in because they like only take a certain amount of people you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And like, I was not soon enough so, but there's a school that it's right next to, there's a college and it's like attached to the college.  I can't think of what the college is called now, but yeah, downtown, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's a good summer so far?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just kind of taking it easy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, some of it's [INAUDIBLE], but it's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're a bit bored?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little bored, but you know, I'd rather be bored than be like overloaded with stuff that I have to do I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you like a little more to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'd like bit more to do, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does your program, uh, always have the summer off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I mean I could take summer lessons, I mean it's not like I have summer school, like at summer school —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, it's really fast.  I mean, we both know that school is not my favorite thing to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Well parts of it are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well yeah, but, I wouldn't choose to go year around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, do they have like theater plays or what have you, during the year that you can, uh, do that extra?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you try out and whatever and?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I planned on watching the [INAUDIBLE] last year.  I auditioned for a Broadway show and got called back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Awesome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that was fun, but I didn't get cast obviously, but it was a good, it was a good experience, so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What would you have done if they cast you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Taken a leave of absence from school.  My parents seemed to think that I could of done both, but it's not possible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't imagine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can't do both, not at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  I hear about people doing two plays at once sometimes, and you think how do they do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know, but yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many were, how many auditioned?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eighteen hundred.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the second, and the call back was how many?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I got narrowed down to 35 people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty—five girls, so, yeah, it was really exciting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's impressive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was, it was actually the, they cast it, I mean, you know, I didn't get cast, and then they called me.  When I was in [DEIDENTIFIED] they called me and said, "Someone in our show dropped out, could you be available to come up to [DEIDENTIFIED] on Wednesday and audition again?"  So, like we had like a day to get me up there, but I did it, so it was really scary, but it was actually the last in our racking room, like any of the other auditions that I've ever been to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think because like, it was like, "Wow me, I got called back!"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Out of 1800 people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why I would be nervous, you know?  It's like I wasn't even sad that I didn't get cast, because it was just like, I got called back with that many people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's such a big deal, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you going to try again maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, sure, of course, that's the plan, but it was good to, you know, to go to my first one and get the first one ever was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now I know what it will be like, so yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty neat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you'll be getting an agent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would like that, I want an agent now, but you can't get an agent unless you're, you work and you can't work unless you have an agent, so you know, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've been talking to people that have done this and getting some ideas and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How it works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I already know exactly how it works, it's just actually getting it to happen, you know?  But, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's awesome.  Things okay with your mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You guys okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mom's not too worried about you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So far your moods okay, even though you get kind of down about no boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, you know, I'll have days where I'm like not happy —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, yeah, I don't know, I guess like once a week, I have one of those days where I'm not stable, where it feels like freshman year again, but, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just like, it's really hard to describe, I wish that it was like, it's almost like I feel like I was suffocating.  You know?  Does that make sense that I feel like I need to scream, like I feel like there's not enough room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what it actually feels like, and I don't understand, like I, it's, it's just really weird, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And is that like a panicky almost feeling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is almost like a panicky thing, and then that always makes me mad, because my mom's first reaction is, "Oh, well, did you take your pill?"  And then I get all mad, like it shouldn't be about the pill.  I mean I do take the pill, but, you know, like it shouldn't be about that, like it shouldn't, like can't I just be sad?  You know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have to take the Paxil when I'm sad?  So, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not just anxiety, it's sadness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, it's like yeah, it's like, it's like, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, some people describe it like a wave —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of comes over them and say, "Where did that come from?"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty overwhelming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  What do you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Talk to your mom it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she, no, I mean, because I never shut my bedroom door, like ever, so it's when I have these moments where I shut the door and like lay on my floor, you know, so that's when she knows and then comes upstairs to see what's wrong.  And I'm crying at that point, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you do when these happen in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, cry in the shower, I mean that was the only way, that's the only way I could, you know?  That's the only thing I could do, I wasn't going to sit there and cry in front of my roommates, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How do you feel after you're done crying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It wasn't that I feel any better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's still pretty hopeless, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until the next day —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, once I sleep on it I guess, then I wake up feeling a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you tried anything else, or done anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I've tried hypnosis, like the little CDs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've done, I've done those a lot of times, but they just half put me to sleep.  Um, so I think I've read every self help book there ever was, but I don't know, you know.  I tell my mom, "Once I have a boyfriend it won't happen any more," but, it's kind of pathetic to rely on one thing to be happy, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a, it's a worry that you have at that same time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, absolutely, kind of like, you know, and I think of one thing that always runs through my head, it's like this can't be it, like this can't be, you know, like this isn't what it was supposed to be like, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A worry that it's not going to change?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know it's not uncommon, there's a lot of times even after, uh, a relationship might ensue it could be, the worry could then go to, will it last —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it real, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's, yeah, that's another thing I tend to fear if, if I ever get a boyfriend, that the whole time I'm just going to wait for him to break up with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What would happen then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would be sad, but I just feel like at least then I would know that somebody wanted to be with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what would happen if that you'd worry the whole time you have a relationship, that he was going to leave you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it would, you know, I would ruin it, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You would drive him crazy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what's the key to not, that not happening in the first place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, what, what would be driving that?  That doubt?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess unhappiness with myself?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, your own insecurity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the thing, everybody says you have to like yourself before you can expect other people to like you, but I don't feel like I can do that until someone else likes me.  Like I don't, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you can't both be right.  Either what they're telling you is right or what you're saying is right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's, no, I know, I mean I know some, I know, I know that I'm not the right one, but it's just how I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which puts you back in that dependency place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not where you want to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're an independent woman.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You wouldn't be going to school where you are —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you weren't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And taking, taking the chances that you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you, you had the call back that had to feel good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean that had to kick your conscious level up a bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well it did, but not in the things that a boyfriend would want in a person anyway.  It's not like I was going to call you back because I'm pretty, or call me back because they like me, they called me back because I was talented.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's not, you know, that doesn't really have anything to do with like a relationship, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So what are your goals then, because that's how your self esteem and self worth are going to improve is that you've reached, you're reaching goals that are important to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And don't tell me that my goal is to get a boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that is one of my goals.  That's not my life goal; I always think my life goal is to be successful in the theater.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Personal goals, personal goals.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, be successful in theater and, and I mean that's the number one, I mean, you know, if you told me I could either be single, I mean, be single for the rest of my life and be on Broadway or not be on Broadway and have a boyfriend, I would obviously choose Broadway, but you know, I would kind of like to have both.  That's the way, and like my sister, I mean my sister like almost 40 and she's not married, and it's just like she's unhappy and I don't want to be just like her when I grow up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why, why isn't she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she's alone and all of her friends are married and have kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why isn't she, uh, with somebody, why hasn't she had relationships?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No theories?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean no personal theories, she's not too much fun, but she drives me crazy, so I can't imagine what it would be like to date her.  Then my other sister, you know, is getting a divorce, like it's not looking so good for me.  You know?  But at the same time I am the only one in my family who didn't have a boyfriend in high school.  Only my mom married her high school sweetheart, well they married her, and [INAUDIBLE] one for ten years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  Kind of it's not a necessarily a burden, I mean like a, you know, it's not something they placed upon me, it's something I placed on myself that I haven't, so my mom's like well I'm afraid [INAUDIBLE], but it's something I think about all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wish I had an easy answer for you, but I do know it is about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it is about, you know, how you see yourself and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's going to be the best that you're going to do is focus on making yourself the best that you can be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have things that you're working to change?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll always like to lose more weight, but I did lose weight, it was kind of like I thought, "Well I'll lose weight and then I'll get a boyfriend," and then when I didn't it was kind of scary.  Now it's like, "Well what else could possibly be wrong with me," because it's not like I feel like I'm necessarily ugly.  It was like I wanted to be thinner and now that I am thinner than I was, it's like, you know, I just kind of thought it would instantly happen I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But maybe not.  But I would like to lose more weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For me, yeah, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then that's what you should do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I still don't feel like if I lost 10 pounds that I would get, I know now that it's not like that's how it's going to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, not any more than gaining weight would get you somebody —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that would be just as likely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if, but if you're happy with, with where you're at that's, that will be the key.  What else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's, I mean, that's kind of the only thing, I would just like to be happier in general, but I don't really know how to make that happen, I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well ,you look at what you're unhappy about first, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which would be, not based on the boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, that's the thing, that's like the one thing that makes me unhappy is not having a boyfriend, and I can't just like get over it, I mean, you know?  I've imagined what it would be like to have a boyfriend since I was like little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been planning my wedding since I was a child, so it's kind of hard to like not want that anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now I'm not suggesting that you, you ignore your dreams.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But would it encourage you to focus on that internal mirror, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is it you want different about yourself —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you want to improve upon?  Because that's life long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are some personal goals for yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because there's that self confidence that you're going to want to project.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's the kind of person that you're going to want to attract, is someone else that's self confident, so the two of you have this balanced relationship —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not a, not a dependent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know it's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I'll work on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there you are.  It sounds like you've been pretty successful this year though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like it's been a very productive year for yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was, it was a real productive year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, 35 out of 1800, that's, um, when you show up for an audition of 1800 people, it must be intimidating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it, the thing is I got there so early that I didn't know how many people were there, I mean I knew that they were predicting that a lot of people were going to show up, so, I got there, they started at 8:00, I got there at 4:30 and it was already around the block, so I was like I'm probably number 200 in line, so I was like, "That's not too scary.  I can deal with that."  I didn't even know, I mean not until later, it was like a news story on it about how many kids showed up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus they had been auditioning all day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd you have to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well they like, you know, they lined us up and then they gave us, it was so annoying because I didn't go to sleep the night before, because I was, because it would hard for me to have gone to sleep and then wake up at 3:00.  So I was like whatever, I just won't go to sleep, which is fine.  And so I started to get ready to go, you know, like makeup and all that stuff, and then I get at the thing, and I was like, you need that time, you know, you were just in the line to get the time.  So I had like two hours, so I was like I could have done all this later, so, yeah, I came back and then sang and that was it.  Sang and then left, and then at the call back they had us sing and do a scene from the show, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How'd you feel after you sang?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean it was a relief, first of all, to be done with it, but, uh, yeah, it felt really, you know, I felt really good about it, you know, it, it was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's neat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then after you got your call back when you did the scene and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean like after the, the thing is like after the audition I was still kind of like jittery like the first one, I was still kind of like jittery and it was kind of like, you know, whatever.  But I literally like walked into the place, did it, and then left the call back and I was just kind of like, just like close the book, you know, like I did it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's it, and if they called me again I would be happy and if they didn't I would be happy with it, so it was, it was a new experience for me audition wise, because usually I freak out and freak out until I hear something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where this one was just kind of like, "Well I did, you know, I did all I could do, so, it's good."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we've got to get you to that point when, with the guys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not quite there yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where just, uh, you know, you take it in stride and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah,</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll get there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're glad you're there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no regrets?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Your roommate situation the same next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm living by myself, I got an apartment, and I'm living by myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Near the school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it's like a block away from where my dorms were actually so it will be good, because a lot of my friends are living in those dorms again —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So those people are still, you know, friends and everything, but I'll get to live on my own, which is really what I wanted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you, uh, what about food, you go to the cafeteria or are you going to be cooking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably a mix of the two, I'm not allowed to, um, order takeout, I mean, you know, get delivery, because I did it the last year, so, you know, my dad wants me to learn how to cook.  And now that I have like a real kitchen, I can actually do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's cool, how much room do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's, it's a, it's a small little space, I mean, it's not huge, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got a bedroom, you got a kitchen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's got a cool den, so yeah, I like it so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's neat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that comes furnished or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not furnished, so it will be fun to like do that kind of stuff too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you'll be anxious to get back up there then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have it fixed up yet, or you haven't moved in or anything, because —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not till July.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Well that's pretty cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm excited.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that where you're going to stay there the rest of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean we'll see how it goes, you know, if, if I like living there, which I think I will, then, um, yeah, of course.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Think you'll like living by yourself better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not going to be lonely?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like, I like to live, I mean, I'm still, when my roommate would go like out of town for the weekend I was just like, I loved it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A relief.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it really was, so, I mean I have friends, you know, friends can come over, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It isn't like I'm going to be all by myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be on my own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, alone in [DEIDENTIFIED], huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's awesome, I'm happy for you [PATIENT NAME].  Do you need any meds while you're here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean I like the Adderall, you can give me another prescription of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's helping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, I think it really was, I mean, I feel like I didn't, I didn't feel as anxious, you know?  It almost, I know it's supposed to be like a stimulant, but it really kind of calms me down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, focus is you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, 1 a day is enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about I'll write it for, uh, 2 a day, so you'll have enough for longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You won't have to get it so often.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, yeah, I like the Ambien, it's not making me hallucinate and it works sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It works sometimes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes it doesn't work at all, but occasionally it works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want that as opposed to trying something else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been in good health?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, the first thing that's on my mind is something that I, I had forgotten it before yesterday.  But uhm, I don't, I can't quite understand why I would have forgotten it.  Uh, when I got home, we have MSCZ's cousin baby-sitting right now until the woman hopefully, can come.  And uh, when I got home yesterday — he's a student at KWNZ, so I was just asking him about his exams, and he reminded me that he has one on Thursday, which I'd forgotten all about.  And uh, well, I mean, er, part of it is wondering why I forgot, because it means he can't come at this particular time.  And, but it also means that then I was thinking of asking you, and I am asking you, if it would be possible to change to my old time on Thursday.  And maybe that's why I forgot.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How does that explain it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, my hesitance always to ask you to, uhm, change the time, or, or my feeling, I don't know, I think I've always felt that I didn't want to think about either cancelling or changing, asking you if you could change the time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But why not now?  It's true it's been true in the past.  Why now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I suppose one of my first reactions when you asked that, is to try to remember why in the past.  But what comes to my mind, it seems unrelated, uh, was just well, just thinking about, uh, the way I seem to react to all doctors, as sort of a father figure.  At least it seems to me that's what I'm doing.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>And then If, if I think that, and I, I was trying to remember one day I think I'd seen my obstetrician and I was talking about what had happened at the visit.  And I always have a funny, a up-and-down reaction with him, or to him.  Because I don't know how he's reacting and all.  But I do, and uhm, I think MSCZ made that comment, then.  But then I was just thinking that I, I think I even have this to some extent with the doctor I take FSO to.  More, that I expect him to sort of be pleased with me because I produced this child, or something like that. </p>

<p>And, and then I was just thinking, well how does this relate to my not wanting to ask you?  And I don't know, I don't know, somehow I, it seems to me you f—, you are a doctor, so in that sense you would fall in the same category.  But, yet I, I think I see, I think of you as, as something, somewhat different.  Because what you're doing is different than the doctors I'm used to.  But I don't know, then I was just thinking about, well it must be something about I'm afraid to initiate things, or ask things.  Then I thought, well that's not true, when I think about how I was with my father.  But if I initiated anything with my father, I'd always try to cover it up.  So at least to myself I was pretending it wasn't obvious that I was initiating anything. </p>

<p>And I don't know whether I was doing that to save myself, or to — if I thought it would fool other people, or what.  But somehow I think I felt safer if I didn't, if, if in my mind it was not obvious that I was initiating things.  So if I asked you directly if you can change the time, well I — this is reminding me now of what I've said before.  Then I feel more open, because then it's obvious I want the time changed and you might say no.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>Because even when, uhm, MYJ, this is the boy who's baby-sitting right now, even when he reminded me yesterday, and he had remembered that I had said uh, when he told me this before, that I could ask if I, uh, I could keep this ti—, you know, the original time I used to come here.  And uhm, and he, he said well, can you change to the other time?  And uh, my first reaction yesterday was well, it was, took me awhile to even remember the conversation I had with him before.  And then my first reaction after that was, I'll do anything than to ask to change the time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I think, then I, well I started thinking what I could do and (Sniff) I don't know whether it was that, thinking about what I could do, which uhm, as far a_ as getting a baby-sitter that I'd pay, I don't r—, I've tried a number of things, and uh, it's been pretty difficult finding anyone.  So then, I didn't want to do this, because of the fact, well, I mean this l_ leads into something else, the question of our moving.  But uh, I didn't want to get into a baby-sitting pool that might end up, well I don't know why I didn't.  I'm not sure if this is really it, because I don't see where, even if we're moving soon, it would be that much of a problem to part of one while we're there.  I think maybe I have another reason. </p>

<p>But in any case, my feeling has been I didn't want to get into a baby-sitting pool, which is the best way to get uh, baby-sitting done where I live.  And so I was thinking well, I could do that.  And then I just thought, well, it's silly not to ask you.  Because if it's possible, it would be, it would be what I'd prefer.  And, so maybe it was a question of which I didn't want to do more, I don't know.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>But, uh, uh, mm, I, again I think of the fact that right away after you asked me why I'd react this way right now, and then I thought of looking at at least my obstetrician and pediatrician as sort of father figures and expecting them to be pleased with me, and so forth.  Uh, I, and then I just thought of how, I don't know, somehow just I, I sort of think, it's almost even as if people I've never met before, who have no idea that I have a child, that somehow, the fact I've had a child now will make people think differently of me, and that they'll approve of me.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What you're leaving out is, that you want me, apparently, to do that.  You sort of, it's conspicuous that you don't say it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Th_ that I want you to do that.</p>

<p>Z____ Z____ Z____ Z____ Z____   (Overlapping voices.)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you don't say that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I'm not sure if I was sort of building up to it, or not.  I mean I, when I was just thinking and just talking, right, about this last part, uhm, I was sort of remembering coming here yesterday.  And, but everything was still sort of vague.  I, I, and I'm not sure whether I was going around it, or whether I would have come to how I was feeling yesterday, and how I wanted you to react. </p>

<p>Or, though when I think about it right now, it almost seems like the way I was feeling was that I'd just taken a test, almost and, and gotten a good grade on it, so you were going to be pleased with me because I had done a good job.  And, and so then I was sort of wondering if I felt that this would be sort of a lasting thing, because now I'm going to be a mother, it's not something that's over.  And, so it almost seems like it was not so much being a mother, as having a baby.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Uh, and I had 2 questions on my mind right now.  One is well, well one isn't a question so much.  I was just thinking that if I saw, or if I were feeling that I wanted your reaction to be approval on that basis that I just said, it was sort of uh, approval because I had just done a good job on something.  And, and I very much think of it as, in terms of taking a test or passing a test.  Uh, and th—, it just reminded me very much of the one way I knew I could get approval from my father.  Uh, right now I've forgotten the other question, well, the other thing that was a question.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, it seems possible to me that one of the reasons you didn't want to ask, was because you're inhibiting exactly the opposite.  As though you really would like to have me change the time as sort of a token of my appreciation and you have passed your test very well, and that I'm pleased by it, and all that.  It would indicate that I was giving you something in return to show my appreciation.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  Yeah, when you say that, first I think that's crazy.  Why would I do that, if that's what I want.  But then, it reminds me of uhm well, what was rea—, much on my mind before I had FSO, of that Sunday when I was at my parents' house, and my father was giving us some money.  And then I had that reaction to (Sigh) I don't know, not feeling good on one hand, but yet feeling awkward about showing any, any signs of affection, physically.  And, and then, anyway it's, it's something about, I don't know, I'm so used to thinking I wish my parents had been more a—, openly affectionate with me.  Because I wanted to be in return.  And yet, it seems like I want to avoid anything that will then sort of make me feel obligated to, or I m—, it s—, it seems sort of awful to use the word that I'd be in debt, but I think that's how I feel,  And then I'd owe something. </p>

<p>And I don't know, maybe it's with you too, just as it's with my parents.  There's something about if you don't do anything for me, then I can feel freer about feeling angry at you when I want to.  If you do nice things for me, then I won't feel that I can be free and feel angry, or anyway, feelings that I don't like having.  And, or maybe I shouldn't say don't like having so much as don't like showing, don't like admitting.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And also, I was just thinking of, uh, I don't know, sort of remembering my feeling in past times of either wanting to ask about changing the time and then not, or finally doing it.  But in a very oblique way.  And it always seems, that, I mean maybe this time in particular I'd feel you were showing your approval in connection with my having a baby, because that's the way I'm looking at things.  But it seems like anyway, anytime I think of asking you to change the time, I find it a real struggle to think — and I, and I don't really believe it, I think I always just tell myself this.   That it, that you'll do it if you can and you won't do it if you can't.  And it means nothing else.  Because I think I always think of it as some kind of a special sign of favor, or approval, or something like that.  </p>

<p>And (Pause), and I, I don't know, it just, I was just thinking that it seems like I'm caught either way. Because by asking, I was just remembering there was a time when I was feeling very strongly this way. And I don't think it's just that time, I think it's always true, that I feel a certain anger, or some negative feeling anyway, if I don't get what I want, which is to change the time.  And so, I don't want to face, or set up the possibility that you'd say no.  But on the other hand, it seems like I can't handle your saying yes, too. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So no wonder you'd forget to bring it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause)  I think what amazed me though about it, was not only that I forgot here, which is not, would not have been unusual.  Because I used to do it often about, the times like when we'd be going to Vermont.  And I remember always forgetting until the very last possible moment, to bring up either that I'd had to cancel or that I'd want to change the time.  And, but I think what surprised me was the way I'd forgotten it, so even just at home, or things like that, I, I wasn't thinking of it.  And i—, even when MYJ mentioned it, it was as if at first, I'd never heard of it before.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You didn't mention how you felt about my changing, you know, the hours to this hour when we talked about that on the phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   I mean, in light of what you've been saying, it seems likely you must have had some idea about that, or feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah well, I, I was sort of wondering that when I was uh, it did enter my mind at some point, when I was talking today.  But I don't know, it's sort of hard to separate things, because the one thing I'm remembering is that I had, I knew that it would be a while before I could call you after she was born.  And yet, the fact that it was on my mind to call you, stayed very much on my mind, and was very bothersome to me, until I finally did it. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   It would be a while before you could call me?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, just because I thought I should at least get some idea of how soon I could come back.  And I didn't have any idea.  I know when people tell you things, and my doctor's sort of casual about well, do things as you feel you can.  And, at first it just seemed that I couldn't imagine that I could arrange it so I could come back — I mean just in terms of my feeling strong enough, and all. So I knew I had to wait a little bit before I could sort of judge when I'd feel, I don't know, not so tired, and, and that I'd be able to come back.  And then I didn't have any idea who I'd get right after she was born, so I'd have to have some idea about that. </p>

<p>But (Sniff) I, I mean in other words, when I had had FSO I, I was thinking that probably I wouldn't call you the minute I got home.  I'd wait maybe a week or so.  And yet, it was very much on my mind.  And I was agitating over something, but I don't know, I don't think it was the question of when would I come back, just in terms of how long.  Because I'd always had the idea that probably I would not come for about 6 weeks.  Just from what other people had said about how they felt, and how quickly they felt better, or not tired by going out, and things like that.  And uhm, so it must have been something else. </p>

<p>And I don't know, when I first spoke with the woman that uh, well I still haven't met her.  It's through a friend of mine that I'm getting her, who had her for her child for about a year and a half.  And uh, I'm planning to meet her, and she wants to meet me too, before she starts to come.  So I don't know, in a way I'm feeling that it's not a completely definite thing until I meet her.  And, and yet she still hasn't appeared.  And I've, I've had to leave when she, when I'd meet her for the first time up to her, because she doesn't live near me. </p>

<p>But anyway, when I first spoke to her I, uh, tried to get her to come so I could keep my old time.  And then I think, I don't know, it just seems that the feeling of being sort of desperate, I had to find somebody, got stronger.  Then the feeling that I didn't want to change the time.  And when, it was apparent that she couldn't come during that time, I, I somehow, I don't know, I was just thinking, well, for me to come, I have to be able to change the time, I guess, I don't know.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>Because, well, I mean it d—, it was in my mind that well, what if you said you couldn't change.  Well then, I knew I'd have to try to find somebody else.  But I didn't really, I don't think, come up face that.  I mean, I didn't think much of it.  And I, I kept thinking well, I'll think about that if you say you can't change the time.  And so I was, so, I think I remember just feeling relief.  Because I was thinking well, this woman will be quite definite, because that's the way she'd sounded at the time.  And then it was when she got sick that things began to get sort of questionable.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, somehow I have the feeling I'm not really getting at how I reacted.  I, I feel as if I'm doing exactly what I did then, which was to concentrate on other things.  Because uh, then I began just now, thinking of the fact that if I'd kept the old time, if you hadn't been able to change, then I would have probably had to start thinking about high school girls.  And yet, when I was first looking for baby-sitters, I just couldn't conceive leaving FSO with anyone except for an old experienced woman who had taken care of other children that I knew about.  At least one other, so that I knew everything would be alright. </p>

<p>Because I had this feeling that I just couldn't leave FSO, that something horrible would happen.  And now I'm thinking that's sort of silly.  Of course she's older and I just, I me—, I suppose it's probably because I've seen that she's alright, she can take care of herself to an extent, and so forth.  But at the time it just seemed that I couldn't leave her with somebody as young as a high school girl.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Because I'm, I was just wondering too, that uhm, I think I had some feeling about when I called, and uhm, I had to leave the message about the time I'd want to change to.  That I was being, oh, I don't know, I felt very much, well demanding isn't quite the word, but, but anyway, he—, sort of here's what I want.  I m—, and here's your very narrow choice of you what you do within what I want.  That's the way I think I was feeling, to some extent.  And, and, and then I tried to sort of soften it, by saying, but if it can't be either of those times, well then I'll  have to just work at finding somebody else, so that it wouldn't seem so much that I was being so demanding.  But I think I was feeling that way, and I was just thinking that, since I didn't speak to you directly when I asked, which is the hardest part for me, maybe that's why I don't, I didn't have as bad a time about it that I might have, if I'd had to speak to you directly.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think maybe, well, part of it then was part of what was, what's my feeling today, too, of uhm, I don't know, something about the fact that I'd had a baby, and then was asking if you would, I don't know it was, it was, maybe almost even assuming that you would do me a favor because I'd had a baby.  I guess because I think that I can count on approval for having had a baby, and so therefore, you would do something as a sign of that approval.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I began just, (Sigh) I'm, I'm not sure how I got into this, but thinking about the apartment, or the question of where we're going to live.  Because I remembered, well, maybe this is why, because I remembered that you had asked me at some point over the phone if we'd moved yet, or, or made some comment about our moving.  And uhm, I said, "No, not until April 1," then.  Because at that time we had, the apartment we thought we were — still another apartment that came up since I've been here, that we thought we were getting.  Or maybe it, no, it must not have, because I think I saw it right before I had FSO, and uhm, it was going to be the one that was the least expensive.  And we were just waiting for the lawyer to return for this woman, so we could finalize everything.  And then, she de—, she has had trouble finding something for herself.  And so she decided she didn't want to sell, right now.  And we l—, we learned that uhm, last week.  So I was just thinking we're still, we were back to the first apartment that we seriously considered now, which was sort of ironic.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You said you didn't know how you got to this, but you got to it right after you had said you had this strong feeling that you expect approval because you have produced a baby.  And the next thing you tell me about is that you don't have an apartment.  (Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I—, r_r_ reminds me of my father giving us the money.  I mean, giving us something.  He, he would have given me money in some form, but gave it to me in the form he did, because we were looking for an apartment.  And I think I've also had a feeling, well maybe I'm deflecting it onto MSCZ, but I know before FSO was born I had this very frantic type feeling that I had to, if we weren't actually moved in, at least know exactly where we were going to be.  And it was connected with the baby being born.  And I don't have that feeling anymore. </p>

<p>But yet I think somehow, I've sort of felt toward MSCZ that well, now he should be providing for me and FSO.  But it's more for me, I mean, I don't think she cares where she is.  At least, not right now.  And uhm, because I have this baby, so he has to be considerate of me and provide for me the way I want it to be, I guess I'm thinking.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I, I, I've been finding something that's been happening that uh, I think maybe I was, I knew it would, anyway.  And that's o—, another reason I was in a hurry to move, so I wouldn't be where we are now for a while, and get sort of settled in. Because uhm, I think it's, once I've made adjustments in one place, and, and gotten settled in as I had to over again, once I'd had FSO, then I don't want to move.  Because I, I don't know, I guess I'm just sort of afraid I won't be able to do it again.  I know it's silly, because I know if I can do it once, I can do it again. </p>

<p>But I'm finding now that I, I mean I'm finding people who can baby-sit.  And well, I think that was one reason why I didn't want to join a baby-sitting pool.  Everything would just get too comfortable.  And I've worked out a routine, to some extent.  And I know where I want to go for certain things when I shop.  And I have to go out in a hurry and come back in a hurry.  And so there's no problem of looking around, and just everything.  And the feeling just getting stronger, well maybe I don't really want to move now.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I, I was just thinking back again to what was on my mind when I started and, and wondering if you could change the time.  And I began to feel, and just thinking about it, thinking that you'll tell me something, sometime soon.  Uhm, I me—, I begin to feel very anxious, and it makes me wonder if, well I remember saying in regard to your changing the time t_ to now, over the phone, that I thought I didn't have as much reaction because I didn't ask you the question over the phone.  But just the fact that I'm now feeling anxious about wondering what you'll say to me.  And you said to me something over the phone, must mean I denied, or at least I'm not admitting a feeling that I had when you did tell me. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well then, some feeling you still have, that's the important thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I won't be able to change Thursday.  And our time's up.</p>

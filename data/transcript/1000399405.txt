<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Uhm, well I'm remembering, I think, more or less where I left off Friday.  But then, I'm inclined to think of something, I mean, I'm inclined to think of one of the things I was thinking Fri—, Friday, I guess.  Uhm, wh—, a—, Friday I was worrying about just what would I do, how would I use FTM's being at home.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know if it's exactly thinking about that, but uhm, I mean I was thinking of just, in part I think, that I still haven't quite made up my mind about her.  Uhm, (Sniff) you know, how friendly, how businesslike to be.  And then that would involve how much time, how much is she going to join in, how much is she going to sort of invade our privacy.  Uhm, and she's clearly going to be a great help, except I keep getting this feeling, I might not handle it the right way, because of not deciding that I want to be free, and therefore, you know, that she would be doing some things to free me.</p>

<p>And uhm, and, and, also just thinking about well, today when I came home, today, Mondays are always kind of hectic, partly because of getting back into a different routine, and uh, things at school are usually kind of mixed up, because the TKY school uses the school over the weekend.  And often things are misplaced, and missing, and uhm, I don't know, you just get to school, and you don't end up doing half of what you anticipated doing, because so many new problems are there.  And it's more on Monday than any other day.</p>

<p>And uhm, so I always feels as if I'm kind of running more on Monday.  But then, uh, I started thinking about it. Because when I came home today, FTM's been working, doing some of the different things around the house that I'll want her to do every week.  And she hadn't done the dishes, which, you know, I understood she'd been doing other things, but it does, if she never had the dishes done when I came home, it would bother me.  Because it's just something that I'll think, well I better do them.  Because I really don't like seeing them lying around dirty.</p>

<p>And uhm, I said something to her — I think in a way that was perfectly acceptable to her for me to say it — and it was clear she just hadn't gotten to them.  It was kind of an unusual circumstance.  But uhm, an—, I was explaining that I would like them done, even if she was planning to do them another time, because it w—, it would just be on my mind, and I would kind of come home and just sort of in, you know, in the pace that I had kept myself in, I would just do them.  I can't remember exactly how I put it, but I was clearly also, kind of nervous.  And, and uhm, not relaxed, I don't know what other word to use.</p>

<p>And she said something to the effect of, well uhm, you ought to just relax, because it was a, you know, sort of involved that I uhm, at least today, certainly, I  didn't feel it when I came home.  And it wasn't that things weren't all right at home, it was just, you know, the way I worked myself up at school.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know, I, I, I was just thinking about that, and thinking, well in a way, I don't want to relax.  I suppose because then it would, you know, I wouldn't have this long list of things I have to do, and not have to go from one to another, and then it's all the using leisure time, and making choices of what would I really like to do.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Pause) I don't know, because then I took FSO to the park, and I was just thinking about my reaction there.  I enjoyed taking her today, and I have enjoyed it the last few times I've gone, partly because I rarely see the people that I now see, and I enjoy seeing them.  And probably, it wouldn't be so enjoyable if I were going all the time.</p>

<p>But then also, there, there was sort of a dual thing, a feeling of, well I'm not dependent on them.  Because I have this, these other things to do, and I feel happy about it, I feel as if I am somebody, maybe still not in the right way.  But at least, I mean it's a replacement, I think, when I wasn't working, I was dependent on uh, people at the park, or I was trying to be.  Uhm, you know, to give some meaning to my life, or to make me feel like something.  I don't know exactly how, I mean I know I talked about looking for the answer in what they were doing.  But I, I, it seems like it was even more than that.  And or, another thing too.  And uhm, and, and now I just feel, well, it's nice to see them.  But then, I can see them go, and I don't feel I have to know exactly what they're doing and uhm, well somehow, there's just a different, I feel happier about myself, I guess.</p>

<p>Uhm, but then there's also that atmosphere at the park of there's so many people that I'm seeing, and I'm only there for, if I, if FSO and I are lucky with, I'm there an hour before I have to leave again.  And so it's a—, you know, again, it's kind of a, I'm saying hello to one,and then to another.  And uhm, and then I have to run off, and you know, th—, i—, there's still this sort of hectic pace, not exactly, but I don't know, i—, still always, you know, I've got something else I have to now do.</p>

<p>And uhm, and just thinking about what FTM said, "You ought to just relax," or whatever she said. and, and you know, it was sensible what she said.  And I, and I was just thinking of it in terms of at home.  And then, at school, although school's getting better, now that the uhm, well (Sniff) it seems to be.  This morning I had to go over some things that were, you know, the, the aide that we now have has been with us for a few days, so that I was going over with her on what we would permanently expect her to do.  And so that took up some time this morning that wouldn't ordinarily.  So things were a bit more hectic.</p>

<p>But uhm, things are generally, I think, better at school.  And yet I, (Sigh) well I don't know, it just seems like I want to I, I, uhm, i, in especially I'm aware of it with FTM, who's willing to do so much.  Uhm, I'm trying to decide how much do I want to let her do, so then I don't have to feel so hectic and pressed, and busy.</p>

<p>And something else, I, I wasn't bothered by it after I thought about it for awhile, but I was really bothered at first.  Uhm, yesterday FSO played with FWQ, FYR's daughter, for a while.  And first FWQ had FSO, then we had FWQ.  And at different points FYR was talking with me about the fact she's applied for a fellowship, or some grant, I've forgotten now what the particular grant is.  But anyway, there's quite a strenuous process to apply for it.  And she was telling some of the things she had to do.  And one was, to write her intellectual autobiography.  And she was saying that she'd found that very difficult at first, and you know, how it had been and what she had done with the kids while she was doing it, and all.  And there are a number of other things she had to do, too, all of which she just said that she hadn't been prepared to find it as difficult as she did.</p>

<p>But when she was talking about er, it was the intellectual biogra—, the autobiography that really uhm, bothered me to think of, you know.  In the end she'd worked out something that she felt was uhm, what she wanted to turn in.  She wasn't sure if it was the kind of thing they were looking for.  But uhm, you know, at first I thought, I don't have one.  Or I just couldn't think, well, what is mine?  You know, because I started immediately applying it to me, and what would I do.  Because I kept thinking, well I could never apply for something that involved all this, I couldn't do it, and uh, how did FYR do it?  And that I didn't have one, and it was really bothering me.</p>

<p>And uhm, I mentioned to MSCZ, because he hadn't talked directly to FYR about it at first, that she'd had to do this.  And he said, "Oh that wouldn't be so hard."  And then he was talking about what he would have done.  Uhm, and it involved, you know, awareness of selecting.  And again, I was just blank, and I was thinking, well I don't have one, I ha—, I mean, at least there's no, you know, direction.  I mean, I could just list where I went to school, but there's sort of no direction.</p>

<p>And then later on I began to think, well I have one now, in that I, I have an interest that I think I'm sincerely interested in, in connection with how children learn, and teaching them, and uh, things of that sort.  And there's been a direction in the kind of uhm, studying I want to do, and things I want to read about since then.  But that I d—, I didn't think of that at all, at first.  And all I could think of is, I was making no choices, and how would I put it all together, and uhm, well just simply, that I didn't have one, almost.  Except for a list of names.</p>

<p>And at some point, when I was in that stage of thinking about it, I was s—, or maybe this is when I began to think the ot—, you know, began to think, well I really do have one, uhm, you know, where I really feel I have a direction now.  But at some point, I was thinking, well here intellectual has always meant to me more of a masculine, has always been a more masculine quality to me.  The more intellectual you are, then you know, sort of the more s—, replacing having a penis.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) And you don't have one.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  And I think I got this feeling today at the park too, that it's almost, well I'm working uhm, I'm doing something that, I don't know whether I was thinking of it intellectual, but I'm doing something, and somehow that's like having a penis.  So I'm already set apart from these women, and not dependent on them.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, and then I, I just was thinking again, if the way I can't uhm, I don't know if I'm completely aware of what I'm trying to decide, but I know I'm uncertain in dealing with FTM.  Uhm, and I was just thinking of how, you know, the opposite of, I don't know whether it would be called nervous, exactly.  You know, there was a certain nervous quality to the way I was today.  And I think I was more relaxed over the weekend.  But even then, you know, it was sort of a, I talked faster, and more, and sort of talked to cover up, and I'm not sure exactly what. Whether it's just simply being uneasy because I'm relating to a new person, and it's sort of an abrupt rela, relationship, there she is living with us, all of a sudden, and doing things that are very important to us.  Uhm, or just what it is.</p>

<p>But uhm, well today, I especially, I did have this feeling, and I ha—, have had it throughout the weekend, but controlled it better than today, I guess, of talking to cover up.  And me—, and meanwhile, she is uhm, quite calm, and self-assured.  I mean, I'm sure she has her moments of not being, but she's, she is not a nervous person herself, outwardly.  And uhm, knows, I mean, she, she just seems to have good sense and, and a fair amount of confidence.  And uhm, all of which I'm glad.  But on the other hand, it somehow makes me more nervous, and more unsure.</p>

<p>And it's not exactly that I'm not asking her to do what I want her to do, because I am, and she's been very open to, you know, hearing what I want her to do, and following what I ask.  So it's not even that, exactly.  But I, i—, all I can think of, is just somehow, covering up a lack of something, by talking.  (Pause)</p>

<p>You know I was st—, struck by something else, though that, uhm, might be partly because it's just this type of thing has come up enough now, so I've probably just had practice in dealing with it.  But I think my feeling is different, too.  That with all these uncertainties with FTM, uhm, and one of the things, you know, that I had mentioned on Friday, and I think that she would see through me, because her mother had, is a teacher, and uhm, you know, so I can't put on things about oh how much I'm doing, how much work, and so forth.</p>

<p>Uhm, but she's asked me a couple of things about it, and today she said something to the effect, how do I find it.  And I think she might think I've just started this year for the first time.  I'm not sure.  Today I said something, so she knows it's not true.  But uhm, she asked me something about how I liked teaching SGN, or whether I thought I'd always stay with it, or something like that.</p>

<p>And, and again, I felt uhm, I had this f—, I don't know quite what I did feel, except I know I wasn't feeling quite just being myself.  Uhm, I somehow felt uncertain, I, I don't know quite what it was.  But, then she asked me what I did at this time every day, because she knew I wasn't teaching again.  And uhm, and she was quite direct about asking what I did.  And I just said, "Well I'm doing something personal."  And, I don't know whether that's the best answer in the end, except I felt more comfortable answering it this time than I ever have.</p>

<p>Of course, now that I'm here, I think, well that, you know, again I could be thinking, well she could think that I'm having an affair.  But I don't think, I wasn't aware of that being on my mind then.  I was just aware, what I'm doing is not teaching, it's not studying, it's something personal for me, and I don't want to talk about it.  And how do I say it so she'll not be, you know, upset at the way I answer, you know, that I, I can't say, none of your business.  But on the other hand, I want to say it's something I don't want to talk about any further, without even saying that.  Because I think once I used to say, something I don't want to discuss.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You know, you sound today, here, just the way you were describing FTM, like you're kind of talking to cover up.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   See, I think, uhm, aside from the whole question of whether or not you want to really tell her what you're doing, it isn't just her, really.  It's the kind of thing you were describing, that you felt with FHYZ.  You didn't want to go into anything, really, about yourself.  It's like you're in analysis, and you're here, but you're really not.  And you pretend in so many ways with certain people that you're not.  It's like it doesn't exist, a whole important part of your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, w, well I know I, I guess I kind of got into that when I was talking about my reaction with FHYZ, but uhm, I'm still more involved in thinking of it just with her.  And I, I don't know, I see what you mean, of, well, I don't know.  I mean, the way I, I guess the way I'm thinking of it, is that if people knew, then I would feel a certain, different responsibility about what I was doing.  Because people would know, and then people would expect to see a difference (Laughs).  Or I don't know, just somehow, I'd feel more responsibility.  And if people don't know, then if I don't change, nobody will know.  And uhm, except for MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, first, I guess, I was just thinking again of the old uhm, (Sigh) business of my trying to keep a balance.  And, you know, that's, I still try to do it with MSCZ.  And then I started thinking about, I think it was Friday night, he was happy that FTM was in, and, you know, the question was settled.  And she had struck him as being very nice.  And uhm, and of course, I was going the opposite way, of resisting having everything be settled, and happy, you know, so that I could then relate to MSCZ.  And, I, you know, sort of carrying on what I was saying here, I guess.</p>

<p>And in any case, uhm, I can't remember, oh, I guess I was working out some stuff.  I had some forms I had to fill out for Mrs LDJ's Social Security.  I was trying to do things Friday night that had to be done this weekend, because I typical, most weekend's typically turn out, that after Friday night, there's, if, if we're home Friday night, then there's very little time for me to get things done.  I just don't uhm, and it's just been a wise thing for me to do, if I can, on Friday.  And, you know, I'm still kind of in the mood of it.</p>

<p>So I was.  And then MSCZ came in, and he clearly wanted to make love, and wanted to go to bed immediately, and uhm, and I was just about finished.  But I immediately started putting on a show of, had all these things I had to do.  And uhm, I just wanted to, you know, sort of push him off.  And I don't know whether I just want to do that for awhile, or uhm, you know, whether it was just sort of an annoyance of being what I was, and I didn't want to be what I was, and you know, sort of being annoyed at him, or what.</p>

<p>But uhm, in any case, he persisted, and then finally said, "I'm not going to let you start a fight.  You're just trying to start a fight, so then we won't make love, or you know that, cause a problem anyway, and I, I'm not going to."  And pretty soon he had me laughing.  And uhm, it wa—, I don't think, as I recall, that I had an orgasm, but it was pleasant.  I let myself enjoy it.  And uhm, I felt good afterwards.  But if he had let me start a fight, which in some occasions he has let me do, then you know, the whole thing would have been ruined.</p>

<p>And uhm, well I know I, the other thing that I didn't think all weekend, because it just wasn't at all comfortable, but I know what I left thinking about was the last thing you pointed out to me.  And that is if FTM had gone off with FSO, or done something to her, got rid—, gotten rid of her anyway, as far as I was concerned, then it would be easier for me to leave MSCZ.  And, I don't know, I just, I guess I felt I don't know where that leaves me, thinking about that.  And uhm — (Pause).</p>

<p>Because I guess I was thinking, well, in a way, yes, because uhm, then it would really just be my own decision for me.  And I wouldn't be having to consider FSO too.  And I can always think of things that are considering her, and that sort of cloud the issues just for me.  But on the other hand, then I was I think, th, thinking of FHYZ VQC too, and I would not like to be to—, so totally alone, as she is.  And again, I don't know whether it's that I'm afraid of it, and you know, really just sort of the total responsibility for myself.  Uhm, or whether it is an awareness of how lonely it must be too.  And not wanting that.  Uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well I, I don't know, I gue—, I guess I was sort of thinking, or maybe I thought of it more afterwards because of, we saw the CFG's this weekend.  And I was thinking more about FRA, and what she's doing.  Uhm, but it's a feeling of uhm, I mean, sometimes I can't see it this way.  I see it either that if I think about it, that means I'm choosing not to be with MSCZ any more, and I can't think that.  But I think I was thinking over the weekend, and imagining this might be part of what FRA is doing, and thinking about FHYZ, that I have to feel that I could do it, if that is the choice I then want to make.  And right now, I don't even feel that's what I could do, that I could, you know, decide to be completely on my own.  So then I can't even consider if it's a choice I want to make, or not.</p>

<p>Uhm, because I think for the first time, I was thinking about FRA being on her own, the way she is, in the city.  I mean, she and MNO ha—, are still very close together in many ways.  They mix up where they are together, and everything, so that it's not very clear.  Except she is getting some feeling of being on her own, and making her own arrangements.  Uhm, she's not yet financially on her own, but I think she wants to be.</p>

<p>And I was beginning to imagine for the first time, I think, well maybe this is why, that she can't really work anything else out until she feels she can do it, a—, if she has to, if that's what it's going to lead to.  And uhm, I'm not sure of it, but anyway, it just seemed like, well maybe that's part of my situation, that again, I don't think I want to do it the way she has, but I don't know, I always get mixed up when I'm with people like FRA.  Then, I don't know, maybe seeing FYR didn't help, either, in mixing me up on what I want for myself.</p>

<p>But I think I really do have a stronger feeling that uhm, well that I have to be able to consider it, and think I could do it if that's what I choose.  And uhm, th—, I, I, I'm sort of recalling, there was one time last spring when uhm, this whole question came up a lot, of whether MSCZ was right for me, and whether or not I should consider divorcing him.  And uhm, well thinking of him as possibly not being the right one.  Uhm, or just considering that as things are right now, in the way I'm feeling, he isn't the right one,and not whether or not he could be.  And I don't know, just a lot of things, some of which I guess I've gotten beyond.</p>

<p>But I was very aware then, there was a brief period when I co—, I was really thinking about Z,,,,.  I was also feeling, well I might have to be, start again on my own.  And uhm, I think I've briefly felt I could do it.  And then I've lost that feeling.</p>

<p>And (Sigh) I think that's part of what, when I was thinking about FYR yesterday, uhm, that was troubling me.  Not just thinking she has an intellectual autobiography, and I don't.  Or, she could do it, and I couldn't.  Uhm, but just, she has had to go out and really think about what she wants for herself, now.  She can't hide behind being married, and having restricted choices because she's the one to be home with the children.  Uhm, partly out of necessity, because she just can't be.</p>

<p>And I guess I let myself get confused by it, because I do choose, and so does MSCZ, that one of us be home with FSO, at least, you know, some of the time, if it's possible.  And since it is possible, then I can also then hide behind, uh, not having so many choices.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well then I s—, I know, I mean I realize it's not, it's just sort of a side issue.  But I, I started thinking again of FTM, and how I feel confused over just what is it I'm doing there, you know, how am I using her, or what.  Are my feeli—, what do I want my feelings to be?  Or you know, what are they?  I don't know, because I, th—, I was just now thinking, it's as if I'm confusing that she's my employee, she's a—, she's almost like a friend, and that she's from similar background in many ways, and is only doing this for a year.  And I remember when I was in PEC, and not in, in exactly the same position, in a different family, but kind of similar, in a way.  And uhm, you know, and then she wants to go on, and probably wants many things out of life that I do.  And uhm, then sh—, and so then she can almost be like a sister, or you know, a friend, sister, kind of thing.</p>

<p>And I was thinking that today FSO was talking about uhm, I guess FTM asked if one of the girls FSOZ goes up to school with, has a sister.  I said, "Yes."  And then FSO picked it up and asked if somebody else did, who doesn't.  And I said, "No."  And she said, "Well I do."  And I asked who it was, and she said, "FTM."  And uhm, I don't know if she's picked up something on my part, or whether she just was feeling better about FTM.  And FTM's obviously younger than anybody that she's had take care of her for awhile, so that she got that feeling, I don't know.  But anyway, it just seems like I'm mixing up uhm, what I want FTM to be to me, I guess. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, I was thinking of something that, well, of when I left the park, I had introduced FTM to one of the mothers there who's a girl I knew at college, and never really was very friendly with at college.  And uhm, I don't know, I've seen her around since.  We're not really that good friends, except you know, sort of, we, having known each other before, meeting at the park is a bit of a tie, and we have mutual friends.</p>

<p>But uh, some of, some of our mutu—, well people like the BFMs, who knew them.  Sometimes we, I feel kind of, I guess, guilty when I say this now, or think about it.  But we'll joke about some of the things she does, because they're just, she looks at things differently than I do.  Although today, I was finding her more pleasant to talk with than sometimes.  Uhm, ma—, I don't know, uhm, maybe because I just feel better about myself again than I used to when I first did.  She used to be very much involved in you know, doing the right thing, and dressing in the right way, and everything.  And, and then she was I guess, pushing her husband's career, too, socially, and, in certain, not with me, but with some other people.  And they were joking about that.</p>

<p>Anyway uhm, I was just first thinking it was kind of funny, of all the people to be introducing FTM to first, somebody I really don't see that much, have that much to do with.  Uhm, but then, I was thinking about when I left, uhm, well they had begun to talk, so in a way, it wasn't so abrupt, or anything.  But on the other hand, I was sort of, thinking about it now, aware of, you know, leaving with a grand finale, sort of.  I do—, I don't know how to explain it, exactly.  But I just felt awkward about how did I say good-by and leave, I guess.  Although what I did, was I w, went over to tell FSO that FTM was here, and I showed her where FTM was sitting.  And I just came back and told FTM, FSO knew and would come.  And then I just said good-by to FRJZ.</p>

<p>But uhm, I don't know, still somehow, I felt very self-conscious.  And then I thought of something FHYZ had said, about trying to make a good first impression, then finding it very hard to go back to things.  Like at a party, where she'd met people once and had tried to make this go—, first impression, that she could never maintain it.  And uhm, thinking about how often she was, you know, especially with other people — and she was this way with me at first too a lot — of you know, coming on really strong and talking all the time, making a lot of jokes, and then abruptly leaving while everybody was still laughing and impressed.</p>

<p>And uhm, I mean, it wasn't quite like that today, but (Sniff) uh, (Sigh) I don't know, it was well, it just gets me back to thinking about talking to cover up.  And I, maybe I just had the feeling I was doing it again.  And uhm, (Pause) and I guess I was also thinking, a, although maybe — I just can't tell — I have to deal with FTM right now, and it's uh, a new relationship that I want to get off in the right way.  And yet I have this feeling, because of these uncertainties or the way I'm mixing things up, that I could easily not do so.  And so, then I tend to think, well, I've got to think about this first.  Uhm, but I can also h—, see how I might do that just to avoid thinking about other things.  And (Sigh) uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well it does mi—, remind me of what I said on Friday.  I'm thinking about something that I have to talk about first, to get it out of the way before I go back to the things that are more important, and that I never uhm, well I guess, without your help, I wouldn't have gotten back to the things that were more important Friday.  And, and I keep trying to do the same thing today, it seems, of you know, thinking, well I've got to work out this wi—, you know, how I'm relating to FTM, first.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Coughs) Well, our time's up.</p>

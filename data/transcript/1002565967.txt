<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are things going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay, what's going well and what's not, or what's not going well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait, that's all you do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's all you do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all I had to read on there, yeah, it's recording now so whatever we talk about it records.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So things are going well overall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so, okay, what's, what's going good and what's not going so good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My appetite is really going down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, just all day long or more in the morning or lunch?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lunch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you eat breakfast usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your breakfast appetite is about the same as it's always been, okay, but at lunch you're just not hungry.  Does your appetite come back by suppertime or you're still not real hungry?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It comes back like right after school as a matter of fact.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The appetite comes back sooner than it did with the Concerta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Concerta, it would last a full twelve hours.  His appetite is back usually be four, I mean he's like, he's like can we stop by [DEIDENTIFIED] and get four double cheeseburgers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that tells us it's not quite the same half life as Concerta which is true, this medicine usually doesn't last quite as long as Concerta and probably, [PATIENT NAME] when your appetite is coming back, that means the medicine is starting to wear off, does that make sense?  Okay.  All right, what about, can you tell if the medicine is helping in any way, do you seem like you're better focused at school?  No.  Is it easier to get your homework done faster with the medicine, are you more efficient?  No.  So does it feel like it's not really helping at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I just didn't want to do my work really before but now I do so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you getting more work done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just want to do it now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are your, how's your homework going, are you getting more projects done, more assignments done and turned in or are you still struggling with some of them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm doing better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are your grades coming up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay, any other changes that you have noticed since you started the Focalin, good or bad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been kind of agitated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, do you feel kind of irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That can be a side effect of the medicine sometimes or it may also be that the Abilify dose is too low, that's another possibility.  Are you sleeping okay at night?  No trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?  Okay.  And how's your energy level during the day?  Do you feel like you have enough or do you feel tired, too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel kind or tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and is that throughout the day [PATIENT NAME]?  Do you wake up feeling tired or is it more like in the afternoon after school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wake up feeling tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so pretty much all day long you feel tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Ask him what he did this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What'd you do this morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Run.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good for you, in class?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, he didn't have school today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How far did you run?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three miles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then what did you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ran.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Bicycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, bicycle a mile and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, so you went out and ran three miles on your own.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll bet it hurts.  Are you training for something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mountaineering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mountaineering, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so did you run like on a track or just on the roads or sidewalks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sidewalk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and did you take some breaks during three mile stretch or did you just keep going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just keep going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just kept going.  Have you ever done that before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, have you run like in five k races or something?  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You should.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could if you run three miles, those are three point one so this is something you just go out and do on your own then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's pretty good.  Do you ever time yourself to see how long it takes you to run three miles?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It takes me, I range from seven minutes to seven minutes and thirty seconds to run a mile.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, and can you keep that up for all three miles or is that just for one?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know, he just comes back and he's bright red.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just keep going so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, so how many would I run?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know, I'll time you next time you go out, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you ran three miles and then you came home, got on your bike and went for another mile and a half did you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you're tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was going to say, were you pretty exhausted then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would think so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But tell him what else you've done today then, since you're so tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleep, take a nap?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh-uh.  He went out and played paint ball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really, man you're busy, you're active.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Where'd you play paint ball?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, I just shot it in my backyard and my dad and I are going to play paint ball in Virginia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you're just practicing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, so with the irritability, is that something you notice all day long or is it more early in the day or more later in the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Throughout the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All the time, so it doesn't come and go, it's pretty much just always there, okay.  Is that more noticeable since you started the Focalin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd say so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that can be a side effect of it.  Do you feel anxious or nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you enjoying the things you're doing, like when you go out paint balling or running do you have a good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It relieves my stress.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Is there anything you're feeling particularly stressed about right now?  Is there anything you're worried about or thinking about a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Anything you can think of [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He and I are butting heads—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Constantly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that more since he's been on the Focalin do you think or not necessarily?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know, you know, things have settled down since [NAME OTHER] has moved to [DEIDENTIFIED] and it's been after the holidays and things have settled down.  He has been more irritable the past couple weeks.  I doubled his dose like you said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, of the Focalin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of the Focalin, so you went up to 20.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You said one to two tablets so we went up to 20.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's just, you know, I think if I said the sky was blue, he would say no it's not, it's green, I mean he's just constantly, you know, do your chores now, I'll do them later, I don't want to do them now, you know, I want my cell phone back, I want to do this, I am doing this, just this constant, constant, constant battle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Very exhausting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And again, this is a hard question to answer probably but can you tell if that's getting more so or more severe since he went on the Focalin about, what's it been about three weeks ago or has it been longer than that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's always been there.  I would say it's worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a little bit worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What do you think?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it could be, I'm thinking it could be the Focalin, it could be, I don't know, other things, time of year maybe, okay.  Okay, anything else stressful [PATIENT NAME] right now that you can think of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you don't know of anything else that you can think of that's maybe weighing on him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think school is weighing on him, some interactions that he's had with some kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, you've gotten call to the office about bullying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it something you said to someone else that they didn't like or did you shove somebody or what happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was poking a kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and is that new or is that something that just got caught this time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just got caught.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it's not a new behavior since you've been on Focalin, okay.  Poking a kid, they call that bullying?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was poking him with a pencil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And made some comments that apparently, yeah, I wouldn't want to sit with him either, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, this is what [NAME OTHER] said.  You made some comment about not wanting to sit by this kid either, so you know, I think there are some little kids in there and [PATIENT NAME] is bigger than them, I think there's some of that but I have a feeling it's just seventh grade boys stuff but it's just not tolerated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's gotten quite a few detentions for being very social.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More talkative in class?  More recently than in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or is this ongoing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like the last half of last quarter, all of the sudden.  I mean he's never gotten detentions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So this is new?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This is new.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's because [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, let's see, is that the one where you're getting the ones for disruptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because he like searches you out practically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So is it just the one class, is that the one you get detentions for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just the one class, but he doesn't cover his book or he doesn't return things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's only once in a while.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he gets detentions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That class is—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So when I hear he's very social, the computer teacher told me he's very social and she's had to move him three times because he's talking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I understand—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's very social.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So lots of friends.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's a good skill honey, just not in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So [PATIENT NAME] do you find yourself wanting to talk more in class and just have fun with the other guys in class more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More than usual?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, more than usual?  No, just kind of the same?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[PATIENT NAME], why are you mad that I said that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, so there are a couple of things we have to think about.  One, is the Focalin helping—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if it is, is it helping enough.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Second, is it doing more harm than good, is it causing side effects like irritability, oppositional behavior, more talkativeness that's causing problems and if so, then do we need to stop it or do something different.  [PATIENT NAME] what do you think, do you think the medicine is helping at all or not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER], what's your impression?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, because the issue is that I think he made the decision after we took away his cell phone, he couldn't have his cell phone anymore until he brought his grades up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because he did not do well at the end of last quarter and it was primarily from not turning in work and he told [NAME OTHER], he said I just don't want to do it, so I mean, so I mean he's real honest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean, at least, that he just didn't want to do it and I just said you're in danger at this point of failing seventh grade and I don't think he realized how close, that's why your grades have to be up for you to pass, which is why you have to go to summer school for math.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I fail the mastery.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If you fail the mastery, you are going to summer school for four weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it's, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I don't hear the Focalin is making wonderful changes at least and it may be increasing irritability and talkativeness possibly, is that your impression?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Possibly, yeah.  I think he's made a decision to get his work done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what it sounds like, he's making, [PATIENT NAME], you're making an effort.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	These are the choices, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you agree with that [PATIENT NAME] that you're just working harder at it?  Okay.  Well, I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean when he does his work, he like gets A's, it's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hello.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Brain boy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I'm wondering if we should—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We should stop the Focalin and touch up the Abilify a notch just to see if we can get things more back in balance.  Do you think that would be reasonable [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when I say the Abilify, I think you're talking 5 now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"We could just go to 5. "</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that'd be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you take one pill instead of two.  Do you want to try that and see if that helps just kind of make things a little bit more level and you're okay with that [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  Let's give that a try because I'm not excited about what the Focalin is doing and I'm not even sure it's helping.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why are doing this to me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because it looks funny, do you want [PHYSICIAN NAME] to laugh at me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It looks cute on her.  Are you an [DEIDENTIFIED]'s fan or you just like the hats?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm a fan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well, let's do this, let me get you a new prescription for the 5 mg.  If you have some 2's left, you can use them up, yeah, so you don't have to waste them.  And [PATIENT NAME], with the Focalin, you can just stop it, you don't have to taper off or anything like that, you're on such a low dose.  And what I'm thinking [NAME OTHER] if it's okay with you is we might want to try this for a month or so and then check back to make sure things are moving in the right direction, is that okay with you?</p>

<p>
CG:	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that okay with you too [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you want to wait a month?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I was going to say we can check in sooner if you want but I think we need to give it a few weeks because—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With bumping Abilify, it may be three or four weeks before we really know if it's doing what we want it to do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Unfortunately, it takes a little while with it to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome and you can call me sooner if there are any problems or questions if things aren't moving in the right direction.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] we are going to be out of town at the end of next week, Thursday through Sunday, but there is someone on call for me, let me see who it is here, I'll leave their name and number on my recording.  It looks like it's going to be [NAME OTHER].  I'll be gone one week, next week, it's going to be [NAME OTHER], do you know [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's been around for years and years but I'll leave her name and number on my message, if you have any questions, but I wouldn't expect any real problems from this.  In fact, [PATIENT NAME] what I would expect is getting off the Focalin you may find yourself being a little bit less irritable, things don't bother you quite as much and with that increased Abilify, hopefully, things just feel a little bit better and you'll still be able to focus well and get your work done but just things won't be quite as irritating, that's what I'm hoping for, okay.  So let's see here, three, four weeks would be ideal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you okay with all this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He goes I don't like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a pain, I know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's boring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're right, it is but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It is boring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you know, the good thing is about that, you're right, I mean if it wasn't boring, if you were having fun coming here, then I'd worry about you.  You know, if this were a good time, then you'd have problems.  The fact that it's boring means that you'd rather be out doing other things, you know, with your friends or by yourself and that's a good sign so I don't, I don't have any problem with you saying that whatsoever.  Let's see [NAME OTHER], around, and we need something later in the day don't we?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do I have that's later in the day.  The [DATE] would be exactly four weeks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could, the only time I have that week would be on Friday the [DATE] at five o'clock, would that work for you?  That's probably rush hour traffic.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think that might work.  I think we're going to be mountaineering the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's try that and if there's a problem, just call me, we can always reschedule.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it's not, I work but I just make sure I get off, five o'clock is better because I can make it by then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you want an appointment card also?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So do you have plans for the weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bicycling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh cool, where are you going to do that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] or whatever.  They're going to do rock climbing, they're going to go ice climbing, it may be too warm for ice climbing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tomorrow is supposed to be cold I heard, rain and snow they said.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Of course, it's Easter, it wouldn't be Easter without snow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course not.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's been such a beautiful thing—</p>

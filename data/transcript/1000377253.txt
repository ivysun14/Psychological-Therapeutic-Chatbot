<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:00:26)(laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe he liked you a year before that and so he's thinking about that... seven years, okay. And uh, your first name?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uh, Neil.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Neil?... How 'bout you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: My name is Lukas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ayanna(ph) [indistinct noise] And then you had uh...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: No, no, no. I had... I got pregnant, then I got married then I had a baby and the divorce came after when Lukas was one year old...(crosstalk)infant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Luc-- (crosstalk) you were married to Lukas' father.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, but then Neil has been in Lukas' life for seven, eight years?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how old are you Lukas?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old? How many years?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Year, twenty years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Twenty years. Okay... So in many respects, uhmm, Neil is like father to Lukas or does Lukas seek his father [someone coughs] outside(ph)?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: You're asking me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: [chuckles] I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So Neil is the father figure? Somewhat?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I don't think that the relation between them is uhmm... even similar to a relationship between father and son. It doesn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like brother?</p>

<p>[silence 00:01:59]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Maybe, but I can't see... the... natural respect or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. More so with you but uh... but you-- you're close to Lukas?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Now yes, but uhmm... sometime ago maybe a year or two years ago, we had big problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (clears her throat).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Why don't you tell me, uh, what type of work do you do Neil?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: I am an architect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're...?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Architect... architect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Deferred.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Deferred. So, if you're in school you don't have to go to the army.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you don't have to get a new haircut.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Uh huh.</p>

<p>(background laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about... what's happening with your family and why you decided to come and, and speak with me?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, (inaudible 00:03:51) we are sitting here and... I just bring it up, you know, I said well so, and so that our, our family problem and Lukas said "I have no problem" and my boyfriend said "Well, I have none either" so... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: (crosstalk) No, I just said...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can go home(laughs)?</p>

<p>[giggling]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm. So if you please.</p>

<p>[laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You tell me.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm, but uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somebody agreed to come here and talk.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, somebody must think there's a problem.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I think that they're very nice to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don't you tell me what you think the problem is and then we'll deal with the... (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:04:29)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I was just... thinking that, uhmm, we... how to put it, uh, this year seems to be much better at this, maybe because I collapsed in February so maybe they just, you know, there is [clears throat] nothing they (inaudible 00:04:49) in our family because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say you collapsed...?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, can you tell me what you mean when you say (crosstalk) collapsed?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm... I suffered from some panic attack...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: And it was caused uhmm by I think long either time of stressful situations mostly with my son and my momma. I think five days and I have to say that in the past there were also things which worried me... and I was scared of confronting them so long, currently to my boyfriend and our relationship which seems to be sort of uhmm... calm down now but, uhm... maybe... I think that I sort of unconsciously feel that, it's just, he didn't ..somewhere now you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you're with a number of problems. There was a problem with mother.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was a problem with Lukas.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some problems with Neil.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, I'm talking about myself, uhmm... work and... yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, in your mind, do you had an order of what the problem was, what's the more serious problem was?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, a few years ago, maybe, first three years or four of our relationship between me and Neil, I think that, uhmm, Neil and uh... I'm not sure but very important if not the most important thing for me was uh, what was happening between me and Neil. Because I was very much in love with him and like, uhmm, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you meet him?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: He's my English teacher before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He taught you English?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you speak better English than him?</p>

<p>[background laughing]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: I'm not such a good teacher.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need some practice. So that's how you met.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he did a good job?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you fell in love?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In English or Czech? Czech?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: No, here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: But, uhmm, yeah, first we... if-- if you are talking or asking about the language so we are speaking in English first, of course. [laughs] Well, it can be nice to each other in English, too. [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I hate to admit it but if I may, I was very proud of myself when I for the first time I was able to argue in English.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very good.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I thought, I'm getting... you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk) That's it...</p>

<p>COUNSELLOR: That's a good sign [chuckles] when, you can uh, dream, ta-tell a joke or argue in a language you're...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not very good at... So when you met Neil as an English teacher, Lukas was... ss-seven? (crosstalk) Thirteen?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk) Thirteen.</p>

<p>COUNSELLOR: No, thirteen.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Thirteen.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: (murmurs) Thirteen, fourteen.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: (crosstalk)Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And before that, it was just you and Lukas.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, we lived together just me and him but uhmm, there were, during that time three boyfriends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, they live with you, too?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Two of them, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Was he close to any of the boyfriends?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well he... he didn't... from my point of view, he didn't have a problem to become friend with... any of them but unfortunately, seemed to be too much for him when he met uh, Neil [someone sneezes]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I don't know. He was very friendly and so on towards the previous ones or the former ones but... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he was close with them.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Or he didn't have problem with them I could say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Alright.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: If there was a problem, I think that it was rather coming from... uh... my boyfriends...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...and then from Lukas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: He was very natural and very open and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But those relationships just kind of went away? They ended... any reasons they ended?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm, as I saw it, a better and uh... as I can see it now... it was because of Lukas. I mean they were tensions between a boyfriend...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...and Lukas and me in between, you know they...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm. Yes. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yes, sure yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then you met Neil.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've been with Neil for the longest year?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh... and you say you fell in love with Neil.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Neil, Neil was uh,... more permanent.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yes... (crosstalk) at the beginning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: And then Lukas remained... more...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Love than the other?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: No, I think that I've fallen in love with the others as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I... I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this has been a pattern for Lukas that... that... that he's had trouble with the man in your life.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Sort of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This has been a pattern. Something...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...consistent, regular...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is it.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you have relationship and then things went trouble with Lukas and then...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: It will be end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the same thing is happening here.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: It was happening there, and I was very unhappy about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: It started maybe after... I'm not sure, six, nine months after we met and uhmm... we lived two years after that, I was very scared or afraid, and very anxious I think and so on.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: [coughs]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: And... I have to admit that I tried to... uhmm... put things in that way so we... wouldn't split up, Neil and me, and I have to admit that maybe I'm... even though I didn't want Lukas to be unhappy. But I have to admit that maybe at that time, I didn't try hard enough to make Lukas happy as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were angry with Lukas?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah I... rather... when there was situation when I have to decide for... you know in any case, either for Neil or Lukas. Sometimes I maybe uhmm... preferred Neil's way only.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Which you know, maybe it was unfair to Lukas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me that it has put you in a very difficult position.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I... I'd like to hear a little bit from... from Neil and Lukas in... in terms of what they think about what you've said. And do they agree or do they disagree.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: [sighs] I do uh... well this... some... things Mama have said about... I don't remember it [sighs] to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you've had trouble with Mom's boyfriends in the past?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Oh no, not at all. But with Neil I... but it does, I think uhmm... because I was too... I was uh... older when uhmm... Neil came. Then the... and the others...?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: The others.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: The others came, so I... oh it's too hard (inaudible 00:12:15)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Understand.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: I understand uh... my role with men in that time. But when Neil came, it's a... it's harder.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Boyfriend.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Not boyfriend but I don't know (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You, you know...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...it was not a... like a Mom and big baby. It was uhmm... big boy and, and her something, boyfriend...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...but still with Mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me ask you a question, and if you, we need to translate this. Uh, so you understand th--, the at least (inaudible 00:12:49) the situation. How was your relationship with your mother different when she had... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: W--well... (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...wait. How was your relationship different with your mother when they, she had a boyfriend with her and how was it different when there was no boyfriend? (sighs) Were... were you more like the man in her life, when it was just you and Mom and then when a boyfriend came in, you were pushed out, you feel?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well I think uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You understand?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah, I understand. (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:13:27)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me what did you think.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: I think uh... when Neil came I... I... jealous uhmm, uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: He was jealous?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were jealous?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Jealous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But were you jealous of the other men?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But my question is, there was time between boyfriends where it was just you and Lukas?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was life with just you and Lukas and how was it different than when you had a boyfriend whether it be Neil or anyone else? Were you closer?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Uhmm...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Definitely, from my point of view... Definitely, and I think that I... when it was just Lukas and me, without anybody else. I felt, uhmm... more and relaxed, open...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With him?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: With him and with myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With yourself.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Because uhmm... when was Neil, when Neil was there at the same time I felt that, that there could be some tension between Neil and Lukas... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...and I will be in the middle and I will, (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...I was expecting...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, your relationship was more relaxed when it was just the two of you? And you felt that, too.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: I felt the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you really in some ways liked that closeness? It was easier life.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah. But I didn't want to be without a boyfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No of course not, of course not. And you have every right to... But I'm just, I just wanna point this... on the... the difference because... while you didn't wanna be without a boyfriend, I don't think he minded being without a boyfriend because he had his Mom to himself and he had a nicer life.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that Lukas is happy that you have someone in your life but it makes it more difficult because we go from two to three.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he has to share. And that's what it sounds to me like that's what his problem.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah and then there's all those... maybe overprotective of Lukas or... (clears throat) maybe over messing...mm, th--, the things... I... I don't agree with but Ayanna... much like (inaudible 00:15:32), because it's like two against one. Ayanna... I should have to uhm... put up with the stress. So Ayanna... you know that's what I see solving problems more. And that and ...(clears throat)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yo--You-- you didn't know what your role was... in a sense...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: But I think Ayanna had in mind a role for me. Well, she was a kind of uhmm... father figure for Lukas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that didn't work.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Well, it wasn't, we never really discussed it and maybe it wasn't, well, I certainly wanted this not uhmm, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were your expectations when you came into Ayanna's life? What did you think was going to happen? How did you think things were going to go?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm... I was... I... I didn't really uhmm, put a little thought into it beforehand uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just exactly expected, expected things to work, to-- to go.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, whenever someone gets involved with a person who has a child from a previous relationship...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: [coughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We call that blended family and we, we know that there's gonna be some adjustment. The adjustments either gonna go well or it's going to be so-, so... or it's not gonna be good. So you must have, uh, have some thoughts about that this would be difficult or... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: No, not, particularly... Because uhhm... you know, when we... when Ayanna and I met the first, I think... Uhmm... I guess it has been like falling in love and uhmm... (clears his throat) I just assumed that you know, that we'd overcome any problems, that it will be... I mean obviously uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, uh, and that's a very common assumption.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: (crosstalk) Uh, uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that, "Love will conquer all."</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But uh... it's a little bit different, isn't it?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So now, what, what does that do to your thinking that... that, that you meet and you fall in love and you're happy and in some ways you have, uh... Lukas is happy for you. But then, it begins to be problems, how does that change your thinking about each other in the relationship? (long silence)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (clears throat) Well, on that time I didn't... I was confused. It was the first... feeling maybe. I have to admit that... Uhmm... when Neil who actually didn't bring Lukas up, I hadn't known him, you know. And for... so, when Neil... for the first time criticized Lukas' behavior, I felt it as, uhmm... as an unfair personal criticism.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what thinking... What thought did you have?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm... that it's unfair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he should have talked to you first?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Oh... he... he... he did actually. He did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: But uhmm... I just saw that uh... you know, he didn't have the right to criticize anything because he actually didn't know... didn't know Lukas before that. He didn't uhmm... and it was sort of uhmm... I, so... I didn't think that it was even right. It wasn't even true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But did you... did you understand that Neil was coming into a situation that was difficult for him because, even though he's not Lukas' father, he is in many way-- ways in that role.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he's your... your boyfriend.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are couple. And when people see you, they think that you're family. So in some ways, that put him in difficult position because he needed to have some role. "Wh-- Who am I going to be to Lukas? 'Cause Lukas was a child, should I... I do... I have a responsibility to discipline him or should I let you do all of that?"</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh hmm. Well, I seem that I sort of presume that uhmm... the roles in our family or what... will, set up somehow... after a while and I was pretty disappointed that, you know, when I saw that Neil uhmm... didn't try hard enough to find his way to Lukas... who was... like you were thinking for one time. (indistinct sound) And, uhmm so, I tried to ready enough to in a good way. But I tried to help... him... for... for example... when Lukas was a little bit older, I suggested you are taking to the part go for a year or something like that. Because, when I am not at home or even when I'm at home, but they would go on their own. And I remember Neil said... now that he was left, "Wh-- what should I do with him?" You know, "I... I have nothing to talk... about with him. Which was, uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That hurts you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you felt if he loves you, he would try hard?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is your thought? Your impression as to why Neil didn't try harder with Lukas?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Maybe he wasn't confident enough...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In himself?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm. Maybe uhmm... Lukas'... Lukas' is... uhm... uhm... ability to refuse of... you know... Well, Lukas' also didn't... No, I was going to say something but, I just realized that uhmm... I think that at that time when Lukas was thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years old and all the community between Neil and Lukas was more or less... about... some requests. "Lukas, please do this..." or "Lukas, please don't do this." And I think that the communication was... sort of tough, you know. Sort of uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...it wasn't...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well, it was also their language problem.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: That's true.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: That time, I didn't speak Czech. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: And uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you speak Czech, Neil?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: No. So, Lukas can't speak English, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he... he... sort of speak Czech.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well I speak a little... Yeah. I can get by.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: But now it's much better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your... your English did you say?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: No. Uhmm yeah. (inaudible 00:22:20)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, did they... did they speak in Czech sometimes?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Well, almost everytime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you don't understand what they're saying.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: No. I do not. I do not... but uhmm... I've just way of getting... [clears throat] the idea from... you know, pounding(ph) with lush(ph) burger(ph). The language I think has made up more difficult(ph)... has made up these problems(ph). [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What thoughts come to your mind when you hear... Ayanna... Ayanna... start... Ayanna talk about how she didn't do it. (inaudible 00:22:49) (someone clears throat) with Lukas.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm... well I'm... I don't... I don't understand it... really. Uhmm... I don't think they've been trying to uhm... I think... I mean I see it from... most probably [clears throat] because... Ayanna and Lukas... but Ayanna wants to be there. [clears throat] But at the same time we want the things not to change it anyway. [clears throat] Uh... maybe... uhmm... but especially Lukas... want to... you know it's almost as if I wasn't there. That's one. Uhmm... (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:23:26)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were getting mixed signals from... Ayanna. She wanted you in her life. But, in a way, it felt like though, sometimes you weren't even there.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did-- did that develop a belief system in your mind about this relationship?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm... alright belief system uhmm... I mean I resolve the problem by (clears throat) going back to UK for a couple of years at one point. Uhmm... working there and coming back on weekends. Uhmm... and even, even coming back, things were pretty bad, I don't wanna come back, uh... for a couple of years and somewhere (ph) in this year I thought it got better. I don't think it's probably because just of... Lukas but the whole thing is growing up and... uhhh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, one of the things that we, we know is that family has developed what we call schemas. That they, they develop their own belief and perceptions about the situation. That... and they tell themselves that... for Jacob, to me it sounds as though your schema was, you know, "Ayanna says she loves me and I love her. But yet, in many ways I'm not in her life", and when it comes to Lukas, "I'm... I'm out." So it gives me somewhat of a, I have one foot in and one foot out of her life." This is a difficult situation. Is that your... it's the schema that you see?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm... Well, maybe not as much now. When I was talking more about in the beginning (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: ...when I came at first. You know, I don't... I don't get these feelings now. (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:25:18) Not about Lukas. (crosstalk) (inaudible 00:25:19) uhmm... Yeah I must admit... I didn't... I... I still uhmm, I'm still trying to talk about the problems. But, uhmm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Do you still talk?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: ...I think I've actually felt really, really small. Resolve it or... either it resolve itself in time. (clears throat) But, there, there's a lot of we can do to solve that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was frustrating to you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about your schema? Your belief? The way you look at the situation.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well, should I say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You say what you're feeling. What you think?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: I think, when Neil was... wasn't at home... he was, I mean works somewhere. Uh... he was out working for one year. So, after half a year... I... I uhmm... I s--, I slowly return to the old uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Relationship.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...relationship with my mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which was close.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah. And I think our uhmm... relationship was, was better when Neil's o-out. Well, from my... from my side of view... and... in fact I think today it's okay with me, but uh... before I don't know. Three, four years ago I really uhmm... had times when I uhmm... I was afraid about Neil. When Neil's at home I... I felt bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was your fear?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well... [sighs] like uh... some... uhmm... how was it like? [whispers to mother]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Foreign...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Foreign. Yeah... some... some foreign man is in our home and... and... breaking my uhmm... bridge with my Mom... I don't know how to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. That's... you know, that's a very good way of saying. It... it was a threat to you. How do you say that in Czech? [coughs] Threat.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Ush-oh (ph) [translates 'threat' into Czech]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Sevu (ph) [gives another translation of 'threat' into Czech]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A threat. (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:27:59)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>[somebody coughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your... in your view, yours too?(long silence)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: He can't talk about feelings... no feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You cannot.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I felt very bad... all the time because... and I... I remember a time when... we had Lukas and me... sort of relaxing time... quiet night... with problems of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: That quiet night... and then when uh, I knew that...[background coughing] Neil is coming, so I could feel some kind of tension... you know... and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Which eventually probably turned into panicking.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm. Yup. Because I knew... not that I thought... I knew it... that there would be some problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you were trapped.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah. Because I loved both of them...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I didn't know who I'm giving more(ph) and I want both of them to be happy. So, sometimes I just forgot about my happiness you know... so I thought how to make Neil happy. How to make... make... Lukas happy. And then eventually after sometime... I thought... "For heaven's sake! Where is my happiness..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: My something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (Sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let... let me ask you a question. Do you think that maybe... you should have left those two... try to work it out themselves?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah, exactly. (indistinct noise) you said very well. Sometimes I thought that I would give them some... very big wooden sticks... uhmm to cool(ph) them in that little small courtyard. And then I would say... "Now" you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you would be attending a funeral for two people (laughs).</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: And then you know, one of them would be dead and one of them would survive, you know... so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah... but... but if... but that would have killed you... either way...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you don't want to lose either of them.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it... you know I think... it, it speak very well of you because I think you're very loving. And I think you want them to be happy but you want yourself to be happy. But, you know what? I think what happened is that you tried to fix it too much.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't have put them in a room with sticks. But I'll put them in a room... and I would let them... I would put the responsibility on them to work it out. Because I think they have the capability of working it out. You know why? They have something very much in common. You know what?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They love you very much. They both want you, but they don't have to fight because... they had different relationships...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: [sighs deeply]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are his mother and you're his... love of his family. And they can't swap... they can't switch roles, they can never switch roles. You will never be Neil's mother, you will never be Lukas' husband... or wife. You see? So, they have their specific roles but they are not being allowed to work that out. Because you're so concerned about the happiness... and the balance... that I think that this has caused a stress for you.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I realize it, couple, couple of years ago, maybe, three or four years ago. And at that time, after a period of time when, Lukas and Neil kept coming to me saying, "Ayanna tell Lukas that..." or "Mom, tell Neil that...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I don't want him to... do."(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Right.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: So then, I did...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're a translator again.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Sorry?...[chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're working as a translator again.</p>

<p>[everyone chuckles]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well... they... they need it. They wanted me to do it... and... and... they actually did it... for a long... for two or three years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: And I thought, well, that be... they are not able to communicate because of the language and so on. So... I just... accepted that role and at that time maybe four years ago...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1:,I just... asked both of them to come to the kitchen, please sat down at the table and I said, "Well, you two... I don't want you to be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...something in the middle. You are adult... both of you and I would like you to solve your problems without me. If you tell me about them, I'll be happy if you find it necessary, but please don't come up to uh... you know...(crosstalk) don't push..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you said these to both of them?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah. They were sitting... we were actually sitting apart. We were there at the table.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And... and... what happened?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I think that it worked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So things are different now?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Definitely. Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me, what kind of relationship do you see they are having?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: More respectful... I think that they are more tolerant to each other. Even though I... if Neil wouldn't know that it's partly... a matter of... we found that Lukas is growing up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: He got a job and so we saw that he is more responsible now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: That's so long. But uh... I can't see some kind of uhmm... not willing to... can't do some agreement or some compromises or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then tell me how your thinking has changed now. That you see that's happened. What have you learned?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Huh... (sighs) (silence 00:33:26) I'm not sure if I'm able to... figure out (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Well let me take, let me make a guess, if there's(ph) the one...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you seem like a very beautiful person, a very sensitive person. I think you're probably a good mother... and it would... stops from you. But I think you want to fix things... you take responsibility to fix things and somehow you can. You have to let them repair... you have to let them work it out. Because you know, they will grow in their process of working it out. And when you said to Neil... "I don't think you're working hard enough," you know what happened? I think it didn't work hard enough because you tried to do it for him.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I think what they need is for you to step back and say, "I love you both... and I will not reject you both. But you have to work this out, because we all have to be a family."</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm. I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think about this?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhm, Well, I... meant to have the father role and then I... didn't see that it's working out, like that.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you may never be a father to Lukas? But you can be a friend.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can be his mother's spouse. Then that's maybe enough. Because he does have a father and I don't know if he sees him much.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Not at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know what? I think, if he's ready to... to have you as his father, he will come to you. But maybe that's not time yet. And...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: No. Well. I don't know if it's something that Lukas needs...(crosstalk) Uhm... But uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you... are you comfortable with his relationship with his mother? (silence) I think it's getting better.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhm... Maybe, it's a long story maybe but uhm... think equals about uhm, and then inevitably be together for so long. And... but I ge-, you know, it's getting better and I think they are now become more difficult to change... (clears throat) 'cause Lukas breaking away. Like (inaudible 00:36:12) But uhm, (inaudible 00:36:19)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. So, how do you feel it then? (ph)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... you get me (inaudible 00:36:27) things are getting better?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah, Uhuh huh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how does your thinking change about your family?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well, which one is to change? Well, uhmm... more... respect or times to each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that because there's less of the threat?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: [sigh] Maybe... uhm, second... thing is... I'm older and more man(ph) and then... than...than... before. Uhuh... [sigh] and I think... we, uhm... (inaudible 00:37:15) departed(ph) our land I have to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...we have to live together. Live for some fight and then (inaudible 00:37:32) each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now my question to you is to look in your process of learning to live together, did you have to change your thinking?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah. [soft voice]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you change your thinking and what did you change into? [silence]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah [whispers]... I think that I was suppose(ph) of... which any roles(ph) Lukas is growing up, our relationship re-opened and uhm... I think that sometimes... in the beginning it was just, uhm, making mistakes and gettin'... some experience after that... which probably like to... better understanding what real effect he might think... how he can feel... [unknown sounds] what he feel(ph) that I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...and uhm, I have to admit that when I had that very difficult time last year, especially last year. Because, there was a time two or four months (inaudible 00:39:03). We didn't talk to each other, Lukas and me. So, at that time Neil was very supportive 'bout him...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To both of you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...and well, to myself it might be difficult for my son (ph) because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he stayed for Lukas?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they did got closer after that?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I think so, I think so, I think that was a very good... he's very good, well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who-Who stop speaking to who?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I started speaking to Lukas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you stop, no, who stop from speaking?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhuh! Sorry...Lukas stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, uhm. Why did you stop speaking to your mom?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Uuhh...! [sigh] (inaudible 00:39:48) to look like...[laughs] (inaudible 00:39:56) Well, [laughs] 'cause when I'm sleep under my knee... (ph) [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're what?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Under my knee... and uhm, my room is like some really old bin.... sometimes</p>

<p>(background laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yo-, your room is like an, uh, a very old...(crosstalk) bin?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk) Trash bin.. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trash bin?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk) Trash...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Trish bin... Trash bin, yeah. Do you know my son? You see, I have a steel(ph) on my son...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: (crosstalk)No. (inaudible 00:40:35) (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELLOR: He's got a trash bin, too</p>

<p>(background laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's amazing. (laughs) well, not fit for human inhabitance...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, that's how you stop speaking? Because you went to your trash bin and that was it?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah, I went, I went to my trash bin, but uh, one day my mom, uh...got angry...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, young man, kept asking if you to... (crosstalk) (background laughing)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: And she says...Oh my God! Stop... and completely collect(ph) my... (crosstalk) everything, everything, goes, uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...just the way you like it, a mess, right?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah, and the half of the thing, uhmm, ended in the (inaudible 00:41:24)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uh, it didn't end there(ph)(background laughing).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you know, the symbolism here is that you wanted your life the way you want it and-, and this was a conflict between you and your mother so you stopped speaking... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah, it was uh, I... I...uhmm...(inaudible 00:41:44).</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1:Understand.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah, I understand it li--like some kind of attack into my territory or...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. But you know what's interesting, that stop, when you stop speaking that allowed you to-, to speak with him only and maybe that closer, maybe that is a way of getting closer to him (inaudible 00:42:04)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...or maybe because, I-ss, I needed some...thing... I don't know if, uh, (laughs)... uh... some support...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, uhmm....</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: From somebody... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see, like your trash bin...(background laughing)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: I'm not sure, but uhmm... I think this is quite long. This... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk) Oh, o...o-oh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm, I'm not going to take this up. You, are you a little bit sloppy?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Not at all, no. I'm pretty tight in here(ph)(background laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so, while they weren't speaking, tell me how the two of you became a little closer?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: I don't remember much about it you know. But I knew nothing, there wa--, there def- there was a time when, Ayanna just wouldn't speak to Lukas and she asked me to...uhmm, you know, there was any communication between(ph) and stuff like that... and Lukas, this is why...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: In a way, that was some kind of simulation of... you said... before... of room we three, too... in this room and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: From others</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yet?(ph).</p>

<p>(background laughing)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Because, uh... I didn't, uh speak with my mom and she didn't speak with me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For how long?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: 1 m--</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: 3 months.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: 3 month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 3 months?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah, and it's, I--, I don't see, uhmm... how (ph) just like, and, so there was a situation, our flat, and, me and Neil... and we live together... because m-mom (inaudible 00:43:55) so he maybe have to find out some sort of communication.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: (crosstalk) Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were forced to?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah... maybe.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, tell me wa--, what happened to your family... at this point? Where, where will things go for the future? If they fail, you'll get mad...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I would just say that after all these (sighs) events... I'm a little bit... I would like to be... optimistic but uhmm... it seem that I... somewhere inside of me I feel some kind of, uhmm... anxiety that, you know, one day maybe the next week, maybe after 5 years, I don't know, something might happen and... the things will get back again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what will you do?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Depends what this thing would be about, but uhmm, if it was something between Lukas and Neil, I would let them sort it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's not your responsibility.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Exactly (crosstalk) even I do care, that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You... you do, you can love them both very much. But that's something they have to work out because they both love you.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: That's... if it's... with something between me and one of them...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you'll work it out, too.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Now, probably, I might be able, but, I can't be sure(laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. How are you going to be... what will you do to try to make sure? Because people, families have problems. Always.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This... there will always be some problems and you will have some arguments. So, if you make a commitment that you will always work them out one way or the other and you set your mind to this: "That whatever it is, we will work on it because we love each other."</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay? That you need, I think, maybe that'll make you feel more secure about it.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I think so, I agree. Yeah,, uh hmm. And wha-- what help very much that was that... after that three months, very difficult months for me, I was uh,... I felt very bad about it. I could (inaudible 00:46:13) so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know what? That was a very important three months because things changed for the family. That maybe needed to happen...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Exactly. And not only that, not only that was good for uhhh... because of all for Lukas and Neil, for their relationship but, when uh, we started talking to each other, Lukas and me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did that start?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, I need it. We were thinking about buying a new computer. I'm not very good at computers, I mean, what I, and exact or what, while Lukas is quite good at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: So I just got the idea to just converse, you know. I didn't think it uh, I didn't sit down and I didn't think about how to start communicating with him, but uhmm, I was thinking about the computer. What part of the computer to get? And then I thought, well, I'll ask Lukas and it was simple like that. All of a sudden, so he was in the kitchen, I had this paper with somebody's notes... compositions. And I said, "Oh, Lukas, when you have time, could you kindly see this, just and tell me what you think about it. This will be our new computer."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he respond?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Yeah. And I was surprised how... how it was easy, for both of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were both ready?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Exactly. [chuckles] He wasn't surprised. And then we talked about many things and we explained many things to each other... from the past... (crosstalk) and since then</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) That was, that was good.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (crosstalk)Uh huh..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're... you're thinking about this exchange in many ways.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now Lukas is twenty. But someday, he'll have his own trash bin somewhere. Maybe out of (inaudible 00:47:54)(background laughing).</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: (chuckles)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: I'm sure... I'm sure... without the trash bin it would be a mess and untidy (background laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's great, that was good. We'll go over to his house and say, "Don't mess this up!" (somebody coughs) (indistinct murmurs)</p>

<p>PARTCIPANT1: Don't(ph) take that..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will happen then? Let's say, I don't know when this is, maybe one, two, three years in the future. Lukas will maybe meet someone to look out</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: (sighs deeply)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, what, how will things change again?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: For me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For everybody.</p>

<p>[long pause]</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: For me, I think that a process has already started. 'Cause, 'cause uhmm, I have to... when... what to ask Lukas where he is going, when he is going to be back, who with and so on? And it works... uhmm... and then to me which is very difficult... very, very. Uh, I'm trying not to care when he doesn't do things in that way I would like him to do it and I can see and I'm sure that there will be a problem if he doesn't do it in this way. I knew, I know that there was... will be a problem (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you let-- you're learning to let go.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh. So I'm trying to let him to get the experience... difficult.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, it's difficult because for a long time you were together. You were the only ones that each other had... that you could count on. And that's changed now because Neil has been around for a while. Each becoming more of a family but to let go of that is, is hard. It's very natural for one to hold on.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh, uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's very natural for him to start to pull away. And he has done that by, uh, making his bedroom a complete disaster.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is probably different from the way you live, and my guess is that Neil was right. That in time, he will come back and be very ...and uh, different...But now, he is finding himself.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you see your relationship changing... how do you, your relationship changing with Neil or Lukas goes on to (inaudible 00:50:14) side</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Well, that's a question... (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good question for either of you.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh hmm?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm. (clears throat) Well, I had, I thought there were, are(ph) still things that we need to, uhmm... (clears throat) resolved (inaudible 00:50:36) easier than said but, this year things would've been better. But, uhmm, there's a feeling that there's a lot of things to think(ph) and brush under the carpets...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk)Like what?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: (crosstalk)(inaudible 00:50:44) sign(ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such as what?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT2: Uhmm... Well, I, I know,... (clears throat) always had the feeling that we... aren't able to talk about important things (clears throat) Alright, for example, we're not, we should have, uhmm... you know, would have children (clears throat). It's not something new that we really talked about, and then we meet some complete stranger. (clears throat) And they come up and say, well, "Are you... are you gonna have children?" and we said, "Wooo, hey!" (chuckles) you know, and, and we hardly even talked about it ourselves. Uhmm... the result... I've, I've always felt this, this...I don't understand why but uhmm, we're just not able to sit down and talk about things like this easily(ph) done for..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is it so hard to do?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uhmm... well, I, I just disagree uhmm, with what Neil just said... because, uhm, we met some people, couple, couple of weeks ago and they were asking, well, "You've been together for seven years so, and then, what about children?" And, uhmm... I mean, I think that Neil is up to trying not to talk about it, it's not me. I don't feel it like that and maybe it was uh... uhmm... maybe he was just making a joke or something like that but, uh, I think that he said, well, I been troubled enough yet so I can't have a child. And then, the friends were saying, "Well, you know, but uh you know, you might be too old for it after...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: ...either ten or twenty years..." and huh hmmm(ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would like to have children?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: I did... I did. I, I wanted to have a child.(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) Uh huh.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Now, I'm not sure if I'm not... getting too (chuckles) uh, old for it. But now, maybe, maybe possible but uh...(crosstalk) twenty years.</p>

<p>COUNSELLOR: (crosstalk)Uh uhmm...(inaudible 00:52:43)(coughs). How would you feel if they have a child?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Uhmm...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Hahhh...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Well...(background chattering) Mom, uh, it will be interesting.</p>

<p>(background laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure it would, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>(background laughing)(someone coughing)(indistinct chattering)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...because I think... uhmm (crosstalk)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm asking that question because it's a very, very important one.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT1: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And my question is, if they decided to have a child... and they had a child, would you feel that you're still part of the family? Or would you feel that they were(ph) a special family without you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Nowadays, yeah. I... I think yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you would feel...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...like you were not part of that family.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: 'Cause...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh uhmm.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: ...I'm now a big boy and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(indistinct background chattering)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Uh, or... okay... young man (background laughing) And...(background chattering)... I don't know... I, I will be... I don't know, 'cause I'm feeling as I have now and, uhmm... in a way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That they would be... they would be a family...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The three of them...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT3: The three...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you would feel difficult (ph)</p>

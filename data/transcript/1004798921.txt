<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where are you today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a job interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, congratulations!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. (giggles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the scoop?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, okay. So they—a couple of weeks ago I applied to this library assistant position, but it's like a library assistant inside the archives, and like doing archival reference. And I'm definitely qualified in most ways, or overqualified except for the part where they want you to have experience with this system, which is their like online integrated computer system for their collections? Which I don't have experience because it's—even if I, like wanted to spend some time learning it, I was looking at the documentation which is like hundreds of pages, and there's no way I'm going to get through that, but like if I wanted to play with that I would have to pay a lot of money because that's proprietary software and, you know? Individuals don't buy these things. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>And also, it's not like I have a library collection that I can pretend to play around with. So I have absolutely no experience though, in my cover letter I wrote around that fact? Like I have experience working with technology in library and archive settings instead. So—and I'm actually sort of surprised that it's an in-person interview. But it's an in-person interview with a library recruiter. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a step!</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a step. So then it's like, do I—I guess this time I'm not going to make the same mistake I did last time, where it's like, I assume the other person actually has knowledge of what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at least this time I can, like gauge facial expressions and stuff, that I couldn't do last time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And I think asking, you know, if you can get further clarification on something, is a way of gauging if they've understood what you said without (pause) appearing condescending in any way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I'm saying? Do you know what I'm talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it could be hurtful, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I could say, "How much experience do you have with it?" Or something. Though I have no clue what they're going to ask me. [00:02:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could always ask, "Can I give you more information?" A way of putting it on yourself, rather than putting the onus of them (pause) on them for describing what they know or not? You could always ask, "I'd be happy to." You know, or offer. "I'd be happy to give you more detail."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad you got this step. It's very encouraging and (pause) hopefully the interview will go well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I still have time to get like, a shirt for the interview and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that must be on the list today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. Like this afternoon, Sydney and I are going to go to Macy's, and I'm going to get some blouses and stuff. But like, I know. It's like actually a real person full-time job with benefits and all that stuff. I'm just sort of afraid I'm not going to get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I hope that it goes well. [00:03:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And they got back to me remarkably quickly, like (pause) maybe it was within... no, it was within two weeks of me submitting my application to them. So, yeah. In the meantime I've lost all motivation to apply to other jobs, even though I really should apply to other jobs. It's like, there's no way to know whether or not I'll get this job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, none of the other jobs I've seen have been, like, as good as this one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe spending the time preparing for this interview... you said you can't play around with the software, but you can read a little bit about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. But it's like hundreds of pages, and most of it is like, "Click on this icon to do this,", you know, "Click on this icon to do this and that," and it's like, it's not going to be that helpful. It's like, more of a reference guide so I can't really—I really can't do that much without having the software in front of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All I can do is talk about using similar software, or software that I think is similar.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's good preparation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't even know if it's really similar because it's like, because I've never used this other software. Like... [00:04:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How easy was it for you to learn the other software?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's the similarity, right? "Here's some stuff I've used, it was really easy for me to pick that up."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I would imagine that I would be able to pick up this software easily too."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could say that I easily picked up, like, Microsoft Word or Chrome or something, and that wouldn't be much, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that cataloging software might have more in touch with other—if they're used in similar settings, they might have some...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this was a museum setting, and for museum objects and stuff, and not like library collections, but, um... I guess it's close. I mean, I guess they wouldn't have called me in for an interview if they didn't think I was qualified.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. If they didn't think you might be a good candidate. So they know what—they know what their requirements are, and what the job requirements are, and they have some knowledge based on your cover letter and your resume, of what you've done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I never claimed to know that system, so it's not like I am pretending that I know it, or have used it for all the things ever. I just—you know, I did not say I didn't know it, but I didn't say I knew it. So... I did not lie to them in the cover letter, I do not have to keep up a lie. Um... since I can't really make myself lie in the cover letter. [00:05:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, and there's no need to lie. That's saying—but there is a call for you to sell yourself to them, you know? But that doesn't—saying that you, you've picked—you're good with computers. Saying that you can pick something up because you know that you can learn quickly is not lying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're intelligent, you have experience with lots of different types of things. Library school was pretty easy for you. These are things that you know about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still thinking that library school is easy for everyone and still convinced that Aaron's cat could apply to and get in if we somehow faked the GRE scores or something. (giggling) But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This does not need to be said on the interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Just... I don't know that I'm particularly good at anything, and then it's also forgetting that certain things in library stuff are like jargon or technical when I think that they can't be really technical, this is stuff that's really easy in the humanities. Everyone knows this stuff, clearly, when... [00:06:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not actually true, you actually do have a specialized set of knowledge, and giving yourself some credit for that is important (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I'd say I learned stuff in like half of my library school classes. Maybe like two-thirds of my library school classes I like, learned things in, and then there were a couple that I just didn't. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think you need to do well on the interview? What would set you up for success?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For one thing, getting a good outfit together. Because I'm going to wear nice pants and a shirt, and my boots. I hope that's professional enough, because I don't have a suit that fits and I would not have time to get a suit that fits. I really don't want to have to buy another suit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that, like, office wear would be fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just—the conservative rule is dressing up a little bit more than you would if you worked there, and I've never seen a suit in a library. Working there. (chuckles) Maybe a law office person wandering through a law library, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. I've never seen anyone work in a library wear a suit either, so... [00:08:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that you'll be okay without a suit for the interview. And having something that you feel comfortable in so that you can feel confident is important too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess just knowing—I just wish I knew what they were going to ask so I could be prepared for what tough questions they're—the woman I'm interviewing with could ask me. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be a tough question for you? [00:08:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) some of them are like, you know, "What have been your biggest challenges at work?" And stuff like that, and I'm like, you know, all the jobs I've had until now—like any job that I've actually managed to get, they've all been easy. Or like my internships too. Like, maybe they were easy because I was good at them, but they weren't really things that were really, really challenging, like work really hard for a solution. Also, anything that relates to like, office conflicts or anything like that, I guess the answer is just, I've always been very fortunate and have always had really nice coworkers who I got along with, which is true. [00:09:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like a good answer. And you can spin that other answer. I mean, if you feel like—I mean, being able to say, "What I've actually found more challenging is finding a job position that was a good match for me. The jobs I've had, I've enjoyed and I haven't found particularly challenging." You can spin it to fit for you. Because you've had a really hard time finding positions that you've wanted to apply for. That's been the hard part for you. The internship you've had, the jobs you've held—you've enjoyed going to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There was never really any time that I tried to go into work—and yeah, finding a job is a lot harder for me than actually doing the job, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe that's your answer if you get that type of a question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not even sure what... okay, they're going to ask me what softwares I know, and I need to look over my resume, and every cover letter I sent them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And remember all the things that you actually know how to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you don't want to sell yourself short. [00:10:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And... But like I want to sound confident. And also, I'm afraid they're going to look at me and think I'm too young-looking or something and I don't know my stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not take me seriously. But... technically that would be age discrimination.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have the degree, and it shows, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's true. I do, and I have other degrees too. And they can put together from those degrees that, like, at least the minimum age that I must be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I would imagine on some sort of application somewhere is your birthdate. What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Is there? I don't know. I guess I would have to go back through and apply for another job and look at my information and see whether or not my birthday is there. Um... but... yeah, like... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your confidence may be more important than your age.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you feel you're confident, people don't question your ability, regardless of what age they might guess you are. Some ways of expressing your confidence, meeting their eyes when you're talking, making lots of eye contact, smiling, standing up nice and straight. It doesn't matter how tall you are, it—[00:12:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to be sitting down, wouldn't I?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At some point, but I'm imagining you're going to need to get from one room to the next, and I'm sure you're not going to do that sitting down. Those things—walking with confidence, standing up straight, shoulders back—those little things that you've probably heard from people send up signals that people pick up on, whether they notice that they're picking up on them or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the other thing is like, how I'm put together. Like I have no clue what I should do with my hair, I have no clue, like, whether or not I should put on makeup since, like, normally I don't wear makeup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel when you put on makeup?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it's been so long—did I? I may have worn makeup to the wedding, and before that I wore it to the other wedding, but only to—I think I've only done it when I'm being photographed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what makes you choose to put makeup on for those occasions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because experience having been looking washed out in other photographs, where I wasn't wearing makeup. And I don't want to repeat that. (giggles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. You liked how you looked better with it. In the pictures. [00:13:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the pictures. Not necessarily in person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel in real life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Real life, I think I look fine without it. I'm just afraid that it will look sloppy if I don't wear it or something, even though I normally don't wear it. And also my hair, if I leave it down, it's like really, really long and that would be unprofessional, but if I put it up—like I can't put it up like I have it right now, because that's also unprofessional, and I don't have any sort of professional-looking way of putting up my hair. And even if people aren't consciously judging that, they'll subconsciously judge that, and so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you feel it's unprofessional now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This isn't messy, I didn't really brush it before putting it in. It's like a bun that's, like, not really tightly put in. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you could do a neater version of that that might feel more professional for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I mean, there's a reason I don't do that normally, and it's not just because I'm lazy. It's also because sometimes when I brush it then I end up having like weird bumps in places and something like that, and having it look worse. And then I'm like, "Oh, maybe I should get a haircut today!" and I don't want to have short hair in general, if it would help me get a job for sure. You know, I'm sure once I have the job it would be fine for me to have long hair, but once you have your hair cut you can't get it to be long instantly again. [00:14:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have to wait several months for it to grow. So... that's like, preventing me from going and getting a haircut. So... and then also, whether or not I should even take out my nose ring, if people are even going to notice that. Because I usually forget that I have it, but... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are no right answers for any of those questions. These are very subjective questions that you're asking yourself. I think the best answer is, how are you going to feel most confident? (pause) And if that's, you know, with a little bit of makeup because you think that you... because you're kind of stepping outside yourself and wondering how they're judging you, then wear a little bit of makeup. Do you have to? No, of course not. That shouldn't impact the outcome. But if you feel a little bit more confident that way, by all means it's fine to do that. With regards to your hair, if you feel like it doesn't quite feel neat enough the way I do it every day, then taking a little extra time to smooth out the bumps and comb it any way might make you feel like you've done a little bit something extra to feel a little bit more professional, in the way that you present physically. (pause) [00:16:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And jewelry, which I don't know if I should be wearing jewelry. I didn't know if it should be something, like, small and unobtrusive and like, matching my outfit, but (pause) which I don't even know what my outfit's going to be because I don't have the shirt yet. So... (pause) all these things. And I guess technically my nose ring is jewelry. But I don't even know if the majority of people even notice it without being told.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really small.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel like I shouldn't have to take it out, and I don't think it makes me look unprofessional.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you have to. It's not a "have-to."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not a job in the financial district.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think if I were interviewing for a place where I would have to wear a suit, then I would probably take it out but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There I think the expectations are a little bit more stringent probably, in certain fields. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other thing is, I also don't want to wear a suit. So I don't want to work somewhere where I would have to wear a suit every day. That would just suck. A lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not your field. Your field doesn't require that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless it is, like, corporate archives or something like that. But I'm not looking at corporate archives currently. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you want this job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's, like, what I want to do. I mean, I guess that it's slightly like lower level than—this is more like entry-level, and you don't need to be a professional archivist to have this job, you'd be working for the reference archivist. But I'd pretty much be doing reference archivist-type things, like, you know, people come in with research questions, and I would help them find the answers. You know, I wouldn't be processing questions, but I would be going through collections and helping them find what they need, which is like, the fun part—one of the fun parts anyway, and it's something I actually enjoy doing, and, you know, full-time, actual benefits, decent salary, it's a one-year term of employment with possibility of renewal based on (pause) funding, and whether or not they like the person. [00:18:13]</p>

<p>But you know, it would be stability for at least a year. But, um... and you know, well, actually, I'm sort of confused—I know exactly where my job interview is, I'm kind of confused as to where the job itself would be. Because usually the website is good about listing the areas. But, like, this job is at the university archives. And (pause) that's in the PC library, which is underneath the library, which is on the main campus. However, the job ad itself lists the location. So... I'm a little bit confused about that. I mean, if it were here it would be really convenient, then I could, like, walk to work and stuff and get all that walking done, at least until the winter. If it was in the city, it would be slightly less convenient but it's still... fine. (chuckles) I could just take the bus and, like, knit on my way to work or knead on my way to work or something, and that would be fine. But... [00:19:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This job sounds like it's got really good possibilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does, and it would be perfect, and it's something I'm actually good at, and (pause) there's nothing—I guess I would also be answering phones and stuff, which would be a little bit hard, I guess. But I think I'm better at answering phones than I am at making phone calls to people I don't know. And I mean, I've gotten a lot better at making phone calls to people I don't know as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've had to get some practice at that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think I'd be fine with like, (pause) though I have answered phones before. I just haven't done it in years. Because, like I didn't do it when I was working at the clinic because, like, you needed to be specially trained to answer the phones, because the clinic is the one school department that has a 1-800 number. So people will call there looking for anything to do with the school, because hey, it's free. So they're the most interacting-with-the-public department of the university. But—so I never answered the phones there, and of course I didn't answer the phones at either of my internships. But I did answer the phones back when I was working as a cashier. And I answered the phone a lot. It was just that it was so long ago that I forgot that I even did that, but, like... you know, this was high school. I don't think that's like, really... [00:20:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't need to be on your resume.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's not on my resume usually, unless I'm looking for a retail job for something, then I would put it there. But, like, if they ask me about that sort of thing, I'll tell them, "Oh, yes, I answered the phone... ten years ago."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they have that specific question, you can certainly go back and say, "Yes, but, you know..." like you said, a really long time ago, I did have this position that required me that in my job. And I'd be happy to do it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I don't mind answering phones. It should be okay. If I don't really think there's anything... the only thing I think I'm not qualified is knowing the system, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you can certainly know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I can know, eventually, I just don't know yet, and don't have the time. Because they asked me on Wednesday, and, okay, yeah, I could have technically been studying this Thursday, Friday, yesterday and today, but it's not going to be enough. Because I don't have a library and I don't have the software. So... like I can't... [00:21:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't had the opportunity for you to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which they can't really fault me for if I've never really had a job inside the library itself. Like, I've worked in archive shops.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you haven't had the opportunity to learn it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'd welcome it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. According to Aaron, it is a pain. But that's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which will remain unsaid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would, yeah. (chuckling) Like I'm not sure why they use it, but they do. But I know all the technical things, and I know things that are more technical than that, because it's like talking, like, um, if you look at the website, "Oh, this is based on XML." And I'm like, "I know XML." And I guess at the one screen, it's like, "Oh, lots of numbers. That must be the mark record field." Oh, God. Their documentation is so awful, and their screen shots are, like, the most unhelpful thing ever, like you can barely see the screen that they're taking a picture of, and it's all tiny, and it's like, how is this supposed to help me if I don't have this right in front of me? And even if I did... so... like—and also, I don't know how long it will be between this and the next interview if I can get a next interview, and I'm like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One step at a time. Today's job is to get ready for the interview. Tomorrow's job is to be present at the interview. And then you wait. [00:23:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also, how do I tell them, like if they say that they want to, you know, contact me again? Like if they call me on the phone the following Monday or Tuesday, I will not pick up because it will be Rosh Hashanah. And I try to avoid stuff about talking about the Jewish holidays before. I have to. But, um, you know, I don't want to seem all rude for not responding to them and like, you know, for like a good 48 hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you could ask if they could anticipate when you might hear back, and then based on their response you may or may not have to worry about Jewish holidays. If they say, "We expect to get back to you within a day," no worries. "We have several candidates to interview and we expect to get back with people within the next three weeks," you probably don't have to worry about it. So maybe you could get an idea from them of when you might hear something. And then, if they say, "Oh, what about a week?" you could say, "I'm going to be unavailable on these days." [00:24:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then the other concern is, theoretically it's a 9 to 5 job, and then in the winter, Shabbat starts at like, 4 so whether or not there'd be a way for me to make up those hours some other time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, get the job first.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I guess you bring that up after you have the offer, I guess is when you'd bring something like that up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess normal people would have to sometimes leave early sometimes to, like, pick up their kids or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, people sometimes need to have doctor's appointments, people sometimes have child care, people sometimes have religious obligations. So your job is now to get the job, and not to talk them out of hiring you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to mention the religious thing until I have to, which would not be now. And it's not like they would want me to work on Saturdays, so it should be okay. I'm sort of also hoping that the interview process takes a little bit of time so I would get hired after, like close to the holidays or over, so I don't have to worry about missing work because of all the holidays. Especially because like, you get—I guess 15 days of vacation time in the beginning? But it's accrued at like, one day every, like, you know, 2/3 of a month or whatever it is that they posted, so it would not be enough to take off for all of the holidays. [00:25:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it wouldn't be paid time but a lot of the times if you haven't accrued the paid time off? You can take unpaid time off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know I did that at the universtiy because I started at the beginning of the school year as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The Jewish holidays always fall at the beginning of the academic calendar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I took unpaid time off, and then just accrued my paid time off later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're all on Tuesday. Monday and Tuesday, and then Yom Kippur is on a Wednesday, and everything is like the most inconvenient time ever. I guess it's better than the Thursday-Friday-Saturday ones that are like three days in a row, and for three weeks at that, and... those ones are even worse, but these ones are pretty bad too. I wish it could be one of those years where everything was on a Saturday or Sunday, and then I wouldn't have to worry about it. I guess one of those days I won't have to miss, because one of those days is Columbus Day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like Succot, or some lap Torah is on Columbus Day, so I would not have to miss work because I'd already be missing work. But other than that, yeah. I mean, I doubt—even if I did awesomely at the interview, I doubt they'd like, you know, give me the next interview the next day, and like, hire me, like, the next week or something. That's like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The holidays come around real quick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can't be the only one they hire who's Jewish, though. Like, I can't, and like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they might not all miss, like two days of Rosh Hashanah or like, Succot, or anything, but a lot of people would at least miss the first day of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One step at a time. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're jumping ahead lots of steps, to "What would they think about this next thing?" And your job right now is to focus on selling yourself to the position, and not the details of time off or scheduling, but because if you would do a great job at the position, scheduling glitches are scheduling glitches. They usually can be worked around. If you're the right person for the job, it will be worth it to work around those things for you. And so your job right now is to be the right person for the job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's the other question, what if ask me, like, what I've been doing for the past few, or why I've been unemployed for all this time? It doesn't look like that on my resume, though, because I put the whole consulting archivist position at the Historical Society even though that's not a paid position. [00:28:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is time, and it is in the field. And volunteering and consulting is a wonderful thing to do as you look for the right position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, if they ask me what I've been doing with the past six months I guess I'll have to pretend like I was spending more time with the Historical Society than I've actually been spending there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so that's one option. What's another way that you can direct the story to be (pause) positive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure. Because, like, a lot of it was just not having found a job, so I guess... but I don't want to be like, "Well, I was just holding out for the perfect job, because," yes, I kind of am...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then I sound spoiled or something? [00:29:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it doesn't sound spoiled to me, because you're talking to the person who has the perfect job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds selective. High standards. So I think you can say, you know, "I've really been looking for a position that felt like the right fit, a position that I'd be really excited about working for." Because look who you're talking to, someone who has a position that you'd be really excited about working for, and who do I want to hire? Somebody who really wants this job, and didn't settle for some other job that they were just plying away on. So selling it, it's packaging it in a way that sounds pleasing to them. Which is true, you are really excited about this interview. I mean, you described it as "the perfect job." In here today. So you may not want to use those exact words for them, but talking about it from a perspective of, "I've been spending time looking for a job that's the right fit, and I'm really excited about this opportunity. You know, I've been looking for the right opportunity and while I did that, I've been volunteering or I've been consulting," because that means it's paid work now, right? (giggling) [00:30:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For a very, very short period of time it's continuing to be paid work but yeah, because then if they ask me, "Why are you leaving the Historical Society?" The real answer is, because it's a mostly volunteer job and I want something that pays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. That's okay. You know, the amount that they're able to pay is not sustainable. And while you're really excited about that work, the funding is not—</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like a tiny little, tiny grant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think you know, saying, "Well, I really enjoyed that work and I would like to be able to continue to volunteer, but the grants I need is not something that's sustainable for me." They know that you need to eat, pay rent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most people are not independently wealthy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. Yeah, I just like, I don't know if they—there are just so many ways this can go wrong, and I don't know if -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's look at what you can do to make it go right. There's also things that can go right about it. [00:31:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. I just haven't had a job interview go well in, like, so long that—I mean, I haven't even had an in-person interview since November, and I guess—I mean, I guess that went well because I would have gotten the job, had I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had you wanted to take it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Had I wanted to take it, but at the time I really didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, so far this is going better than most, and there's a possibility it will continue to. Because you haven't made it to the stage where you were able to sell yourself, really, at a lot of places you've applied. You know, it was the cover letter and the resume, and you really didn't get your chance to talk to them, and express why you'd be great for the position, and why they should hire you. And with this one, you're getting the opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, surprisingly I realized, after I'd sent it I'm like—I left out the date of, you know, you put the date before you start your actual letter? I left that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess they didn't notice. [00:32:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they still—yeah. So whether they noticed or not, you had enough in your experience and what you said that made them think you'd be good for this, you'd be worth interviewing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You think they'd expect it to be there and didn't notice it wasn't there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's possible. It's also how important is it? I mean, that doesn't—well, yes, you'd like to have a flawless application?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's important in terms of attention to detail, which is theoretically important in my field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is, but really what they want to know is, what have you done? What do you know? And you can express some detail-oriented abilities in person. And the things that you're thinking about, how do I want to present myself? What's an appropriate type of jewelry? Those are details that you are paying attention to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I have to see what shirt I end up coming up with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and what you feel is a good match.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the jewelry. I guess I could also buy cheap jewelry at Macy's while I'm there. [00:33:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you need anything necessarily. I mean, if you don't typically wear jewelry, you don't need to have jewelry on for an interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't need to wear earrings?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I know people who don't have their ears pierced that are employed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. And I mean, though they do make clip back earrings. I know because I actually own some.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not very comfortable, but they do exist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not a job requirement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you feel like you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just afraid that everything will like, look not all put together without it and I won't have, like, enough. And I won't look professional enough or grown up enough or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel more grown up with earrings or jewelry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it depends on which earrings or jewelry I'm wearing. Some, maybe some.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then, again, I think a lot of it is about you feeling confident. So if you find something, or you have something that makes you feel grown up, then wear it. Because then you'll feel grown up. Then you'll feel more put-together. The words that you're using. (pause) But certainly (pause) I know grown-up women that do not have pierced ears that are employed. [00:35:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But do they wear necklaces or something else to work? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The particular person I'm thinking about does usually wear necklaces. Because she likes them. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like, something, and I don't know that many counselors wearing jewelry to an interview, because the whole point is to not be that noticeable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, your nose ring is pretty small.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If somebody sits across from you in interviewing space, I know you have one, you've mentioned it, but it's not very noticeable, just from this kind of conversation or distance perspective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it just seems—I really want this job, it would be what I want to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a wonderful thing to be able to express. If you can get that across. [00:36:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I guess, most of the things I've gone to the interview stage, they haven't been—except for one, the internship at the Library, that one, I really wanted too. But other than that one, the other interviews that I've had, there were ones that were okay or whatever, but like, they weren't in my field, and exactly what I want to be doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a great opportunity. I'm really excited that you have the opportunity to interview for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like a real-person job instead of just like a part-time job, and I wouldn't have to be reliant on my parents anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be nice for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least for a year until the funding runs out, and then I have to find a new job, but still, it's a whole year to, like, save away money and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, a whole year to do something that it sounds like you're really interested in, to feel secure, to feel independent. It's a good opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I'm just so afraid that I'm not going to get it, and someone else will because even if I do this... Because this isn't even the person I'd be working with. So, like, she's just a recruiter. So if I do get the next stage, it's still possible the next person isn't going to like me. [00:37:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's get through this step.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yeah, I don't even know. I hope that she isn't the recruiter that I had talked to on that phone interview and did badly on? But I don't think so because I think the other person was just a general worker and not a library recruiter. I don't know if I recognized the voice because that was, like, back in March?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And recruiters probably talk to lots of people. And what stands out for you, it may not stand out for that person. Because they probably talk to lots of people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By the nature of their job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really wish they would let me know the kind of questions they would ask me, and I don't. You know, there's the usual, "Tell us about your previous position, blah blah blah, and what experience relates to this?" But I don't know, should I spend time like, tonight writing out questions that I think they would ask me and answers that I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could, and I think in general spending some time thinking about yourself in general. Because really, what they want to know is, what is your experience, and what are you like? How do you work with others? How do you get along with others? How do you usually function in a group? Can you be self-directed? I think thinking about how do you usually work, thinking about yourself and some ways to talk about yourself in strength-based terms. Whatever question they ask, you find a way to get your strengths in that answer. That's not lying, that's presenting information that helps them know what you're good at. And then their job is to say, "Okay, so this is what this person's really good at, is that a good match for the job?" Your job is to let them know what you're really good at, and that you're really interested in the job. [00:39:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just so afraid they'll do ones that will trip me up, like, "What is your biggest weakness?" or whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so what is your biggest weakness? Let's practice it. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only answer that I would actually give them, which is true though it's not my biggest weakness, and I actually got this idea from someone else, is to say that I'm very bad with remembering people's names at first. You know, if I'm introduced to people that I'm going to see all the time, sure, I will know their names. But if I meet people in passing? I'll never remember their names, and there are times where they will even come up to me and be like, "Hi, Georgia!" and I'll be like, "Hi, person who I don't remember at all." So, like—and it's not something that would make me bad at my job and it something that other people can identify with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Now, and so phrasing that, "Sometimes I have real difficulty remembering someone's name." And then you can connect that to the job. And you can say that, "It might be something I want to work on and be able to remember clients that might come in, people who come into the library." [00:40:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Luckily I'll have access to their computerized records and can look up... (giggling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because I think part of that question—that's a pretty typical question, what's your weakness, or what's your greatest challenge—is answering it, and then not condemning yourself by it, finding a way that, "Here's how I work around my weakness." Because that's what we need to do, we all have weaknesses, and we need to find a way to work around them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the other thing would be that, or yeah, the biggest challenge you've encountered in your workplace, which I'll have to say, actually most of the jobs I've had have been really—like all of my internships in the field, I've found them easy. Not because the work is actually necessarily easy, but just because it just makes so much sense to me. But then I can't think of an actual challenge that I've overcome and... like... I can't really, I guess (pause) I don't know, maybe I can talk about the Historical Society and how they don't really have an archive, and how the biggest challenge is like, starting off from scratch. [00:41:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's a good answer. And what have you found difficult about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact that their entire collection is organized like a museum collection, and therefore I have absolutely nothing—like usually you'll have a collection to process, like if you're an intern or something like that, or not the person in charge, and it will be like a discrete collection and you'll have at least some sort of background or something. And this is like, (pause) everything, and starting from scratch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can talk about starting this task where there really was no groundwork really laid for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the current thing I'm working actually does have groundwork laid out for me, because they've had to do stuff in order to get the grant. So she had to at least, like, survey the collection and figure out what was inside of it. But most of the time I feel like I'm not accomplishing much because I feel like there's so much there that hasn't been accomplished.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's another way to phrase it, one thing that's hard for you is being in a position where there's so much to organize that it's challenging not to be able to see the progress. So there's another way to spin it. So I think spending some time today, you need to go shopping and find an outfit that you feel comfortable in, that makes you feel presentable and professional enough. And then your other job is to spend some time thinking about these types of questions so that—you don't necessarily want to have prepped answers, because you don't want it to sound scripted, but starting to think about these things so you have kind of a somewhat formed notion of, "Oh, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would talk about if they ask this particular question." (pause) [00:43:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's all you can do to prepare.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really hard not knowing until, and to force myself to write these other applications so I can, like, for these jobs that are not as good as this one. And you know, there's this one that, like, is pretty good, it's 28 hours a week permanent position, I don't know if I would have benefits, but it's this evening manager, so it's this Monday through Thursday night, 3 PM to 11 PM? Which...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is that one due? Do you need to get that in today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I don't know if that one had a due date. I think they wanted you to start soonish, but I don't know if it's—it's posted last Tuesday, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it would be good to get it in within the week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just like, I don't know, maybe having something to take my mind off the interview might actually be a good thing if I'm getting something else accomplished. But, like, it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it doesn't have to take forever. If you sat down and focused, you could probably get that done in less than an hour. [00:44:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, set a goal for yourself, send that one out, go shopping, give yourself some time to think, and then get lots of rest tonight so that you're rested and fresh for the interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess I also have, like—and I have all this time where Sydney has therapy at two, so between two and three...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll have an hour -</p>

<p>CLIENT:—to do work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So that sounds like a good plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just have so much trouble staying motivated. And I guess this helps, because I'm like, "Whoa, I submitted something and I actually got a response!"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it's nice to get a good response.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess I really just thought that I really should stay with the stuff in my field. Because the admin assistant jobs that I am qualified for, I don't get responses back because I'm overqualified. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very frustrating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All the more reason to not put out all that effort and just to focus on -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To focus on things that are a little bit more tailored for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my parents are like, "Get a job, any job." I'm like, "It's not that easy. They're not going to hire me for certain jobs. If I applied for McDonald's, I doubt they would hire me when I have a bachelor's and two master's degrees. [00:45:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're too expensive for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they don't have food or service experience. So anything that—the only job that I'd, like, could get in retail, I think would be working at a yarn store and those jobs are hard to get, because everyone wants to work in a yarn store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everyone who can knit. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everyone who can knit wants to work in a yarn store. Therefore, it's not like they have all these openings in the yarn stores that they're trying to fill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, right now focus on getting that one other one in your field out, prepping for tomorrow, and resting. And we need to schedule some follow ups.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Especially because Monday is Rosh Hashanah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why don't we skip that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And is there another—Tuesday is also Rosh Hashanah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not here Wednesdays and Thursdays, so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What about that Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we can do Friday the 21st, or if you just want to meet next Monday the 24th, either one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, probably better if I did the 21st, because I don't want to go that long without therapy and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, on the 21st, I can offer you an 11:30, a 12:30, and a 1:30. Or a 2:30. I have lots of possibility on that Friday. [00:46:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, let's see, the 21st. How about the 12:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so 12:30 on the 21st. (scribbling)</p>

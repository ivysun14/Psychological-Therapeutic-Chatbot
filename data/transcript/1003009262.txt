<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And thank you very much for signing those, [PATIENT NAME].  So you were telling me about having a nice Easter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me what you did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got a couple of boxes of [INAUDIBLE] tobacco cigarettes in my Easter basket.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still smoking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I still smoke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you with those uh, matches earlier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now tell me how -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I only [INAUDIBLE] when I go back to work though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you been cutting down?  Have you been cutting down on your smoking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've been smoking a couple.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my word because I was hoping that you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been smoking five or six outside the workshop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I was hoping with us starting the Zoloft that you'd be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was smoking the five and taking the sixth one home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Have you noticed any change in your um, thinking about cigarettes or how much you've been smoking since we started the Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I smoked four on Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I'm, when I'm going to the work, workshop on Sunday.  One at breakfast, one to ride, one at supper and one at 8:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you use -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take a shower and take one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you still tend to be smoking when you're feeling down in the dumps or is it more when you're feeling bored or what would you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] makes me smoke on Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's when [NAME OTHER]'s not there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it seems like you were smoking more cigarettes per day before -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We just started the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How many did I smoke?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was more like between, it was about a half a pack, so would we be talking about 10, about 10</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now you're talking about more like a quarter to a third of a pack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, five -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a little better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I smoke five [INAUDIBLE] taking the sixth one back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Are you feeling any better physically?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're not having the cigarettes as much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you look better -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  What time do you go to bed?  What time do you usually turn in for the night?  Like lights out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like 10:00 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what time do you wake up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 7:00 or 8:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, so that's a good solid sleep -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 7:00 or 6:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, okay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, mostly I ate them all.  I like the hard boiled eggs the best so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You ate them all?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, how about you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had some too?  That's excellent, very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I had the hard boiled dyed eggs, [NAME OTHER] made me hard boiled eggs, cut up hard boiled eggs out of the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can also make egg salad out of them if you want to.  That's not a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With coffee.  [NAME OTHER] makes me good breakfast in the morning.  Coffee, [INAUDIBLE], apple juice -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now are you eating three meals a day now?  You're eating regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's another thing that's improved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.  That's very, very good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> This is from her physical and that's from her last visit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, excellent those blood pressure, that blood pressure is looking really good 158/82, very good, thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fantastic.  I've been hearing about Easter and dyeing eggs and all the fun stuff they been doing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm thrilled, she's on, sounds like she's sleeping well at night -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM or so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We had a totally 360.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's so good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In a good way, no.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah, things going okay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like oh, well she, I don't know [INAUDIBLE], she's having issues and stuff with infection and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And [NAME OTHER] was saying they put her on this cancer drug, well it's, it's a drug that they give people with cancer patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But I told them maybe her infection is so resistant they're trying something very, very strong -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> To try to knock it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, poor [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But um, you just seem like a 360.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Outgoing, you know joking -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With [NAME OTHER] right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and of course the Zoloft helps.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's the stress, I think that was sort of stressful because the other one was torment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know but we've seen a big difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know still a little obsessive but I guess that's just what we're going to have to deal with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's always room, you know this Zoloft is not at a very, very big starting dose.  It's always possible to raise that and if the obsessions really seem to be digging in and trying to take over for her.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, uh you know I think we can give it a little more time because sometimes when you, you know we'll see through the changes of seasons and -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Adjustments and things like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to keep this one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no you ain't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum, sort of kind of goes with my outfit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You don't think so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, take your lunch bag back then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'll keep my pocketbook.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And from what [NAME OTHER] tells me, she's eating regularly and she's smoking a little less.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Somewhat, possibly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hold on, I'll tell you exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It was definitely [INAUDIBLE].  [INAUDIBLE] the peaking and stuff that's gone, but I think that's, it just her, I mean.  Oh, you know what [INAUDIBLE] that you'll see I had her, they didn't tell me about this one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, on three, you'll see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, daily routines.  Repetitive behaviors, yeah a little bit of that OCD you're talking about.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, let's track that and you know if we need to make an adjustment in the Zoloft, we certainly can.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, this is something new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I smoke five a day and take the sixth one back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Might be worth raising the Zoloft today, you know?  What do you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you want, you can track her a little bit more -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some of that obsessiveness because like you're saying there has been a change with her roommate.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know and maybe there's some adjustment there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there's definitely room to work with the Zoloft, you know it's just really a starting dose type dosing at this point.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is that, is that the same smile you give [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or is that a different smile?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Why you laughing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have a wonderful smile.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is that the same smile.  Oh, I did it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I get the same smile.  When [NAME OTHER] goes to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] he does this.  He just smiles and goes, yes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So, umm, umm.  Mister Happy, happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're looking out for each other.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum, uh-huh, I got you.  All right listen, honey if you want to sit in here, you can, if you want to go sit out front while she do, does [PATIENT NAME] you can do that also, which ever one you want to do, okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, we're just finishing up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You want to go sit outside and wait?  Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sit here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're going to sit here, okay.  Okay that's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Always a pleasure to have you along.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I tell you what we'll do, we'll switch seats.  Why don't ya'll get up and switch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay?  You need to put your shirt in your pants instead of having it hang out?  [INAUDIBLE].  How was your holiday by the way [PHYSICIAN NAME]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was nice, thanks, it just flew by.  How about for you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It was good.  It was um, I don't know [INAUDIBLE].  My husband mother passed away like all a sudden.  That was March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, went to sleep and didn't wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness, that's the best way to go if you're going to go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, you know what, my sister told me I'm crazy.  I said, "She the only woman I know that went [INAUDIBLE], she had one of those sexy little nightgowns."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bless her heart.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe she was ready, you never know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You never know, sometimes people -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it was a lot of stress for her though.  Like a friend of hers had had a stroke.  Uh, she went to see him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And then her mother in law had passed away, she was like [AGE].  But she had a long illness and they said that there was definitely, you know hospice said, "Like you know this is it."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And um, she got that news that Saturday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And um, she passed away that Saturday night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> They said about, probably about 2:00 or 3:00.  She passed away so I was like, "Umm."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe it just kind of was reminding her that for her, it was time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's just too much, too, too, too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Excuse me.  Yes, [NAME OTHER]?  No, why?  Oh I don't, it maybe something wrong with the phones, I don't know.  I don't, well I'll tell you what I'll do.  Um, I'm getting ready to go upstairs soon as I'm done with [PATIENT NAME].  I'll call you, all right, bye bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, feel free to check this over, make sure we've got everything we need.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll work on these last forms here.  What do you have planned for the rest of today, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have other plans for the rest of today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, smoking.  [LAUGHING].  [LAUGHING].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what I get for asking you about it, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put it on your mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you know [NAME OTHER] here says you are doing better with that at least -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Smoking outside with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and the less you can do it the better, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keeps you healthier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you ever try the gum instead?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What the gum in, Easter candy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've been -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm talking about like Nicorette gum instead of cigarettes, you know they have a substitute.  No?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I think it's um, remember we went through this with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Um, it's more so of a repetitive kind of thing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly because -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> More so then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We were talking about that obsessiveness -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I forgot [INAUDIBLE] or one of them drugs you had suggested.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But when [NAME OTHER], you know, you know how you see somebody smoke but you never watch them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [NAME OTHER] pointed out, he doesn't inhale.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He doesn't, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's actually interesting because with the Zoloft, there's a little bit less, I'm kind of wondering maybe that is lessening some of the obsessiveness.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She [INAUDIBLE], so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so if the -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's just the idea of doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I used to know how [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I think when you were younger; I think you probably did inhale.  But I don't know what happened -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I was 31, still 31, still 31.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're 31, what happened to your hair?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's paint.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's paint.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went [INAUDIBLE] rinsed it out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get it silvered?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm older than you too, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Forever 38, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm in my 20s?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're a couple years older.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still younger than me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still younger than me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I got you beat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I got you beat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I've seen some of the pictures when you were young.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So did you have dark hair or light hair?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Not lying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know what's on your mind [PATIENT NAME].  But you know [NAME OTHER] just said something really important which is if you're around other people who are smoking.  It makes you think about it and if you're not, like she, nobody smokes in her house.  That definitely makes a difference, that helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So, I think you got in mind to cutting back, that's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we're going to keep looking at that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

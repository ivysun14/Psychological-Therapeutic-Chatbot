<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I met with my advisor yesterday and I didn't have the work I promised her I would have done done, and she was very displeased and she said basically if I don't get my act together in time to get those papers submitted, she would be "very resentful", those were her words, and that she was feeling really screwed that I didn't do well enough in the fall to get our funding renewed. And that if I didn't get my act together in time to get this paper submitted on March 15th, then she would feel "resentful enough", again her words, that she wouldn't write me a letter of recommendation and wouldn't sign my thesis. [00:00:51]</p>

<p>So, I've been beating myself up for not getting my act together sooner and everything is terrible. And, I don't know, I just feel, I feel like I'm always going to be broken, I'm always going to be a fuck off, and I'm never going to be able to, you know, be responsible at work. And, never going to have a successful career because I keep fucking up repeatedly. And I guess there's, I don't know, I've also been having this thought a lot recently, but I'm not doing anything useful with my life, that I'm just marking time until I get old and die, and that everything is awfully pointless. And I know this sounds like (sigh), sounds like nihilist angst and part of me just wants to say, "Get over it already. This is nauseating to listen to." (sigh) [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you're going to put yourself up for having angst?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your thoughts are so blank? Or —</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they just keep circling around the same thoughts and there's nothing new over or beyond what I just said that she said. There's an endless loop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you get anywhere in terms of how it sounds?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. I think, I think what I just said was a pretty accurate representation . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT . . . of what's going on in my head.</p>

<p>(pause) [00:04:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so let me go over it. So, your advisor unloads all this stuff on you about her disappointment and frustration, feeling that you screwed her over. And she is and will become even more so resentful. You imagine yourself sort of continuing to do this kind of thing, and then you, then you think about how you're wasting your life. You're not really doing anything and are just marking time until you die.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then feel like that sounds, as I'm imputing to you, like you hear that as almost a cliché sort of angst.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you then get impatient, kind of frustrated with yourself never having, and feel like you should just sort of suck it up and get over it, suck it up and deal with it already. [00:06:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this sort of a loop keeps going around and around and around and around and around and around and around in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I've tried to break out of it. I've tried to talk myself out of it. In fact, yesterday, after my conversation with my advisor, I talked to her at 2:30 and by 3:30, I was just, couldn't cope with being at school anymore and drove home. And on the drive home, I was crying and, yeah, I tried talking to myself, you know, saying, "Your assault here, you're very smart and you're having trouble with your thesis because of all of these problems. The thesis sucks and you've got all of the structure from your parents that's poisoning you and, you know, that doesn't change the fact that you're smart and, if you just stop beating yourself up (yelling), you could get things done and it's well within your capabilities!" And that just didn't help much at all. [00:08:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So, I suspect that all of this is, unless you're dealing with similar dynamics which are these, I think you kind of externalize your sort of beating up of yourself, or self-flagellation. Like you arrange situations, so that the people who have authority over you are going to, you know, beat on and criticize you. Because that way, I mean for a bunch of reasons I think, I think it's basically what you grew up with with your dad. But I think how you, I think it's also, all of this sounds strange, I think, an effort to cope in that when it is somebody else whose beating up on you, there I think is a little bit more of a chance that you may be able to have some feeling for yourself, some sympathy. Whereas when it's all just in your own head, first of all you're alone, and second of all, I think it is much, much harder to have any sympathy for yourself. You just feel the weight of the criticism. Whereas, in that is coming from somebody else, as awful as that feels, and I think it feels awful, at least you can be kind of, in part, coming from a different angle, like trying to reassure yourself or having sympathy. [00:10:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. I don't feel like I have too much sympathy for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, in the car, you were crying. Carrying (ph) on, like I assume that says you were sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, maybe more despairing than sad, but that's what I'm hearing (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Well, tell me. [00:11:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was more, I don't know, I didn't have much — I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>Did I mention that my parents were planning to come for a total of like 36 hours for my graduation? They've changed their mind. They're not coming at all, which on one hand is what I wanted in the first place, because I don't like graduation ceremonies and I don't feel like I've earned it because I am dropping out by taking the Master's instead of staying for the Ph.D., and I hate my thesis and I don't really feel like I've done enough work. And so I didn't want them to come in the first place, but they're not coming! Not because they actually respect my desires and wishes, right? Which would have been, if they just said from the first time I said, "I don't want to do this graduation ceremony," if they had just dropped it, it would have been fine. [00:12:29]</p>

<p>But, instead, they kept pushing, "You have to go. We're so proud of you. We want to see you graduate. It's so important to us, the ceremony. We like to feel a parent's pride." Blah, blah, blah, and then they change their mind because, as I mentioned, my sister's graduation is the day before mine. She's got two days of graduation events!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Five ceremonies she wants us to go to and blah, blah, this, that and the other. And my parents decided that they had to take her out for dinner after all of the ceremonies and luncheons, and tea with her sorority, and this, that and the other. They had to take her out to a special dinner after all of that because it doesn't count as a celebratory dinner before she gets her MBA Even, though, effectively, she will have earned the degree the minute final exams end. Right? Like the . . . [00:13:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. It's ridiculous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it doesn't count until the ceremony is over and then there "just won't be time to get there," because they have to take her to dinner and they don't want her feelings to be hurt if they cut dinner short or skip dinner to come to my graduation. And, besides, I wasn't even getting a doctorate, so they'll come to my graduation when I get I get a Ph.D. Even though I've told them a gazillion times, I'm not planning on getting a Ph.D. In fact, I didn't even tell them when I started this program, that I it was a Ph.D. program. I told them from Day 1 that it was a terminal Master's program, because I didn't want that pressure, should anything go wrong, which, you know, as it turns out, I did quit, drop out. I don't know. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>It's just (sighs). And, of course, Dave tells me that I am being ridiculously upset because I didn't want them to come in the first place. But that's really not the point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not upset because they're not coming per se, you're upset because they made you feel pretty worthless, I think. They told you that, sort of, regardless of the fact that they're coming, taking your sister out to dinner after spending two days with her and going to five different ceremonies, mattered more than coming to your graduation at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that they told you something that I'm sure sounded to you like you were worthless without getting a Ph.D.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (crying) And, rationally, I know that a MBA is a professional degree. Just like a professional academic degree. My sister didn't have to do a research project or a thesis, (crying), so in every respect that matters, we're getting the same kind of degree, but, they considered hers better than mine. [00:15:50]</p>

<p>And I can't help but feel that they lied when they said that they were so proud of me and they wanted to come to the graduation because they were proud of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure! When they follow up by saying, "Well, you know, we need to take your sister out to another dinner and, you know, we don't really care anyway, because yours is just a Master's Degree." Like, how much pride does that convey? (laughter)</p>

<p>I, of course, don't know where they're actually coming from, but I can certainly understand why you feel that way. [00:16:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was 16 or 17, bratty teenager stage of development, I remember this huge blow out fight with my parents and I can't even remember what it was, but at the peak of the shouting, I ran into the living room and just grabbed an empty grocery bag and started throwing all of my medals and trophies from the mantelpiece in the bag, and told my parents that I won those in spite of them, not because of them, and they didn't deserve to get to show them off. And they completely lost it. My mom came over and shoved me against the wall and took the bag out of my hands, and started putting the trophies on the mantelpiece while my dad was, went on and on about how he raised me and he earned those trophies because I was something. I don't even remember all the details, but, you know, even then some instinct said that the worst way to hurt my parents would be to take away their right to brag about me. [00:17:53] (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that's what really mattered to them the most?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They still have those goddamn trophies from when I was in fifth grade displayed in their house. My brother was a sophomore at Harvard, and I took one-credit class on machining and engine design, and at the start of the class, we each had to design an engine and build it, and machine the parts ourselves and build it and everything. And I designed this absolutely beautiful, beautiful brass engine and, you know, carved out decorations and whirls, and it didn't win the contest, it wasn't the fastest in the class because I put too many bells and whistles, and, you know, aesthetic decoration on it and slowed down its performance, but I am so proud of that stupid engine! And I brought it home to my parents and gave it to them, and asked them to display it with all the medals and trophies, and they put it in the back of their closet where it just sat there collecting dust. [00:19:41]</p>

<p>So, it's really frustrating that they don't care about what I'm proud of and they don't care about what's important to me. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate it when I lose control and start crying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No worries. And what you're talking about is (inaudible at [00:20:37]).</p>

<p>If that makes sense. Which is how I think, I really felt like that [it was really about you] (ph) that mattered a whole lot to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) I hate being seen crying. I hate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just, it's humiliating. It's like being seen picking your nose and eating your boogers. It's disgusting, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder, like, in some area, like oversimplified, dramatic sort of way — Let me put it another way. I think there is a way in what you feel so gross about you has more to do with feeling like you're being open about what you really like. I mean, there's some aspect of feeling kind of close to somebody else, in this case, me, from talking about this stuff has actually felt to you, how painful, how you're going to be for yourself. And that makes you feel really gross. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>Then, I want to say, for instance, to be beating yourself up, than to be more open and more synthetic with some really very terrible ways that you are treated. And the fact that there were warnings that (inaudible at [00:24:00]) . . .</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I guess what I'm saying is, I think what you're feeling to be gross may be a kind of openness and intimacy about what you're feeling, and which could at least be [referring] (ph) while crying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think you're right.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand that it feels like sort of gross and disgusting to you, but it's all right. [00:28:13]</p>

<p>Tell me what you've been thinking on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My parents hated it when I cried when I was little. It was, they were just all these ways in which they tried to make it impossible for my sisters or I to cry, and, I mean, and my sisters, I have never seen them cry, except when they are in the throes of a complete, hysterical breakdown. And it was a combination of, "don't cry, because we're strong and, you know, if you cry in front of other people, they'll know what your weaknesses are and stab you in the back." And, "You want to cry? I'll give you a real reason to cry!" [00:29:35]</p>

<p>And I realize now that it's all really, really fucked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know, it was a point of pride for me for so long, that I don't cry. And it still feels really terrible to, to be seen crying more than — I don't know. I guess, even when I was a teenager, leaving at home with my parents, I would cry alone in my room, but, you know, hide under a pillow so that no one would know that I was crying. And it's more the "being seen" to it, than actually crying, what's upsetting to me. I don't know. I'm certainly far more emotionally healthy now than I was at Harvard and the first few years after, but, there's still that programming that, you know, whenever I expressed any kind of emotion, other than anger, there's a part of me that ways, "What are you doing? This is dangerous! Stop it!" [00:31:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so your parents, and you never wanted to see them and, I guess, in a lot of ways, including this one, like, I don't know, they've just been, kind of wanting you to be their little soldier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, if little soldiers don't cry, then [you don't cry.} (ph). [00:31:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>(pause) [00:32:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had a person that, they were vilifying a sort of vulnerability between people. That, I don't know, I was just trying to [really construe him in a light] (ph), but I would guess that he probably felt, all the time. [00:32:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, God knows my dad had a terrible childhood. He grew up in a refugee camp and he's said things that make me believe he was probably a child sex worker, so possibly for him, it actually was, like, physically dangerous to show vulnerability. But he's also Board Certified Sociologist, for God's sake, and he's a school principal! You'd think at some point, he would have learned that for children, growing up in, you know, not a war zone, there are things you don't know because it will permanently scar them and, like, he was 40 when I was born! He had been in this country, living a reasonably comfortable, middle-class lifestyle, for over a decade! You'd think he'd have just a smidgen of awareness of how to treat children properly! [00:34:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah! I mean, I imagine, well, he felt a sort of vulnerability, especially in a very physical way, that a kid, that he sort of does this aid (ph) too, I mean, like, I'm not at all trying to excuse how it was with you! It was horrible a lot of the time, pretty much all of the time I've heard about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know, you feel like, so insulted that somebody else has gotten, whatever, two more vacation days than you, that you have to quit your job! [00:35:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, that's pretty vulnerable. Do you know what I mean? Like that is such a huge insult that you have to change your job and relocate or something. And you must feel tremendously exposed walking around all the time! You know, income, white coat, family, you know, not real [family] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT" Yep. [00:35:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could imagine that, you know, seeing your 4-year old cry, I don't know, might be way too much or something. Again, I'm not at all trying to excuse how it was . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you act like a monster.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just like [pointing to stressors] (ph) is sort of like trying to put the vulnerability that feels so gross to you and to [inaudible] that backed his car, violence to him, and how he kind of hinted to the town, he had some of that down, in a way. It's not the same thing, you know, yelling at 4-year olds or whatever, but just in terms of how it feels to you. [00:37:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so much easier to get angry at my parents and to be hurt by them. Does that make sense? I was talking to one of my friends yesterday about my parents' decision not to come and pretty much summed it up with, you know, fuck them, fuck all of them. And, of course, my friend agreed with me because, you know, that's what friends do when, you know, your friend is ranting and angry, pissed off at their parents. [00:38:41]</p>

<p>I don't know, it's so much easier for me to express anger than hurt. But so much so that sometimes I feel that I am nothing but a feeling ball of anger. Just unthinking, insentient, just pure rage sitting inside of me. I don't know what to do. Let's be kind, I don't even know what I'm so angry at most of the time. Sorry. (crying) [00:39:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess some of it is fitting in angry, so you don't have to feel so hurt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. It seems a little bit too facile, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that was the same for your dad as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, reacting angrily to being hurt really. [00:40:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad is always angry. I don't think I've ever known him not to be angry at someone or something, for some reason. I know my mom's said my grandfather was also always angry at someone or something. There was never a time when he wasn't raging about something or another. My father and my grandfather got into a fist fight once. We were moving from, where were we? We moving, and we were driving, my grandparents came to help us drive. And we'd stopped in a rest area somewhere, and they got into a fist fight in the middle of the rest area over whether American cars were better than Japanese cars or not. It was just so, I just — [00:41:30]</p>

<p>You know, I tried to imagine being so angry that I would strike one of my in-laws or Dave being so angry that he would strike my parents over a car, and it's just so, it's so nutty! I can't even, even being angry all the time about stupid things, I still can't imagine being angry and I would hit someone over a difference of opinion. [00:42:12]</p>

<p>I do get angry all the time over stupid things. A couple of weeks ago, I was trying to find a pen in my office and the supply cabinet was out of pens and there were only pencils. And I got mad enough that I had picked up a box of pencils and flung it across the room. I was just in a fit of rage over a pen! It just, in hindsight, it feels so stupid, but I guess I'm just telling you this that, you know, I can — [00:42:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, be like, it's not looking true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Completely irrational.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pissed off for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I totally lost track of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: its fine. We'll talk more tomorrow. [00:42:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Oh, and there's a piece of paper under the door too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Thanks. Take care. [00:43:19]</p>

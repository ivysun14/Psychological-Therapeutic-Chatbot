<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Session 3 [inaudible]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I haven't been here. What do you want [inaudible at 0:00:20.5]... Oh, let's see. So that might give me but actually I would've thought, I mean if I had been here, to turn it off because I always watch that. Well, let's see, how is, [well he's still feeling excited] (ph) but how was Wednesday sometime?

</p><p>PATIENT: See I'm having to guess. I'm working 7:00 to midnight these days [inaudible at 0:01:09.9]... I'm usually taking [inaudible]... and get up by 1:00 and come up here but that's not a big deal...I really don't have [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, like on Wednesday were you poor or frustrating, something like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, maybe. You never, I mean, that literally mean?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I thought you didn't want to come here? That would be fine if [overlapping voices at 0:01:39.9]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'd be, I mean, after I sleep but I think I've... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd rather come here?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't like Wednesday sessions.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:01:46.7]... So I wonder what time?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, 11:00 would be good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That would be fine.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, wait, wait, I've been singing with this music. Can I make it 11:30, because I get a little trouble getting out, because I work [inaudible at 0:02:07.7]... boys who live in the city?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because we have a good time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: All right, 11:30 Friday?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: All right. I mean it's been, my job is like been, one night and I [inaudible at 0:02:29.2]... with you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean tired, bored with it?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not bored with it but a constant roar and I just realized all of this noise. I do it standing on my feet for eight hours straight and they give you a ten minute break in the first half, then a ten minute break in the second half and then a 15 minute break in the middle.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Boy.

</p><p>PATIENT: What they don't tell you is that it takes five minutes to wipe off the windows in the back seat of the cafeteria where it's quiet. There's no quiet place in this place except the cafeteria and to get to the cafeteria takes five minutes, so by the time you get there [that wasn't left to do. Can you see me?] (ph) [0:03:13.9]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: All right [inaudible]... I think the other time I go it's [inaudible]... If I would have walked into a supervisor at something and he was sort of yelling at me for it. So like I knew... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you were right on the verge of quitting?

</p><p>PATIENT: I hated it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:03:49.3]... The work itself isn't [inaudible]... it's standing in one place and ignoring it for a [inaudible]... time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The conditioner (ph) of it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean the noise is the biggest [inaudible at 0:04:06.8]... with this. Like it was like on the railroad, working in the pouring rain and he might have just said, "Are you coming in?" And just started to go around the corner. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that what, makes a joke to you or?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's like there's something kind of overpowering me last night and you can't shut it off or else you don't have a job. You're really kind of tied to it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something (ph) overpowering you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean it makes me wonder, who is controlling the environment around here, the machine (ph) when it rains? [inaudible at 0:04:52.3]... without the machine.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you feel really controlled very much by it, out of control?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, I mean, it's like abiding (ph), where you, I hate it but it's necessary for survival.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Almost like it's an enemy but you have to put up with it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Like a parasite that has no end to it. I can usually think of a whole bunch of neat stuff that kind of makes an event (ph). If you think of it as [inaudible at 0:05:31.3]... kind of let it come [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's like unplanned today?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I've been doing a lot of thinking but I can't remember any of this weekend though. I always, when I haven't anything else to do I always think, [just some weird things I mean.] (ph) [0:05:55.5] And I, I don't know, I had the courage to go and read through Carl Rogers (ph) again, without reading it as a, like running to it for a source of pleasure, I didn't read it like that and it feels very relaxed reading it. So I read a couple of chapters and then [take a bath,] (ph) and then I really felt good. And then I started reading some more and then it felt like I was pushing myself...like I didn't want to read it anymore. I had read enough. So I decided to call him up [inaudible at 0:06:42.7]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So, it sounds like you felt good about reading it in a new way?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And also about being able to stop it and shut it off when you were ready?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then you're, it was really obvious when the time came to quit...because I came to the end of this chapter I read and it was really, I don't know what you call it. I felt like I had learned something from reading it or that what was in there agreed with what, something was kind of clicked inside me. And then I started reading the next chapter and it was completely the opposite, I mean, it was kind [inaudible at 0:07:35.4]... I wasn't ready for it, so I got a headache.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A headache from pushing yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: From the strain. I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's a strain? Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And that's from pushing, because I wasn't really pushing but I, it was like a woman (ph) and as soon as I closed the book the headache it went away.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it was a strain to push farther into it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I had felt that feeling before but I didn't really know what it was, so I kept reading harder instead of closing it. [silence from 0:08:16.9 to 0:09:03.0] And now I don't see any sense in making up because I'm, can usually come up with something to what I'm not thinking about. I answer it sometimes but it, it's like I can't face myself to put the solution into effect.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean [inaudible at 0:09:29.0]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess to put a solution into effect that would be honest about what actually exists.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's the hard part, to really look at, to talk when it's really [inaudible at 0:09:42.1]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't really say it's hard. If it was hard that would mean I was trying to do it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I can see that, that's what's happening though. It doesn't really bug me as in why.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In some way you don't want to look at it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not my looking at it, it's the only way I can do it. [silence from 0:10:09.4 to 0:10:23.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But there's a big part of you that doesn't want to do anything about... [silence from 0:10:29.3 to 0:10:41.5]

</p><p>PATIENT: I keep thinking about that being honest with myself and how I, sometimes I can see how obvious the contradictions are in what I say and what I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see. And that seems like dishonesty?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it's not dishonesty though, it's like something I can't change.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I can see it but I can't change it. Like I mean, since I got out of that psychiatric hospital, my image of myself after this whole thing is over has been living out in the hills in Wyoming or New Mexico [inaudible at 0:11:54.5]... and possibly even living alone, like a hermit. And at first it was, I wanted to live like in a commune with a whole bunch of people, like I do every day now, and after a while I kind of just forgot about that and kind of draft (ph) away. And now all I can picture myself is sitting up in a log cabin at the top of a hill, looking out at the countryside. And then I imagine what I would be thinking up there and it's the same thing I think now...like, what is the purpose of all this?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The purpose of living you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. What, I mean, exactly what am I doing here, that I want to do here?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Nothing. There would be nothing to do. It's kind of hard for me to face the fact that, that wouldn't be an answer to all my problems.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah. You'd like to think that, that's going to solve... 

</p><p>PATIENT: That would be the kind of ideal solution. [I couldn't say that other than I feel.] (ph) [0:13:29.3] [silence from 0:13:30.7 to 0:13:52.2] Then today I kind of imagined (ph) myself going back to school. This was when I was busy hating my job. Like the only thing I could think about was, I got to get out of here. And the only way I would be able to get out would be if I would go back to school. I mean, I'm even [willing to think back how well I did in school.] (ph) [0:14:14.6] I don't know [inaudible]... which I hated and all the hate of the job that put me in school in the first place and [me drawing in the night,] (ph) has no purpose in being in school.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like being in school is just to get away?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And not really what you want?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I felt pretty good last night before I went to work. I was thinking of going up town, just drive around. And there was nothing in the refrigerator to eat, so I was going to go get a hamburger, which I did. And on the way out my mom says, "You're going up town this time of night?" It was [ten of eight] (ph), and I said, "It kind of looks like it doesn't it?" And I just thought, and it felt so good just to be out of that house.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it's freezing (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not to have anyone question what you're doing. I mean I really know you're going to do it and you get the question if you're intelligent by making it sound ridiculous, what you're doing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: So I was driving around, having kind of a ball because it was dark and I haven't driven around in the dark alone for a long time, other than coming back and forth for this. And I stopped and got a hamburger at the local hangout. And there's all kinds of people with their hot cars there and our town has some of the most conceited girls in the world... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...and it's really pitiful sometimes the way they act. So I'm sitting there watching a couple of them and just the way they act, so completely self centered, into their own group...like they'll have a group of two or three people or maybe four people, and anyone that's not in their group they don't even talk to them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you were what, just disgusted by that a bunch of college girls?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I was laughing at it really. At first I thought, there was this one girl I knew and I knew her pretty well, but she wouldn't even look at me now. Like, "Oh, you're a [inaudible at 0:17:07.9]... get away from me."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But then I thought..., "Man, this is ridiculous." And I really am glad I don't have their view of the world. And it made me see, like all that was behind me and I was kind of above it, and I liked that. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were out of that and beyond that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I didn't have to drive a hot car to feel good and I didn't have to have a girl hanging on me all the time or I didn't have to have my own little clique of friends, which I clung to kind of when I formed the status symbols that they had.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That you were at a different place, at a better place?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Even though I don't know where I'm at, I'm better off than they are. And I was standing there in line waiting for my hamburger, kind of laughing over it, and a black boy bumped into me, I guess he was about 16, and I turned around and said, "Hey man, you drunk?" No, I said, "Are you stoned? And he says, "No, and I almost got [inaudible at 0:18:29.1]... that night because some guys offered me some glue to sniff and I told them no." And so I was telling him about a few people that I know that are really into drugs and that it's doing nothing but turning their minds into just cheese (ph). And he said, "Yeah, yeah, I know." And so we're sitting there talking and laughing, a guy I had never seen before [inaudible at 0:18:53.3]... And it was so funny because the people that I knew were standing right behind him in line and yet they wouldn't look at me, and this guy who had no connection with me whatsoever and who probably had twice as hard of a time in life as I did, was sitting there laughing and joking with me and enjoying it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like kind of the weirdest feelings that... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like maybe it's not so bad after all that I don't give [a damn] (ph). And like maybe the world still has a few decent people. It's funny that it always seems to turn out like that. The people who I expect to be nice to me and the people who I don't expect to be nice to me always are. Not always but more than people I know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you, like are often surprised by people's unkindness or kindness?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm usually not surprised by their unkindness. I kind of expect it sometimes because it's like [inaudible at 0:20:13.7]... and I don't like it but I can't say that I expect it to be different. I mean, I do expect them to be different but I know that they're not going to be, even though I want them to be. And it's funny, the people who I have no connection with or else, I don't even consider the possibility that they would be nice to me as the ones that I knew the most. Like this driver that's working with, on the job now. Nobody, the only reason I got the job was because I had no seniority at all and it's the only thing he had in the company is seniority, and I had none at all and yet I got the good, steady job rather than just extra jobs. And everybody says, "Oh, don't work with Daniels (ph)...he's a bastard." And I said, "Oh, what the heck, I need the money." And I worked with the guy who turns out to be a real cool head. He's an idiot really but I could see that the way he's an idiot doesn't really hurt anybody else. He'll screw the company out of anything he can get but he won't really hurt anybody else. I thought that was kind of funny because [inaudible at 0:21:45.5]... I guess just... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like somebody who everyone else told you to stay away from, it should turn out so well between you and him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I shouldn't say it was really well but see I was expecting this mean, crabby old man and that's what I got was a mean, crabby old man. Except behind that I could kind of see that it wasn't really, he wasn't really mean and crabby that was just his way of doing things, and he was really a pretty nice guy. And he would sit there and tell me about how he was going to...beat me or cut my hair, and I would sit there and laugh at him and tell him what the sentences were for those things [inaudible at 0:22:48.6]... (chuckling) But I'd sit and say absolutely nothing and let it pass by. And I guess I was one of the few people that, I didn't let him bug me and he knew that. And he knew there was no way that he could bug me because like sometimes he'd sit there swearing at me and I would laugh in his face...laugh and smile, just sit there and grin, and he didn't know what to do. And nobody else could do that around him and so nobody else could get along with him. So finally he stopped doing that to me because he knew that it wouldn't get him anywhere.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you felt pleased that you could do that with him? That you could [overlapping voices at 0:23:32.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, I had a ball in there. [silence from 0:23:34.1 to 0:24:25.9] My girlfriend and I have a dream quite deeply involved with turning each other on and it's really getting to be fun.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Turning each other on?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, sexually I mean. It's fun. And she gets pretty scared sometimes. And then she, she's a very steady church, well she was a very steady churchgoer before she moved (ph) in with me, and she feels like she, at first she felt like she was corrupting me...because she had heard from other people how shy and reserved I was and how I was such a good boy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And then after a while she started being afraid because of all the ways that people would preach. And when you have a guilty conscious, everything is aimed right at you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's the way she takes what they would say. And it, sometimes I don't even want to get anywhere near her because I know that she'll feel rotten if I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you want to stay away from her sometimes... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...so as not to encourage all that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, just so she won't feel that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's very hard to just kind of let go and enjoy ourselves and not worry about whether she's going to be in trouble or whether she can trust that I can get where I'm going.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're saying it's hard for her? Is there something hard for you in that, too?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because it [inaudible at 0:26:56.4]... Sometimes she gets me so turned on that I really know how to do it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's kind of an unspoken rule that when we're that turned on we can say anything to each other and then won't hold each other to it. Like pleading insanity.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No holds are barred but... 

</p><p>PATIENT: You can say anything but as long as you don't do anything on it. And it's like how you're just, you just be taken like that, I don't want it to be like that. I want her to believe in us because I, I don't know why but I always would never say anything to a girl I didn't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like say anything that time, when she's not taking what you say for real but you're really saying things that you really need and you want her to understand that you really do mean them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that it's not just because I'm turned on. [silence from 0:28:26.9 to 0:28:43.2] Well, that's why I kind of feel that I have a very good time. [I don't know where that came from.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's about time she knew how good that felt, right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know what we're going to talk about but it seems honestly, that our dates are almost centered around sex. And I don't know, I don't think I'm really, I do mind a little bit but it's not because... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean not in your mind? Yeah, go ahead.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not because I think that, that's the way it shouldn't be. It's because I want sex to be kind of secondary. So I'm, I would be, if I was satisfied with it now I would be kind of selling myself half short...like second short or no, second best is what I mean.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That you don't want that to be the center of your relationship with her?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I was thinking how neat it would be if I could just sit there and talk to her and keep talking until I felt so good that I didn't really want anything to do with sex as long as I felt that way. Not really an escape from it but like infinitely better for me. And I know what it feels like, so I know I will get this far. And if I find that [inaudible at 0:30:24.9]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That you'd like to have that feeling between you and her?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was reading that Carl Rogers (ph) last night and I kind of tentatively decided not, a way to try to see that. You said something about, after a person states something the other person should restate it exactly to the first person's satisfaction like to answer it and then discuss things that way, and I just wonder if it would work.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you haven't tried that, you're thinking of it?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm thinking of doing it tonight.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I get the feeling that the kind of thing you're looking for between the two of you is somehow a feeling of really getting communication with her and really accepting each other?

</p><p>PATIENT: And feeling so good myself that there's no way possible that she could misunderstand the way I feel. And it would be like overwhelming, just a smile or a touch of something would communicate everything because it would be, it wouldn't be a neat goal, it's if we could get the words that we can't say out of the way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you could say them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or get beyond them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Then you have to find out what they are first. (chuckling) [silence from 0:32:30.9 to 0:32:41.7] I'm going to think of something new. I'm tired of the rehashing of everything that I think during the week. If I can, that really can do that by myself and I have a few friends that I can talk to. I want this to be something more than... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want to do something to try to keeping whole, we can't just do it all the time during the week?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. [silence from 0:33:11.4 to 0:33:59.5] I remember the last time I saw that, on a [inaudible]... my life's okay. I really don't know how or why but just thinking about that interview makes me so glad that I'd gone to it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something about what happened that last time turned you off or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: And it seems so senseless to sit there and ask questions back and forth, just kind of ref. because I can do that with any number of people. Well, actually I'd say that three or four I guess. And I know that I can be accepted in the same way he did, so that was nothing knew to me and he was amazed that I could talk so openly and freely about how I was seen, now that I was past the stage that he was ready for.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It was really nothing to you [inaudible at 0:35:22.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was useless. [inaudible at 0:35:30.0]... I experienced a real horror [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A real what?

</p><p>PATIENT: Horror. I was absolutely appalled that... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: At what he was saying to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I was going over to a neighbor's house next door and I would say I'm eating a doughnut, munching on the way over. And I was going to go over and try to get her to buy me some limes, like now she likes a certain kind of lime [inaudible at 0:36:15.4]... which I very seldom get for her. So I was feeling pretty good and I came over there and I got about halfway over there and she's standing by her house, screaming at these kids to come over there. And there's this old man living there and Sharon's (ph) shaking her head. And I guess what happened was, some kids had rung this old lady's doorbell so she had come up from the basement to answer the door and her husband had seen the kids running away from the door and so he knew who they were and so he told her, and she came over and told my neighbor. And the neighbor got all mad and she's sitting there yelling at two of her own kids and one of the people across the street's kids, and she screamed at him about, oh, maybe she sent him home. And he was so scared at first he forgot his bicycle and went home and he came back after his bicycle and he went home again, then he came back again after his jacket. And so she's sitting there, after he left she was standing there screaming at her own kids and this old lady's sitting there telling them that they're bad children, that they should have their ears boxed. And then my neighbor started hitting this one, her youngest, not her youngest her second youngest, a boy who was about six years old, and this kid, he was really very shy and he's terrified of adults because they seem so alien to him I guess. And I don't think he really feels very sure of himself at all. And he still wets his bed, which makes for a miserable life when you're a kid.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you were appalled that this poor little kid was being... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and she's hitting him for actually no reason and it's obvious she's in a rage probably. And then she hit her other son, her older son once or twice, and then I don't know what happened then. And I just sat there after, she went in, she didn't even see me she was so mad. And I though..., "How messed up is the world where a kid gets completely beat up, terrified for ringing a doorbell?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How does it push him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, to me it was. [silence from 0:39:12.1 to 0:39:23.2] And I still wanted to go over and ask her for the ripple (ph) but I thought that the only thing I would do would be to go over and start screaming at her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you were so angry with her?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it made me mad. [silence from 0:39:35.8 to 0:39:47.5] She had just divorced her husband for being meaner than she is, screaming and yelling at her and occasionally hitting her, and then she turns around and does the exact same thing to her children.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And the funny part about it is that her children just can't say, "I want to sign a paper and get out of this relationship." Her children are desperate.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're caught, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I thought, "Well if she doesn't see that, she's not going to see it if I say anything." [She has all this...] (ph) [0:40:22.0]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But then it really hurt you to see that happened to him?

</p><p>PATIENT: They're such abuse, they're beautiful kids though. [silence from 0:40:28.5 to 0:41:01.1] Remembering how it was to be hit when I was a kid.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel? [inaudible]...

</p><p>PATIENT: Remembering how it was to be hit when I was a kid.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It was really bad you remember?

</p><p>PATIENT: It is and I could just see that kid, he's 20 feet away from me, and the kid is obviously terrified. And his mother is in such a rage that she can't even half see it. She grabs his arm and she misses, then she has to grab again. And then she grabbed his arm and starts to beat on his head.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: With no feeling at all for the kid?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and the kid has no where to run.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean that's how it was for you too when you were a kid?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You had no where to go?

</p><p>PATIENT: Like being indicted for a crime. I thought about that too...how that, this old lady is standing there and saying what bad children they are, and then assuming that her neighbor is obviously agreeing with her by hitting them. And I just thought if she keeps saying that then they're going to start believing it, and if that happens they might as well give up.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if they get told enough times how rotten they are, they just give up, playing the roles they know.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not that they'll give up, it's that they'll just change so that they're, they'll try harder actually but they'll try harder to be rotten.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that the kind of thing that you feel sometimes about yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometimes with my parents I do. I used to a lot...it was very obvious because they wouldn't let me pick my own friends or anything when I was younger. And as soon as I started driving I got a job that I could stay away from home all the time. And then I started gouging (ph) instead of doing anything but what I wanted to do. Even if it obviously contradicted their, just to do it to contradict them. Just to kind of say, "Well, you have no say in what I do now." I think to rub it in.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To make them see that you could do just what you wanted to do and that now they couldn't do those kind of things to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I remember when I was 18 my dad and I were arguing about me going downtown when I worked in town. It was a whole big, black [inaudible at 0:44:04.5]... and I would have had to walk. And we were sitting there arguing about whether or not I should go downtown and I used to say that I was through arguing with him. He obviously wasn't going to let me drive, even though I had enough money and I had a license and the whole bit, I was an experienced driver for six months, but he wasn't going to let me go at all. And so I started walking out the door and he grabbed me and he started to slap me. He started to, he didn't get that far, and I hit him in the stomach. And I drew back to hit him again and he decided that he didn't want to slap me anymore. That's the last time my father tried to hit me. Sometimes I've almost hoped that he would try and hit me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because now the retaliation would be so much more swift than... (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean you'd hit him back now?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it wouldn't be a hit, it would be more of a death blow.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's almost like you'd like a chance to get back at him, you just don't have one?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I had just one little reason.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've really got it in for him but the way he acts keeps you from being able to do anything about that?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know about having it in for him specifically but it would be a good outlet and I wouldn't feel guilty about doing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd feel justified?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because now I've learned a lot about fighting that I never really knew but I know it, and if I ever get in a fight the other guy is done for, I mean.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it's almost like you'd like to get in a fight of that kind?

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometimes I do like to and I always wish it would happen because it would be such a shock to him to end up in the hospital. And at other times I'm almost appalled that how could I even think that?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you'd like to shock him and sometimes you're shocked at yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, like walking in here today, there was three guys walking on the sidewalk and then I was walking across their path. And from about two blocks away I could see them and it just worked out that we were walking at the same, at the rates where we would intersect...and I thought, "Now what if one of those guys shove me or something, what would I do?" And I'd probably kill them and I don't want to. [0:47:07.7]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it's really on your mind it seems like... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...getting into a fight with somebody? But it frightens you at the same time that you might really do that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it would, because I know afterwards it would seem even more senseless than it already seems to be now. Beginning to feel like I have, I would really hurt him for doing absolutely nothing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel senseless but there's another part that just feels kind of like you couldn't stop it or like you are in some way drawn to that, wanting to do it?

</p><p>PATIENT: I just feel like I have to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you have to? [silence from 0:48:09.6 to 0:48:20.4]

</p><p>PATIENT: And I'd rather, when I meet, I feel so threatened by people. And I know that, that comes out kind of, I don't know. It seems kind of fake just to act real threatened by people I don't really notice in myself but if they [overlapping voices at 0:48:46.2]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it's really real? Yeah, yeah. Like people scare you? [silence from 0:48:51.7 to 0:49:05.4] And pretty strongly scare you I think.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm scared of the, that I'd fight. Like I really have to think ahead.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Scared of what?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I know last night I didn't feel that way. Because I'm walking right through this, it's like a closed [inaudible at 0:49:43.2]... If you don't wear a leather jacket or drive a hot car or have muscles bulging out all over, you can't go into the zone, like a caste system almost. And here I was walking right through the middle of it with none of those.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you weren't scared then?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I wasn't scared at all. I felt like I had all that kind of wrapped around a little finger and I can flip it away because it was [inaudible at 0:50:18.5]... and it wasn't even worth looking at, let alone being scared about.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You just forgot (ph) about, you weren't there at all?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. On the drive down here today, I don't know, it almost seemed like this guy was just driving in such a way that it very subtly bugged me, and I know he wasn't but I didn't seem to know that. He had cut this other guy off at a stoplight just to get into the lane first and then when he got out on the expressway he only did 45. And he placed himself so that there were two cars [inaudible at 0:51:07.3]... couple of feet and I was behind him. And he slowed down just as he was coming next to the car and then [inaudible at 0:51:15.5]... And I'm doing 60 behind him and all the sudden he's doing 45 and there's no place for me to go, except to the side. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it felt like he was doing it to you on purpose?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then he would fall back and then I would go next to him to pass him and then he would move back up again, instead of, and then we did that, we jockeyed back and forth like that three or four times, until finally I just got mad enough to, I thought, "If he does that once more I'm going to total off his car into that guardrail. I'm going to just shove him over it."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But then I got around him and then after that I thought...why was I so mad at this guy?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But when you're in a situation like that and you feel like those people have got it in for you, then you really get furious back?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would have felt good totaling on his car.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd really like to do him in, wipe them out?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but they won't listen to me. How much more time left? How much more time do I have?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Five minutes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Your clock isn't [inaudible at 0:52:38.8]... longer? Your other clock over there is digital [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I know who I grow (ph) from.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Last week my girl felt, like she said something to me like, she'd been working all day and her parents were on vacation and they hadn't called for four days, and her sister was working so that she was alone at the time. And the place she works is really bad. I don't know why she doesn't quit. But every morning it seems like a hate contest. It's like she's sitting at home thinking about all the hate in the world, and then I call her up and cancel the date. And I'm talking to her, and I see now how really [inaudible at 0:53:46.3]... just when she needed to talk to me [overlapping voices]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and felt guilty about letting her down just when she needed you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't feel guilty about it but I know how she felt.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel for her, how that was for her?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It feels like all the hate that I'd sent was absorbed and there's no place for it to go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is absorbed?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It kind of becomes part of me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Becomes part of you? Gets absorbed into you and gets stuck inside of you, there's no where else for it to go from there?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then some little insignificant thing will trigger it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's just all, it's like you're all full of that, all soaked in all through you?

</p><p>PATIENT: And I hate it. [silence from 0:54:54.4 to 0:55:07.8]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It must be really frightening and also very infuriating just to have that all inside of you?

</p><p>PATIENT: [It makes me want to give up.] (ph) [0:55:16.7] Because I see so much of what, I'm horrified if someone else does it but do they see that I'm the same way?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And some how horrified by that much of it in yourself too?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it's kind of in contrary. I'm horrified when I see it but when I do it I feel good about it, until when I realize that, how obvious it is, that I am doing what I expect someone else not to do. And it seems like I'm adding to the hate that's already in me. It's like I need it. Kind of like in a daze (ph) or is it something that kind of destroys itself?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that's what you're doing to yourself, killing yourself you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and all it takes is a little bit added in, like a spiral, all you have to do is add a few [inaudible at 0:56:47.2]... and her needs that, and it keeps getting tighter and tighter.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it feeling that way, tight, now?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. [I just can't trust.] (ph) [0:57:06.9]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you can't?

</p><p>PATIENT: [I haven't.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No? [silence from 0:57:14.7 to 0:57:43.2]

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't stand to be [inaudible]... it's like the person. [silence from 0:57:46.0 to 0:58:10.9] I heard [inaudible]... that this isn't the stone age and that if man is going to survive, somebody could be, going to be because it's getting along (ph) without having to be, I mean, only the animals that are going to survive are going to be the ones who are civilized. And it seems like he says, necessary for survival of the human race. And it seems to me to be so far away because it's necessary to [inaudible at 0:59:05.1]... I want someone, for somebody to just love me. And then sometimes I really do, I envy his methods (ph). [inaudible at 0:59:19.1]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want it so much and you're so afraid of it when he does start that, that you push it away?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's how I felt when I robbed [inaudible at 0:59:45.8]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What?

</p><p>PATIENT: This is how I felt after I [robbed that store.] (ph) Like all my hate had gone in like an emotional flood, but then it felt really good and I just don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't know any answers to that?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. It doesn't feel [inaudible at 1:00:19.1]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It still feels there?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe I don't feel it even at the time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And maybe you're still holding it back, feeling uncomfortable?

</p><p>PATIENT: [Like maybe it's come inside now.] (ph) [1:00:40.2]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, really. (chuckling)

</p><p>PATIENT: You're not supposed to go over the time limit and you're a very poor therapist.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What did you say?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm saying you must be a very poor therapist to go over the time limit.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If I what?

</p><p>PATIENT: Go over the time limit.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel that's, is that sort of, is that the way you look at it?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, that was, it seemed to me while I was reading [inaudible at 1:01:09.8]... was a very important point to be flexible of [inaudible]... by still trying to [inaudible]... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I wondered if you did that right at the end, if you wondered what I was going to do about the time limit?

</p><p>PATIENT: [I've been too at attention with it.] (ph) [1:01:32.0]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I usually call it a time limit but I figure once in a while, when I want to go a little over, I go over, but we do have to stop now.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I want [inaudible at 1:01:50.0]... go over, so I did. [1:01:53.4]

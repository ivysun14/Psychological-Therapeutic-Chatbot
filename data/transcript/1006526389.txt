<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What’s cooking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like there’s always something right up to the hour. And then you get five minutes in between to do your notes. But if you want to go to the bathroom or you want to get a drink of water or… then the next one, and you’re like, “Shit, they showed up.” But it’s funny how like it’s fast paced, and even though I have that reaction of like, “Shit, they showed up,” once I’m sitting with them it’s fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was running late today because Bill, the boss, came into my office like five minutes before I was gonna leave to consult about someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Catch your breath.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then the traffic. Then I wasted three quarters because I forgot it was President’s Day. Whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s right, no hidden, no fees.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just three quarters. And that reminded me of money, which reminded me of my dad, who called me and gave me his Social Security number. I think I’ve mentioned this to you, he wanted me to put him down as a dependent on my tax forms, and that’s illegal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, your dad… I know Billy had wanted you to…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, this is my biological dad who is in Chile and who wanted to help me financially however he could, so he was like, “Take down my Social Security number, you’re gonna put me down as a dependent on your taxes so you get more money back.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just humored him and I wrote it down. And I did my taxes on my own, I used like an online service…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … and I was really proud of myself. Like this is the first time I do it on my own and everything. Getting slightly more than last year, but we’re moving up, so that’s that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re moving up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then like just… even though I wasn’t planning to do that, like I said, “Oh, what would happen if I clicked, you know, dependent?” And they asked me all these questions about like… you know, because they have criteria, like the person has to have lived with you for a certain amount of time, or the person, you have to give them 50% of your income. And I’m thinking to myself, if I get audited I have no way of proving… you know, I’m gonna end up in prison or something. I’m like, no, we’re not gonna do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’d have to pay it back. [0:02:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I thought about how he’s gonna call me and yell at me. And he kind of did, last night he called, and he was like all confused. And I couldn’t explain it in Spanish, but I was trying to explain like, “That’s illegal, if I get audited that’s a big problem, I can’t just do that.” And he couldn’t understand like why I couldn’t just do that. He thought like I was choosing for him not to help me or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. He might not have really understood that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … it was a legal matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And just my dad’s so funny, he calls and… He had called me a few days prior just to do his quick, “Hello. How are you? Everything good? Okay, bye.” And then he had asked, “Can I call you on Sunday night, will you have some time on Sunday night to talk?” I was like, “Sure.” So I thought he had to tell me bad news or something. But it was the same old kind of just blah silence, him telling me he doesn’t have a job yet, but he might sell some property, and if that goes well I might send you a couple hundred bucks. And I might move back to Jamaica for about a month to get some work there. Some lady needs some help with her house. Like he doesn’t really give me details, he’s just really vague.</p>

<p>And then he mentions, “I saw your sister’s Facebook. I don’t like these guys she’s hanging out with on the beach, these like muscular guys, she’s standing next them in pictures. Or this guy in a suit.” And I’m like, “Yeah, dad, they’re not her boyfriends, but I mean, she has friends, she goes out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this is… appears on like a Facebook or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s my little sister has a Facebook. This is the one I share with my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And your dad’s on as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has a Face… I don’t know if he even knows how to use it. He doesn’t even have a profile picture, it’s just… it’s funny. And she’s blocked him. But somehow he’s like seeing…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow he sees the pictures. [0:04:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she posts pictures… she has a new guy every different week and a half, and they’re never relationships. But, you know, she’s like meeting guys and she takes pictures. And he’s all like suspicious, and he’s like, “You need to knock some sense into her and really like tell her to do something with her life.” And I’m like, “Yeah, but, you know, she’s in Jamaica, she’s far away. Like she’s just having fun, and it’s not like she’s getting married or she’s pregnant. Like those guys aren’t her boyfriends.” “Yeah, but aren’t you the psychologist? Shouldn’t you knock some sense into her?” I’m like, “Yeah dad, I try. I try to give her good advice when she’s on the phone with me.”</p>

<p>And then I kinda switched gears, and I said, “Well, you know, me on the other hand though, I am dating someone. Do you want to hear about that? He’s a psychologist too, and he’s 35, and we have a lot in common.” Silence. Just complete silence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the only thing he said was… he said it in Spanish, but he said like, “Within crazy people they understand one another.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. What does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In Spanish that’s a direct translation, but I’m thinking, like you have a lot of things to talk about because you both study crazy people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it sounded like we’re crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s what I’m… yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a direct translation. That’s all he said, and then he switched topics. It’s just so interesting how like my role, or my sexuality, my gender, like it’s never in his realm, you know. Like he doesn’t ask me about it. I mean, I’m older now, it’s not like I’m a 20-year-old girl, you know. And he’s just no curiosity, he doesn’t want to know details, what’s his name, nothing. Are you happy? You know, I would appreciate a dad that would tell me something like, you know, “I hope you find a good man one day that treats you well, treats you with respect and takes care of you.” I’ve never heard him say anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm. Yeah. [0:06:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I’m just thinking like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, takes kind of a… well, hands off approach is one way to put it. But it’s more than that, it’s almost like he’s frozen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then… in this moment I just got reminded of Brian. You know, that silence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That silence, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I’m just thinking like, what a… what a messed up kind of… I guess nobody has a normal upbringing. Some people are lucky enough that like both parents are stable, somewhat happily married, that they both talk about healthy relationships and say, you know, “We hope that you end up with someone like this.” And they show it by example, you know, like as a couple they get along. I just had such messed up examples, like a father who just denied that I even had that part to me. Don’t talk about guys, don’t talk about yourself as a woman. And then my mom and Billy were just weirdoes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like no wonder it’s confusing for me. So I’m still with James, and it’s both exciting and scary, because it keeps on getting better and better. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What… yeah, what’s been happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had a very weird experience. This was on Wednesday night, so this was after I saw you last. On Wednesday… Friday was my payday, by the way, don’t let me forget this before I leave. Friday was my payday. And so Wednesday there was a storm coming, I was very tight on money, I had like 20 bucks, remember? So I said to myself, “Okay, James is coming over tonight, I just need some like eggs and milk and gas for my car.” But I had 20 bucks. So I was like thinking to myself, it’d be really useful if for example Billy put 20 bucks in my account. So I call him up, and I explain there’s a storm coming, I only have 20 bucks, can you just help me out and give me 20 bucks more? And he just makes it so complicated. He was like, “Well, what do you need to get? You need to go to the supermarket? Well, why don’t you do this, when you’re at the supermarket get the manager on the phone and have him talk to me and I’ll give him my credit card number.” And I’m like, “Billy, you’re in Alabama. Supermarkets don’t do that, they’re not going to do that for me.” And he’s just… like there’s a sense of entitlement, like special treatment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. [0:09:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt like saying, “You know what, forget it. I’ll go without gas, or without eggs. Like just forget it.” But I said, “Yeah, Billy, okay. I’ll call you from the supermarket, thank you. And I didn’t plan to call him from the supermarket. And he texted me later, “I put 20 bucks in your account.” But I just got in such a bad mood. There was something… Like I was rushing, because I had my group on Wednesday nights, and I was supposed to meet James, because he was going to spend the night, and there was a storm coming. And I was rushing, and I think in the back of mind I’m always thinking, “Oh my God, he’s going to be mad at me because I’m late.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also that thing about Billy just stirred up crap, and then it reminded me about how poor I was. And James texted me, “I’m waiting at the bar across the street from your house, I’m sitting here having a drink watching sports, take your time.” And again I’m thinking to myself like, “Shit! He’s probably going to expect me to go and join him and have a beer. Or maybe he’ll even want to eat there.” And I’m thinking to myself, “I don’t have any money.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:10:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So all this stuff got stirred up and I was just in the worst mood by the time I got to my house and parked. And I walk into the bar… and this didn’t surprise me at all, because he’s such a friendly guy, but he’s sitting at the bar, and there’s a seat in between that he’s saving for me, and there’s a woman, and they’re talking. And something about that also just added to my fury. It’s not like it was a huge jealousy thing, because he’s just that kind… he’ll talk to anybody. But something about that I think added to it. And I came in, I put my coat down, I’m like, “Oh, just give me a minute, I have to run to the restroom.” And went in the restroom, collected myself. Because I was like when I came in here, like panting. And finally I sat down next to him, and he said, you know, “Very nice to meet you,” and totally paid attention to me. But I could tell by my body language I was acting a little aggressive, because as soon as I sit down I’m like this, with my back completely to the woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [unclear]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he had ordered me drink already, he’s like, “You sound stressed, is everything okay?” And I just felt like not like myself. I felt like I was going to break down and start sobbing. Like just one of those moments. Like I knew that if I was home alone I probably would have been in a bad mood, everything’s fine. But the fact that I had this caring tender person there, like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know when like someone asks you like, “Are you okay,” and then “Nnnnn!”, that’s when it comes out, you start crying. That’s how I felt. And I was basically a mess. Like I was just not acting myself, I was a little on edge. And I felt something brewing in me like that used to brew when I was with Kevin, that something else had pissed me off but I felt like taking it out on him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there was something in me that I so wanted to like get off with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn’t.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What… yeah, tell me, what did you… [0:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know, like… I could have made a big deal out of like… even something simple like him talking to a woman or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it didn’t even bother me. And like I’m able to now step away and say like, “This isn’t about him, you’re upset right now. He’s just trying to be nice, he doesn’t know what’s going through your mind. Just breathe.” Before with Kevin and stuff I wasn’t able to do that, I would just lash out and start… just act like a bitch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh! Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So even though I was acting a little bit off…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would… I was thinking that. In some way though that is like some mainline… mainline expressway to telling them… bringing them into how you’re really feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or how I really am. Like what I’m capable of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you’re capable of. Huh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it’s funny, because that was the theme of the night. Because I’ll tell you the rest of the story. But I think that was the theme of the night. Like… and we had also discussed this in therapy, and it was coming up for me in my mind, that he’s going to ultimately discover all the messy parts of me and not like it. So here we are… I wanted to see him, it was the middle of the week. Like, you know, here’s my dream come true, a guy that wants to see me more than once every two weeks. But during the week I’m busy, and it’s fast paced, and my hair’s a mess. And, you know, when I’m getting to know someone, presenting, like my hair is straight, my makeup is fresh. And, you know, he’s just seeing me like all frazzled. And on top of that I’m in a bad mood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [unclear]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like starting to see like the real me. And I chugged my drink. Which was a mistake, because then I got teary eyed. And he was so good. Like he just… he knew right away something was going on, and he kind of like took me and put me on his shoulder and whispered to me, like, “I just want you to know, like whatever is going on I want to hear about it whenever you want to talk about it. And I’m gonna have moments that I’m gonna be crying because I just got off the phone with my mom or something and I’m gonna need you to do the same thing for me. Whatever’s going on right now it’s okay, I’m here with you.” Like grounding me and… And that made me want to cry even more. [0:14:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he was inviting you to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, he was totally fine with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then we sat down at the table. Thank God it was 40¢ chicken wing night, so I had like a really cheap dinner. And after that one drink I was just like a little more calm. And we got to talking, and we didn’t really talk about anything that was bothering me and we had a normal night. But then things got weird again once we went back to my place. And I don’t know what was going on, but during sex I started crying. Now, all this was going on, but also I think the fact that Valentine’s Day was coming up, Brian was in the back of my mind. And just… like I had been thinking the night before about, “Wow, this is really sad, this is my second Valentine’s Day with Brian and again not seeing him. I know he’s going to be working because I’ve already asked. This great new guy is taking me out.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what did… remind me again, when did you and Brian begin seeing each other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: October last year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Twelve, 2012.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I started crying, and right away he stopped and he asked me what was going on. And I said… I said, “I don’t know how to do this.” And he was like, “Do what?” And I was like, “Like just blend all the like crazy fun sex with this nurturing person, like this caring relationship. I don’t know how to do that, and I’m trying to figure out how to do that.” And he just held me, and like I don’t even remember what he said to me, but whatever he said to me it helped me feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. [0:16:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like he said something like, “That’s okay, we can figure it out together.” Like, “You can talk to me about that, you can tell me what you need from me.” I’m having a really hard time orgasming at all with him, and I think it’s emotional. I think it’s because I’m having a hard time blending the two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he is such a… he’s not vanilla though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s not. Like he’s got an edge to him, and he’s got a funny sense of humor, dirty sense of humor. He can go to those places with me. So that happened, that was over, I felt better. I ended up telling him what was bothering me that night. So he knows, like it’s out in the open. Something else happened that was really big, that was very just a lot of feeling. So in the middle of this we’re just like embracing each other, and I’m crying. And he said something like, “Are you afraid that you’re falling in love with me? And are you afraid that I’m falling in love with you?” And I just started crying so much more. Because I really feeling like I am, like I’m in the process of falling for this guy. Like it was just incredible that he got it, you know, and it was just a really powerful moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And speaking… and really speaking to like something happening between you two that’s opening up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he doesn’t quite know everything that’s going on in my head, but like he’s so open to learning about it and hearing about it. And then on Friday he had planned reservations. And I knew that Brian had been working because he was texting me sometimes at night. And Friday Brian texted me in the morning, like 7:00 a.m., he was driving home from work and he said like, “Happy Valentine’s Day, I love you, I hope you have a good day.” And I thought that was really sweet. “Thank you, I hope you have a good day too.” And then he didn’t text me again until I got home, and I was rushing when I got home to take a shower and go to Bunker Hill, because the restaurant was by Bunker Hill. And so Brian texted me, “Hi, how was your day?” I said, “Busy, how was your day?” He said, “I’ve been sleeping all day, and I’m about to sleep again, round two, because I have work to do.” And I’m just reaffirming to myself, like this is why this doesn’t work. Like here he is sleeping all day because he needs to because he needs to work hard later. Like how selfish of me would it be to like, “Well no, you need to come see me, and you need to take me out for Valentine’s.” You know, like… [0:19:00]</p>

<p>So whatever. After that I said to him, “I have to jump in the shower now.” And he wrote, “Uh huh.” But I know all these little like micro communication things, and so I knew that meant like attitude, like, “Oh, Uh huh.” And so I wrote back, “?” [says “question mark”] And he didn’t write me anything back. So I was busy, I got ready, got dressed up, drove. I had a wonderful night. Brian didn’t text the rest of the night. I wouldn’t have answered anyways because I’m really trying to—at least when I’m with James—to separate. Because I can feel that my feelings of Brian are getting in the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like in bed that night they were totally… I was thinking of Brian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That Wednesday night. Or Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wednesday, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was… like I was missing him in a way. I was missing the sex we used to have. Because, I mean, it’s not like the sex with James is bad, it’s just different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I got to his house, he had like flowers waiting, and I made him a card and I wrote something in there. And I got a bottle of something, and the chocolates he likes. It was so sweet, because my mom had teased me about like, “Please make sure you get a picture.” And I was like, okay, I think we’re at the point that I don’t feel silly like asking, “Hey, can we take a picture.” And so we’re about to leave to the restaurant and I go to grab my camera, and that’s when I hear him say, “Hey, before we go can we take a picture?” So I was like, oh my God, this is so great. Like it’s everything I’ve ever wanted. And so we posed for pictures. And I don’t realize it, but he’s sending the pictures to his dad and I’m sending the pictures to my mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs] [0:20:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we’re sitting at the restaurant and he gets a text and he’s like, “Oh, ‘pretty psychologist,’ it says.” And I was like, “Who’s that?” and he’s like, “Oh, that’s my dad.” And then we both started cracking up, because I’m like, “Oh my God, I sent my pictures to my mom too.” And it was a very nice restaurant, with like a fireplace, and like American food but like fancy. You know, so they had like buffalo chicken mac and cheese, but like the best tasting ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [laughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we got like… I got a fancy chocolate martini that I’ve never had before, like we really indulged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was great con… it’s just easy between us. It’s fun conversation, it’s easy. He was saying things… So we sat by a fireplace, and he said something like, “Oh, I want to have a fireplace at my house one day. And I want to lie in front of the fireplace on a rug.” I’m like, “Oh, on a bearskin rug like naked?” And he starts laughing, he’s like, “No, no, no, just like a big rug with the dogs.” Because we both talked about how he wants like a yellow lab and I want a basset hound and… So like there’s these like playing around, like fantasy, you know, about what a family would look like. And I totally picture him doing that. And I’m like, “Wow, that sounds great, I’d like that.” [0:22:00]</p>

<p>And then we go home, and later when we’re getting intimate things go well. I didn’t have a single orgasm, which very much disappointed me, but I keep on saying like, “This is emotional, this is because I’m not letting myself completely go with it yet.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since I had had a few drinks I decided to test the boundaries a little bit, and I started trying to incorporate things that I would normally ask for or do with Brian, or with someone like Brian, with him. And he complied. Like I was surprised that he… And it felt natural, like it didn’t… He sees it…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was it? How was it to do that with him? [pause] Bring that out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I… It’s like I had to teach him first, and then he took the reins, and then he was in charge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that felt good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because remember, like, it seems what turns me on is when he’s in charge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the end we were hugging and he said like, “Wow, I’m actually really surprised I like that. Like I’ve never tried that before and I really like it.” I was like, “Oh, good.” Like he likes what I like, that’ll be good. That night I had a very interesting dream. So that night I dreamt that I was in a room, and I was either like a man or a woman, but I must have been a man because in the room was my wife, my small daughter, and like my adolescent son. And we were saying goodbye, we were placed in that room because I had a few hours until I had to die. Have you ever seen that movie “Hellraiser”?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that the one with the pinhead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know a little bit about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they’re like demons, and they come and they torture people and send them to hell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had like five hours until I get sent to this room with these demons that are basically going to torture me and then kill me. [0:24:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you’re… say again, where does the dream start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like in a room, and it looks like a teenager’s room or something. Like it’s got a bed, it’s got a TV up there with like the cable going. Almost like a waiting room, like a generic looking family room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in there… on the bed is like my wife, and a daughter that’s like four, and a son that’s like 12 or 13.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your wife?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that was the weird part. But I didn’t feel like a man. Like I don’t know…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … I couldn’t see myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we were just hugging, and holding each other, and telling each other how much we loved each other, and laughing, because we knew that this would be our last moments together. And then after that, like I looked at the countdown, there was a clock up there and it was time for me to go, so I left. And I felt ready to die I remember. And I got put in this dark like padded room, and I got tied up like this. And all of a sudden I look to my left and my son is there, he snuck into the room somehow. And I’m like, “What are you doing here?” And he’s like, “I really just wanted to be with you. It’s okay, I just wanted to be with you in here.” And I was freaking out because I was like, “Oh my God, he’s going to see all this torture.” I’m like, “As soon as it happens just start closing your eyes.” He’s like, “No, I’ll be fine.” And then it started, and these things came out of the walls that were like ripping pieces of my cheeks off. Like very violently, like some scary movie. And then I just remember after that I could feel like my body shutting down. And then I just died. And then the dream ended.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had died in the dream.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I died in the dream, yeah. So the next morning I told my dream to James and he interpreted it for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s like, “Oh, it’s just interesting how you… you know, we were talking about a lot of family stuff yesterday, and then yesterday after the sex I told you that I actually like some of the stuff. And I know you’ve been grappling with trying to combine this whole like family nurturance part of you with the sexual part that you see as like violent in a way.” Because like I told him some things like that I like the whole dominance thing, and I think at first he initially thought… Now it’s coming back to me. Wednesday night, when I had the crying incident, I said something to him like… like that I like it rough, or that I like to be… to be dominated, or something like that. And he was saying to me, “I can’t do that to you.” Because I think he thought that I was asking him to hit me or something, or insult me. I think I was asking him to insult me. And I felt a lot of shame in that moment because I was like admitting to him that things like that turn me on. So he said, “And you know how you were telling me that the other day.” It’s like the Sunday in the room…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … like the innocence in the room…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … exposing you, that you being tied up…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … hurt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like trying to negotiate, like how do these two things fit together in the same room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was neat. And we had a good next day. And I purposely went home early Saturday to kind of exert my independence, like I was like, “No, don’t want to spend too much time with anyone, I still want my freedom.” And I was planning to go out with my friends Saturday night, which I did, even though there was a little snowstorm. But I realized that night after going out that I would have rather him be with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. [0:28:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he also acknowledged that, like he said, “I’m very social, I like going out to people’s houses, going out to bars, meeting your friends, you meeting my friends. But I just would prefer to like go to those places, have fun, mingle, even on our own, but then go home together.” And I was like, “That’s what I want.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we kind of decided like we would try that this weekend coming up, you know. So we’re just so on the same page. And then to throw a wrench in everything, after the Valentine’s Day text with Brian that I said I need to shower now, and he said, uh huh, and he never responded, the next morning I looked at my phone and I notice at like 1:54 in the morning he had written me, “Gonna be away for a while, not gonna be able to talk.” And that’s it. So after I left James’ house…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is all… this is like the 1:54 a.m.…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Valentine’s night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … of Valentine’s night, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I wrote him back, “Can you be a little more specific, as in you’re going to be gone today, for a week, for a month? Like what’s going on? Okay, I won’t bother you, hope everything’s okay.” And then like the next day or something I texted again, “I really hope everything’s okay. Just confused.” And I said something again like, “I don’t understand why you keep just cutting me off like this when I’ve told you repeatedly how much it hurts me.” Then he finally… last night I’m sleeping, 3:54 in the morning—because I had left my ringer on—I get a text from Brian. — 3:54 in the morning! Like, what the fuck? And he writes… he writes that, “I told you that I had to go away for a while, you told me that when I’m feeling this way I need to tell you.” And then it registers, like, “Oh, that’s what he’s doing.” I don’t know if you remember, but I had told him before, next time you feel like you’re overly emotional and you need a break from me, tell me like, “Look, I can’t talk, but I promise we’ll talk about this soon. Just leave me alone for a little bit.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. [0:30:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he was just so vague about it…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it was differently worded, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: … that I was just like, “What?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. He might not have known what you meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I finally got like a good phone. Billy got it for me for 80 bucks. It’s like a six hundred-something dollar phone. Don’t ask how he did it. But you know Billy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m sure you don’t want to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He just called until he got a manager on the phone that agreed to a new device.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it, is it a…</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s a new Samsung Galaxy 4.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, [inaudible].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very good, I don’t know how to use it. But I want to read you kind of like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so 3:54 in the morning, and I’m thinking to myself, “Maybe he’s at work. So that’s why he’s texting me in the middle of the night.” [pause] Okay. Well, “Why are you doing this now at 3 in the morning?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what did he write at… what did he write?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he… it doesn’t show, it doesn’t like go more up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think before that was pretty much what I just said, like, “You told me when I need some time to myself to tell you I’m going away, so I’m going away.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, he said that, that was the opening…</p>

<p>CLIENT: At 3:54 in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I wrote back something like, “Oh, now I get it, you were kind of unclear. Okay, I’m sorry. Now I understand.” I wish it would go up [the phone display]. But he said something like… Or I asked him something, “Do you know how long it’s going to be? Can you at least tell me that?” And he said, “It might be forever. Because I’ve realized that we don’t have the same investment in this relationship.” And I wrote back something like… and this is 4 o’clock in the morning. So I’m like, “Brian, first of all, I’m not a business transaction, so try to add some feeling words. And second of all, it’s 3 a.m., like why are you doing this right now?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [0:32:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he wrote back, “I feel that you’re not investing in this relationship like I am.” And he said, “And it’s not 3 a.m. here where I am, so… And I’m not going to be back for a while.” And I asked, “Where are you?” and he won’t answer. And then he just starts kind of like blabbing about things that don’t make any sense, like it’s almost like it’s all unspoken. Like he said, “We talked. You kept going. We talked again, and you went out and fucked on Valentine’s Day.” I said, this isn’t about fucking, I went out to dinner.” And said, “And didn’t answer me till noon the next day.” I said, “You didn’t write me back after I said I had to shower.” He said, “You don’t shower at 6 p.m., you had a date and you knew it.” Then we got into this whole, like I said to him, “Do you just want me to sit at home and wait for you to be done with school then, is that gonna prove that I love you?” And he said, “Too late for that.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, “All I’ve wanted is to share a life with you, which requires you to actually see me and actually do things with me out in the world. Are you asking me to wait for that?” He says, “I did ask, I told you multiple times. You cheated on me twice last year, and again this year.” And I said, “It’s like I’m getting very little now, and you promised to give me it all in another few semesters.” Because I’m gathering, even though he hasn’t ever spoken these words, I’m gathering this is his plan. Because just from little things he said that I’ve gathered, and then I’ve repeated it back to him and he hasn’t said no. So I’m guessing, okay, your plan is to leave your wife and to be with me and have a family with me once you finish with school. Which wouldn’t be until like next spring. But keep in mind, he’s never explicitly used these words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, right, right. Yeah. [0:34:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he writes back, “You’re unwilling or unable to wait.” I said, “You’re asking a lot from me and not giving much in return. Meaning I don’t see you, you don’t go out with me.” He says, “I’m not asking anything. I know what I need to know. Your mind is made up, you’re not waiting, you’re pursuing another relationship.” I said, “I can’t believe you’re doing this over text at 3 in the morning.” He said, “I felt so guilty—” SO, written in big letters—”I wasn’t there for you on Valentine’s. You were so lovey dovey in the morning, and you had a date and you knew it.” I said, “I needed to hear that on Valentine’s Day but you keep it all inside. I need to hear so much and you keep it all in.”</p>

<p>Again, like I didn’t have a clue that he felt guilty on Valentine’s Day for not being with me, because he doesn’t share that with me. Like it doesn’t register in his brain when I tell him—and I’ve been telling him this since we started together—like, okay, he’s married, I get that. He can’t do those things for me now, I get that. All I would need is for him to say, “I so want to be with you today, and I feel so bad that I can’t. And I promise… let’s make it up, let’s do something. Let’s be together on Tuesday,” or whatever. But I need to hear that, and I need him to follow through with the behavior. And he’s not understanding that like because he’s not giving that I can’t just wait around. [0:36:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, so what was it bringing up for you to… what were these e-mails… I mean these text messages kinda…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just frustration and more… more validation that you’re making the right choice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like keep on falling for James because he’s a healthy human being.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like even if Brian wasn’t married there’s just so much work to be done. With the communication and the feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. So there’s kind of like why am I just hearing of this now, this doesn’t make any sense, that kind of… Yeah. Yeah. Huh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what’s even more confusing about him is today at work… So basically I had to cut communication last night, and I said… Oh, I’m just reading this from last night. Oh, “You accepted my marriage.” I thought he was asking me to marry him. “You promised to be faithful.” And I said, “Brian, I need to sleep right now. Please don’t see this as me not caring, but I just need to go right now. Please, let’s talk more later.” So then what’s really confusing is that this morning—or this afternoon—I get just random dirty text of him trying to initiate like phone sex or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And him telling me how he’s going to hurt me so badly next time he sees me, and if I’m free tomorrow night. And I was like, “Well, can we talk tomorrow night? Because I’d like to just figure out what’s going on with us.” And he’s like, “Yeah, after I punish you.” You know. And I get sucked into that. I want to see him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don’t understand why that is, like that…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what does it feel… what do you feel? What do you… [0:38:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get sucked back into that dynamic we have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exciting? Or…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is? Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I get sucked back into like, oh, I’m his little girl, and it’s gonna feel really good, and we’re gonna feel really connected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ahhhh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we’re gonna be able to get out all those feelings, even during the sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get all these feelings, yeah. Huh. What all the feel… what feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like everything that I want to tell him, like about how I feel caught. I feel like I’ve been waiting for you a long time, and then this wonderful person comes into my life that offers me all the things I’ve been waiting for. And you’re not even using your words or your behaviors to show me like that I should keep waiting for you. You kind of you’re so vague and…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don’t know, I feel like I’m gonna miss my opportunity. Because I’ve been waiting a while. And what if you never give me what I want. What if he chickens out and he never leaves his wife?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think this is, I mean, in some way coming on because of you and James. I mean, you know, that he’s really reacting to knowing there’s another man in the picture, and you have feelings, you’re going out to Valentine’s Day, you’re with him that night, late night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he knows.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My friend Carly, who I always tell you I admire, like just her clinical skills. So she’s… I finally told her that he’s married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a big moment for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah, yeah. I’m sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I noticed a little change in her, like she’s more protective of me and basically saying like, “Oh, I wish you could just tell Brian like, ‘Look, if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. Give me a call when you’re single.’” And she never used to say comments like that. Like she’s fed up. But she still tries to be as supportive as possible. And she kind of understood this whole thing that I just explained to you as… she said, “Brian senses that something is different. Like you’ve never put someone else before him. Like, ‘I gotta go shower now.’”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:40:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You cut off communication and get ready for a date.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see. That’s right, that’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: “And his… Why did he cut off communication at 1:54 in the morning? It’s to take back power. Like even… Or trying to take back power.” So I think that’s what he’s doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.… Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But why… I keep… It’s so hard like not to get sucked into it. Like I forgive him so easily. I was so pissed last night at 3, 4 in the morning. I was… an hour, I lost an hour of sleep in the middle of the night because I was like, “[gasp] This is my only chance, he’s finally talking to me. He was silent for 48 hours, now he’s finally talking to me, let me grab it.” And I was so angry, and like, wow, how immature. Like this wouldn’t work anyways, even if this guy was single. How unhealthy is this? Good thing I have James. And then here he is talking dirty to me? [snaps fingers] I don’t want to see him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, again, it’s… there’s the power, the feelings and the sex and the… that are all kind of like… the sex is infused with so much need and feeling of, you know, that there’s gonna be some real, real… uh… disclosing of feeling, and sharing, and something very essential to you. That’s, you know, very, very eroticized.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it’s something I can’t feel with James yet. [pause]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I mean, like I went out Saturday night and my friends were asking me, “Oo, so tell us about this new guy.” I couldn’t wipe the smile off my face. And my friends are all single, it was two guys and a girl. And it’s funny, because we all got together, and then after everyone spots someone they want to talk to they split. So the guys split, and Patrice and I split, and I was like her wingman. And so I had to… like she had a guy in mind, and he was with a friend, so I knew I would have to talk to the friend. Five minutes into the conversation I tell him—like I weave it into the conversation even, like I didn’t even expect I’d do that—but I was just like, “Yeah, because I’m just getting to someone. Like it’s soon, but I think it’s going well.” And, “How about you, are you dating anyone?” You know. And then five minutes into talking to this guy too he ends up telling me that he’s in rehab and he’s gotten into a lot of legal problems and that’s why he keeps drinking water and not alcohol. [0:42:45]</p>

<p>And then this other guy, he looks older but he’s 25 years old, and he’s telling us he wants to sleep with as many women as possible during med school because he doesn’t have time for a relationship. And I’m just thinking to myself like, it’s so hard to meet a good match. And I found a great one. And wow, how lucky am I. And I started missing him. But I was having fun with my friends. And just like thinking about how much fun it’ll be when they get to meet him and I get to bring him with me. You know. But if it’s going so well why can’t I just cut this thing off with Brian?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I don’t think it’s a one or the other kinda thing to you. And I don’t know that they… like it contradicts anything, your attachment to Brian contradicts at all. In fact, to tell you the truth, like from… you know, just from the outside, I think you are talking about Brian in a different manner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, that’s my sense, is that, I don’t know, just the way… you know, revealed through the texts, the Valentine’s Day texts, and like, “Hey, I need to get off the phone.” Even if it’s like a pretty intense conversation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:44:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s going on. But that doesn’t mean… there’s still something very alive in all that with Brian. And it’s interesting, it’s kind of bookended this… so our talk today is bookended by your father’s call, and like a lot of promises and not really feeling like it’s delivering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, this has a hell of a lot of meaning to you, and feeling for you. And I think one thing too is yeah, one element is that ongoing kind of desire to have a man that will fulfill… that will take care of that, that will kind of… take care of you. I mean, it’s such a powerful experience I think. For men and for women, but it’s certainly… you know, this is something central to women, that they find a man that really takes care of them. Like a father. Like a father did or didn’t, but whatever, like some presence like that. Safety, security. And then there’s the element of the erotic for it to you, and something that the dream is getting at, this dream is getting at, of torture, and, you know, a little boy there. I guess what came to mind to me was that sense of how it suggest maybe something about Brian.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I thought about how you characterize often so much the two sides of Brian.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, like he’s a little boy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One is the torture, and the other hand is the little boy. That there’s something not only going on in terms of you… Oh, go ahead, what? [0:46:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The text messages. The 3:54 in the morning guy, that’s the little boy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s a little boy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The guy that talks to me dirty and then pulls me in, that’s the man. That’s daddy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he shows up a little later and wants to seduce you. And some way in which he can express that and convey that taking care of, through sex, through power.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So when I get my tax return I will try to pay a lot more of my debt to you off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great. Yeah, thanks for letting me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you have a better pen?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no, it’s working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I do, I do have a good pen if you need it. Oh, and I have a… just an invoice for the deductible so you’ll have it for your records.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got something too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, are you going to give it to me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Here you go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like hearing that I’m speaking about Brian differently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I was… and that was in the back of mind. It is, it’s different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can’t hear myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that’s evident.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is evident, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s good to hear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you know, it makes perfect sense given what James has meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. [0:48:00]</p>

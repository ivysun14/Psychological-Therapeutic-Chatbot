<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 19.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Quite a bit has happened since we were here last. Not a lot too important, but I thought I'd mention it and it might sound like it's not pertinent at all. I'll get there eventually. I went to England to handle a swimmer. A swim, a 28-mile swim, and he was doing quite well, you know, I was in the boat training, and (inaudible) be. And it was the same thing I had done last year exactly. Except it's just so much work to get into shape for something like that. I mean, just the fact that he could swim that swim meant that he had worked months and months.</p>

<p>So, it's a big investment. Well, he was doing quite well, 50 yards in second place, with, you know, a mile to go. And he's a 14-year-old boy, the youngest one swimming, of course, most of these are men. And I was really happy, not so much that...you know, I get 10 percent of his winnings, not so much that I'd get 10 percent of a couple thousand dollars. I wanted him to do well, because, you know, I was handling. Well, he really went downhill fast, and I pulled him out the (inaudible) with a half a mile to go. So, it was a very excruciating experience for me to have driven a human being that far, and I looked at the sport in an entirely different light, because I had been driven close to that far on occasion.</p>

<p>And he was hospitalized, of course, and when I had gone on other swims and I heard that people were hospitalized, I thought, well, so, they're hurting just a little bit more than I am. I didn't have much pity for them. But when you see it and you're not as frivolous, (inaudible). Well, despite this new light on the subject, and to see that it just isn't worth all the effort and that it's just...it's almost like you're performing a trained circus animal for the public. Nevertheless, I have strong desire from being there to go back into it. Mainly, I...and I try to figure out why. Just, you know, it doesn't make any rational sense. Because all I could see were bad aspects of it. There must be something, and then I realize it's quite clear that there are 20,000 people there shouting for you, and you just need the recognition, or at least I do. And that I find kind of disturbing and all. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That that would be the reason?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I can see down and the very, very, well, the outstanding characteristics that I see are things that just disgust me about the sport. And yet, for some reason, I have this compelling urge to get back into the sport, and it's not, it's not the obvious why I wanted to, but after investigation then I could see what it is. So, it just shows that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want to check then, is that...the reason I'm checking is because I know you've...that's been an answer before, why you want to do this? Is that really why you want to do it? I mean, I just want to check that you didn't come to that answer quickly, because that's how you often look at this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm pretty sure, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, there's small little things, like when I was with him in the parade, and they have a big parade and they go to the city.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And of course, the trainer sits in the car, but he sits down in the car, and the swimmer is up on the back, and a couple times I was mistaken for a swimmer, and it hurt a little, because I'd have to say no. And I'd have to do it in my broken French, tell the other guy. And also when they'd come around for autographs, I'd have to be careful not to have mine taken, and that kind of gnawed at me. So, certainly, yeah, that's what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just couldn't tell from the way you said it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't think there's much question that that's what it is. And then I come to a prior conclusion, or another conclusion, well, maybe that isn't so bad, because you hear about it all the time, performers talking about, you know, what the audience can do for you. And this is clearly the only chance I'll ever have in my life to have a great number of people recognize me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the only opportunity for an audience.</p>

<p>[0:04:19.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, so I might as well do it. Well, at any rate, it just...just reinforce...you brought up the point that maybe I had this notion about why I behave the way I do and then I have something happen to me, and (inaudible) where I fit it in. Or on the other hand, where I look at it as this is being just another very, very strong evidence that that is indeed the way I behave. You know, that seems, well, anyhow, so I've seen June a couple times since I've been back. I can't help, you know, I...I can't really feel bad about it, either, because she really enjoys seeing me. She really enjoys talking with me, and if we go out to eat or something, she just really has a great time, and it's very hard now for me to feel bad about exploitation, because, especially because she knows I'm leaving the country and there can be nothing serious. There's no question.</p>

<p>I've told her there can be nothing serious and longstanding, and now, there's logistically no possibility. So, it's very hard for me to be...to feel as though I'm exploiting her. And yet, way back in my mind, I am, I'm just seeing what my sexual behavior is like. It's one of the...well, that's one of the main reasons why I'm with that gal. And I find that it's quite easy to behave in a way that quote, I feel is normal, without any fantasies at all. With just a modicum of effort.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just trying a little bit, it's very simple.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, oh, quite comforting, too. Especially after the fact. And I don't...I think I feel good about that. I'm not sure. I think I feel good that I can solve what I considered myself, personally, to be a problem. It seems to me, one conclusion that I've come to, there should be, by definition, no sexual problems, because any way you feel should be a way to behave. As long as...if it involves another person, if you can find another consenting person, that wishes to behave that way, that's fine, as long as you don't impose your will, fine. Great, dandy. Yet, somehow, the way that I think I want to behave on occasion doesn't seem normal to me, and so that bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Well, it sounds like there are two kind of values going at the same time. Inside of you. One thing is anything people feel sexually is all right. The other one is but this isn't all right. This is a...this is a norm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, but I can...yeah, I can very easily, as I've proven to myself lately, behave all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And think all right. And I...I think I've found a conclusion that I might as well behave that way because it's a...well, I think sex should definitely be satisfied. So, if I'm satisfied with behaving that way, why shouldn't I?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. So, it's a question of it's pretty easy to do it this way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it takes a little effort, I guess you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does initially. I don't know if it will in the long run.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, say, eventually, I end up living with a chick and it never crosses my mind again. You know, big deal, then the effort would approach zero. I think that would be the case anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. So, what is bothering you about that kind of solution?</p>

<p>[0:08:27.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you see, it's in many senses, I'm sort of a cocktail party liberal. I'm great talking about things, and a liberal attitude towards sex is another example, but deep down inside of me there are times when I don't really like that particular solution. Mainly because of the fact of the way I was brought up, I think. There are some...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I meant why didn't you like the solution of, say, just being totally heterosexual?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I? Didn't I like that? Oh, then because there's a liberal part of me that's saying it's not sexually honest because there is another facet of my sexual life that could be explored and maybe to true satisfaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't we draw that out a little? If the liberal side said that, what would the conservative side say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it is an abnormal type of behavior and so...abnormal according to the norms of this particular culture, and therefore it should not be...those type of actions should not take place. So, it's...you see, if I were to go the completely liberal route, I feel that it would take me, number one, a long time to get to where I would be comfortable. Number two, I'm not sure that I would get there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm, there would be a long period of adjustment, however you're going to make it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and number three, I think, to be completely honest, anyone that I knew well should really know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that would be like nigh unto impossible to get people that are close to me, to explain to me how I feel about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be hard for them to understand it, and for you to say those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, both. And so the other solution is a much easier one and if I...if the end result is satisfaction and a good feeling, you know, what's the big problem? I mean, I'm certainly a...I can't see myself living in any thing but modern, Western society culture. I can't see myself living in a commune, for instance, where there would be complete sexual freedom. That would just be too much of a shock. Although, I can ideally say, "Great, that works." On paper, it's fine, and probably in principle, it's very good. And even if it were working, if it were working and would accept me, I would still say, "I should join it," but yet, still, I've been just going too long, my life has been too much patterned after other norms, so that that would be hard for me to do. So, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you feel yourself stuck in a mold with the way you've been brought up.</p>

<p>[0:11:36.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm, yeah, and I don't think that, well, this is a basic conclusion I think I've come to or am coming close to. Biologically, the reason sex is enjoyable because if it weren't the race would not propagate itself, I mean, the human race would not exist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because...yeah, because there has to be something that would make people do a ridiculous thing like that, god-awful way to conceive, well, no it's not god-awful, just (inaudible)...there's got to be something, so that's why it's programmed into our system. Okay, fine, so the desires are there, and why not enjoy them if they're there? Great. Tremendous. So, I think, personally, now that we've developed to the point where procreation need not really be a fear when you're having sex, almost the exclusive purpose of sex is to enjoy it. Except maybe once or twice in my life, when I might want to conceive, well, fine, well, that's a hell of a lot of other times, so let's call those a special case. All right, fine.</p>

<p>So, that leaves me with enjoyment as the ultimate goal. All right, fine, well, if that's the case, there are two types of enjoyment. One we should be thinking of is type of enjoyment that exists during the act, and any hang-ups that one might have that would bother one and gnaw at one. Well, I think even the most sexually active person can't spend more than a few percent of his life involved in sexual activity, and a busy person certainly much less than that. So, therefore, one of the more, I think the most important thing is to be comfortable with your sex life. So, that it wouldn't bother you. Lately it's been bothering me.</p>

<p>So, if I have found that I can be comfortable with what is considered by this culture, normal sex life, in that other, that one percent of the time that I'm engaged in sexual activity, I can be comfortable then. And in that way, I'm comfortable all the rest of the time with my sex life. Why not do it? Yeah, that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think what you're saying is you can be comfortable all the way around by this solution...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whereas with the other way, you would be uncomfortable with what you were doing a lot of the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And you know, if I were brought up in another world, another era?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might could do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which it's not, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so...and I think that everything will be...be all right with that solution.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, initially, I'll be thinking about what that solution is, but once I get to the point where I'm no longer thinking that that has been a solution to a problem in my life, then everything will be effectively solved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking that that will pretty much disappear?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially, I think, especially if I can develop some sort of relationship, longstanding, with someone, which is hard to do now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, but that would be the kind of thing that would, I guess, bring more enjoyment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it would bring me more contentment with...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Contentment, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With this solution. Yeah, that seems good reasoning. So, there, see, I've solved everything now, it's all taken care of. There's no problem. I'm wondering, though, if I have forced a solution by...by wanting to terminate our relationship at the end of 20 visits? I don't know, it's hard to say. You see, the thing is it's hard to come here sometimes.</p>

<p>[0:15:48.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, it really is. It's not so much hard once you're here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's hard to bring yourself, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes it's hard to think, well, let's throw this all together. And it's not rightly throw together-able. Like now, we're going to meet next Thursday. Right, okay, fine, that's great. Maybe next Friday is the day when everything will settle out. I'll have everything tied together. Well, that means I'll be a day early, so it will...I'll be forcing it, you see? And Wednesday, I'll be thinking, well, I'm going to see Phyllis tomorrow. Let's work on what's going on the last week, what your mind has done. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The trouble is that you have to do that on particular days. No, it's not the whole. It's more like something about you're worried that you might be doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and also why such a...why is one hour so holy? Why should we come here and talk once a week for an hour, I mean, ideally, what it should be is you should be someone that maybe works in the same building and maybe you can get off for five or ten minutes a couple times a day. We could talk that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It should be more informal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, not necessarily informal but when I need it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's plenty informal. So, there's...(inaudible) it's really been hard. Well, number one, it's been hard to stay away, because I've come to some conclusion and I have to wait three days to see you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or number two, nothing has happened, and if I don't want to come see you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think that's very, you know, understandable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a limitation, (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. The...the first five or six times when there's just information pouring out, it wasn't that way. But then it got gradually that way, and as I came to the conclusion, towards the meetings and things, and the last couple, it has, no occasion, been very hard, so I think, although there's a strong possibility that I will come to the center, back within the next few months, I think that I'm going to try and treat 20 as it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to try and make this all of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's hard, is that the reason?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and because now maybe one other thing, and that's that maybe now I can do it myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just a matter of really digging it all out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, so you mainly think you're ready to begin to figure it out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We'll have to see. Yeah, that seems to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it's like you're going to try it out. (inaudible). When you were talking about the hard part, was that...you know, so why you want to...(inaudible) use that? Because just because of the timing thing? Or is it hard in other ways?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they're hard to separate. No, I guess I just...what do you mean hard in other ways? Just hard to come and talk?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I do mean, was the fact that the...the fact that the timing, that you had to come in at a certain hour, whether you are ready or not. Was that the main thing to make you decide?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Pretty much. It's a strange way to do things, but I can't think of how you're doing it. First, it's not my field. It's real...I...you know, not...I don't know, I'd really be curious to see how some, you know, when you talk about...there was a movie, "The President's Analyst," like some really high powered analyst that has to deal with, you know, the deep problems of a person, if he treats it just in the same ways, and people are solving their own problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd say it depends on the analyst.</p>

<p>[0:20:02.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really would. I don't think it's a field that I would want to get into at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it just, well, excuse me, there's just not enough there right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To (inaudible) this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless you could hold onto.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's quite clear, in physics you have results from that. Of course, very often, lab results is a completely publish-able result. If something doesn't happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And here it seems rather ambiguous?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whether you have results here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's ambiguous whether you have results or not, and it's, well, I don't know whether it's...it seems a little bit ambiguous that, no, that, I was going to say that you're necessary, but that's not the case, because had you not existed, of course, I would have come to the conclusion I've come to. And although I...now, looking back at it, I could very well have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just by bringing up these things by myself. But the point is, I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I kind of feel unnecessary, like I'm not (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's as though, maybe it's the best way of saying, maybe once you've been developing a pers...well, no, maybe that's not true. Well, if a person is going to approach it with the idea that he's going to solve his problems, rather than he's going to say, "Well, this is that, this is the other thing, now tell me why that's the case," I think they could probably use the Rod Steiger approach. If one is going to solve it their own way, then, yeah, it's perfectly clear that this type of...that you and the tape recorder might be considered unnecessary. However, in my case, without you and the tape recorder, I never would have come to the conclusions. So, therefore, at least for 20 sessions, at least for 20 sessions you were very necessary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is what you're saying, the way I was necessary, or what changed, was it attitude?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well, attitude about what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About how you're going to get your problems solved?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, the attitudes stay the same. The point is I wouldn't have done it without you. See? So, the fact that you were there, it got done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Had you not been there, it probably...it certainly would not have gotten done. But now when I look back on it, I couldn't have done it without you. So, you know, now, where am I at?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, the times that you've set me straight and you know, to unscramble my thinking, I think I would have ultimately I would have taken quite a bit longer time. Ultimately, I would have noticed that scrambled thinking and that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the kind of thing you can do for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if it's not straight and it's not clear, you're going to come to the wrong conclusion. Okay? So, I wouldn't have come to the wrong conclusion, I would have just kept going with the dead answer. And I think your role is frequently that of keeping it in a reasonable direction. But I don't think that that was something I was incapable of. Incapable of doing, and now, but I didn't do it, you see, or hadn't done it up until the point of (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow that you could have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, so now the point is maybe I can now. Now that we've done this, now that we've had our 20 sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, does that mean you can because now you now have...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, now I have the confidence that I can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, now I know that I don't need a Rod Steiger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So, earlier you thought that's really what you had to have was a Rod Steiger. But now you feel that you can make progress without that kind of approach?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if I can remember to do it. If I can remember to sit down and think, do the (inaudible) kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>[0:24:18.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe think with a tape recorder, that would be helpful. Yeah, I think that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, if you want to be more independent of somebody else, figuring (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think more independent is a good phrase to use there, because I never felt dependent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I...in my life, I never felt dependent. I felt dependent in these sessions, initially.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I was talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay, fine. I thought you were talking about long-term.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you see, I never felt dependent upon anyone, because I never really thought anything out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. But you used to feel...you used to feel dependent on someone if you tried to think things out? What to you, those two things went together, thinking things out and using someone to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't...well, hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Forget it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's right, I think we beat that to death.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how do you feel now about not getting the Rod Steiger approach?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought it would have been really interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought it would have been really interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would have really liked that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I...just to see what conclusions he would come to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd just like to...like right now, I'd like to just go to someone and just talk for maybe four or five hours a couple times a week and then after a couple months and then say, "Okay, you tell me." Probably be the way I'd (inaudible) it out, "Now you tell me." And that would be fun. That would really be fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. I guess I'd be interested to find out (inaudible) yourself, (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd find out some other person's opinion about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, the thing is, he'd only know what I would tell him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could control it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm pretty sure that there are certain things in everyone's life that would indicate certain states of mind, certain problems, and just to draw a certain type of thing out, he could make himself into a psychiatrist, almost anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You (inaudible) looking while you were?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that I think that it's be pretty much, I went to Rod Steiger, pretty much not even doing anything. But if I really treated it honestly, and went right, you know, from the beginning of my life to now, the most important impressions, the things that the most points I could remember, then maybe I'd be interested, but I think I'd probably see a trend developing and then follow the trend, make him come up with some conclusions that I'd want him to come up with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm, you'd fix it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm. There's a bum that stays out on the point, (inaudible) on the lake, that fancies himself as a amateur psychiatrist. He has about three or four clients that come out there at night. He's got his little notebooks, and they just talk for an hour. "Okay, thanks, goodbye." And he closes his book. It's really wild.</p>

<p>Of course, he passes himself as an amateur everything, doctor, psychiatrist. Really strange guy. There was something else I wanted to mention, I don't know. I've been organizing a swim for New York. And it's...I really am sincerely interested in making it a successful swim and nothing else. I'm not getting any money out of it. And very suddenly, very, very, very suddenly yesterday, it was called off. Suddenly, right out of the blue, I mean, there's no way in the world I could have imagined it being called off. And it just shocked the hell out of me. And I don't think it shocked me so much because the swim being successful or unsuccessful, but because I'd just come from England and all of sudden, I'd been counting on the swim, and it was my face that was being, you know, that I was losing face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were losing face?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. In kind of (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I think pretty much that that's another indication that I mainly wasn't interested in just a good swim. I was interested in having a good swim that I initiated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would say that, and I had argued vehemently with other people that I was not interested in anything other than it being a successful swim. And I get...yeah, and now I see that it was just a successful swim, for the right condition for me. Not for the sport, but for the (inaudible)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so now it feels like just the opposite. Like it was all for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like it was...you see, there's another girl who's from Chicago, who's exclusively and entirely and totally in this work for mine. There's �s just no question, that's what he's in it for. And he's very good at his art, and whatever you want to ask him, well, (inaudible) what he's in it for. Good, clear, just no, no question at all. Well, I consider my goals to be, you know, more elevated, better goals, and now I'm thinking, well, they're not really. It's just that I value something different and I'm treating it just as holy as he is. He was brought up...he's just a little older than I. He was brought up with money being the most important thing for his family, timing right, and for me, of course, it wasn't that. My parents only cared about how well I did and what recognition I achieved. So, we're basically the same person, exclusively, and I looked down my nose at him, because he's such a money grubber. Well...</p>

<p>[0:30:49.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You looked down your nose at him and now you're looking down your nose at yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is my loftiest goal in a long time, because whenever I talk to...especially to him about it, I can say, "Alex, can't you get it through your head that I am only in this thing for the sport? I want the sport to advance, and I want to do a successful swim, and I could care less how much money I get for it." He was thinking I was in it because I was going to get a director's fee. And he contended...he's still contending that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He couldn't understand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, really, had I just been Alex, and there had been a director's fee, and then the director's fee, and I was working for that, and had the director's fee suddenly been abolished, then I would...that feeling, in Alex's head, would be the exact same feeling now in my head because the swim was canceled.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Of what you really wanted out of it, being...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. So, you know, it's, it doesn't make me feel too good, it really doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of disgusts you a little, it looks like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because, kind of, so long and so often I had defended my motivations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And defended them very strongly and Alex had to say that mine were better than his. But now I look at it and say, "Well, it's no big deal."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, he could never understand that, I guess. He could never understand that...that somebody would want something other than money. Of course, I can understand, I guess, I can't understand why people would want something other than recognition.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that true that you can't understand that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I've done this too long to know. Wow. Everything, I mean, he really wants his money very bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He complains when prize monies are lowered, and he wants races shortened so that the miles per...money per miles is greater.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I mean, is it true that you can't understand why he would want money?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can understand because I understand Alex.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand his motivation is exclusively, entirely with money. He wanted...he's a very funny guy, and he wanted to do a monologue once about, well, my hair is cut too long and I had a beard. And I told him I wasn't interested in that, I sincerely told him. And he wouldn't even (inaudible) about that. "Those (inaudible) you wear in your hair you just can't eat. And when you have kids you can't buy shoes with grass." And he's got a family and he realizes, you know, he just needs money to support his family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, their whole (inaudible) one thing is that, I mean, having been, this last two instances, being in a swim and seeing that I want to swim again. And number two, this thing about the shock of (inaudible), fit very neatly into the puzzle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I tell me one thing that's bothering me. I think I'm saying this because it's the 19th interview, and I feel in a hurry. It's something like this...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, now I'm going to get another session here, with just you. Okay, Rod.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, this is a Rod Steiger. It's bothering me that you seem to see this and like there's one motivation for it. Like, I guess, you know, I have trouble buying it is all that simple. You know, probably this is part of it, but there are probably other motivations, too.</p>

<p>[0:34:44.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true, but I can't think of what they'd be. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm very much in awe of all these great swimmers. They're simply, well, they do superhuman things, in my opinion and they're just great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I went up to see them...let me finish that real quickly. When I went up to see them, I...the fact that I would present a swim to them, you know, really made me feel good. Just saying, "You know, we've got a swim in New York on the 22nd, can you come?" And they were excited in that swim, and I really, that was my greatest moment up there, when the world champions were starting to really question me about the swim, and were happy that I initiated it. So, that makes me believe that this is really a major motivating point. Okay, that's what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying that I don't feel some major work being on the course, but the thing that bothers me is for it to be thought of as the one motivating force in your life, something like that. Because I don't think life's that simple.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, I'll tell you also, I think that's in your own little head, because I think what you're doing is trying to see where it does pervade your life, and what I'm saying to you is step back from that, maybe after you see that, and then maybe there are other things, too, applying to what you do. See, I might not be around then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. That's true. I really have trouble believing that there are other things to...granted, they don't need given an encounter, they're, you know, all sorts of things flying at you. But I think there's an overall strong desire for recognition in my life, and all major decisions and major things that I do ultimately boil down to this. And maybe...maybe I'm only bring...there are many things that have happened. I told you like three things have happened in the week and a half since I saw you, three or four things, and those are just things that boil down to the same thing. But they're important to me. And I looked back over this last week and those are the events that really stick out in my mind. Not anything else. And those are what matter to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you're saying it is very important to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are (inaudible) things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And at any given time, oh, granted, there may be many other things that I should be considering, but I think that in all honesty, right now, anything that I...any major thing that I do, anything that bothers me, anything that I think about, afterwards, by and large boils down to the same motivation. And I think I recognize it that there are many others, and if I come to a problem that doesn't fit into this mold, I'll have to say, "Well, now, wait a minute. Maybe that's not right." But I don't think, I really don't, anything that I've brought up of any consequence, and that I've come to this conclusion with is wrong. That's pretty egotistical, I know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To say that. Well, I came up with a solution, that's right, don't tell me that it's wrong. Well, what I'm trying to say, I'm trying to say to you, don't be too alarmed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, don't be too alarmed? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't be too alarmed that I do it this way, that everything comes up with pretty much the same conclusion, because I recognize that there are other things going on, and granted, maybe five years from now, there will be other things that motivate my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. Okay, that makes me feel better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, if I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I see that you're not looking at it as sort of simply as I had thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I feel better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If, for instance, I now have five or six years of really dire economic straits, I might turn into a dentist. But I think I have prepared my head enough to realize, define what motivation is. On the other hand, yeah, you're right. It's comforting to come up with a solution, and it's awful easy to have a mold to fit everything into. And that's a fear that I have, well, now that I've got this pattern and this mold and everything worked out, everything I do, any way that I behave, push it into the mold, be happy with it. But the fact that I recognize that that's a fear, that's a possibility is important. And I do recognize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't...yeah, I didn't want you to feel bad after 20 sessions, (inaudible) left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want me to feel bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't going to feel bad, but I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, feel bad to the extent that, well, he's got it summed up, but that ain't going to help him much later. I realize all solutions area dynamic and that different motivations may certainly creep into my mind and I'll try and be on the lookout for them. But in these early stages, the first time I've really examined my life, it's been really nice having a mold worked out.</p>

<p>[0:40:13.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so I hear you saying, you know, okay, you may have some point that may be useful five years from now, but it's not right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at the level I'm doing it at, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, I understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, I just hit, right now, the big high points and the most important things that affect me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see. I see. See, that's what happens when you do Rod Steiger things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's true. I can see that. That I could see really being a problem. Like I could see myself being 78 years old sitting around saying, "What was it Marcy and I decided?" and it might, it certainly wouldn't apply at all then. So, I just say the point is exactly to, I don't know if it's the Rod Steiger solution, to everything to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a logistic problem. Do...do other people hear what I say, or just you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I play these tapes for just one other person sometimes. But, see, your tapes are going into research. So, yeah, some other people will hear segments on the, (inaudible) segments. Why are you asking that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've wanted to ask that all along, but I haven't, and I don't know why I didn't. I should have right away, because I was afraid you'd say yes, and then I was afraid it would be besides between you and me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were afraid it would be what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was afraid there would be a third person, or a fourth or a fifth, whatever. It just doesn't seem, oh, it doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have a third or fourth person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that's, oh, that's really strange, too, by the way. None of this is strange. I was going to say that they're not really communicating with that other person, and by virtue of the fact that you're blind, it's the same communication, because you just hear me, as does that other person. That was the first thing I was going to say, but then I came to another conclusion, well, he can't talk back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He can't say anything, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so you in there, you can't talk back. So there!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It isn't like he's another person, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is so. Right there, and it's going out on magnetic tape, on the Mylar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, true, but I mean somebody right here. That's true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounded like you wanted to ask that before, but you felt...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be fear?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if I knew that, you see, I wouldn't say things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that way now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it's all pretty much said, don't you? That's why I brought it up now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, you'd take the chance of asking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, I never, I've always thought, well, this time I'm going to ask her. No. This time, no. And I didn't decide today to come in and ask you, I just decided, well, I'd really like to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been in the back of your mind all the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it really makes it harder for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What really makes it harder?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Having that here. I mean, it has, looking back on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: All along I said that it didn't, you know, that it shouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, let's say, for instance, that I solved any sexual problems, well, any sexual what I consider problems, that I have, or that I have said something that maybe wasn't really right and that, but later on, that this is something that I want to be in my past, and it simply won't be. I mean, I know the probability of that is just so remote, it's unbelievably remote, and yet, it's still there.</p>

<p>[0:44:21.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something that you want to be in your past?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and...and for some reason it's recorded...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know what you're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's a third person that knows it. This is something that, well, frankly, the id...something like, blah, blah, what was I going to say? Was it "Advise and Consent?" Did you read "Advise and Consent?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, anyhow, the Congressman that had a homosexual event way back in his Navy days and it gets back to him. Well, it's not that there's anything sexual in these tapes or anything at all in these tapes just the fact that I've been completely honest, I think, and have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what...it somehow related to it getting back to you later on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, if I change completely and there's a person that I wouldn't want to see how I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you had been?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How I thought, or even if I eventually behaved completely differently or, yeah, that's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Something about having these tapes made is having your past following you, in a way that you can't get rid of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I just want to clear that up. It's not like there's one person. It's like saying, in all the times that you've done tapes, I've maybe played parts of maybe two or them...one or two.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then for the research, that would be using short segments of (inaudible) your case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How does...can you just describe briefly how that works? I mean, like what part of an interview? Why one part rather than the other? What is the research about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if I'm supposed to do that. I don't know if that interferes with the research or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just...I really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know about the parts of the interview, they choose, and I don't know exactly how they're being chosen, but they're part...partly random numbers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really? Oh, that's interesting. That's very interesting. I'd like to be a little mouse and sit in on the back with the people that are doing this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you ask about in your post session? I'm sure he'd be glad to tell you after your testing, about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. How many people are involved in this, by the way? Can you actually say that or can't you even...I'll ask him that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Forget that. Why bother you with that? It just, frankly, that...that has been a very strong presence, that tape recorder. Although I tried to push it way back in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You tried to not have it be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it was really there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bothering you. And your fear that you were (inaudible) something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's just...I guess, it's the same as Rod Steiger's notepad, but it seems a little different because he could copy it wrong and I could deny it. If someone said, "Oh, this is the way you thought and this is the way you behaved."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're stuck with this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, well, I'm sure I'll (inaudible) through the rest of my life, I'm sure I'll be able to live with it, no trouble at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like somebody very set with what you've never been able to get rid of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, also I wonder if it's prohibited me from being completely honest. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it probably has. Well, not about anything that really matters, just about explicit things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, it's kept you really general?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>[0:48:34.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really hard to ask. But it's really gnawing at me, and I really want to ask it, before 20 sessions are over, have you enjoyed it at all? No, I'm not saying relative to...because it's your life, certainly, I mean, you wouldn't be doing this type of thing. But has my problem been at all interesting relative to some of the others you have, or not? Is it just a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean more interesting than others?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't...personally, I don't see how it could be because it doesn't seem that dynamic a problem to me. I mean, if you had, like, seven interviews a day, and I don't know if that's a number for a week or a month or a day, but would you have looked forward to mine as being one of the ones that you could get your teeth into and interested in and challenge maybe some of the stuff you've done?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me try to put it this way. I'm only trying to find a mirror of what you...let me put it this way. I've enjoyed it, yes. But I wouldn't say that it's because you have some kind of unique problems or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I enjoyed. I just kind of enjoyed the sessions, yes. But that's sort of interacting with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I've enjoyed. No, I can't say, you know, gee, this guy has the most interesting problem I've ever seen, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I kind of could have predicted that answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I want you to hear the positive part of it, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, I'm not saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just saying that I can't see you having come up with a derogatory or with a negative answer, and that certainly wasn't. You know, you could say...I just didn't see you say, "No, it wasn't that interesting a problem, it wasn't that deep a problem, it was a pretty simple one." And also...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't say that, by the way. I didn't say that it was simple, and not deep.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all right, fine. I mean, but it's certainly not...well, what did you say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I said it wasn't...oh, I see. Well, it wasn't like if I were working with somebody who had a multiple personality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would be very fascinated by their particular problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, in working with you my interest is not so much in, gee, this is an interesting problem this person has, it's more, gee, it's interesting and sort of fun to be with this guy for an hour and interact, it's more that level than about, than focusing on the problem of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see. Yeah, oh, that's...that's...that answer, now that you've worded it that way, that is an answer I...frankly didn't expect. I expected something much more nebulous that could be applied to anyone. You know? If anyone asked you that question, you could come up with answer and no matter what had transpired during 19 sessions, that answer would fit. I mean, it could be done, I'm sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. But this didn't feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it wasn't meant that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you say that like...you say that like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before the fact I wondered. You see, that's something completely different, you see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What...what goes on here is completely different than what I ask you, "How do you feel about what goes on here?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a different level?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible) for, you know, going beyond one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I would like to know is like what you would like...what kind of impact would you have liked to have on me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm very happy with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't think there's anything in my life that would change the first part of the answer is, you know, well, you know what I mean. That I'm not, that I don't have two distinct personalities or something like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think one of the first things I said when I came in here was I didn't really like myself very much. We have in here. Well, there's only been a few times, lately, at all, when I've not liked myself because of the way I've behaved. And I think there are going to be very, very few. In fact...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty rare.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The reason I mentioned that is because it happened once up in England when I was with these swimmers. And I was behaving strangely around one of them, just briefly, and when I finished the interaction I realized that I was...that I really didn't like the way that I behaved, and it was just the old thing about behaving the way he wanted to see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's...I said, "Wow, that's a long time, I really felt bad."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. It made you feel good, I guess...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To see how long it had been?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, at least we haven't gone backwards. I don't know. I still am, I think, the last thing to break down, at least with me, is to relegate certain, along the range of behaving completely honestly, exactly the way I feel at a certain instant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or telling someone, perhaps in here, gruesomely honestly how I feel, and the other extreme when I'm completely in awe of someone and the most important thing to me is (inaudible), that's why this happened, by the way, right now, well, the world's best marathoner, and I was with him, I was very conscious about how I was behaving, and I wanted to make a good impression. When I go to that other extreme, looking back on it now, I think that the last barrier to break down is to those people. Those last few people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're really in awe of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, is to...also, with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could act like you wanted to act...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With them, that would be the last barrier?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I've gone right up the spectrum to them. I still have (inaudible) with Dr. Smotel, my advisor, who is just in my mind, a very good physicist. He's always going to be. He has a directorship in Germany, and wow, it is really something. So, I really am in awe of him...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Impressed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And impressed by him, and I have trouble not saying, "Sir," when I answer, but everyone else says, "Helmut," you know?</p>

<p>[0:56:03.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, it's almost there. It's (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You tell it like there's a line there that you stop just the other side of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Of course, there is a certain amount of...there's a difference between respect and behavior, too. I mean, I can still respect these people without having to change my behavior around them. You know, respect them personally and what they stand for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say there's a difference, like those two can be separated?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm not saying I'm going to lose my respect for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Yeah, I see. So, you can change your behavior and still respect?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. I think that's...that I've come pretty much a long way in that regard. I still think the only way I'm dishonest in most interactions is a much shallower level and that's just when I come to a decision, when it doesn't really matter to me, one way or the other, but I can see how it matters to someone else, that I will make believe as though it matters to me in that particular way, in his particular way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is not so bad. It's not as though I'm changing my attitude. But as a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're picking up an attitude?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm picking up an attitude where it really, and it's usually not on critical matters.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's on little things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so maybe to that extent, it's still the old me. But I don't find that to be a major problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That isn't so oppressive to you? Just at that level?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's all right. As long as I don't get back to the point where all of my opinions are jaded by the people around me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. You feel that you moved from that, and that's where you want to keep that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What? What? Say that again. I want to keep that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to keep the progress that you feel you made?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't want to keep this last little residual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I should say, in such a situation, "I don't really care, but if you feel that way, fine." Whereas now, when I don't really care, I say, "Yeah, that seems right. Let's do it that way."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, so you can see how you'd like to change that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's sort of the remnants of what's left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The last bits of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've noticed that in a particular instance, a couple times in the last couple weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, next week, Thursday at 8:30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 8:30.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The three of us will have to get together again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You and I and the tape recorder?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay, bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I've been thinking off and on today about, uhm, something that happened last night.  My father called and said that they hadn't thought of this before but if I wanted to go to PYKK when they go over to my sister's wedding, they would pay my way.  And, I don't know, I just had a very mixed reaction.  In one way, it would be very pleasant to just go off for a week and have a vacation and to see another country and to see my sister.  And, well, I can just seen where it would be pleasant.  But I just can't imagine going.  And I said that I would check at school but I indicated I didn't think I could.  And I never did check at school.  And, and I actually had intended to speak to my supervisor but whenever I saw her, I seemed to conveniently forget about it.  And it would be out of my mind for a long time and then it would come in again at times when I wasn't around her and I could ask her.  And I couldn't tell whether it's because in a way I don't want to go or if it's that I don't want to make the decision.</p>

<p>And I think it's partly, too, that I don't — there's just something about leaving my job for that amount of time and I just don't feel that I could do it even if they said it was all right.  And just the way I thought about it today, the way it would come to my mind and then leave again, it was almost as if it were just like all the other things that, material things that I have to make decisions about.  And I'll just push them aside (clears throat) start another pile and say well, I'll take care of this later instead of taking care of it right when it, the problem first arises.  And then of course I forget about it or else they all just increase and I feel the pressure just from the fact that they're all building up.  And I just, I do it with letters and things that I have to answer.  And I do it with everything at school that I don't decide right at the moment.  And it almost seems that I'm doing it with this too, that I'll just sort of let things go until it's too late.</p>

<p>And also I think besides feeling that I couldn't leave school that long and also the feeling that I can't really ask to be allowed to leave that long for something that's not personally concerning me — I mean I've seen them be rather sticky about somebody's wedding for themselves and I can't imagine their allowing me to do this.  But even aside from that, I felt well, how can I go when I have all these things that I have to do for the course I'm taking.  And I did, when I first realized they were going to offer this to me, have a feeling that I couldn't do it too because then I wouldn't be coming here, although I don't know whether that's, I can't tell whether that's functioning as strongly as these other feelings. (Pause)</p>

<p>And in a way it was the same kind of reaction that I have whenever MSCZ suddenly will say late in the week, "Let's go away this weekend."  It's almost again I start thinking of all the reasons why I can't do it.  So for a trip like this I just feel I can't even consider it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  You mentioned 3 things that you have to leave: school and then your own course and you put, eh, coming here third in the list, sort of.  Any ideas about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it might partly be that sometimes I find it so hard to do what I have to do here and just making myself think about things that it would be a relief, in a way, not to come.  But I'm afraid of breaking the chain because once I am not here I'm afraid it would be even harder to do it.  And probably I do have a certain feeling — well, I must because I say things I never would have said when I first started — have a feeling of a certain type of freedom or, uhm, I don't, that's not quite the right word, but as much as sometimes I find it hard to just make my mind think about things here I, I don't feel the kind of pressure that I feel from these other things that I mentioned.  So that they would come to my mind first of things that I have to do.</p>

<p>But r—, but right when I was thinking about it last night — today I didn't really think too much about well, if I decide to go what will happen about this.  I was really thinking more how could I get done what I have to get done for school because of those conference reports and then the things I have to do for my course.  And I was just trying to think of just practically, could I get these things done somehow.  But last night when I was considering it, it, for a moment it just seemed like a very strong feeling that I didn't want to stop coming here just for that time.  But I can't tell because maybe I was just making it seem that way to myself so that it would seem like a perfectly good reason why I would think to myself that I couldn't do it.  Because everybody, well MSCZ for one, immediately reacted, "Well, of course you're going to go, aren't you?"  And anybody I've mentioned it to — I haven't mentioned it to more than maybe 2 people — but their reaction is, "Well, of course you're going to do it, aren't you?"  And I think in a way I mentioned it to the other people because I want to know how, how they'd decide it.  Although this isn't really a good test but just I can't even make the decision on my own.  I have to see what other people would do.</p>

<p>And I was going to do something, if I had mentioned it at school to my supervisor, I know I was going to do something that I used to do with my mother and, and that would have been presented in a way hoping that she'd give a negative answer so that in a way I could feel the decision were made for me or the limit was put on for me and then I didn't have to.  And, in a sense, I know I've, I'd made up my mind that I wasn't going to go.  And 2 things about that bothered me.  1, That I didn't feel I could leave these things and just suddenly change what I'm doing and go for a while.  I, I don't know, I, I've just feel so tied down by things that I'm, that aren't there except I'm putting them there.  And I felt sort of annoyed too, that I'm so uncertain about making this decision that I can't just make up my mind and then that's it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was a little surprised, too, at my parents' doing this because maybe I've given, attributed something to them that they never did but it has always seemed to me that they've preached when you have a job you don't leave it.  And so then they're asking me to leave something for all that time just so my sister would have some family there.  (Pause) And then if I try to imagine going I sometimes think well, it would be very nice because we'd probably stay in a nice hotel and you wouldn't feel as if you were pinching pennies all the time or that wouldn't be on my mind when, which is on my mind sometimes when MSCZ and I travel.  But then I think of the one time I did travel with my parents and it was just awful.  I don't think it would ever get that bad but I just wondered, too, how much just the tensions I now feel if I'm around them for very long would start bothering me.</p>

<p>And I don't know again whether I'm just doing that so that it justifies my deciding not to go, but then I'll think, well, it wouldn't, it would be silly to go to all the trouble I'd have to go to and take all that time away and then have an awful time (laughs) because of the way I'd react to my parents.  So, but once it's too late then I'll start wondering if I shouldn't have gone and probably it'll look pretty good to me then.  And I'll think, well, I could have done it if I'd really wanted to.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What happened?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Mm.  You stopped talking right after you in effect had said, if you go you might not enjoy it and if you don't go you'll regret it afterwards.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I just thought then very briefly of the fact that I hadn't, when I was thinking about it, thought right away of the fact that I'd be leaving MSCZ for a week and, and that when I finally did it was almost an afterthought.  And then I realized I hadn't even, I just realized right now that I haven't even ever thought of who would take care of the animals because MSCZ doesn't like to.  And that, both of those things — well, didn't surprise me as much that I didn't think first about leaving MSCZ for a week because I know before, I've found if I don't want to do something, that then I can't go for a long time away from him but if I do want to do something, then it doesn't enter in the same way.  And then I just began to think about school as if I just couldn't think about this anymore.  Because it just, although I think there's no question but that, in a way, I decided not to go right from the start, I'll always be sort of going back and forth on it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know what it is about, how, how I make the transition to school but it seems often when I'm thinking about things here that I'll suddenly just come to a stop all of a sudden and it's almost as if, well, what can I think about?  Well, let's see what did I do today?  (Pause) Maybe there was something in the fact that I was realizing how I'd reacted to the offer from my parents and, and the fact that I hadn't been sure about how I felt about leaving MSCZ or whether the fact that if I really wanted to go, it would not stop me, the fact that I was leaving MSCZ.  And therefore it might indicate a lack of feeling for him or maybe it's indicating that I'm too dependent on him.  I just don't know but I think there's something there that bothers me.  Because occasionally I had reason to be, during a vacation at, at my parents' house a few days either before MSCZ's with us, because I usually do it around a time we'd both be going there anyway, and sometimes it's bothered me that I can do it at all. (Pause)</p>

<p>And then other times I think, well, it would be awful if I couldn't do it so I'm equally confused about that, too.  Or maybe it's a feeling of, if I can leave him for something that I want to do and in a way, forget him — it's not that I don't think about him at all but in a sense it's kind of forgetting him.  It's not needing him.  — Then perhaps the thing that disturbs me is the fear that he might do it to me or that he just might like not being home and find reason to have business trips or say he has business trips but he really won't or something.  And I think I'm afraid of his returning what I'm doing that bothers me about it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Are you saying then that, uhm, you've mentioned a number of times ah, in the situations where you find yourself thinking you're, you're provoking him to threaten to leave or threaten divorce or talk about that, are you saying now that you are worried at the possibility that he might, in fact, take it seriously and leave?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think when I'm thinking of this, I'm thinking more in terms, we'd stay married but that he might start getting interests, other places even to the point of sometimes I've fantasized that he would have a mistress when he works late, that maybe what he's really doing is meeting somebody else.  And although I've tried to make it, light of it to myself, it is something that I'm se—, that is seriously on my mind and that by my finding it easy to leave him for a few days at a time he might in turn find it very easy to leave me.  But I don't, well, I don't know, I don't think I was thinking of divorce then.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But you think he might take a mistress or have an affair or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.  (Pause) And when I think about that, I can't tell, again, whether the thought of it bothers me because in, in effect he's rejecting me or whether it bothers me because I care about him and therefore I'd, in a way, be losing him.  And I think it's almost, just simply that he'd be rejecting me and I make up these things and even imagine — it's just like with imagining my parents not coming back from something and being killed in a plane crash and then trying to see how I'd feel or pretending to myself well, I'd feel this way or that way.  And this time it's almost like my making a situation where I am actually rejected and then sort of tormenting myself with how I'd feel.  Because there are times when I do wonder why he hasn't rejected me and in a way I assume he would never leave me because in my thinking it used to be you just, you wouldn't break up a marriage, even if it weren't a very pleasant one.  Or I don't know why, but anyway, in a way I don't believe he would but in another way I sometimes find it very hard to think that he still does have any feeling for me.  And if he ever says something about how he, how fond he is of me or that he loves me I always have to ask, why.  As if there must be, I mm—, that there has to be a reason because otherwise he wouldn't.  And it's almost as if I want to know well, what have I done that was right.  Because there must be so many things that I don't do that are right.</p>

<p>And I'm sure sometimes I'm unpleasant to him because I want to prove to myself that he's not going to leave me or reject me, that I can get away with a lot and he'll still be there.  And I imagine in a way that's what I did when I was being so awful to my mother.  Although the way I was to my mother was a much more intense thing and it was just always a very unpleasant relationship but during the time it was unpleasant.  (Clears throat, pause)</p>

<p>And it was interesting: today I asked a boy who happened to be waiting for his mother later than all the other children just some questions so, so that he would feel free to talk if he wanted.  And he, he never has been able to talk when he's alone with adults.  And at one point — I, his mother sometimes comes in a taxi — so I just said, "Does she ever tell you where she's been or does she tell you ahead?"  And he said, "No."  And I, so then I asked him if he tells her about things he's done at school and he said, "No."  And then he said, "She never asks."  And I said "Well, would you tell her if she asked?"  And he said, "Yes."  And it just made me think of the fact that I used to always feel that way about my mother and that that was one thing that made me feel so angry against her and that she didn't care because she never asked.  She always thought it would be prying to ask and she would wait and let us tell her.  And there are times when I think she was right.  But she didn't select the times.  She just universally didn't ask. (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's funny that it made me think, too, about MSCZ's, especially when we were first married, not talking about the office when he came home.  And for some reason I had and still sometimes have a great feeling about not talking when we were having dinner.  And so what would I do?  I'd ask him questions about his day at the office and he wouldn't tell me anything.  And I suppose in a way this seemed to me as if he were rejecting me because that was the one type of conversation that I can recall very clearly my parents always having.  When my father came home, he'd go into great detail about things that happened to him that day.  And (clears throat) it was almost like MSCZ didn't want to have anything to do with me, that he wouldn't tell me these things.  And it got to the point where I would just be in a bad mood before each dinner because I was anticipating this feeling of being rejected.  And of course it bothered him that I would ask him questions in the way I did.  It wasn't natural, there was nothing relaxed about it.  And it just made me feel as if everything had failed, that we would sit there and not talk to each other. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think it must have been that I was trying to have him react in the same way that my father had and I wouldn't accept any other way of reacting.  So I stopped what he would have done.  Well, I don't know what it would have been but I wouldn't let him do that.  But in the, in return, he couldn't be my father, the way he acted when he came home.  (Pause) It was almost like it was another aspect of the feeling that I was playing a part.  This is what you were supposed to do when you got together after a day apart if you were married.  And it was nothing spontaneous about my participation and it was what you were supposed to do, just the way I went through my wedding and my engagement and everything else. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  When I think about this side of me and this feeling of having to, the only one way to do things and it is the right way, and all I often think of the boy at school who seems so compulsive to me and I al—, and today I was, maybe always I picture myself in the position of helping him from being that way and often sort of attacking him for being that way, not really but just times when he annoys me because he is that way and, and makes it so hard for him to be part of the group because he is that way.  And then I will picture times when I was feeling very annoyed with him.  But it's almost as if I don't want to think of myself being like that anymore so I think of somebody else and put my relation to them, or put myself in a relationship that makes me seem much better compared to them. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I was thinking of the fact and I thought of it earlier too when I was quiet, that I was just wondering if I could find the face that I had seen yesterday.  And I did find it but somehow it seems pretty much the same but somehow I just not, am not particularly interested in it.  And if I keep looking at it it's more to see can I find it again and why, why am I not drawn to it the way I was yesterday.  And almost annoys me today.  (Pause) I could just feel myself reacting sometimes the way I do when I'm thinking about something I don't want to think about.  And I'll often get tense and sort of a stomachache.  And then I'll just say, because I can feel this, well, I'm just not going to think about it.  For some reason after saying that it annoyed me, I just didn't want to think about it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Are you looking at the face now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) It's funny.  I found another one (laughs) just now.  It's almost like it just sort of appears.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What does it look like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually, I just — and then there's another one right near it.  It just looks like a face of somebody, just sort of looking, maybe questioning.  Almost as if they can be saying "No", "Oh".  Not "No", but "Oh."  And then right next to it, sort of behin—, not behind it but kind of above it is another, a face of an animal that again just has sort of a expression of questioning or, I don't know, just as if they were looking without any other expression on their face.  And that's what I feel comfortable looking at today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: November 30th. JB, Betty Johnson, therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Look at that picture there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which picture's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Third flip (ph) fall colors, trees, and leaves on the ground. Prettiest time of the year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, fall is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's, what's pretty about it do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, you look at that and you see the colors and you look out around. [0:00:59.9] He did a good job [when he pictured nature] (ph). [It's painting in that] (ph). So many times you just take things for granted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything in particular you're thinking about and did you think about that whole process about taking things for granted and?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nope. Just slowing down and being able to just enjoy the moment. There was a time years ago when I went to my parents, my dad had retired from the shop and he built a house on Hillside and there was a pond in the back of the house and behind that was, was the woods. [0:01:50.8] About three or four acres and I used to go out there with my camera, set up in the woods and stuff and take pictures, but I got a beautiful picture across the pond of the house and a couple of deer with fawns and stuff standing right by the edge of the pond. You got the reflection in the pond of the house with deer. These (ph) like to sit down with this reminisce and things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What other kinds of things would you be doing, would you normally reminisce on (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just think about just the peacefulness of the moment and just not being a part of the everyday rat race. Just try to enjoy the callpart (ph) of the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you'll (ph) have times like that now where you think of suicide (ph)? [0:03:00.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every once in a while, I'd go off and (inaudible). This is (inaudible). My dad came along with some stuff, but I just don't, I just don't do much. Thanksgiving went to Davey and Anne.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (crosstalk) Oh, oh, that's Davey Anne.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Took the kids, grandkids. [0:03:52.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your wife had concerns you're telling me before about Dave and Anne's and how that time will be spent and what would happen. Did any of those things arise or how did it work out for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my daughter-in-law's mom rode up with us and I, it wasn't, wasn't bad. It wasn't any bad moments or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she and her mom don't get along too well but Gary doesn't want to get involved too much with her anyway, but they like to try to avoid him. We wanted to try to make her feel part of the family as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, just everybody get along. Enjoy things. Have a good time, but if it turned to a fight, oh well. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How wa-, what do you think was different? That caused this type of turnout rather than (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. [0:05:00.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did our meeting make anything different or, I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe the three of us getting along because we all feel about the same way. We're both, we're all three facing trials and struggles in our life, anger. And she's a breast cancer survivor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So somehow you all got connected because of your pain and?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know just what it was. Everybody seemed to be just all right with everybody. And grandkids, so funny. [0:06:00.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's fun (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had gotten my haircut just the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and so my granddaughter hadn't seen me yet and we got over to the house and she said, "Papa, what, you lost all your hair."</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, yeah, for a little while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, so, so what made you decide to cut your hair? Would you say? (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Wife had been talking about it and stuff. I usually get maybe a half inch or so on top up, I've never shaved my head since I've been in the service and stuff and I just wanted something different. It just got too hot all the time, I was getting tired of it. Just wanted it real short this time. [0:06:57.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you look clean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you (ph). I guess you got to change things around a little bit once in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that do to you and (ph) change things around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually dip (ph) but don't look maybe (ph). Just need to kick yourself out of that rut or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you only feel that difference now I mean since you got your haircut it's hard to be in somewhat kind of a rut?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feel the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, it's, because it's interesting though you came in, you look at the picture and you were talking about the pretty colors and fall and it seems like the fall represents change, innocence. And you talk about how it caused you to take a step back and put things in perspective and how much we may take for granted and things and stuff that you talk about now the haircut is about maybe changes and sometime you have to do things differently to get a different perspective on things. [0:08:10.7] It seems like this time of your life you're looking for something to be different or something. Trying to get perspective on things this is what this whole process has been about right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. I try not to get uptight about things at least. Accept things for what they are and if I can change things, go (inaudible) and change it. If I can't, don't worry about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because what happens with the worry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just builds inside you. You get to a point where you just might burst out in anger at someone. [0:09:09.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that's good. We got that small (ph) thing that you're trying to decrease is the outbursts, channeling your anger in less hurtful, explosive ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get so frustrated with the bureaucracy of our government. One day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: One day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One day (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not a, I'm just, I'm struggling right now trying to get Social Security. I've got my VA Disability stuff, I just got a notice saying that they've increased it for the month of December. [0:10:08.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, now Social Security, they, they seems like they just try to bury you into the system and so you just give up. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you make sense of them (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just accept it for what it is and just wait. Not much I can do about it to speed up the process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not like these are, this is one of those situations that if you can control something, control it or where if you don't, you can't worry too much about it? Yeah? (ph) [0:11:00.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, just not enough money to do everything that you'd like to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's (inaudible) frustrating in a sense. I just (crosstalk)  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) and then things for you that you would like to do but I wouldn't say that (inaudible) situation? Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a pretty unique situation for the two of us. You know we did my wife's struggling with her pain and I struggle with my pain and. At times we have to take a moment to just try to understand each other and where we're coming from. Just wears on you. [0:12:00.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, I can (inaudible) [how it happened] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now Friday after Thanksgiving I got a call from the Credit Union. Wife had entered a, some contest where you had a expenditure involving 91 dollars I think it was, then you were entered into this contest and we got a phone call saying that we had, that we had won 100 dollars. That was very exciting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She got off the phone, "I won 100 dollars!" I thought we won the lottery</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Laughing]</p>

<p>PATIENT: [and we both] (ph). I said what do you want to do with this? And she says, "Well what do you think?" I said, well how about going out and doing something pleasurable, we'll just go out and buy some groceries and give them away. She says, "That's a great idea." So we did. [0:13:01.5] We got two of the cleaners and (inaudible) rolled up and Salvation Army's out there and this guy was just a little bit obnoxious - brought me to the point I wanted to drive off. It was just, you know we really don't have any other place to take this, so let's just go back and drive by this character. So we did and when we got inside I told the guy what had happened and he says, "The gentleman out there in the parking lot?" and I says, yeah. He says I had a pretty rough time with him too today. He says, I was [growled at] (ph), well he better get over it. So, we, we just give all 50 dollars away and called it a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's really neat. That must makes you feel good. How did it make you feel to be able to do something like that? [0:13:59.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've done similar things of that in the past with the churches and I remember going to one house used the dove (ph). And the box had paper products and dish soap and stuff in it. First thing out of the little boy's mouth was, "Mama we have dish soap." And that was, you know walking into somebody's home you're bringing them all these gifts and things, you see their eyes light up and the wife was talking Tuesday night to somebody and she says, "Yeah, we did the same thing." And she says, "What brings it back to reality real fast is when you hear the neighbor's next door saying 'They're not coming to our house.'"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why would they say that (inaudible)? [0:14:58.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they, these people had gone out and then they would just buy for one particular family and the kids saw them going into their, the other house and stuff and they thought they would be coming to their house too. Did you happen to see the John Stossel 20/20 last night?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Cheap in America?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I didn't see that. What was that about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's more people in a working classes, the working poor, that give more money in comparison to those that have the most money. You look at Ted Turner and, and he says, "I give away two billion dollars" and John says, "Yeah, but you still have twenty billion left. What are you going to do with that?" [0:16:05.7] I don't trust the system, I don't trust Social Security. I'm thinking, you get Social Security? Hmmm. How can you get that, but you have so much money? And here I am (ph) struggling and I can't get it. It was an interesting show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like (inaudible) might help you put some things in perspective is what I mean. I mean, I mean, I think sitting here you talk about your own financial situation and frustrations and the struggles that you have as far as not being able to do what you would like to because you don't have money and then say, here you, once you do have money, I expect [it to be] (ph) in your pocket and you go and give it away to someone else who might need it and that's, that's interesting how that works. [0:17:04.0 ] And so I'm just wondering what is it that you get out of that? And it's not just you apparently, it's, based on what you're saying (inaudible) the show is, a lot of the working poor and the working class.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People just (inaudible at 0:17:25.9) are fairly generous at giving away, I guess the way the guy said, last night was I've been blessed and whatever else I get above that I give to others. So they can feel blessed as well. But the Golden Rule - do onto others as you would have them do onto you - and so many times it just slipped away from us (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially when we get caught up on like you were saying earlier the cares of the world or cares of our lives and get caught up in everything somehow that's easy to forget how to treat someone else or have a care for others despite you (ph) in our own struggles or in the face of our own struggles. [0:18:16.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: At Christmas time I think it becomes so commercialized. What is the real true meaning of Christmas? What does a Christmas tree represent? I haven't been able to find anybody to tell me that. They didn't have one in front of that manger. Not in the middle of a desert up there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So for you it's that thinking about the, let me ask you this: what, what does Christmas represent to you? How, how would you like to celebrate it or so it's not as commercialized? [0:18:58.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of giving so much as gifts to each other and they say that the three wise men came with gold, frankincense and myrrh and the true meaning is supposed to be the whole basis of Christianity, the birth of Christ and accepting him. That a lot of people just think that it's just a time of, of Santa Claus and they spend as much money on everybody as they can. As far as family gathers, it's more personal desires and what it is real necessity, so to speak. [0:20:04.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you talked earlier about being, being blessed that you can give blessings to others. Do you feel as though you're blessed Tim?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do. Because even though that, even though I'm in pain and wife's in pain and stuff, we still, I wake up every morning, there's nobody around my bed crying because I'm dead. That's a good thing. Every time I go over to the basin (ph) (inaudible) all selfish, there's one security cop that's out there, every time I ask him how he's doing, he's always got some sort of comical remark. [0:21:00.5] He says, "Well I'm able to stand upright, I'm not six feet under" and things along that line. He got the right perspective I think. No matter how bad you are, if you look around you can find somebody who's worse off than you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it may not be more than two doors away from you, you just don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you use that at all when, when you're feeling like you're in a rut? Do you use that type of perspective?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things could be worse or could, this could be happening or I'm not as bad as this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Things could be a lot worse. [0:21:55.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Putting in steel (ph) and looking in, in that perspective of how it doesn't always take away your pain and doesn't always take away the struggle that affects (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it help (inaudible) so far?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It takes your focus off of. I remember so many times I had when I was out fishing and stuff standing in the middle of the river.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were how old was this, when was this? When was this? [0:22:50.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, this was when I was in the service up in Jersey. We would go out to the Hackensack River every morning we go to work. And some we go "Fish on" you got about 30 people standing all these guys pulling the rods and back and. One time I caught two. I had two hooks and I got them on the line and I must have toyed with them things for a good hour. It was funny. Said, "you going to pull them in" and I says they're a tag on again. And just as I got them in, get down with the net and [makes noise Schew] they go again. I said man they (inaudible) kind of strength in life. I think we could if we just didn't let so many things wear us down. [0:23:57.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder, what, what do you think is the significance Tim of you reminiscing as much as you're reminiscing now. Thinking back to the time when I met you with the haircut and this example that you gave me. What is it, what do you think is going (inaudible) times and thinking back on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Using the more peaceful times to help overcome the difficult situations I get in to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So look back at a time in your life where things were good, when you - [0:24:51.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Back away from some of the things that are troubling us now. They just, just, (inaudible) kind of a dull for a future. I just accept things for what they are, do what you can and don't worry about it. As long as we have what we need, I guess our wants are, you know worldly possessions are just worldly possessions. It's just stuff. No matter how bad it is or if you go through a divorce, it's only stuff. Stuff's replaceable, but when you're with somebody that you really enjoy their company, you really care for, then the goal is to try to spend as much time together to have feelings (ph) and enjoy just some of the simple things. Don't let difficult things get to you. [0:26:06.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the simple things in your life that you're trying to enjoy more of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The grandkids. And my wife and I do have a lot of time together. We do enjoy each other's company, going out, doing some things. I got a, I got a band saw that's supposedly my Christmas present so I spent a few days putting it together and she says, "I want a lesson on how that works when we get done." [0:27:05.2] I said all right. When I got finished up, headed for (inaudible) and run a piece of wood through it and made some scrolls and she says, "Wow, that's pretty neat, you think I could do that?" I said, if you put your mind to it, you can. She says, "Well it looks dangerous" and I said well, it can be, but you just put your mind to it and think of the thing as a tool and you're going to use it for a purpose and just be careful, but not let the thing overpower you. If you think you're bigger than that, then you're going to have a problem, but just remember that that thing is dangerous, but it's only as dangerous as what you make it. And then she was pretty excited (inaudible). She says, "Now what do you use it for?" [0:28:05.2] I said well you use it for scrolling and making different things. In general, guys just like to have a workshop set up with various tools for various purposes. And they come in handy. So she's got a number of things all set up for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Laughs] More projects.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Still trying to put my workbench together, that she's wanted flower boxes with wood tulips and something to paint. She says, "Can I paint it?" I says well if you want to paint the projects, I'll make them, you paint them. She says it sounds like fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds good you guys are working together. I'm wondering how that feels to be able to have this type of time together and the dialogue and? [0:28:59.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some days it's good. Some days it's difficult, because (ph) you just don't feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like talking about the tool and the flower boxes and projects, that was a, a, a, are the, the communication its good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Tim I wanted to let you know, take a few minutes to talk to you before you (inaudible) continue our discussion, but I wanted to let you know that some unexpected things have come up in my life that I want to patch (ph) up, finish working here on the 22nd of December. [0:30:04.3] And so I wanted to be able to work with you through that point and transfer your case to one another therapist. And I'm really trying to figure out who would be a good therapist for you, so I just wanted to let you know that ahead of time. What we'll do before that day is actually, I'll introduce you to that person and then you want to go from there as far as setting things up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, that's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any problems (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We all have things that come up in our lives and we have to prioritize things when we run into difficult times we have to make the decisions that are best for us and I understand those are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this has been great working with you and I'm sure the next person is going to be, will be responsible for your case will be working with you as well and continue to help you on goals as you establish those (ph). [0:31:14.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what is your assessment of me, the times that we've been together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I do see the depression that you mentioned, but over the time that we've worked together it seems like it wasn't, it's not as prevalent as it was when you initially started, but I definitely see it there. </p>

<p>I see when we talk about the anger, maybe the inner man explosive anger, depending on who or life circumstance and want you to be able to come up with ways to channel the anger and frustration. You have lots to be frustrated about, given the system and Social Security, the financial strain, the strain that your health puts on you, the strain of your wife's health (inaudible) houses, definitely a lot that could cause your frustration and anger. [0:32:25.0 ] And those feelings are totally appropriate, but it's, important to try and figure out ways to channel that so that it doesn't come out in explosive way that hurts yourself or interferes in your marriage and, or in your abilities to be a better (ph) grandfather or whatever the case is. </p>

<p>I see that there might be some unresolved issues that you have from childhood with your own father and parents and I think that's come up and that's surfaced in you, me listening to the way you describe your, your childhood and your father and I can definitely see maybe some traces of things that, maybe your needs expressed to your father out of fear or whatever the case is that you might still fear him with you and the anger and things. [0:33:26.9 ] And then maybe even just learning some things from the way that your father handled conflict are things that maybe we when, and we look at your own style of handling conflict and handling your feelings. It seems similar to some patterns that maybe your dad made a model for you. </p>

<p>I see at times Tim, it seems like it, it may be a challenge for you to identify your feelings or openly talk about your feelings because I've noticed in conversation when I might ask you how this made you feel or how that made you feel, you either sometimes you change the subject or you tell me what you're thinking and that's totally, I mean a lot of them respond in that way and so I would hope over the course of treatment, and maybe it's not possible, but I would hope over the course of the treatment that, that the therapy can create a safe place for you to be able to get in touch with some of those things because if we all get in touch with those feelings, then at times those feelings is what controlled us in a sense. [0:34:45.5 ] And so if we can tap into that and experience them and be okay with experiencing them and be okay with expressing them, then we have control over them and we can direct and channel where they go. You see what I'm saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. It is difficult at times to talk about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And being in the service for 20 years I was around mostly men. There was some women that were there too, but mostly men and in the shop that I worked in there was just four guys that we worked out in a test cell, because we ran aircraft engines and we ran aircraft and we did all of the diagnostic stuff over the years and when you spend that much time, sometimes we were working eight hour days. [0:35:51.0] Some days we were working ten hour days and some days when we were out of the (inaudible) we were working as much as 24 hours with each other and guys just don't talk about their personal lives that much and we don't talk about their feelings and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the way society is structured too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Men shouldn't express themselves or shouldn't not (ph) a man needs to get in touch with feelings, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you identified with that part of yourself or that being in my shoe (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to. I'm trying to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another area I see too is intimacy towards (inaudible). We've had that discussion around intimacy in your relationship with your wife and how do you all build intimacy and have the marital relationships despite your physical ailments. [0:37:03.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the difficult part. That's the difficult part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seemed like that would be frustrating is what. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For both of us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two (ph). So those are the types of things that I wanted to share with the next therapist. Is there anything else you want, that, that you see that I may have missed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there anything that you don't agree with? Is there anything that you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything I don't agree with? No. They're just.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So those things are pretty accurate you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Did, did I miss anything? [0:38:00.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I can recall right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Those are the things that I'll share with the therapist and I'm not sure, now we were on a bi-weekly schedule. Are you still satisfied with that and (inaudible) couple weeks (inaudible) looks like three weeks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think so. Did you have the opportunity to talk with anyone about the financial situation?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did. The, the lowest fee that they can do is 35 dollars. That's the minimum that, that we get, and that's the minimum that they can take, do the fee weavers (ph) or lower payments is 35 dollars and if that's something that still puts a strain on you, then there are other places where I can refer you to if 35 dollars still is a strain. [0:39:08.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I can (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. If you feel the quality, the quality of the therapy is pretty cool here. I mean I would like to see you stay on board if possible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had also talked about getting in to see a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I'm still waiting on that and so I'll make sure to complete a follow-up with that or that your therapist follows up. Because you want to get your meds reviewed (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's, that's everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So our next appointment would be  - </p>

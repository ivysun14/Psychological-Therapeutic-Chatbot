<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is February 22, and this is Carrie's ninth session with Tyler. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I came to a, it took me a while to realize certain things that I really wanted to discuss like, you know, for some reason I really hoped that you would suck it out of me. Do you ever feel like that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I did some of those focusing games. And I did one with that friend of mine Stacen. And one thing that she was saying was that - she was the focus and I was the facilitator and we were talking about, she was saying that, she was saying that she doesn't feel that I can, I am physically demonstrative at all, like I am inhibited that way with my friends and stuff like that and so that really upset me. And it was good, just focusing and facilitating, but that just really bothered me. . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a second, hold. Now, that is what I haven't been throwing out at you? . </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that has nothing to do with that; this is something that I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you prefaced with -  </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just prefaced with that because I wanted to say it sort of. But it has nothing to do with this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We had all the demonstrative  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: With what I am telling you now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See because I want to tell you some things that happened to me like when I was in fourth grade or fifth grade and like it's something I have never been able to verbalize and yet it has always really bothered me. And what happened was that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A problem, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I find it really hard to - but I promised myself I would tell you. Like my weekend resolution. Because I can't figure it out and I know it has affected me and I don't even want to think about it sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must be really terrible?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it is really horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what you think? </p>

<p>3:33</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Look at you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it help if I looked away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really nervous about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like something that you have been sitting on for a long time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I didn't think I could ever tell anyone about it, so I better tell you quick. I guess I didn't realize what I was doing but I guess I was masturbating, and my mother found me and she didn't tell me what I was doing and she said "Don't you ever, ever, ever do that again." And she made me go to church to confession and she didn't' say the word and I didn't' even know what it meant. She told me I had to tell the priest that I was doing impure things with myself. And so like, I would still do it and I just felt horribly guilty about it. And no one has ever. And I just really feel guilty. I feel awful about it. And I think it has hung me up in certain ways. Wow, I didn't think I could ever tell anyone about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what is the hang up for you, what is - I hear you saying it is hard and you feel very guilty talking about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel really awful about it and like you must think I am an awful person. Well I was really angry at my mother for not saying anything and I had to go and tell this priest and I didn't' really know what I was doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, now how do you feel; like now that you have said it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not so bad now that I have said something. </p>

<p>5:33</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really understand that because I had the same problem. It happens to must of us Catholic kids. Are you Catholic? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You must have been. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was. I'm not any more. Like I don't think I can accept my own sexuality very much and I think that is why when Stacen was saying that, I think I really have hang ups involved with that. And I feel like maybe most people don't do and I don't know why I have done it. I would say I did that a lot through high school and then less and less but I don't' know how to handle it; like I feel really badly about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me tell you something. I masturbated with a lot of guilt all the way through high school every day; a lot of guilt, same guilt thing. Up till the age of 26, still with a lot of guilt then I found out that everybody else does this too and there is nothing wrong with it. And if you want to masturbate now it is okay too. And it will go away once you start having intercourse. Once you have a normal relationship it will go away. And then you may not go all the way. And that is okay too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like I am maybe the only girl who does this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you didn't do it you would be the only girl who doesn't do it, maybe, that I could buy. There is a little bit more variations among girls but clearly most girls masturbate. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why didn't she say anything to me? I mean she just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't any parents; I don't know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But that was, remember when I said to you I had done terrible things and if you really knew me that is what I was talking about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's funny because I missed that. I'm serious about that though. Somebody must have written about this somewhere but there is nothing. But I'm not giving you a private opinion of my own either by the way. The opinion I am giving you is like about as wide spread as people need to talk to people. There is nothing to worry about. You did not - I mean after this hour you can go masturbate if you want to.</p>

<p>9:15</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is okay if you do though. You shouldn't deprive yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You see but it's - I think I sort of have to accept sexuality a lot more than I do. Because then I felt that I was this oversexed person and I was sick because I wasn't expressing this with other people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you're not; sorry. Do you still feel guilty about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I feel like, I didn't' think I could ever say anything, it just sort of - and then of course I would go to confession, and my god I could never tell the damn priest that and I never did tell him when I went. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I mumbled something, then I never went again because I just didn't believe in confession anyway when I went. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it was still a bad evil thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, horrible, like I just thought I was evil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even Margaret Mead talks about it I think. In other cultures adolescents do it in groups. I think Margaret Mead, Coming of Age in Somalia describes group masturbation, because it is a very natural thing to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And what I feel like now is just like sort of like my whole system has been cleansed out. Have you ever had that feeling? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because finally you got that out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, finally I got that out. Because I just felt terrible about it. </p>

<p>11:42</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know yeah, I beat myself up for that, every time I masturbated I felt bad. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you feel horribly guilty and just really hostile angry towards my - towards everyone. I mean it got to the point like if I - I remember in high school thinking if they only knew that I masturbated at home everyone would flip out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, if they really knew who you really were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if they knew. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Evil, perverted. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, perverted and fucked up. I just thought, "Oh god you are so fucked up kid." </p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you noticed, the reason I had to tell you about my own thing on this is because I started to snicker a little bit because I can't tell you how many times I have heard that in this office. And I said it in this office myself when I was sitting in this chair as a client. It's really too bad we have to go through all that pain for all those years. I can just see you going into the confessional booth, torturing yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh god. Then the thing was like you know it was definitely a mortal sin. I heard it again and it was like twelve or thirteen years old and we had been at camp and we came back and there was some sort of girl scout badge we were trying for or something and we had to talk to this, one thing was to talk to someone in the clergy and a whole bunch of us went up to this priest and he was saying - he said - or we were asking things - a question came up about sex or something like that and he said "I don't know why everybody make such thing about it." He said, "There are so many problems like I was just counseling this married couple and the husband told me that his wife was masturbating." And everyone kind of looked around at each other and no one said anything and he said, "Don't you know what that means?" And no one said anything so then he said you should go home and ask you mother about it. And everyone was giggling about it. Then I felt horrible like I was the only one doing it and I just think it is a horrible thing and my life will never be right because I was doing something really horrible. </p>

<p>15:10</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you, that is going to change in some way too, all that building up or something. That was the fantasy I had somehow it was perverting me forever. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I was incapable of having sex with anyone else only with myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that might even work on the contrary. That is probably directly connected to sex. I just can't imagine-well I guess it is possible it just seems so foreign to think of someone never masturbating. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's funny because I guess I just felt that it was so foreign for someone to masturbate. Now that I have talked about it, it's not such a big thing but I just needed to say it and tell someone. Then I said, well, Jennifer, you have intellectualized it like why do you have to go in there and tell Felix about it? And I realized it would be a painful thing for me to say plus I just needed someone to say that it was all right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wouldn't tell you that it was fine if it wasn't by the way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really do believe that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do I don't have any sex books here? No, I don't think so. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's this whole feeling that you have to run up and hide in your room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how about (footnoids ph 17:20) complaint?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't read that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Read it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Read it, I'm going to assign it for you to read it. I got so tired of him masturbating I had to put the book down. As a matter of fact after I read him, and then I read some other people, I had the feeling that I hadn't been masturbating enough. I'm serious. Clearly for adolescent boys it is a daily affair. I'm not that in touch with it but girls do it often also. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then she made my - she was very upset you see she told my father and my father actually had to come up, I was in my room, and he came up and he wouldn't mention it but he said, "Mommy said that something ..." I just felt that I had done something and really let him down. Maybe that is why I tried to go out of my way to be goody good to them in other ways. Because I really think it blew her mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so. She masturbates too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Jesus, I can't believe that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to imagine isn't it. </p>

<p>18:58</p>

<p>PATIENT: God yes, anything else but not that; my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just didn't handle it very well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't handle what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Obviously she didn't handle the sex education in your family very well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There wasn't any. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that's my point. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There wasn't any and I think that was one thing that made me very sort of leery about sex in general and not as easy to get involved in it as my sisters were. I have no idea if they masturbate or not it was never discussed but they have slept with people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is - well another very common thing that people don't know is that girls, especially very young girls having - masturbating with someone else at a very young age like fourth or fifth grade or younger, kindergarten. And people sit on that for a long time too. I didn't get a chance to do that but I hear it is common. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't' either. I guess everyone would consider me real social outcast then, if I did that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Young girls like that get seduced by janitors and then they don't tell their parents. They say I liked it and I don't want to get the janitor in trouble and all that and then they sit on it all their lives and that makes them feel pretty rotten. That usually makes it worse. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just needed to tell you that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was a sex survey about fifteen years ago or something that indicated that males for example, 25 percent of all males, and this was when the country was more rural, 25 percent of all males have ejaculated when in contact with animals at least once. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that the Kinsey report?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, this was pre-Kinsey. Now figure that one out, so that is not all that uncommon either. See I'm afraid you only have the garden variety things here. If you want to shock me you are going to have to come up with a better one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it though there is nothing. That shocked me. </p>

<p>22:29</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think you're delightful. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now when I think about it, I said, "I can't tell him that, it will just blow his mind." I said, "Jennifer you've got to, you just have got to go in there and tell him." I was thinking about it all day today. But I think, see like going to what Stacen said, I do think that had a lot to do with me feeling very guilty sort of and plus you know I like my family has never been very demonstrative or physical and stuff like that. And I didn't really think that I wasn't like with friends and stuff like that but you know it made me think that maybe unconsciously maybe I am sort of really wary of sex and frightened of it and I think in the back of my mind that there is some dirty connotation of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is because that is all you have ever been told about it that it is very dirty and evil and not only that you will go to hell. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, this was the thing that if you didn't confess things like that and you get run over by a car you are damned and you'll go right down there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, straight down, zap.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that is what got me so angry about the whole church even now and I won't' go near it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know the feeling. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just think it fucks up to many people. </p>

<p>24.33</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, see that is why I left that business too. That is one thing I want to rip the church off because I think that they are a destructive outfit. They suck people in and give misinformation and destroy their lives. Other than that they're a great outfit. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus the whole thing like it was all right for guys but girls are not supposed to have any sexual feelings. I have no way of expressing them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't be church going; you are supposed to be pure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and when I knew I wasn't and I had impure thoughts and desires things like that I thought, "Oh Christ what is wrong with you?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most of my thoughts have been impure. That's true most of the time and that gave me ten years of hell. I felt worried and obsessed about that all the time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was a real obsession for me. Like I use to just think about it all the time, like what is going to happen to you. But that was what I wanted to tell you. So I wonder how I can be - like I can't see reading sex manuals and stuff like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that going to do for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing I was just thinking about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you need to read sex manuals, I don't read them and I have about ten of them and I haven't read any of them. I thought it might be - I'll look up some stuff for you. The important thing is for you to believe that it is okay and you shouldn't deny yourself. One the other hand you shouldn't let it be a substitute either. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't think that is going to be a problem for you. I don't think so at all. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think that when I'm done in here and I am very anxious, and especially during exam's and stuff like that, and all you are doing is looking at the god damn books and worrying about papers and stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure anxiety builds up and it is a way of reliving anxiety. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I could say that to myself but I don't really feel that. I did feel horribly bad because that is what I was thinking when I said that there are all these horrible things in me and that was it. I thought that was just horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The only problem with masturbation is that, what it does is relieve tension that is all it really does and there is some enjoyment but it is really quick. At least it is for males and it is not lasting or anything. I'm not quite sure and I can't say what it is like for females like what the feelings are but for males anyhow, and I think it is a little bit for females, is that a male can be masturbating all his life up to the age of 25 let's say for example and have the same fears that he wont' be able to enjoy sex with a woman but as soon as he has sex with a woman he finds out it is different and better. So you get all those enjoyments you get out of masturbation except a hell of a lot more and better and then when you start having a relationship with a woman you'll find that it doesn't come up as an issue or anything all of a sudden it disappears. And I never believed that it would seeing how you had been obsessively masturbating for so many years. I don't thing that part is any different for females. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then what I did this summer, it was really cute - I had this boyfriend at home and I just didn't want to sleep with him and I didn't' want to and I was scared the same way, just because there was a lot about him that I didn't like I guess. And so I went back to New Jersey and I stayed with him and it was the night before, I was going the next day so I decided to sleep with him and it wasn't successful like he didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you have done, would you say I'm an evil person? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No he didn't like break the hymen or any like that. And like it was like I almost didn't want him to and I almost unconsciously didn't want to work at it and go back and sleep with him again and stuff like that. So I was leaving the next day and it was just a strange introduction to sex. Then I felt very badly about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? In what way, what was bad about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I felt that I was really running and I had deliberately done that so I could run and secondly I just I think with real problems I think like he just didn't care for me any or that much and all he really wanted was my body. And there was really - and that made me feel very uncomfortable in bed with him. So then when I could leave the next day it was almost like I planned it that way. </p>

<p>31.36</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have had similar things like last summer for example; a woman went to bed with me just for my body. I finally woke up to the point that, "Well, I have done that why can't they do that?" And I was shocked that they would do that. But I finally woke up to the notion that and I had done it in the past also and women who have basically been friends of mine and neither one of us had a relationship at that moment and so we just went to bed with each other to satisfy each other sexually and that was all it was and that felt good. I'm glad I did it and she is glad she did it. The point is to be clear what the hell you are doing so one person doesn't think they are madly in love and the other person doesn't. So don't have any miscommunication. Ice cream is better than nothing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But that was a very strange and I knew it was strange and I knew why I did it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought maybe you were going to say you felt bad because you couldn't do it then to or something? But what you are saying is you felt bad because you felt you were running. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like it is not that I thought, "This is horrible or I feel this is a dirty thing." I guess I felt bad because I just couldn't stand his. See that is what I meant about accepting the sexuality, like I was always attracted to his body. And I really felt like we never communicated on a mind level at all; in fact I couldn't stand some of his ideas. We use to have violent fights about that and I really didn't care. But I am saying that I don't understand why I couldn't accept the sex part because that would have been really good. Like I felt guilty about it; not that by sleeping with him it should have been some meaningful thing, however long it lasted. But then I wanted or prevented a lot of things from becoming meaningful because I won't get over this obstacle of sleeping with someone. Does that make any sense to you? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to warn you about another thing and give you a little sex education, okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't any more things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you sleep with some guys they are going to be impotent with you. The danger is you are going to think that you, or since you haven't had much sex that it is your fault but that is not true. That happens a lot. And guys will feel, god knows because I am an expert at this, guys will feel that they are inadequate and you will feel you are inadequate. You may but neither one of those things are true. Sex with someone initially will be not so good the first time or maybe a bunch of times in a row. You should not have expectations about what it will be like. What that does is build up pressure to perform and as soon as there is pressure to perform on males particularly they cant do it. And that is very common. See that argues for love relationships for sex and that is the best way to do it. Where you love each other whether or not your sex is good or not, then the sex tends to get better with that kind of person. But if you are just going to go just for sex and you have to do it then it very often turns out not to work well. Then there is accusations of self and others and back and forth. So be for warned. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you go to bed with someone it doesn't mean that you both will have an organism every time. That's another thing too. The next trip you may go through is I'm no good because I'm not having an orgasm. That is a very common one too and that doesn't mean you are evil either. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I'm just worrying about myself because I just seem to be so slow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you are not setting any record, that's for sure. On the other hand it is not that unusual. You are not that unusual. Let me say how I feel remember those helmets I gave you last time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a Canadian term by the way. I felt a little bad doing that because I didn't know if I communicated to you and what I want to communicate to you is that it doesn't mean you have to use them. I don't want to pressure you into doing it; you should do it when you feel right, when you want to; listen to yourself. What I am saying is more like, how you grow is up to you and I don't say you have to rush all of a sudden and do that. </p>

<p>37:53</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that was what I did last summer and I just felt like, "Jennifer you better hurry up and lose your virginity quickly so that it will just be smooth sailing from now on." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It will help I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so too. What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering if you approached that guy you mentioned?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I haven't seen him yet, tomorrow. But I will. I don't know if it will work. I don't have to much confidence in myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I noticed that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, at all, in anything now. I use to have confidence in certain pots but now I feel like I am a zero in everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you are feeling that way right now, like right now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I feel really good right now because I feel like I just went over a really big hurtle by telling you what I told you. </p>

<p>39:17</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel that you did too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I just, it was something very, very hard for me to do or to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that was very good. And there will be some more of those hurtles by the way. There will be more things that you are not going to want to tell anyone. I don't know what they are but they are probably going to feel similar and I hope that maybe next time it can be easier. It could be thoughts maybe, fantasies rather than deeds. And that is okay to share with me to or someone else like me; I mean someone else who really likes you and doesn't have an investment in pushing you around. You must feel like, well you did your work for today. Like how much progress should I expect after all. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I did my job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, you did your job. </p>

<p>PATIENT: My father is coming tomorrow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He has to be here for business or something. That's the other reason I thought, "Shit, you better tell him quick." That is one thing  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't let him push you around. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you see it is funny like if I came in here and said, like there is a lot about my parents that you know I can't stand and I wouldn't want to be like and that was part of the biggest thing. And there is a lot of other things but it is not - I can accept it sort of, it hurts me some of the things they do but I am very aware of things that they won't discuss like sex, they totally deny and stuff like that. And my father is not a demonstrative man. I feel sorry for him. It is too bad. I think it would be nice to be able to say to someone I care. Or show them that you do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, let's get back to that demonstrative stuff. That is what you came in her with prefacing about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well that bothered me when she said that. But I honestly said that first sort of as a lead in because I was thinking how am I going to word that, but it wasn't the biggest thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that is connected by the way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you see what happens if you are demonstrative, I see you as a highly turned on lady and if you get turned on to other people before that would mean that you would have to be guilty for that. So I think what you do is avoid. A good example of that was when I saw you dancing. Your partner could have been in the next room somewhere. And if he wasn't that would have started turning you on. I think if you gave him eye contact when you were dancing that would have turned him on and then you would have felt guilty. That is my guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in general, yes. It wasn't with that specific case. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in general?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In general you are right, yeah. But one whole thing is I thought that if, that I was just strange sexually because I masturbated and I hoped he didn't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have orgasms when you masturbate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do; I thought so. That is good, that's great. Some girls don't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? See I can't imagine any other girls having done that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think there are girls who would say so, just like you wouldn't say so. Like if a girl came up to you and asked, "Do you masturbate?" You'd say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, "How dare you say that to me?" Out evil person. Like most girls will do that. See most girls don't work it out like you. You are lucky. A lot of girls don't work it out and they are never able to say that and they carry that guilt all their lives. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your mother just over reacted. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can tell you how you can tell these people. They tend to be very controlling, not only of themselves, they deny themselves everything and they become very self sacrificing, saints. And they become very controlling of other people. Particularly people they feel responsible for, like their children. You see, my mother is one of these people. It is amazing. And they get to be really crotchety when they get old. And they have a lot of rules; they have a rule about everything, about what is right and what is wrong or moral. Which includes things like how you dress, how you walk, talk, how you comb your hair etc. Just it becomes such a blanket thing like they have to control everything in order to keep control and keep their hand away from their crotch. Was your mother like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can't honestly say that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should meet my mother. What a number she is. </p>

<p>45:40</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a feeling that my parents never reached the heights of oblivion through sex, I mean ecstasy through sex but I think they are both fairly satisfied with what their sex life is and I think they definitely still have one. But you see, like intellectually I don't want that, because first of all I don't' want, I just don't want to get married for a while and there are a lot of things I want to do. That is why I want to learn to accept my sexuality more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look, if you don't have orgasm while you are having sex over the next four years don't worry about it. That is a very common thing but that will shift I think, it will shift. Well anyhow. Whether you are formally in therapy with me then or not you should get in touch with me and we can talk about whatever those problems are. I am not going to disappear. Even if I am not in New York just call me and we can talk about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Because chances are I won't be in New York forever and neither will you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I feel much better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, I'm glad you told me. See, I'm not going to pull things out of you, that's clear. I'm not sorry I missed it earlier. You obviously weren't ready to tell me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know because that is the one thing that I said I was going to tell my therapist about when I go to therapy. It wasn't so hard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was very good, by the way, some people it takes a years before they can tell their therapist that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, actually I feel like I could tell you anything, really. Like I feel like my problems are coming kind of. You know like, because like I was telling this girl in the hall how I come to hear you speak and I was telling her about the therapy and it was blowing her mind. She said she had been in for three years, and she is a real wreck. And she was saying. "You are only limited to twenty times? You are just going to get started and then what is going to happen when you can't see him any more?" So I clutched and then I realized that has never bothered me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't take three years. It does take it for some people but not with others. I don't know who she is seeing but it shouldn't take her that long. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she's got - she drinks, she's drinks herself into oblivion and she won't go to bed, she sleeps with the light on, doesn't take her clothes off, sleeps in a chair, she is just - Plus she has all these, I don't know I am very afraid of pills and stuff like that, really paranoid if I ever had to start taking them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, don't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she has now these anti depressant things. </p>

<p>50:16</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, don't. Who is she seeing? I know I am poking my nose into other peoples business but, who is she seeing? Somebody named Jones?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, he is downtown, I don't know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Michigan Avenue?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nalander or Nagle; something with an "N". </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Michigan Avenue sound right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And she also couldn't understand how I, she said, "It seems to me that you couldn't possibly have that sort of therapy because the relationship between me and you is important." And she said, "The only way it works is when the therapist becomes completely dehumanized and depersonalized."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is what some people think down there and that is horse shit; that is why it takes four years. Another reason it takes four years is because you get more money if it takes four years. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems to me that it is harder for me to have told you because I care what you think of me than it would be if you were just a blank wall. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't' think so. Would you trust a blank wall?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, as a matter of fact. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would argue that some of the reason that you only need 20 hours is because in order for people to get help they need to get helped by a person otherwise you could do it with a machine. If it was a blank wall kind of thing you could read something or - she is right in one respect she had to be non-evaluative that is if I was a person and I was evaluating you then you couldn't tell me. Okay. How about Thursday; Thursday no good? I'm not coming in Wednesday. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't we make it next Monday? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Same time, same station?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Same time, same station?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have any appointments slips, let me see.</p>

<p>23016 - First Interview</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you afraid that it will be too young by these standards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't know I just feel like I've been talking [inaudible at 00:34].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm actually 28. Does that make you feel any better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that you have on your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, did you see any of the tests that I took? Well, I guess basically it's I feel like I'm in a stalemate and I can't make up my mind for myself. I just can't make any decisions and stick to it, do you know what I mean? I can't seem to move forward. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like you're trapped where you are now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much trapped as that I don't know what to do. I guess the thing is I don't trust myself. I don't feel secure in myself to depend on myself and do what I want. And sometimes I even feel confused about what I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you don't know what you want and sometimes you do, and you can't make yourself do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of times I just find myself over-concentrating and over-thinking about things, do you know what I mean? To the point where it bothers me and I still don't know what good it's done or if there's anything I can do for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you're just sitting around thinking about what you should do next, what you'd like to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know, it applies to my friends and just everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're doing a lot of just thinking over and over again the same things and never getting anywhere on them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, on things that have happened in the past, which I just couldn't bother. You know, it's all over so why bother worrying about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you can't stop thinking about some things that happened. And you start to think about what you're going to do next and ideas about these things just bubble up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It kind of puts a damper on anything that I want to go ahead with, that I could feel good about doing. [03:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like these things in the past make you feel like you can't, you don't have any right to ahead I guess you mean. They depress you, kind of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not so much a right, it's that I don't feel good about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it sort of like you think about the past and you think about things you wish you hadn't done? And then you think well I better not do anything now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not so much that I don't think I should do anything like that, it's okay, I've done this and I even want to move forward now but sometimes I think I should completely start something brand new. Like my friends, you know, just not see them any more and just meet new people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like just make a clean break.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And forget all that stuff and try all over again. Do you want to tell me some of the [inaudible at 04:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're wasting your time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's up to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's been bothering me for a while now. Do you want me to tell you some...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me some of the things that are bothering you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, first of all, I'm a mother. Well, like, with the boy's father for one, I just... I can't... I don't know what to do about that. Well, he's in school in Florida now and when he visits us on vacation I just can't relax and be myself any more with him because of certain things that have happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel when you're with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of times - I cry whenever I talk about it - a lot of times I don't trust him any more, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you're afraid he's going to hurt you. Does he hurt you a lot?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In certain ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like some Kleenex? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Half of me loves him and the other half hates him. I've told him, you know, we've talked about this a few times, but he's the type of person, you know, he doesn't find everything real earth shattering. [06:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you tell him you've there's a big problem and he says, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He'll listen and he'll say he's moved, but nothing is earth shattering to him. He's easy going. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it sort of like sometimes you try to tell him, come on you've got to help me, you've got to do something and he just won't do anything. He just kind of just listens?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes it's like that and then other times he'll say, okay I'll try and then he won't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He kind of makes you feel like you're just not getting through to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, like I'm not progressing or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he used you but you can't [inaudible at 06:57]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he's very set the way he is. I mean a couple of other people have made the comment that he's still doing the same things he was at a couple of years ago. And sometimes I've felt that way, but then again I go over it and I say, maybe it's my fault. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe what's your fault?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's not really that he's where he was at, but I've just stopped. I'm just letting the same old things bother me instead of trying to work it out or find something to do about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really want [inaudible at 07:43]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do but it's just, I keep thinking that he'll change but I guess he won't. That's another thing I've learned lately that people really don't change that much and they are what they are when you first meet them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really tried hard to change the way he was when he was with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I didn't do it at first, you know a deliberate thing, because I thought being with someone you kind of change a little bit. They weren't really bad things that I was trying to help him stop. But he said yeah, yeah, I'll do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you can't make yourself just look at him like he is and feel good about him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's really painful for you now when you... it's too hard to do anything now. If you could just make it work you'd give up almost everything for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing I keep thinking, you know, maybe the things that bother me are not really so bad, I'm just over-emphasizing it all. I mean with other people too. I don't work right now because I'm waiting for my baby to walk, and he's just starting. But I hope to start working this summer for sure. And I think maybe then I'll just get along better and everything because right now I have too much to think about. Not too much to think about, just too much time to think about things. [09:49] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like in a way it really hurts a lot being with him and the hardest part is that you keep blaming yourself for it not working with him. But you keep saying maybe you should change more. It's your fault because you can't find it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he's the type of person that can befriend almost anybody but whether the person stays a friend for a long time that's another story. He never really picked on certain qualities that I had or didn't have but I just felt at certain times that... I didn't feel that I was giving as much of myself to him or just doing things with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it sort of like you couldn't just be yourself with him? Like you were always watching yourself and seeing if you were doing the right thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just a tiny bit in the beginning maybe because I was very shy and he was very outgoing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old were you when you went out with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was 18. He was almost 23. At first I didn't even like him, that was what was so funny. I thought he was funny and he kept coming on asking all these very intense questions and I just started thinking about things and a couple of months later I realized I liked him a lot more than I thought I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you got married very soon?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, we haven't been married. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you live together a long time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We lived together half of the week when we were going to school and then the summer after school we lived together for the summer but that was a disaster. It was just a disaster. [12:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you start to live with him before you liked him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, the year after I knew him, the summer after the year after I met him. I didn't live with him before I knew him. I don't know, maybe it's just looking for someone to live with. I don't think so, because he seemed very nice and honest and everything, but I guess after maybe six months he asked if I wanted to live with him and all this and I said no I didn't for another six months or so. He's a very sincere person but he's also, I don't know, like he's a Don Juan type in a way, do you know what I mean? He likes to flirt with girls and everything. A lot of times he just likes to have a lot of girls around him. The month I met him he had just broken up with some girl, supposedly the only girl in his life he ever really loved. [13:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you include yourself in that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At that time, he says. Now he says, [inaudible at 13:39] but at that time. I met him I guess the day that he had broken up. I just thought he was, like I said, real funny, and to me he was someone special. But after that he kept meeting me in school, not following me all day around, but when we were in a class together or something he'd come and talk to me after class, or we both were interested in the play and he'd sit by me. I don't know, I guess he comes on strong to girls at first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you feel in a way like he really sort of snowed you. You weren't really buying in and he kind of engulfed you until you were in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and he said that he didn't care about anything he was doing and he didn't really care about anyone. All the time that we were dating and everything he always said that he liked me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like in a way [inaudible at 14:55]. Is that what the Don Juan business was? [15:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I think. I think that he dated a lot in high school and in college and everything and I don't think that he's ever really, really cared for very many people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it's really kind of like an ego kind of thing, making friends and not trying to really care about them or be concerned about them. Sort of like, everything's fine, but if you ask him he's not there for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's just very careless about things. I don't think he does as much for any person as the other person does for him. And his friends, I mean, he treats them all rotten too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's really like you keep on putting out in a way. I mean like you pour out all this energy and you don't get anything back. He kind of sits there and takes it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But then again, I think that maybe I'm just making a big thing out of all this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 16:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've lost my sense of perspective with everything that's happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think it might be? If it's not a big thing what kind of a thing is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I just care about people and things too much. I guess maybe I'm extra sensitive and that, like I said I should just get busier, find more things and people that interest me. I'm pretty sure that he's kind of callous towards a lot of people when relationships start getting close. I'm pretty sure that he just wants more of a casual type thing with people or one where he doesn't have to give as much as the other person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard. In a way it's like being put in a position where you keep saying just come and get closer to me and he keeps sort of sitting and saying everything's fine isn't it? He comes but then he doesn't really get with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's kind of the way I feel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then the way you don't trust the way you feel sort of because you're not sure if you're thinking so much maybe there's something wrong and it's really your fault. And it's really hard to decide... like if you could decide if it was his fault then you could get out. Is that what it's like, hung between two things? [18:18]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been thinking about is this one of the relationships that I should just end. It's hard because we have a little baby and everything. I keep thinking should I do that or what. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're feeling really pressed to make a decision. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been thinking about it for a very long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess the hardest part is thinking about it right? It almost feels like if you could just do something, anything would be better than...</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of times, momentarily I'll decide it one way and then I'll stick to it for a day or two and then I just change my mind again or something will happen and I'll go back to thinking the other way. And that's what's kind of frustrating to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he hurt you a lot when you're with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes he did. Like I said, I was very vulnerable, but he doesn't do it now intentionally or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you still hurt when you're with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually not now I don't, but a lot of times before I did. But then I guess I expected more of him than he expected to give of himself. But you know, like one of his friends, a girl he dated, I was friends with her and she said she had the exact same feelings about him. And she said that was one of the reasons she broke up with him. She said, he's just like that. He just doesn't care, or treat a person all that well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If he comes to visit, like, when was the last time you saw him? </p>

<p>PATIENT: At Christmas time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How was that, you know, that you were just sitting around the house and playing with the baby?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We get along basically all right but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you sort of remember the mood, how it felt? </p>

<p>PATIENT: He types, he likes to write and he does a little freelance writing. That part is pretty comfortable, but until I start thinking of everything that's happened in the past... I just can't, it must have really hurt me but it really bothers me. I guess it kind of spoiled my feeling about him. [21:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like if you could forget the past you could accept it the way it is now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or at least I would know how to go about things, you know, just to improve everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it sounds like what you're saying is, I think I could make it work if I could commit myself to it. But like I can't because I keep remembering how much it hurts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't respect him any more hardly at all. I don't trust him too much any more either. This is what's so funny about it now because he'll say things and do things whereas before he never did. It's like I'm waiting for him to pull a switch. I guess he does it because of our little boy Adrian because he loves him and cares about him. So that's another part I can't believe he's doing it for me and Adrian, but basically mainly for Adrian. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I find it hard to believe you can really care about him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not so much care, but be the type of person that I thought he was or he wanted to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which was like when you see him with Adrian he really seems more admirable than he would usually be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 22:50] he can't really be like that. He's just doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just keep wondering about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you really feel manipulated by him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's that type of person. He just manipulates everybody. If he can't manipulate his friends he'll accept them. The few people he can't manipulate, he considers them to be his best friends. The part of him that I trust now is the mother of the baby. When we're together we're doing things that way and he's considering me that way I trust him that way. I guess he considers me a girlfriend or someone he's visiting with or staying with, like that part of me doesn't trust him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What changes? Is it the baby isn't there? You just start thinking in a different way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I start thinking of it differently. You know, he's reacting towards me and not towards the baby.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it any different now when he's alone with you than it was before you had the baby?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess when we talk that way he's there in spirit anyway. It's more like a family type thing when we're together, like say a mother and father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But always in relation to the child, not like a man and a woman together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's that way too, but I don't know, I guess I tend to think that he's the father and I'm the mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that sacred for you? I mean, is it like you wouldn't hurt anything [inaudible at 25:15]</p>

<p>PATIENT: At times like that I don't necessarily want just think like the mother and father type thing. I just want to relate a fella, a girl, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel when you tried that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I go back to feeling that I don't trust him again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he does things... do you think in a way he's trying to keep you away sometimes? [25:54]</p>

<p>PATIENT: From him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he sort of deliberately does things so you don't get too close?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that every once and a while he'll do something to rebel, to show me that I'm not his mother or his wife or something like that. Like if he wants to stay out all night with his friends or with someone else, he'll stay out until five. I don't mind it you know. I don't mind if he does it once in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you think about him now how do you feel about him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I love him, and I'd never make it married to him. I don't really think that he could make it married to anybody right now, or for a long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like the thing you want most but it's hopeless?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I love him but I don't know... I think that I might be happier and just feel better about myself being with someone else after a while. But then again I don't know. You never really know how much you care about a person until after you've broken up and you've lost each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid you might lose the only true love of your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because he's the second boy that I've loved. You know how you feel about your first love, I guess that most people come away with the feeling that it was beautiful and real. Anybody you love after that I guess you're more adaptable. If you break up you know how to get back right away to doing things you were doing before because you're older and had that first love experience. [28:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way this wasn't [inaudible at 28:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never thought it would be. It never started that way and then all of a sudden I found myself, you know, I really like him. That's what's so strange about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like after your first love you never really expected to really commit yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to commit, I wasn't thinking about that at the time, but I didn't think that I would really love anybody as much as I loved that first boy again. It was completely different, the first boy I loved, right away we were attracted to each other. Everything was really great. But with him it just went very slowly, where I wasn't even attracted to his looks. It kind of backfired because I guess he starts off that way with different people, but he asked me, he always threw these questions at me and he'd say, how do you know if you're in love, and things like that. Maybe he was doing it to startle me or to start me thinking about him. I'm basically a very serious type person, and so if somebody asks me a question I guess I think about it. But I remember thinking about him when he said all these things, I thought, how would I feel that way about you? Who do you think you are asking all your darn questions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like when you look at it now you can't figure out how you got to where you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't. It's silly, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you can't remember making a decision like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't know if it was his technique or something but... and then later he told me that he gets people interested in him and he knows that he'll ignore them a while so that the person is kind of wondering, well what's he doing and then person will kind of go after him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it sounds like you can't believe really even the fact that you love him because in a way you're so afraid that he could make you feel anything. He can sort of play with you until he gets you where he wants. [31:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I said, I kind of found myself liking him one day, and then months later loving him. It was just very different from my first love. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you talk about it now am I right in thinking that what you're saying is you're pretty sure you love him but you're feeling funny about that love.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I love him but everything about it's just ... everything that's happened along the way hasn't been nice. It's been kind of been, not soiled, but I don't even know... It's just been very strange. I guess it's kind of a long "by accident" almost. That's another thing that bothers me. Why did I keep liking him and thinking that he would change when it's so bad? Deep down I really think he's a good person. He's very gentle and tender to everybody at times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you figure that's how he really is if you could just bring it out in him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know the other side of him can be really mean and nasty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you've had a belly full of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he's very self-centered and at times he's very selfish. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you a really silly question, if you could imagine not having the child how would you feel about him then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would probably still love him but know things wouldn't get any better, just hang out with different people. And this is another thing, I don't know if I would just tell him to drop dead or just go on being his friend because for instance, a bunch of the people, fellas and girls, well, a lot of the girls that he's dated he's told me ever since high school and everything, I think he hurt just about every girl he's ever gone out with. A great deal of them have told him to get lost or drop dead. [34:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They hurt the way you were hurt do you think? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Without their having any baby, and that's something else, do you know what I mean? As far as the way he treats them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think they were as much wrapped up by him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well as far as I can tell a lot of them were.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get into this kind of position where you just don't know... I mean you're feeling such intense things that you can't...</p>

<p>PATIENT:I guess you basically give him the chance you need to know and after a while each person, each girl supposedly could only take as much as you've taken and she'd tell him one thing or another. And his friends, he's maybe insulted or hurt in some way, I guess he stopped communicating with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you wish you could do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, maybe the supreme thing in doing that would be hurting him back, but I don't like to hurt him. If anything happens to him that hurts him I feel bad for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in a way it's sort of like you've suffered double, like, you get hurt when he hurts you and when it's bad for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but for him I just feel bad, I don't keep remembering it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there any special thing you do, like is there any special [inaudible at 36:06]?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When we were dating he lied about different things, like girls for example. I don't know, the things he would do when he was younger, not that it should matter so much, but he never completely told what happened when he was younger and maybe it would bother him. I just found out a whole lot of things that he did that just kind of turned them off, but still it bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It bothers you in a way that in a way that if he had been straight with you, you wouldn't have gotten into it? [37:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing he's doing now, well not now, but he used to do, he'd manipulate people and cheat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the main hurts were around trust.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I told him, and he gets a kick out of the fact that I told him I never trusted him or respected him. I mean, not until I got to know him better. And he just gets some kind of thrill out of the fact that he's like a rebel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way [inaudible at 37:49]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't even in love at first and he would say things and I thought he was just teasing me or kidding me. I thought the way he said it, it was some kind of joke. He did a lot of acting, he has a good imagination and I thought he was just joking and kidding around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it seems he's proud of the things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He'll say, I'm never going to be tamed by anyone or anything like that. I guess that I'm making him sound real immature, like a jerk, but when he sits down and the other side of him comes out, then I feel proud of him. Maybe it's that I never really knew him, or knew him as he really was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He didn't give you a chance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I guess I didn't know him until it was too late, until I was really liking him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds to me like you're saying [inaudible at 39:42]</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is kind of stupid in a way, but if there were just a few things he would change he would be an almost ideal person, or someone that I would really like. This is another thing right now that [inaudible at 40:03] and what type of person I really do like. I don't know, maybe I feel the need to be put in certain types of categories.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like if you could just be what he was an example of you could think about it clearly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Since I've met him I know I've changed a lot too but I don't want to put a person in a category. I find myself needing to be in one to know where I really am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 40:57] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't know how he needed to change. You can do certain things but if it's not the way you really feel or you really are, then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that makes it harder for you to be who you are. Maybe it's like sometimes when you look at who you are you think well that side of me could never really live with him for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I wonder if he made me feel bad or inadequate or lacking as a person because he's done so many things. He's got to have so many people around him sometimes he makes me feel I'm not doing everything I can. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like [inaudible at 42:14]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if you were there for him more that he wouldn't need all this other stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then he'll say, don't smother me like you're my wife or my mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you supposed to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it doesn't give me any right to ask him what he's doing or where he's going. He's always done this to me, you know, like if I want to talk about something that relates to me. I'm not really that self-centered, although he makes me feel like I am. He'll say, we'll talk about it later. He'll never help me, not giving me the answer, but help me come to a decision about certain things. [43:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You try to get close around him and there's [inaudible at 43:41]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is that when it relates to him I guess he's got to work it out right now. Like he'll ask me a question about him and he'll say, he writes poetry and one-act plays, and he'll have to know right away if people react to his play and to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 44:27]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, he likes to have an honest answer but he wants to be talked about and you have to concentrate on him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he knows like you have to be equal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I never really get to talk about something that's really bothering me and something that we could work out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must make it hard to feel you can ever work it out. You must feel sometimes like</p>

<p>[inaudible at 45:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, when I tell him something and talk to him he's not really fully concentrating and he's not really there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to imagine being in that kind of relationship. It seems like you're being rejected all the time. You're never really important enough and pressing enough and whatever it is you want just doesn't matter. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It will make me think he's doing me a big favor. With our baby, one day he had to go downtown and pick something up for Adrian. And he said can't we tell him that I'll go tomorrow? And I guess I did something really sneaky and I said, well if you're not concerned hw your baby's going to be taken care of. He said, okay I'll go today and he got up and he went without any problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel then? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I laughed at myself because I knew he'd go. But I was happy that he was concerned about Adrian.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then uncomfortable that you [inaudible at 47:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I wasn't uncomfortable. It was sneaky but I guess I knew how I could get him to do things for Adrian. But I haven't done it again. I didn't have to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: As we're going along I think about the nice things that he's done I feel better about him. Right now I consider him my best friend. I just keep thinking that sometimes I don't really know him. He'll go back to the way I thought he was, but he keeps telling me now that he's more secure about himself and that he's less likely to do anything nasty now than he's ever been. And it's because of Adrian I know. Or maybe because things have changed, you know, I'm the mother of Adrian.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 48:52]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I guess I know in my mind [inaudible at 49:02]. We had a social worker for nine months right before Adrian was born. She just said, as a father he'll probably be pretty good. He's just that type of person who's interested in the baby and can do all these things. But he said anyone that would marry him it would be a complete disaster because of the way he is, because he likes to run around and he doesn't like to commit himself to a person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you talked to him about that again? </p>

<p>PATIENT: He asked me three times right before Adrian was born and I wouldn't because I knew what would happen. Then once he said if we had married, and he said when I go to school you can still date if you want. That didn't make me feel too good. I think I thought it was kind of a joke in a way to protect Adrian and everything. [50:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 50:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it was a lot of pressure from relatives and everything to get married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 50:51]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think things are in a way they're smoother all alone then anybody thought they would be, but then again this is in my mind. Sometimes I don't really know how he feels and I guess it's also in my mind that maybe he's just going along with the whole thing because of the baby and he just doesn't want to be involved. Although he says this summer he's going to... he's moving back to New York for the summer and he'll work up here and support Adrian and I. He said so. And he said that he wanted to support us and take care of us so he could have a hand in raising Adrian. And he didn't want to be sly or tricky about it. I don't know if I want to be around him every day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like he does really care about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, after everything that's happened with, I think it's odd.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's inconsistent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the past he'd say, I really care about you, I love you, but he'd still say every once in a while, I want to date somebody else. If you'd been honest about it, or said openly I would have been hurt or mad, but he never said let's date other people or anything. He'd always makes excuses or tell me later. And then he said he never really cared about the birth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the main thing that he be honest with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's one of the things. He said to me, we're still lying to each other. I said, no we're not; you're still lying to me. I've hardly ever lied to him, maybe once or twice a little fib, but I've never lied to him about these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, I hear you saying, I could accept the way he is, I could even maybe love those sort of odd things about him if he would just share.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. And he's also the type of person that will do something and before it's even over it's probably forgotten and he's going on to something else. And I guess I really don't know what's near and dear to him any more about anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way that's like saying, I just can't believe anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what he is any more. [54:36]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he gives you lots of stuff and he says a lot of other things. In a way it's sounds like there's always some excuse that I just can't see you any more because I get all ecstatic every time I think about him. If I could just look once, clearly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like a lot of people, friends of both of us, say he's just a jerk and, you know, forget it. I mean as far as everything that's happened with us, you know, forget it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like he's trying to forget it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when I do things that I told you, when I try to push him out of my mind, because it happens so much now that I just can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess sometimes he remembers the times when you were mean to him and you remember that he said [inaudible at 56:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I said, I don't even know like his apologies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way [inaudible at 56:36]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like even questioning the person, what they say or what they do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's really hard to believe that it means anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he supposedly loved me first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mainly do during the day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like to play with my little boy and now I'm busy with [inaudible at 57:26] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do with yourself during the day? Are you happy when you're with Adrian?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, he's a fantastic little guy. When he takes a nap I read try to write. I used to write a lot in high school and in college. I'm trying to do that again because I'd like to do something in Literature. I worked for the American College Society [inaudible at 58:07] and I definitely like writing. I think that was one of the things that attracted me to Robert because we both like writing. That's kind of been a mutual. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you resent him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 58:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have parents in New York?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they're in Ithaca.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they get along real well with Adrian and I have a sister who is about three blocks from me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She helps you out sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they're watching him right now. My father hates Robert and won't talk about him. He's made friends with my sisters and my mum, but my father no way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like that's unfair?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Ever since I got pregnant he's just been... I guess basically he's been honest but he's also done it in poor taste. My father just was turned off by him and doesn't want to deal with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 59:41]</p>

<p>PATIENT: He doesn't know that [inaudible at 59:46]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your mother does know him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At first she did but I don't know how she feels right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't seem much pressured by them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. We've got four girls in our family. He's been getting it from all sides so he'll say things every once in a while but he wouldn't pressure me. [60:16]</p>

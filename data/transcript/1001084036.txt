<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how you been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I've been all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I've been really good for the last month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The [DATE] it'll be a year and it's really been the best year of my life.   Even though that started.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A year since?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Since we started seeing each other.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I see, uh-huh.  So, overall, it's been a good month, then.  No major crises?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, this month I kinda regressed a bit because, I don't know, I was thinking I was feeling really good.  Remember I told you I went skydive, I was gonna go skydiving for my birthday.  I did that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You did?  Oh my, how was it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was amazing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I can only imagine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was just amazing.  So, I was doing some stuff for myself.  I took my son with me, but he was to young to go.  [INAUDIBLE], but teenagers need help, right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, they do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's doing really well in school and stuff because he's playing football.  Put him in first string and got a call from another coach that he's done camps with and watched him and asked me if, um, I would allow him to do his camps with him through the summer, it was through the [INAUDIBLE] and he'd knock off, um, he'd knock off 60 percent and just have him be his assistant.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Basically so we could see, like, the different positions.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because he doesn't think that they have [NAME OTHER] in the right positions.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's he playing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He plays, secial teams, he plays both ways, but he has defense and then he plays corner or safety.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Depending, uh, yknow, what's going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what grade's he in?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seventh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, it's pad and he likes it and he has a good base of friends, yknow, since he went to California and I sent him to the youth camp so most of the kids that have been coming over are a real, really good influence, I believe.  I mean, he still talks back to me, but I'm his mom and that's just gonna happen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, yknow, I, I was feelin' kinda bad, he was making me feel real bad about the weekends because I get busy on the weekends, but I'm trying to do special things and stuff and he's always got everything that he needs and I cook for his friends, his buddies that hang out with him, too, because at this age, they can, like [NAME OTHER] is 15, I mean, at this age, they can stay at home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I make sure, yknow, he called me a preppy mom because all of his friends are like yknow, I make cookies and I said that's not a bad thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he thought he hurt my feelings by saying that, but he, for some reason thought that he was and I was like, if that's the worst thing you're gonna say to me that doesn't hurt my feelings.  Anyway, I was feeling really good, fairly good, really good, kinda tired, but as long as I got everything done [INAUDIBLE], I felt like I was accomplishing a lot and sat down and all that.  My folks still haven't come back from California and I do believe that is kind of a relief for me, because she's with my brother [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] hasn't called.  Remember when [NAME OTHER] called me about the car and all that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] hasn't called me about that.  I talked to him, but he hasn't called me about that.  And, so, I started thinking well, I'm feeling good, it's been a year almost, yknow, and we talked about the Klonopin so I thought, okay, I'm gonna see [NAME OTHER], so let's do 2 today and it was fine, yknow, it was fine.  Things did bother me, 'cause I'm used to the schedule, and my body's used to the medication I guess.  So, then the next day, um, I've always taken, I always take the Zoloft, that's the 1 thing I always take.  I make sure not to because that's what's helping me, my brain, 'cause boy does it take off in different directions.  So, I'm, the next day, I ended up taking none because - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No Klonopin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, none.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't take any.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did that go?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's pretty fast [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not well, at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that day went okay, but I was very stressed.  I felt, I had some really ugly thoughts and, yknow, and but I didn't get home until after [NAME OTHER]'s football game so once I did his homework and got him in bed, I just took what I take at night and went to sleep.  Then, the next morning, I had forgotten to take the Klonopin, I was gonna start the Klonopin again, but I forgot to put it in my purse so the other thing that happens when I don't take it, I'm like, plus, I'm like forgetting things, like where's my phone, where's my, yknow what I mean?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, that day, I worked really hard, I got, picked him up at 4:30 after practice, I finally got home and, uh, I mean, it was still hot.  I just changed into, yknow, shorts and, and comfortable clothing and I was making dinner and my son, for his birthday, which is 5 days before mine, had gotten a BB gun, um, just a little Red Robin little old fashioned like [NAME OTHER] has, because they had been shooting at the ranch, he had been doing all these things during the summer, yknow, driving, doing all these things.  And so, I live in a little townhome and there is a townhome association, I've never broken any rules, I've never been late, I've never, I really comply because as long as they leave me, I really like my house.  It's a sanctuary.  I've got it for me.  I've got it the way I like it.  And the garage, I gave to [NAME OTHER], so he put all the noisy stuff out there which is great for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I can go in my room and watch a DVD if I want, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the boys, whoever's over at the time, can play, yknow, um, and they banged on my door and [NAME OTHER], I had set up a target because I didn't want him to get in trouble, I set up a target inside the garage, which is now his, yknow, there's drums in there, there's a little ping pong table, little, yknow, little stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I knew winter was coming so we're trying to, so they still have a place to go and all that, I put down old rugs and stuff yknow, because boys don't care.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, I had set it up.  I was a Correction Officer for 5 years.  I'm certified on all different weapons.  My boy knows how to respect a gun, he also knows how to shoot.  He's good at it.  He's got a good eye.  And, um, it's a BB gun for heaven sakes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay?  So, I set up this little tower and then I put the Coke cans on top of it and I said why don't I make dinner, you go ahead and practice, yknow, and just keep resetting the Coke cans and just shoot into the garage.  But he was standing in my driveway and is shooting into my garage.  I hear this bang, bang, bang.  I open the door and it was [NAME OTHER] a man that lives there, and he's always walking around with a clipboard.  Because it was a community home before they left people in, but I've been there almost 5 years.  And then tend to keep the kids at my end on the circle part, yknow?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is fine.  I love children.  His granddaughter comes over when she's there.  And I said hi, [NAME OTHER].  What's the problem?  'Cause he had [NAME OTHER] in tow, which all of a sudden I knew I was not, I knew this was not gonna go well.  And this is, I had no Klonopin in my system at all.  I have nothing in my system, except for the Zoloft.  And, I um, he started to tell me about my boy and how unsupervised, and make a list of things and was going over things and I was like I'm gonna stop you right there.  I'm the 1 that set it up in the garage.  He's shooting it my garage.  You have no business, there's nothing in the by laws that state, yknow, he cannot have a BB gun and shoot on his own property.  There, there's nothing.  I ready the by laws over and over again.  I'm a legal secretary.  I said I also read, even if I still have my personal weapon, you can't do anything about that either, that's unconstitutional.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Leave my son alone.  He's not bothering anybody.  You guys' kids come to my house.  I don't let him go anywhere else because I don't want him in trouble.  He gets his feelings hurt still.  And so, I said a couple of mean things, he was fired up at me, starts writing up, telling me the driveway is not mine, the lawn is not mine, just the house is mine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, geez.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He saw [NAME OTHER] over at the church on his bike which the kids ride their bike over at the church 'cause there's - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They won't have to ask [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's nobody there, yknow, and I said anyway, it ended up being, I didn't swear or anything, but I did, I felt it, I felt it all coming and I told him, I said something mean to him, I said it would really be nice if we had somebody doing this that wasn't so old they don't remember having kids and that was mean.  And whatever, so he gets furious and says, I have a rose bush in front of my house.  It only blooms twice a summer, it's beautiful.  My dad planted it because the shrub there had died.  He wrote me up for that.  He wrote me up</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Having a rose bush?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Having a rose bush.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's wrong with having a rose bush?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's outside of the little patio area.  See, he's saying that my driveway and my walkway are not actually mine.  Now, when I had the house appraised, it went from sidewalk to street.  And so, I - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is getting ridiculous.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like a 2 year old, well, so was I, like a 2 year old, he goes you're getting a letter, [NAME OTHER]'s writing you up, 'cause he's a management guy, and he's the one that actually is the property manager.  And, like a 2 year old, he goes I'm calling him right now, you're getting a letter, and he's yellin' at me walking down the street.  The neighbors are outside and I, like a 2 year old, said I bet I'll call him first.  So, I grabbed my phone and I called [NAME OTHER].  And I told him, I said a number of things, quickly, and in anger and I said save your paper [NAME OTHER], I really save your paper.  If you're telling me the driveway isn't mine and stuff, then fix my roof, because the next person that slides on ice, I'm having them sue you.  I'm not gonna pay for it because my roof leaks.  See, I don't complain about things.  I just fix them.  Because it's my house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anyway.  I totally lost it, it was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, did he send you a letter?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he actually came to my house and we had a meeting.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  And backed down?  'Cause they were just being ridiculous it sounds like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not [NAME OTHER], he refuses to come to my house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  You're mean.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow what, he's not even an employee of [NAME OTHER]'s.  He's a guy that lives there with a clipboard that helps out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's on a power trip.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he said that he would talk to him because nobody says [NAME OTHER]'s gonna send me a letter but [NAME OTHER].  [NAME OTHER] said [NAME OTHER] would call me directly.  [NAME OTHER] offered me a job years ago.  He wanted me to do all the complexes, the common areas.  I had my grandmother's memorial there.  I mean, so any way, that was a long story, but that was, it wrecked me, though.  It absolutely wrecked me.  And I fed [NAME OTHER] and put him to bed.  I could not sleep and I, it, it's still eating at me, yknow.  And I did start taking the Klonopin again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, uh, but then I started having really awful thoughts.  Maybe I am an awful mom.  Yknow, maybe I, yknow, I don't join in the gossip and things with the women so the women don't really speak to me there, which is fine.  I'm in my house.  I don't wanna participate in the gossip thing.  I don't wanna, I mean, if you walk into my home, it's very welcoming, peaceful, but I do have religious, yknow, things.  You still know that I'm God.  Yknow, things like that, little decorations on my wall and stuff, and, and, um, I think that gossip is very hurtful.  I know no sin is worse than the other, but I think it's very hurtful so I refuse to participate.  So, yknow, when [NAME OTHER]'s yelling that down the street, too, no wonder none of these women want you around, or include you in their things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Geez.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm like I don't wanna, and why am I explaining to this crazy man?  Number one, why?  See, I lost all my tools.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you just got drawn in, yeah, you got sucked in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I lost all my tools.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It happens sometimes in the heat of a moment, but, like you said, you didn't have the Klonopin at that moment.  Just, yknow, if in the future, if you ever decide you want to go off of it again, that's okay with me, but we have to go real slowly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just so it doesn't uh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, no, I felt it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I understand that.  I thought [NAME OTHER] was gonna call you.  I said oh, I'll tell him [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said I'll tell him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I did.  But, um</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, are you sleeping better now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm starting to get back into, my body's starting to adjust well again.  Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, the only reason why I'm tired this morning is because I worked a lot last night.  I only got a couple of hours of sleep, but that's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Have you been eating okay?  Is your appetite normal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am not hungry at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Decreased, okay.  Um, and except how you worked so hard and gotten so little sleep, is your energy level okay generally, or are you tired?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.  I'm feeling, I don't want to make it out to sound like I'm not feeling good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am feeling good.  I can do my job and all of that.  Yes, this morning I'm tired, but I had to [INAUDIBLE] early.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you had a short night.  And are you concentrating, focusing pretty well most of the time then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, like today, I was doing my paperwork.  I'm less on task, it's just the couple days I didn't take any of the Klonopin I was scattered.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, last night, I was mixing drinks and I know I'm not all the way back because I never have people repeat things to me, yknow, um, I don't drink at all.  We've already talked about that, but I was mixing up people's drink orders and I was just tired.  But that's just too long of a day for a 35 year old woman.  I mean, I have a very physical job, both of them, lifting and, yknow.  I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What about, have you had excessive worry recently?  Have you been worrying more than usual about things?  Or not really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Only for like the last week, like I said, I feel like I've really regressed and too, the insurance money ran out.  But I paid, I think I've paid everybody up.  I've paid the full amount to you until I get another bill and then it's [NAME OTHER] and I have to pay her.  She doesn't need this, but I just pay her now.  Um, apparently, uh, Blue Cross Blue Shield, [NAME OTHER] in [INAUDIBLE] tried to cut back police officers, fire personnel and corrections, they tried to cut out benefits.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just medical.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And apparently, somehow he managed to get that through on another bill.  There is a class action suit, but I'm not involved in it.  I don't wanna be.  I'd rather work and pay, honestly.  Um, the only reason why I know is because some people contacted me, yknow, some police officers I know in [INAUDIBLE] and stuff and I said well, I can't do another, I can't do another trial thing.  That would just put me over the top.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, more stress.  What about, when you're doing things with like [NAME OTHER], like going to his football game, do you enjoy yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I love my son.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know you do.  And are you having any side effects from any of the medications at this point, that you can tell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> None that I can tell.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  Yeah, sounds like you're doing pretty well.  It sounds like there was this 1 incident which the timing just was awful, unfortunately.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that was a bad day.  I can't, see, that's what bothers me, though.  Why can't I realize when it's just a bad day or when it's a catastrophe?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Well, and that was probably compounded by a couple of things.  It sounds like he was out of control, [NAME OTHER] was, and then you didn't have your medication in your system so it was kind of a double barrel whammy there, but, uh, hopefully you'll kinda rebound, the medicine will get back in your system, you'll start feeling better, back to your regular sleep cycle, that'll help.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And this guy hopefully will leave you alone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think he will.  Because I mean, I was very pleasant.  I'll talk to anybody if they don't come at me a certain way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, don't attack you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Especially with my boy.  And I think that's why I've been having such a good month.  My mom and those guys aren't here.  Nobody's telling me I'm doing anything wrong.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow.  [NAME OTHER]'s very supportive.  The people that I've met around her office that have become my friends, um, are very supportive.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They talk about how well adjusted [NAME OTHER] is.  He's only mean to me, which is fine, because that happens.  I understand that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's a teenager.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And he always says he's sorry and he always, yknow, he's just, I love him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Dearly.  It's not him.  I think that is part of it.  What I finally felt safe, which I was being a little paranoid, I finally felt safe at home, I found myself worrying more and more about him for some reason, well, kids are breaking their arms left and right.  Yknow, but you're not allowed to say anything.  Mom.  I mean, he can take a hit, but I know he's hurt.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But no way.  He won't even take the Motrin.  Yknow, kid's Motrin.  No.  I mean I know it's bad if he asks me for an Epsom salt bath.  That's the only way I really know, and if I see the bruises.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah it's</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He has this real macho attitude all of a sudden like I'm not gonna tell you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's a teenage boy, yeah.  That's the way they go.  They just wanna tough it out.  Well, you sound like overall, I think you're doing well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you're doing real well.  I'm not worried about this tiff you've had.  I think it's understandable and explainable, given the circumstances, I think you'll pull out of it, be just fine.  I don't think we need to change medication. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you're okay with it, you're back on the regular 3 Klonopin again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And again, if you decide you wanna cut back, I'm not opposed to it.  I think we'll have to go real slowly, though.  Like probably as slowly as like a half a tablet per week or slower.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe even slower.  Some people, they'll even do half a tablet every 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just to kinda get their body adjusted to the lower dose.  But let's let you get kinda stabilized first and then decide if you wanna do that.  Does that sound okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, because it's better to go slow than fast with medicines because if you go too fast you can kinda get rebound symptoms, too, on top of not having the benefits of the medicines.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  And [NAME OTHER] did say, too, around like certain anniversary dates.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like the fight, one of the aspects that triggered what happened, or what I was my responsibility, was the fight between my sister and my mom and my family, the physical fight we had.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that was the end of August.  They didn't come to [NAME OTHER]'s birthday and then the 15th was when I hit the hospital and that's after [NAME OTHER] said especially around times like that, you need not to do any drastic changes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  That makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She told me that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She said just don't.  Just call me if you need me.  Don't, yknow, but all in all, I've had a, maybe a bad start, I'm using September, instead of January, as the year, but I've had a very good year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm more myself than I have been in years.  I really do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, with a situation like that, anybody's gonna be upset by it.  I'd be upset if somebody comes up pounding on my door with 1 of my kids and starts hollering at me.  Yknow, that would really get my blood boiling, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To anybody, it's gonna be upsetting so I don't think what you did was unreasonable or out of the ordinary.  It was just a very difficult, stressful situation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I responded and there were neighbors out and I was like do you think you're gonna intimidate me?  It has my mother all over the place.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yknow we don't always respond perfectly in situations like that.  We respond out of reflex almost, to protect ourselves because we feel threatened.  But you handled yourself okay.  I mean, you didn't punch him in the nose, you didn't, yknow, do anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't swear at him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you didn't do anything that would come back to hurt you or haunt you so, I mean, you just responded the best you could to try to protect yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I did apologize to [NAME OTHER] when he called me.  I said first, let me apologize because I was reacting to a situation.  He goes, I could hear the frustration in your voice and I know, so let's talk about it and so he came over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He seems pretty reasonable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I gave him cookies and coffee and, yeah, he does.  He's gonna let a couple things slide.  He does say that technically the driveway and the side, that little tiny sidewalk and the driveway, are not mine, but they're for my sole use.  Which doesn't really make sense to me because it's included in the appraisal.  But I'm gonna let it go because the by laws were really sketchy and he told me that.  He goes they're really sketchy and it depends on if you're trying to sell or if you're trying to buy, there's like little clauses in there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So can [NAME OTHER], did he say can [NAME OTHER] use the BB gun?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely in my garage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the garage.  So he just has to stay in the garage, not on the driveway.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  And he has to stay off church property, but I say I'd tell all the kids that they can't ride because they ride through it to get to the field.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's telling the kids they can't ride their bikes through the church parking lot even?  That's crazy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That is crazy, but see, he works.  He volunteers at the church, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That has nothing to do with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But [NAME OTHER] said he would speak to him about that, because that's ridiculous.  If the church has a problem, they can tell me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anybody can call me at any time.  I have all my numbers on my machine.  I know I'm not home often, but I'm reachable.  At any time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, nah, it sounds like you're doin' fine.  It's sounds like people around you have gotten all worked up, but presently you're doing great.  Yeah, so let's just leave the medicines the way they are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Check back in a month or 2, whenever you want.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just make sure things are still going well.  Does that sound good to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that sounds fine.  I think I am on my last refill</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Whenever you need more, let's see, now are you doing mail order?  No, you're getting it [INAUDIBLE] came to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I came to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, whenever you need more, they'll just call me and I'll be glad to okay them.  So, let's see you wanna check back in a month?  2 months?  What do you feel comfortable with?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the only reason why, and I say, I'm a little unsteady now, so I wanna say a month, but I also wanna make it through so that you start getting, I mean, you'll be paid, everything already will be paid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm not worried about that.  I'm not worried about that.  Let's do whatever works best for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, a month would be, would not work for us actually.  Either one of us because that is a Saturday.  So, if you look at the month of Monday, the 12th.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of November?  The week of November 12th ?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  The week.  I said month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's okay.  So, the week of Novemver 12th,  um -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And whatever date, because we do it early enough that I can still get to work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You'll do 8 o'clock again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That week, I have an 8 o'clock on, let me check this.  I don't have any 8 o'clocks.  You can have either 7:30 or 8:30.  Would either of those work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Eight thirty would work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've got 8:30 Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, can we do Tuesday, the 13th.  Because Monday I know I work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Monday th2 12th  8:30.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want a card also then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I lose this stuff, I'll just have to call everybody I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, I know, that's something I worry about, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My brother gave me a new Day planner, a little bit larger than this 1, for um, he thought this was funny, in 1 of my favorite colors, and I said oh, thank you [NAME OTHER], for 2008.  And he goes well, open it before you thank me.  He already has me written and already started me in 2008.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, my goodness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Covering for him, but I'm like oh, ha ha, funny.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good joke.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah.  All right, take care of yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, thank you, you, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you need anything before hand, just give me a call okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  All rightie.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  See you later.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, bye bye.</p>

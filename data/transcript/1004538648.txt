<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That painting is gone. [It was leaning against the wall.] Anyway, I'm going to go to Virginia this week and stay for the summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whose idea was it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mutually. It's a mutual decision.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. It got made kind of quickly, even though I think it's still mutual, because we had a fight where I was very loud, and if I leave then Michael probably won't get kicked out [of our living arrangement].</p>

<p>[01:11.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And that's one reason she went on about, where she was really physically abusive. Like really physically abusive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't hear the first part. This last time?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, like on whatever day it was, she was hitting me like relentlessly and repeatedly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Pause) Well, obviously I was angry. I don't know. I have a problem with hitting. (pause) Just out of frustration, I guess.</p>

<p>[02:15.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I've just been in tears multiple times a day for two weeks or something. I just can't continue to do this. And I guess it's an unpleasant conversation when I want to bring things up, and you've seen me be verbally aggressive, even in this room, which is supposed to be a really safe place. So you can only imagine when we're outside this room, and it's just the two of us, how we're really abusive. I don't know what the word is exactly. But I was talking to my sister and talking to Timothy, my counselor, and other people to know there's nothing — nothing I — there's just nothing I could have possibly done to justify being hit.</p>

<p>[03:16.2]</p>

<p>And it's really hard for me to say, because I always look to myself. I feel like I'm self-reflective. I know Jessica isn't, but — I know Jessica is self-reflective, but maybe in ways that are different than mine. Or I feel like she's caught in a catch-22 which I feel horrible about, where I'm like she couldn't possibly feel remorseful enough about her behavior for me to expect for it to change. The reason why is because she [isn't] the kind of person who would hit someone she's supposed to love anyway. Which is a shitty catch-22 for her to be in, especially when I'm the judge and the jury on the situation and it's not fair.</p>

<p>[04:13.9]</p>

<p>But then there are times where it's all — her coping mechanism for a lot of stuff is to get defensive and then to get angry, and the offshoot of that is, you know. I did this thing where — it's almost sexist because I project the idea of if this were a — first of all, that we sort of have this gender role reversal, traditional gender roles like husband cheats on wife, husband beats wife kind of thing. And it's bullshit because we're here, this is our relationship, Jessica and Michael relationship, so I don't know why I have to make that projection. But I can't help but reflect on the idea that if she were a man, she'd be in jail. And if I were a woman, the way she lays in on me, I might very well be in the hospital. (pause) I just can't continue doing this. (pause) I just hurt too much.</p>

<p>[05:39.7]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He also had his addiction doctor tell him that the reason I cheated was because I have low self-esteem, so I just needed someone to tell me I was beautiful or whatever. I don't know if that's true or not.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This Dr. Patton, she maybe oversteps her bounds a little bit by making — positing assertions about things [that hurt]. Then again, she is from the 12 Steps. She pulls out her big book and it's like "Number four, let go of your resentments" and everything. Like "You're driving me crazy and are prone to relapse, Michael, unless you've learned to reaBeckae that your wife's infidelity had nothing to do with you." Like "Let go of the anger towards this person and towards your wife for this, and it's not your fault."</p>

<p>[06:46.2]</p>

<p>And it's really hard for me because I'm inclined to look to myself as being the positive — I mean, like my parents' divorce, for example. And I think it's safe to say that, maybe not right now after some reflection, but you have so much resentment for that particular Dr. Patton that you think she's full of it or something.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. I just don't like the way that she claims to know me. I met her for 10 minutes and she said something about me, but because it was Michael's doctor and I didn't know if I should tell her that he'd been doing — I don't know. She asked if you were doing well, and I was like "Yeah, okay, he is" but I wasn't going to mention "Oh, we did LSD." Even if you mentioned it to her, I didn't know.</p>

<p>[07:41.9]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right, no, maybe you shouldn't have been at that meeting is the other thing.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well she asked me those questions when you were in the bathroom. I don't know. So she didn't like me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is maybe — like, when you were really pissed off, she threatened to e-mail you and cancel this session for today. You know, for today, with you right now. And it was like some therapy stuff wasn't doing anything, and all this other stuff. You were mad —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, it was because my dad cancelled his credit card because there were charges on it, and he couldn't get in touch with me and he didn't reaBeckae it. So he'll have a new card number today that I can give you. That's the other thing, it was just an issue [with cost], like —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, there's a bunch of different things going on. But —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I missed the piece, the issue with the cost for whom?</p>

<p>[08:39.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, some of the charges that were on my dad's card were from me seeing Becka May [ph] because it was three sessions at once, and he just didn't know what it was. It seemed like somebody was running wild with it. (chuckles) That's why he cancelled it. And he had also mentioned when I talked to him on the phone about the charges, he's like "And how much longer do you think you're going to be doing that?" I was like, I just said like a month or something, and he said "Eventually I want you to be paying for it." So that's also why I was [inclined to just quit].</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. But I told her she'd better not cancel our appointment with you here today, because I was like "If you're not going to go, I am." It's too important.</p>

<p>[09:35.1]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But hopefully our lives will improve because when I leave, I'm going to write a note to all his friends that don't talk to us anymore, to just tell them I was the one who wasn't willing to get arrested, not Michael, so maybe they won't hate him. I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She doesn't know about any of that situation really. You didn't know about the drug bust thing that happened last year. You don't know about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't. I know you got arrested for disorderly conduct.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, that was different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're separate. Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I'll try to make it quick.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Can I make it quick?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. The reason why I didn't want to get arrested is because I had that arrest and I wouldn't be able to get it expunged —</p>

<p>[10:24.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's really long and Lorioying. Okay, so around Thanksgiving, my folks cut us off for money. We didn't have enough money to make ends meet. So we received packages for our friend Drew [ph] who deals pot in the area from out West. The package got intercepted. The place where we work, where it was being sent, got swarmed by like 12 different plainclothes law enforcement officials, DEA all the way down to the state police. In the course of what happened in the next hours, so basically we ratted out the guy who we were bringing it to. We were allowed to leave on our own recognizance. We didn't get arrested and we were fine because they want the bigger fish. It sucks. We lost pretty much three-quarters of our friends in the process because they were all "You [fished] out a friend of ours" when we really should have taken more responsibility for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't think we should have. Because it was like 10 pounds and your bond would be like $50,000. And if we're both in jail, who's going to —</p>

<p>[11:36.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's what the cops say. I really don't want to spend time in this session hashing over this thing. Suffice to say, Jessica lost her mom and then we lost 75 percent, if not more, of our friends in the area, our support group. And then I lost my mom.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And nobody really even —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Nobody gave a shit about it. And then I find out a few months later that she'd been cheating on me for years. I've had a bad year.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I just want to explain to those people that, for one thing, whatever Joshua says about Michael, his opinion is biased, for sure.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It just comes down to the fact that I —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He's the one that's bad-mouthing Michael.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Write the letter if you want to. Whatever. I don't know if we need to get into that right now, unless you really want to.</p>

<p>[12:31.6]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I've said what I need to say. I just wanted to mention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Michael, are you plLoriing on going to the camp? What do you think?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. It's moved forward, but I'm going up to Vermont at some point in the next couple of weekends. In the next couple of weeks. And I have an appointment with the director of the camp. This guy I've known since I was — how old are people in seventh grade, 15, 16?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, they're not that old.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they're like 12 or 13.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I turned 15 in ninth grade.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Then tenth or eleventh grade. I've known him for a long time, half my life more or less. He's going to get me a position. It will work out fine and finally everyone in my family is onboard with it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It starts at the end of June.</p>

<p>[13:19.8]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It starts at the end of June. I'm going to go up to Vermont and repaint my dad's house for him, to get enough money to survive. Then Jessica is going to Virginia and going to live with her dad and look for work. We're not divorcing. It's a separation. Are there options to continue sessions with you even though someone isn't local? How does that work?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You could have personal (inaudible at 13:55.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, there are two different things I've been thinking about. The first and foremost is that I'm going to be geographically close to this office. So I ostensibly could be here. Jessica is going to be in Virginia, so it's a little less convenient to get up here. And Jessica could, either via phone line or via Skype, be here with us. However, I take that with a grain of salt because I don't know if it's necessarily an even playing field.</p>

<p>[14:31.2]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's not like we're competing.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's not like we're competing. I'm just trying to say that it may make me feel like it's not — the most important thing about this context is that you're here, I'm here, you're here. And I don't want, just because I'm sitting in this chair and Jessica is at a computer right there or something, having it be not that equal space.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not really in real-time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Another option is that you meet with us and we're both on a Skype connection (chuckles), even though I'm in Vermont and she's in Virginia. Or we could both just call in and have a conference call with you. Although we'd need to figure out a way to do so in which we're not all talking all over each other, because we don't have all the cues of body language and stuff to know that I'm not —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: There's a delay in Skype. I almost feel like the phone would be easier.</p>

<p>[15:32.7]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not anymore really, if you have a good connection.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, if you have a good connection, everything would be just fine [which is along the way, I don't doubt it]. The fact is, you could do a split screen on that thing right now and you have Michael here and Jessica here and vice versa. (pause) While we're separated, I anticipate on not seeing anyone else. I hope Jessica feels the same way. The goal of it is not necessarily — and this is just how I see it — the goal of separation is not necessarily in August, Michael is done with camp and we get back together again. You know, that's not the goal.</p>

<p>[16:30.2]</p>

<p>But if having that serenity time away from each other in which we can reflect on — right now it's just the bad stuff. Life is hard and it's so fresh and it's just the bad stuff. Why would you want to be living and sharing a life with someone when it's all the bad stuff?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it's just because we're used to it or something.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. I mean, there's the whole thing where you've known about the infidelity for years. I've known about it for what, like almost eight weeks now? Or however long it has been. It's really fresh for me. It's that time apart might be good. But I don't want to — (pause) It may work out that, upon reflection, it's like "No, this [isn't something], I need to move on." But I'm not going to get to the place where I'm either going to be able to approach, or rather, re-approach this marriage on a level that both she and I deserve without that kind of space.</p>

<p>[17:52.3]</p>

<p>Nor am I going to be able to come to a conclusion I'm personally fulfilled and satisfied, that it's the right decision that we do get divorced, unless I'm given the opportunity to be separate for a little while. So what's goal? The goal is affording ourselves the opportunity to have clarity, I think. That's just how I see it in a nutshell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like a good goal.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It sounds good to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jessica, why (inaudible)?</p>

<p>[18:42.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think it was just some kind of kind of — I mean, if he's upset and crying, I'm not going to be frustrated. I'll try to comfort him. But I think it's just, you know, repetition. I mean, obviously there are still problems that exist. It just felt like it was more attacking me than, you know, trying to [help something].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you feel like he was attacking you about?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I think he was just saying that — I'm trying to remember. You know, "You did this, you did that, you wouldn't understand, you never will" kind of thing. I can't remember.</p>

<p>[19:37.3]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, it's like this catch-22 that I feel you're in which kills me, because I love you and care about you. Where it's like, she's not the kind of person that could feel the kind of remorse, having hit me —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You said that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, in this meeting.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Alright. Same thing for the infidelity.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not the kind of person that could actually like apologize in such a way that actually holds water for me. But it's almost like — and this is my mind probably being so unforgiving, that's just the way it is — that is like well, if this is the kind of person who could do that in the first place, how am I not supposed to think you're full of shit right now?</p>

<p>[20:33.4]</p>

<p>I'm not saying that you aren't really — and belittles and disrespects and discounts what you're saying. And that's not fair to you either. (pause) So like attacking someone, maybe treating them less than you and not taking on good faith what they're saying. Then again, I feel betrayed and I've got some fairly fucking legitimate grievances. And you have a tendency to — [and when you say, Jessica, and I know that you didn't mean it really, but "I enjoy having people feel sorry for me" so —]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I took it back.</p>

<p>[21:32.2]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I know. I'm saying I know you didn't mean it. Like where I enjoy not being self-sufficient because other people will bail me out, so I can continue in my patterns of, whether it's drugs or laziness or feeling some self-deprecation. And have I milked this shit for all it's worth? (chuckles) I mean, maybe. (pause) But it's like, so what? That's me. Like my sister, when she found out about this stuff, she said immediately "Your relationship is not going to make it through this." I'm like "How do you know that, Lori (sp?)?" and she said "Because I know you and you aren't going to (inaudible at 22:27.9)." "You're probably right." (chuckles)</p>

<p>I'm not trying to apologize for myself or trying to offer rationalizations or whatever. I'm just saying —</p>

<p>[22:47.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Saying that's the way you are.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, that's the way I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it does seem like — and I have a couple of thoughts. I mean, I feel like Jessica that you eventually — well, maybe not eventually — but I have to understand why you choose, you know — obviously if you feel like your husband is being aggressive and attacking you, that's not a fun feeling. But why you choose hitting versus other things. I mean, I think that —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What else is there? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? You think hitting is the only option?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I could answer back but that doesn't stop him. After we decided that I was going to move down to Virginia and he was saying things that I found hurtful, I just like — I wasn't going to respond. We didn't get into a fight.</p>

<p>[23:54.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If Jessica said to you "This is just incredibly hurtful. Is there any way you could please stop?" would that help?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Let's just put it this way. When things get heated I think, what, nine times out of 10, I'm the person that leaves, goes for a walk, disappears. The other 10 percent of the time, when Jessica leaves, she leaves with the car. Doesn't accept my phone calls and is gone for hours.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That doesn't happen.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, the night it was snowing and I walked all —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We talked about that, and she said I needed to answer your calls, and I did.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not the point. (pause) She knows right where I'm going to be, all the time.</p>

<p>[24:48.7]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The question was whether I —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Disengaging is the best thing to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree. I think that's probably true but I was just wondering if there's any way —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think I misread —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think I have said that before.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Disengaging, yeah —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not the disengaging. I mean — you're right. Disengaging is probably the best thing if there's no way to continue engaging in a more productive way. I think disengaging is a really good idea.</p>

<p>(voices overlapping at 25:14.9)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But he always wants to get the last little comment.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But she threatens. She'll do this thing —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, I'm trying to shut down —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It makes me flinch and it's really fucked up. She'll just get this look on her face like "I'm about to beat on you. You better not." She doesn't see anything wrong with it. It's outrageous. You do not hit people. You just don't do it, especially people you love. Like we were in the car the other — where were we? I forgot where we were. And I was just in a moment of relative placidtude where just everything is fine. I'm like "Jessica, you need to, when you go down south" — because you were talking about going down south and using drugs again and doing all these self-destructive behaviors.</p>

<p>[26:11.6]</p>

<p>Which was probably just blowing off steam. But maybe not. Her family has their head shoved in the sand in a lot of different respects. Like I've [done] meetings after recovery. I've gone to meetings like you're supposed to. The 12 Step meeting. And at a certain point —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: A few times.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, no, there's —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Your doctor goes to it too. I know, I'm probably due for going to some things.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is, I did it, and I can do it some more, alright. But [you] haven't done one of those things. After your mom died — you came out of rehab after your mom died, and that's where you should have been.</p>

<p>[27:01.6]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I was resentful that they told me to stay at the rehab place rather than to go home and see my family right after she died.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: All this resentment.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I feel like I'm a drug abuser, but I don't feel like [I'm an addict].</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, let's just put it this way. If you go down south and you start taking —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: When I was going down south, I was talking about maybe I'll go back to my psychiatrist and get a prescription for Adderall, which is the wrong thing.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, isn't this a year of sobriety away from this horrible drug that completely destroyed our lives?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here's what I think. In terms of the practicality of the logistics of continuing, I'm open to whatever. I'm also open to we can try one thing and if it doesn't seem to be working too well, we can try something else.</p>

<p>[27:59.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You appreciate that I want an even playing field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's the most important thing to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. And it seems like you've given good arguments for both ways, right? I mean, if one of you could be here, why not take the opportunity?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean logistically, having a cell phone on speaker phone would be the easiest way to do it. But I feel like so much of — well, you're a professional, you know — how much of what we're communicating here with body language —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Computers that are the —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, at least facial expressions —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And would you have a preference, Jessica, for me seeing both of you via Skype or Michael here and you on Skype? Do you have a preference?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'd rather you see both of us on Skype.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But you're not going to have Skype until you get up to Vermont and use your dad's computer.</p>

<p>[28:51.5]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is, I can find a computer that has a Skype connection for the time. I think in terms of what's easy for me, seeing that she's taking our computer that we use for our — I can do these kinds of things while she's in Virginia. It's hers. Like, whatever, it's hers. It's for her school, and her dad got it for her or whatever. I'd prefer coming in and just being here. But —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's fine with me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, because you've got the idea that I dominate the conversation sometimes anyway. I don't want —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We could still try it once. My only issue is like if I can't find a quiet place to be.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, no, you go to your dad and Charlotte, whoever else is in the house, and you're like "Look this room right here is my counseling session, in this room right now."</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, because they have all those [beds] and they wouldn't be around.</p>

<p>[29:57.2]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's like "Stay the hell out of earshot and respect my clinical, my doctor's visit, please." I mean, it's a big house. It will be fine. All I'm saying is, I know I dominate the conversation sometimes. And I think it has done us a disservice in our counseling here.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I — (voices overlapping at 30:25.2)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it's the way it is, okay? Like sometimes when it comes to breaking out of that situation, I'm just the one who is going to be able to relate the information to you the quickest. That's not the point. I really want to have a situation in which we're equals coming to the table in the clinical setting. If that means I need (inaudible at 30:50.3) Skype connection, maybe that's the way to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have a couple that's —</p>

<p>[30:54.7]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, have you ever done anything like this before?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually haven't done Skype with couples, but I'm not too worried. I mean, that's fine. I'm happy to figure something out that sounds reasonable, and other people certainly do it. What was I going to say? Oh, when are you leaving?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: This week sometime. I'm thinking —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We're going to make a decision on Thursday.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But you need to get your car fixed, and I don't feel like I should leave before the car is fixed.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm taking it in today. My car needs a lot of work. The title is in my name. The Chevy we have here is in Jessica's name. That's what she'll be driving south. But my car needs a bunch of work which my step-dad has agreed to do. But I mean, you're talking like $1000 worth of work. So how long does that take to do? It depends on how busy they are.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it's hard to say.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's hard to say.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: They can charge a lot for a small amount of time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. The point is, yeah, if you could not leave until I actually have wheels so I could —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [Well, I hadn't thought about it at first.]</p>

<p>[32:03.2]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But, at the same time, Wednesday was the day that you were like —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That was when I was talking to my dad, you know. He's like "Oh, so you only have to pack up a little bit. When do you think you'll leave? Tuesday or Wednesday? I'm guessing it will be Wednesday" acting as if that was late.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's going to be on Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I have a couple of thoughts. A bunch of thoughts. So one in terms of your sort of — Michael is talking about doing a disservice to the couple's therapy in terms of you feeling like you dominate. I mean, that's part of what you're here for, is looking at the dynamic. I don't see you at fault. I see the two of you as —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I'm not talking about me being at fault. I understand. It's just, you know —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I don't think that it's a disservice. It's part of what you're getting help for. You know what I'm saying? It's a dynamic between you and Jessica. So I just wanted to make that clear. And, I mean, the two of you are in a tough position that you're trying to work through. One is that each of you, for your own benefit and potentially for your marriage, need other ways of dealing with your feelings than the way you're dealing with them now. I mean, that's the bottom line. Like hitting isn't a good way of dealing with your feelings. Being verbally abusive is not a good way of dealing with your feelings. Using drugs is not a good way of dealing with your feelings.</p>

<p>[33:20.6]</p>

<p>I'm not telling you anything that you don't intellectually already know. But on a really basic level, that's what each of you struggles with is more adaptive ways to deal with your feelings that aren't destructive to yourselves and to other people. And insofar as you struggle with that individually, it's just exponentially worse when the two of you are together. And so that's really the challenge for each of you individually and to each of you in the relationship. And it sounds like right now, it's very hard for you to engage productively. That the best you can do is disengage from each other, which is fine. I mean, that's where you are right now. And it sounds like the idea of being separate is to kind of promote the best that you can do right now, which is disengage and not continually engage in ways that are destructive. And that sounds like a really good idea. It sounds like you're really each struggling —</p>

<p>[34:14.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's kind of like self-reflection right now. You know, like meaningful self-reflection on what did I bring to this? I'm sorry I interrupted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no. I agree with that. I absolutely agree with that. I mean, so in this sense, when you have an individual task, each of you, aside from whatever happens in the relationship, because if some reason you do decide to go your separate ways, you'll still need these skills going forward for yourself and for any relationship ultimately.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, that's the whole thing. When I told Jessica I was concerned about her and her going back to Virginia and continuing old patterns and stuff, I'm like "You've got to get to the bottom of this because you're going to hit other people you love in the future." And then what really ticked you off was when I said "You're going to hit your kids." And you said "I won't hit my kids. The only person I've ever hit was you because you made me that way."</p>

<p>[35:11.3]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I didn't say you made me that way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Whatever. It has something to do with "I never hit anyone before you."</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I've always slammed doors and things like that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just this idea which, you know, Timothy and others have encouraged me, it's like I'm not responsible for these things. I mean, I am to the extent that I've been a neglectful husband and not [brought what I needed to the table]. There are two things. Like I'm self-reflective. I realize not only that love is not perfect, our love is fairly imperfect in a lot of different ways, and I'm responsible for a whole bunch of that stuff. And so is Jessica. But there's just nothing I could have done to make you hit me, and there's nothing I really could have done to have her cheat on me. So the one thing I've been told is that I need to realize that her infidelity has nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>[36:22.4]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You said that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just want to say something.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: When I — and I am being mean when I say that the only person I've hit has been you. I don't mean that means it's your fault.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It sure sounded that way to me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean, it doesn't have to mean that. It could just be I've never been — it could still be a problem with me that I would have with any —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No one is saying you're going to hit your kids, Jessica. I'm not trying to say you're going to hit your kids. It's not fair. I was just saying you've got to deal with some of this shit and so do I. That's like the — this is like the self-reflective kind of like, I'm understanding my anima and having her understand her animus.</p>

<p>[37:15.4]</p>

<p>I talk about gender reversal. It's not gender reversal, it's just a feminine side of me and a masculine side in her, and unfortunately as they exhibit themselves in our relationship, it's the negative part of that shadow that interacts. And then all of a sudden, I feel like a battered housewife, like a battered wife, and how in the world could he possibly — like there's something in the back of me that's saying "Are you even hearing what you're saying right now? Hitting me and beating on me and then thinking there's absolutely nothing wrong with having done it. It's like, do you hear yourself?" It's like I hear you like you're talking with one of your girlfriends or something and this was the situation, you'd be like —</p>

<p>[38:18.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think, Jessica?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm still thinking about what makes me so angry that I choose to hit. (pause) And I guess it's usually his judgment of me or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, the one thing I think would be really important, because these are two separate things. There's what drives your feelings, and then there's what you do about your feelings. And those are two separate processes where how you feel about something and understanding it, and then what do you do about them. And I feel like it's hard at times for you guys to separate them because you're very reactive to what you're feeling inside. Everybody has those vulnerabilities, but for you guys the delay between I'm feeling this and I need to do something about it, there's not much of a delay right now.</p>

<p>[39:28.1]</p>

<p>And so building in that delay would be so beneficial for the two of you. Really really beneficial. And the other thing is in slightly different ways, and we've talked about this before, you have a lot of wishes to be taken care of in ways that aren't part of a happy adulthood. They're not wrong, they're not whatever. But they make you unhappy, in part because they are wishes that really can't get fulfilled as adults.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Such as?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, this feeling — I mean, I think for you the finances are very loaded with meaning. But this wish to sort of be taken care of and sort of this desire to stand on your own two feet but feeling like well, if I can't, hopefully there will be somebody there. And obviously we all need people in our lives. But there's a way in which there's an especially strong urge on your part that I actually think does you a great disservice in the end, because it makes you feel like you're not self-reliant. And it makes you feel badly about yourself. And it makes you feel insecure in the world, and those aren't good feelings.</p>

<p>[40:37.6]</p>

<p>And I think for you, Jessica, I mean it comes out less, but it seems you sort of explicitly say the desire for both of you to be more self-sufficient, but obviously there are ways in which this plays out for you too. Because both of you rely a lot on your parents, and ironically, or maybe not so, they're not that reliable. I mean, even if you could get these wishes fulfilled, they don't do a great job of it, and they cause you a lot of frustration and resentment and sadness in the end anyway.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And they cause problems with the relationships we have [with people].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. So because you're not relating to them in a way where you're feeling more self-sufficient —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm an adult, you're an adult, and this is our adult relationship, parent and child. More like hey, I'm still a kid and you're still having to take care of me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Even though he's late 70s and it's eventually supposed to reverse where the kid (chuckles) takes care of the adult when they get really old.</p>

<p>[41:42.1]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm in a stellar home for (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think that, you know, this really plays out for both of you very much so. You know, I realize we only have a couple of minutes left, and I just want to make sure we tie up loose ends. So it sounds like this is going to be our last meeting in person, at least for now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I have that check for you in my pocket.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I appreciate it. And so what do you want to do, just logistically in terms of do you want to skip —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: For next week at least. What do you want to do? It was already going to be Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, because I'm not here Monday morning.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Do you want to just, let's do it by e-mail? Just e-mail.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Do you think we should just wait to Skype —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't want to set up a time and place for us to do this new technology thing and have it not work out, waste your time, and have us just frustrated. I'd rather know that it's going to work. Do you have a Skype account and stuff?</p>

<p>[42:47.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I do. I'm actually not that technologically savvy, but I can figure it out. I'm not too worried about that. We'll need to look into it. So Michael, you're going to be here for a while. Or, when are you going to Vermont?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm going to be back and forth between Vermont and here until June. When am I going to Vermont? Maybe next weekend, but just for the weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're going to continue with Timothy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And can I touch base with him? Is that okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I've given him written stuff and you can absolutely talk to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, and Jessica, what are you going to do?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And talk to Dr. Patton if you want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I don't have her contact information.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't have it on me. It's in my car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, that's okay. If you want to e-mail it to me, I'd be happy to do so. And so what are you going to do about your treatment or with your treatment?</p>

<p>[43:36.5]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, with Becka May [ph], I have to call her today and be able to pay for the past sessions, but I obviously won't see her again. And then I will go — well, we met on Wednesday, so maybe I would see her one more time. In Virginia, well, all I have is this health care, so I'm sure —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Her psychiatrist in Virginia is a legal pill-pusher.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's not who — that's not our therapist.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Are you talking [to] [inaudible]?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He's not somebody to talk to.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know. I'm just trying to say there are a bunch of practitioners, based upon our previous lifestyle, in the mental health profession that we had very unhealthy relationships with.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [They might] talk to you for 15 minutes —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: They talk to you for 15 minutes —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Or less.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And give you enough speed to send you to jail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's not good. Do you want — the only problem, I know there's a hitch with your insurance, but I could — I don't know about a low fee person, I will do my best, but I can find you someone in Virginia. You're going to be in Richmond?</p>

<p>[44:44.3]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Charlottesville.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, Charlottesville. Why did I think Richmond?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [It's a cooler city.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like me to look into that for you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I'll be happy to do so. We are going to need to —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Since I really don't like my family recommendations, if they've been to that same person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that would not be good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 45:02.3) rehab. Okay, this is for two appointments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is — okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's for two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually it's one forty.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, how much did he write it for?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One is one thirty. Well, it's two sixty, so I imagine it's —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So he owes you $20. Plus whatever else there is. So this is the new one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So this is with all of it, so there's actually — so it's nine forty, because it started on March 26.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He has the dates here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That includes today.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He's got the 26<sup>th</sup> and 4/2, is what this covers. So basically I owe for 4/16 and for 4/30.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I owe one, two, three. I'll have to call you with the new credit card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're going to pay for three. Okay, I'll figure this out.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is the dates.</p>

<p>[45:51.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I got it. Do you have the credit card?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, he should be getting the new number today. Is it okay if I just give you the credit card number?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I realize I owe you a bunch of money. Can I circle which ones he just paid? What does it say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the first one and the third one.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The first and the third one, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if you could — here, let me just — okay, here's that and here's that. This is for you. And actually I can e-mail you a credit card form that you can just e-mail back. Is that okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I think in e-mail, you're supposed to put half the number in one e-mail and —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it's through a form, it's not direct e-mail. But if you'd feel more comfortable that way, that's fine. What was I going to say? Yeah, so you're going to mail me a check for the rest or I may even see you. It's not clear yet. Guys, I really wish you luck. I'm looking forward to continuing this in some form, and I really wish you luck, okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care guys.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Will you still be able to record our sessions if we use Skype?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have no idea. We'll figure something out. I have no idea.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 16th interview. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand. College dean right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It's all the, they all fall in one line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I can, I can go over the things with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Still not feeling too well. I think a cold or - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well are you feeling good or bad about that, in the draft thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, other than I figured when I-when I was here Monday, was I still thinking it was an allergy? Yeah well, I think it's a cold now. It just got tremendously bad Monday night. And... but if at this point, if it were, an allergy or something that I thought was going to be chronic, keep on all spring or something, I wouldn't like it at all. It's been really weird. [0:01:14.1] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not just a...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's been really uncomfortable. And, I don't know, I think I'm coming out of it now, though. I hope, because I've been running around, for the last hour or so, which tends to make things worse. Also I find that when I'm feeling like this, my mind doesn't function well. I cant' concentrate on things. I'm just sort of out of it. It might be a function of things like coresee (ph) and stuff like that. Because when you take those prop (ph) focusing, don't drive, because you might get drowsy or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think? Do you think you physically won't be able to manage to concentrate on anything? </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might be looking for an excuse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or are you just knocking off- oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I still feel somehow-uneasy, particularly at the beginning. And, letting it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you said it's like a hedge wall. If you can't-you have got to go [through for next time] (ph). [0:02:25.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean, it's a possibility, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really, I'm starting to get really frustrated. Taking these- I'm doing assignments for my photography. I plan it ahead of time. And then when I go out and start taking pictures, I just forget about it. And just sort of get immersed in what I'm doing, and lose track of what I was supposed to be doing. You know like he gave us very specific instructions, to follow. And I'm going along and I find myself forgetting to be careful and being sort of careless in the way I'm taking pictures. And then, also not trying to re-not making a big effort to remember where, about in the sequence of instructions I am that he gave us. And I don't know what it is. If-what it might be, is I'm taking pictures of a girl I know, and I don't know that well. And I did-I took some pictures of her the other day. For the same assignment, but I decided to pose her. I was really careless enough (ph). I decided I'd better do it again. I think that, well-I don't know how true it is. I may have been-somebody (ph) would think I was imposing on her, getting her to stand outside in the cold. I've made her nervous by taking so many pictures. And all these things so I-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Started worrying about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I take on a lot of things. Just working together to make me want to think, to describe the pictures, and get it over as fast as possible. Rather than going slowly and, and being careful that everything is done right. [0:04:43.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So worrying about getting it done and the pressure of just getting it done. And having to kind of-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not the - from a school angle, but from an angle of, I've put her in an awkward situation with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Socially.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I don't-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They didn't think you ought to keep on posing but what that did was make-and that's how you saw what you were doing. But that made for what's-was at the expense of - (inaudible at 0:05:16.5)</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hurting work at the expense of - concentrating. And I also couldn't concentrate because I was in an uneasy situation. I don't know, it annoys me. It's just like I said, I did this one, the assignment was population (ph). And after doing it I decided I had done so sloppily I wanted to do it again. And I did the first passes (ph) very carefully and everything. And I just got to, being sloppy again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that-you said then you started feeling that pressure again? In the middle there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it wasn't-it happened yesterday. With another person. I was relaxed and I did good work. Because I knew her well. You know it really bothers me just how automatic and sloppy I get. It would be one thing if I were automatic and good. I haven't been taking pictures for a year yet, and I doubt that my score is that great. My...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Technique. [0:06:41.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Technique, yeah. But I-just I look at something and I want to take a picture of it and I just, do - as a reflex, just sort of upset. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You forget yourself in shots (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just-it happens always. Always. I'm just, not to say I've been crying about this, but it's-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but it's really annoying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really bothers me because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's [your kind of thing] (ph)? You just wait (ph) and take pictures before you remember to stop? Or do you think about stopping and not watch it? What happens in there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't remember. I don't remember to be careful until after taking pictures and I decide that's pretty thoughtless, what you did and I didn't even think about what you were doing. And I just assume that I don't have that good of technique so it should be a reflex now-yet. Given time, it's sort of become a reflex and I do it without thinking. But I didn't pay attention to anything, like holding still or anything like that. And I just don't think, there's anyway to just all that would be-fall into place automatically. And I first consciously train myself and I just - it never occurs to me to be careful until after I've taken the picture. And I realize that I wasn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you're expecting that you're going to - . All of a sudden, just like you're expecting that your technique was going to fall into place one day, you're expecting one day you're going to fall into place that you remember to pay attention to those things. [0:08:24.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I sort of distinguished it could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And all of a sudden you find-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that some of it is-with film, you should be aware of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But I'm saying, you keep expecting that one day you're going to start. Sounds like, to me, like you keep expecting that one day, even start catching yourself on those things. Before you take a picture, without having to, train yourself to that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well... I don't think it should, take any training. I've got to-I've got to train myself to develop all this talent. But that's taking pictures. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm saying is including-what I'm really saying is that I think it's a habit to start paying attention to those things. Stop and think, that's another habit. But how-you don't see it like that. I'm not clear on how you see it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see that it as a habit. I can see that-I can see myself doing it in the future in that way. I feel like I haven't done it now, and I'm going to do it in the future as a habit. But it just seems to me like it shouldn't be a habit. It should just be like a natural thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? [0:09:48.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like a good artist sees something and maybe can just draw a line. Like almost unconsciously. But if you  - someone who doesn't-you don't just go like that. They really think about what they're doing just naturally. They think about what they're doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Do you think so? So you're saying it's kind of a defect in you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That-that you don't stop-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And think about what I'm going to do before I do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the basis that there are people who are ignorant about a thing, stop and plan it out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: If they are really aware that there are things that need to be done, yeah. No, I don't know. It seems slightly-what I'm saying seems slightly inconsistent. It's not very (ph), you know. Just I'm trying to defend it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the inconsistency that you see now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just that everything-everything [in one place] (ph). Like you said, to be a habit of some sort. Yeah, it's in definition. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean something that has to be learned. Yeah, but that's on the one hand. And the other hand there's the-there's that image of you get angry at yourself for it seems that you shouldn't have to think about these things. You should just be thinking about composition, technique. [0:11:30.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when you don't think about them, then I don't really understand what you think then. You may accept (ph)-clearly it's some kind of (inaudible at 0:11:48.4). </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes no difference to you when you keep on seeing yourself not considering what to use as technique. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I keep on considering these things. It's just really annoying because I paid a lot of money for my camera and it's just that. I don't believe I'm that intuitive to be a photographer. And it's something that needs to be... looking at. It bothers me that I'm so careless after, investing my money and hoping to be, quite good. It bothers me that, I just get careless. And it's sort of like what I tend to do. Is rather than do a few shots carefully, I tend to, spray a whole bunch and be wrong, and not be good. And that's a common practice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not where you-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a different (ph)-it's a common practice, I mean, for different reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [0:13:08.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like with deflection, I can take a lot of pictures. So one of them is going to be just perfect. Where I'm saying, one of them is poor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of them is [going to be bad] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. One of them - I won't have (inaudible at 0:13:27.2). Or after, I'm going to have, taking the best shot for the subject. But it just doesn't hit me. I'm got a bulky (ph) camera. I'm taking it, and not-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You won't do] (ph) any technical errors. You're relying on, on taking a lot-for one to turn out without technical errors. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Rather than, than getting rid of the technical errors before I take the picture. I'm taking a lot, knowing that one of them will be artistically aesthetically better than it. The other conclusion I come to is that I'm not a-you know it doesn't seem to take any more time than I do. Than I have done before, talking about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what were you expecting, or wanting, to come out of it? Not that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't expect you to answer, coming out of it, just talk about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is it okay that you came out with the same conclusion that you had before, or is not. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Because it sort of - it's the same. It just sort of makes me feel that I was busy with luxuries (ph) and not (inaudible at 0:14:43.8). Because that makes me mad. I've thought about it a little bit. And, it's sort of like more there. More than invested in, then a change or something. I don't know. That would just probably make me mad. The thing that is bothering me right now is, this (inaudible at 0:15:27.7), it's just like last quarter. I'm falling into the same rut, that I did last quarter. Starting off and getting really behind. And then - then I get a good deal behind. But I just sort of stop working because of-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which place are you at? [0:15:44.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT:A good deal behind. I stopped working. I really want to start, but I keep on saying, "Right, then start." And working on it until I stop. And when I'm about to sit down and start. I say, "Oh, I'm working on that work. You work all day today and you're not going to be caught up. All day tomorrow and you still won't be caught up. So you probably won't be caught up until next week." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I just put it off one day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait-so you-I understand the first part. I don't see how the conclusion follows, do you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: One more day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that-how does that follow from the fact that it's not enough and it's pretty huge. And it's going to take you a week to catch up. [0:16:30.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Each day is work, is [what I'm trying to say] (ph), sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't really follow. But I just can't-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like-well - here what, here is happens like this. You go in, you think of all that work. There's so much, you aren't going to be done with it in a day. It's going to keep on being a burden to you. You're going to have to keep on hacking at it. And it just seems more-better, not to start, because there isn't going to be any kind of fast relief?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In doing it -  doing the work itself is unpleasant. It's unpleasant worrying about it. But, as soon as you start it, it's also unpleasantness of another kind. And, it's sort of like, committing yourself to... to submit to this drudgery or something, extended length of time. Whereas, what I'm doing, more like I just hope this thing will go away. And I really know that it won't. [0:17:51.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But is that just saying-that now it doesn't bother you very much, that you're doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it does bother me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or that you're imagining the future-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It bothers me now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It bothers you less not to do it than it bothers you to do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To do it? It might be-sometimes I forget about it. I don't know, there's something about - time goes a lot slower when I'm - if I was studying, time goes a lot slower. You'd think I'd be more a lot aware of all the work I have to do. And a lot more aware of how slowly time is passing. And, it would be tough (ph) for me, I don't know why, if I would just be looking at how much I've done, how much I have left to go. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This way you can forget or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And time goes a lot faster. If I'm doing anything (ph). But, there's probably something more to it than all that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think you're experiencing, too, more than all that? [0:19:04.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I did this precise same thing last quarter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well that's what it is to you. You're choosing between, it seems to me, that probably last quarter as well as this quarter you're doing a thing that you have kind of stretched out which is choosing between present, levels of present grad (ph). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but-I know what is going to happen, if I keep up like this. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, but you not -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I also know that if I go to work now, I can't do the work by the end of the quarter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but that isn't what you ordinarily think. Ordinarily you don't go around thinking that-or you probably, or except, you probably would be doing more of the work. But ordinarily you think, is what you said to me. That you think, "Oh, only one more day isn't going to make a difference." Or you think-</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Oh that's something else I should do." I can do now, but then three more times of that later-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you think, "Oh that would be a drag." Those are the things that are ordinarily in your mind. (inaudible at 0:20:10.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those aren't things that make a person work. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know. But every once in a while I can think-like-say, now, I can think back and say, "I'd started a week ago, I'd be done now. Why didn't I?" I did that all last quarter too. Particular, not in any of the cores. I'd kept on saying, "You saw it. You saw what was happening weeks ago. Why didn't you do something about it." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's your answer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I didn't do something about it. I should've, that's all I have to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that you've given an answer, which is it's more pleasant for you not to do it now. You don't-you try not to think about what's going to happen in six weeks. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's true. I don't know. But some-as soon as I sit down and do it, I'm aware of how far I've gone-how far behind I am. And I feel so defeated even before I begin. And I can't sort of, project on my mind forward two weeks, when I'm all caught up or something like that. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you get really way down-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, and look at all you've accomplished. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then once you start doing it, you get really really down, by the behindness (ph) and the-all the work -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just like the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if there's no room left to think about how, how there's going to something nice (ph) at it. [0:21:53.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that the thing? That you want it to be something nice while you're doing it. You want to feel good while you're doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. I want-I want to get into it. I think if I could, you know, get into it. That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean get involved?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know I keep on think-that's not why I'm going to lie, because, I remember (ph) when I was back in high school. And even younger, especially. I found-I think I learned this stuff. I learned it faster, and I was more interested in learning. And I could concentrate better. I was always thinking... it just seems like I could go to the library, and spend a lot of time looking up things, taking notes. And, getting involved in what I was doing. Whereas, now I pretty much can't. [0:23:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're always distracted or you're always delayed (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Always, it's always work to do it . It's a lot of work. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to make yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Monotony. Not that exciting. But sometimes I think (inaudible at 0:23:34.8). When you're younger, you're better eager than when you're older. You're better able to understand, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's to say that in your experience you've just kind of lost a lot. You've just been loosing-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I've lost a lot. But, I'm thinking of my work that... how, work is an all in (inaudible at 0:24:15.3) financial questioning. At least in my experience our company asked questions about parents' responsibility (ph). All this shit. And they're constantly learning things, receiving all this information from the world. And as they grow older, there is less and less need to receive all this information. And more and more use of what they've received. It's as if - as if your mind, I don't know. I hate to use the word 'shemed' (ph) . But it's like you know, from the upper computer memory there is all this data. And that's going upward or something like that. At a certain point, your memory, becomes pretty full. And it starts to use what's in it. And it's not as receptive, to get more things. [0:25:18.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There isn't as much room do you mean? When you said there isn't much-</p>

<p>(crosstalk) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if this has much -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is not as much motivation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. There's not as much motivation, for my sort of-I've got a lot of motivation already. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you figure? </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my mind? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you think? No-is that what you kind of think to yourself, "Well I know enough, I don't need - "</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "All this shit."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm just, you know, this is in a biological... this just might be the way it hit me. I added, derived here -  just that that was too many. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part about the mind wanting something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Part about the what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I asked you about that because, the idea of the mind wanting something separate from - something for itself as a mind. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't think that can impact that then. You know just, be open. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then I'm also asking, how does that work in a personal sense. How does that fit back-if you hold back that theory, how does it back into what's happening to you now? And how it's been involved in your (inaudible at 0:26:40.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it-it just seems to be that, I've passed, the age where my mind is really receptive to incorporating a lot of information. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well given that-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not really sure about that. But let's say, that's true. What do you do with that? Do you say, "I can't do anymore"? or do you say, "Well I have to try, harder to do it." [0:27:25.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me it seems like if that's the case, it is a big struggle. I mean it's going to be-it's going to be very inefficient in learning. It would be slower, and harder. Not to say it's impossible. I don't know. I don't know how much I believe that, or how much I let it, run my-influence my actions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm trying to -  think about-about that, even if [it's a drag] (ph), it seems to influence your actions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, it seems to somehow. And then if I ever try to think about myself and how I work, it's like, one possible explanation for that's consistent with my behavior. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'll tell you what I think, kind of. And this is to open it up a little bit more. You said to me, I think, you read that little kids, take more in. There's more of life, and they have-there are more things that are discovered with a kid, than grown ups. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is a certain kind of decline after a certain age. Just because of that fact. But what I don't-but I don't think the difference between 17 and 21 is where that happens. And you seem to be referring in your experience mainly to the difference between saying you were in high school. The difference between you in high school and you in now, near the end of college. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just think that the loss, they call it, the decline in magnitude that I'm talking about, is kind of intrinsic to things, doesn't happen anywhere near that age. It happens very early, and after that, it's kind of like this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was just going to say, it's sort of like that. [0:29:39.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you know I like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Look at that] (ph), for a while. And you still change. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I might only have, half of what I had three years ago, so I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't-I also don't think so, because I've seen people-I mean, education doesn't ordinarily give up on people when they're 21. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I don't think that's completely a mistake on the part of education. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't expect for them to give up on people, pretty much at any age. There's some guy in my MA class who is, I think around 40 or something. I guess he's got a talent and has been learning about stuff. So I think it's probably-I definitely think though that, his experience with learning is going to be different from mine. Because he's slower.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well sure it's going to be different. Maybe-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless I, unless he-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe he has a better framework for putting things into. More experience can make things easier, as well as more difficult. [0:30:54.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he-I guess he could have, maybe have some sort of, conscious control of what he's learning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't see where this-I guess, I also got a little bit sidetracked on argument. Where is this in relation to French. Was it- you were saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could learn the language faster in high school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's harder now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I was just more receptive to taking things in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And it's harder now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's not-yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah, it's harder now, but what about that? What does that mean to you? And I think another reason that I was pressing is because it seemed to me that the conclusion you were drawing from that is, "Well it's always biological, and it's just going to be so hard to try. A real bear (ph)-and there's really hardly any point." So you were speaking, or you know, it's a logical conclusion. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well logically there's hardly any point, but it's surely going to be hard to try. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And given that, what do you want to do about it? It just seems to me like you're immediately saying, "That just [is too hard] (ph) to try. But it's hardly worth trying. And I'm never going to get far in it." And it's kind of organic. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't do that. I really don't know. I wish it weren't so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we're not sure it is, first of all. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-I wish-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're not sure if it's true in an organic fashion. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, that's- it remains it's very hard for me to concentrate on studying French. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it makes a difference whether that's organic or whether that's-</p>

<p>PATIENT: True. [0:32:33.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even if it is organic, people deal with it in different ways. Well when you contemplate how hard it's going to, if you redo French. Then what happens. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel defeated by it. (inaudible at 0:32:53.5) Suddenly it's done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you can't possibly finish. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just that the effort was-I don't have it-I'll get halfway through and I will click. And then I will-I'll have all the unpleasantness of failing in addition to all the unpleasantness I put myself through trying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why do you quit it halfway through?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I realize that it's too big for me. I just lose... I lose motivation or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's better not to put your foot in that water. It seems you left a mark when you get through. (inaudible at 0:33:43.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, I don't-I don't really (inaudible at 0:33:48.9). It's kind of hard to say why I do it. It's just that I do it. I keep on saying, I say I'm going to do it. I say, "Do it." </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't seem to imagine that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do-I do say that. I know I haven't in the past. I've got a very-it's not like my father telling me, "You better study." It's not like a first hand experience. It's very close in the past, and I just sit there and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And instead you say to yourself-instead of saying that to yourself, you say, what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I say all those things to myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what do you say back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really say much back. I just don't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you say-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I walk up to my desk and say, "Oh you know, what are you going to study. Oh wait, I've got a biology assignment." I like this certain biology course. I just find a lot of ways and things I could do, to keep me from doing it. [0:34:47.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it just happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if it's at night, around 9:00 o'clock or so, I say, "Oh, it's too late to start studying. Try tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of those excuses, or those answers to those distractions-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you hear them now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I study French regularly-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean-no, do you believe those things? I mean, okay. Got that biology test to do. You'd better do it. You say, "Oh yeah, yeah. Biology."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some ways, keeping up with the other work-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, forget that. I understand that there are rationale and the dishes are dirty, and you know, the assignment has to be done and all that. Those are true. There's also another thing that you're telling me, it's true. Which is that French is not enough day by day. So I'm saying you say to yourself, "Oh Biology assignment, yeah. I'm going to get it done." So at the end of it, that's the end of French for that day. No hesitation, no qualms, no thinking "Come on", no thinking, "Oh thank God. Thank God I don't have to do French." What happens. [0:35:59.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's... it's a justification for not doing French. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No but what happens. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I say to myself-what happens. Nothing happens. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say to yourself, "Oh, you can save yourself French." I'm not saying how it functions, but I'm asking you what happens in between. Like you say, "Oh biology assignment to do." You then say, or think, or do you have a -  whatever emotion, too. "Ah, good. No-not French." Or-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing happens between the time the idea enters my head. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say, "Oh Biology."</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just automatic. And I-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sit down and start doing Biology. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And before Biology enters your head, what happens? You're going toward the desk and you're thinking of doing French. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You sort of remind me of what happens - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then what happens. Okay -  </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I just start looking for excuses. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so you say, "Oh, I have two weeks of French to do." Then you say to yourself, "What else do I have to do? Do I really have to do it tonight?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like that. All the other things that I have to do, even if I were studying French, I'd have to take time out to do these other things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well even if you were studying the other things, you'd have to take time out to do French, you know. I don't understand that rationale. That's not just to argue for French, exactly, but that's not a clear (ph) rationale.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more like-it's like keeping caught up in everything, but one thing, is better than being slightly behind in everything. [0:37:46.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is that better? </p>

<p>PATIENT: In previous years, if I took four courses, rather than being four weeks behind in one course, at the end of the time, I'd be one week behind in four courses. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like you can't keep up with everything. It's like falling backwards equally or falling back all in one. And-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now a different thing seems like the best choice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it's not that it seems like the best choice. It's that... this is the way that I'm doing it. And it-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, what do you mean, this is the way that you're doing it. You make it sound like-like somehow it's just occurred by probability. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's occurred... without much-I don't exactly sit down and figure out exactly what I'm going to do, it just-for some reason, I'm not aware of it, this is what I'm doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have just let it happen, that this is the tack you're taking. You haven't really examined that it's a better choice to stay four weeks behind in one thing than one week behind in four. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not really, no. [0:38:54.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just think I just do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't sit down and say, "Well, it's unpleasant to do French." And I don't weigh all these other things in my mind, I just-just don't remember that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing about is that, studying in Biology. Doing all the coursework, instead of doing the French, is-to me, it's perfectly justifiable. All studying-all studying is equal.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say that now but in ten minutes-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've gone so far as meeting that responsibility. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say that now, but five minutes ago, you told me that, that's it's really important to do the French because at the end of the quarter, you're going to have to explain (ph) yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I can see how, as a matter of fact, I can see completely how a person could hold those, those ideas in their mind. But I don' t know if you do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: At different times I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it seems to me that what happens is some way, there are reactions for different aspects of the problem. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know what you mean by that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well-let me think. I guess I mean only -  yeah, there's a way in which all studying counts. That's one thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It counts to my father. "What have you been doing?" "I've been studying hard. I spend a lot of time in my books." And he can't complain about that, even if I do flunk one, one of the courses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But to you-so that's one thing to say to your father. There's another thing, when you think about-what, having to take this course over. Or what's sad about not doing your French. Or saying - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Working, having to take it over, and pay more tuition and more time before I graduate. I wanted them to hear-if at the end of the year, if I don't spend a lot of time. I always thought it would be a nice thing to take French. It's required for my degree, a language. Either a language (inaudible at 0:41:27.7). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you think about those, then it makes sense to take French. But when you think about something like, explaining to your father what you're doing, it doesn't matter so much to do the French. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And despite-also it seems like despite all those things you say to yourself, that you just said, there are good reasons for taking French. There's also a way in which you really hold back from it. Something about it that, is very unpleasant at this point (ph). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well at this point, it's a great deal that now is that-how far I am behind. But even when I'm doing it, something that-that bothers me. It requires work every day. It's got to be a constant thing. Most courses don't have to be because everything's spurts. Like last week, I spent a couple days and I really studied Biology first. There were a lot of tests, but I haven't done much since then. You know, but that's acceptable, another thing. Whereas in French, you work for a few days and take four days off, you're four days behind and you have a lot to do. [0:42:47.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can't pace yourself the same way in French. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't work in spurts. It has to be a constant effort. Like to do this French, I'd have to go to class for two hours every morning. And then I'd have to spend who knows how much time every day preparing for the next day of class. And, if I don't prepare for the next day of class, I don't want to go to it because I feel very uneasy when the teacher calls on me and I don't know an answer for her. And I have so few right answers I just, I nervous (ph) in the class because I'm afraid of being wrong. That applies to other classes too. And that's something that we talked about here. (inaudible at 0:43:33.6) But that's one of the things that figures in French. Yeah, the whole thing-and I don't pretend that the way I'm dealing with French is in any rationale, I don't know (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you have a rational answer. Like it's unpleasant to spend three hours a day doing something. Right? It's unpleasant to have to go to class two hours every day, every weekday. Those things are unpleasant. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it sounds like I should. If I were entirely rationale, I think the need for taking French outweigh the unpleasant aspects. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem to add up that way to you. [0:44:27.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Objectively it does. But subjectively, in actual practice it doesn't work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead it is really more unpleasant for you to go to French but you do the work and-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's putting off the things from the future somehow, not when the grades come out. It's not a sort of thing you have to do with it-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there isn't a way to make it real now, for you? Like, "I should do it now." Either to make real that future pain or to make some kind of pressure on doing it now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: None that I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So wait-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like the idea of making the future now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But is that-now, I am confused. Because I think [that would] (ph) brings you to a place where you shouldn't be bothered about not doing French. But you are bothered by not doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that bother like? In a way, you think, how does it feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm going to say, it's unpleasant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid of what's going to happen in the future. But it's something that I can forget about for a few hours and do something else. [0:46:10.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can put off the fear or you can put it on yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and if I were doing French, that same fear and unpleasant feeling would be with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it would be guilt for not having done it. No, it would be part of the same thing and more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd only feel worse for doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd feel, yeah. I'd feel guilt for what I've already done, plus, the burden of so much work to do. Whereas now I just feel the guilt for what I've already done, I don't feel guilty for not studying tomorrow. It's just a... a possibility. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still have, not exactly hope, but what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I talk about this, I have a lot of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the hope then? </p>

<p>PATIENT: The hope is that I'm going to (inaudible at 0:47:14.0). Because that's what we studied with. And I really think it's possible. I mean it seems like the only thing that I could do would do or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now how come? Is that because I've been pressing so hard or - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's just because I've been thinking about it a lot. And I know that that's what I should be doing. And-I know that's what is best for me. But you know as soon as I stop thinking about it, and start being more natural or spontaneous or something. Just stop being rational about it and object, and just start being more subjective about it and doing a, sort of what my feelings tell me.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's just what kind of reaction in flowing back. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just kind of float back to that other way out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just (inaudible at 0:48:25.5) way back to doing things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see that happening, yeah. I don't really at this, like right now-I said that first, I'm done with that, [I'm going to] (ph) study. But I can also say that I'm really not too sure what's going to happen. And then I can say just on the basis of past experience, this time no I won't. I can see the-I could say all three of those things, and feel fairly sure of any of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what does that do to you, that you could predict any of those kind of things happening to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seem hard. If that's it, like you know. I can say, "I'm going to study French." And really believe it. And it's the truth. And at that very same moment, I said that, I could've said, "I know I won't study French." And I could've believed it just as much. And it would have been the truth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you're believing on different data. Those beliefs-you do have those beliefs. Those inconsistent beliefs, but they're from different data. (inaudible at 0:49:44.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's that all combined, that at times I see the 'should study' as being bigger than the 'won't study'. But they're both at the same time, both at the same time. They're really unpleasant. Each one is greater than the other one, at the same time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You believe you will study and you believe you won't study, at the exact same moment. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then, which all these make me believe that I better (inaudible at 0:50:21.2). See it? Just wait and find out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more important to try and make in my mind what I'm going to do now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, there's no maybe no point in predicting what you're going to do. But as for deciding and trying to carry through, that seems like a different issue. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you are-you are making-you kind of think of them, the same. Is that  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I'm deciding what I'm going to do, that's one form of predicting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah. But it involves more things than just predicting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it involves more things but... deciding what I'm going to do, whether or not I do it, is contingent, not on anything I saw now, but on how I feel at that moment in the future. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how you're thinking and on what you're doing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's all-anything I can say now is just nothing but words. Unless something is shown to me. It's so clear, sometimes. So truthful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean to say that there's no way on which you can kind of take a decision to do something and then-then make steps to carry it through? As a general concept? Or, is that not a - is that not a way you're ware of (ph)? [0:51:54.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I always feel that way. But it seems like, I'm not going to retract what I said, you know. I mean, I don't-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm not going to - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that in this case, in this case especially. That-it's almost as though I can't do anything about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. There isn't a way for you to structure in your studying, French. It just-it doesn't' seem like you could do that. Like you don't know what you'll be doing in two hours, and you don't know anyway of ensuring or making a tendency for you to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can set myself off in some direction. I can't see any way of being sure that when I get to the point where I have to take that step - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I won't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And I guess you're also saying it's not just a matter of - that it's-that it's always probabilities, and you are never absolutely sure of anything. One is never absolutely sure. But you in particular, are not at all sure. Not whether you're going to do this particular thing. Studying French. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I really followed you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm saying, I guess it's not just the general issue. The general issue being, well thinking about the future is always thinking in terms of probabilities. And so you can never be 100 percent sure-one can never be 100 percent sure what one is going to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a lot more depth (ph), like you're doing. You personally doing this specific thing. [0:53:42.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But even, even what I've said, it's sort of-isn't-I'm-it's sort of making me believe more that that's more applicable to me than in just this one case, too, though. You know, it feels that what I just said, as I realized I had even less power over myself than I thought I did. I can't set myself out to do something and do it. It's always going to depend on how I feel at the moment, except when I'm going to have to do it in the future. And that's, if I didn't-feels like, I just feel like I've lost something. Somebody is going to come in and take it away from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you're always a victim, in a way, yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's like maybe I shouldn't [have said] (ph) something. I don't know. Not, not to be dismissed (ph) but it's just... [0:55:00.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But had that happened at the (inaudible at 0:55:02.3). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just helplessness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have any feelings like you don't have any control over what happens to you, it happens to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm just trying to figure-trying to decide what I'm going to do about French now. You know, ah. That's the thing, something should be done. But I just admitted to myself that I can't do anything. But I want to do something anyhow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well did you admit that you-first of all just a question for clarification. Did you admit that you can't do anything, or did it kind of seem to you like there's, no way for you to control it. Maybe-maybe that isn't a broad enough distinction, for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it-what you just said is confusing me. I kind of-didn't occur to me to be a natural at this. But once you find out, it just affects me pretty good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what got confusing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What you said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You unders-you mean not understanding it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of did as you said it. But as you got through...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You lost it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying-you said, that what you had just done was admit to yourself that there was no way for you to control or take the decision or do anything. And I'm making a distinction between-I'm raising the question on whether you make the distinction between-well, you didn't expect-you have no control. And have had this experience of just being pushed around and not able to decide. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm understanding that a little. I-I just feel I can't take this-and I figured, you know, I shouldn't be emotionally involved in it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well that's okay. You mean involved in that kind of loss sensation. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I said that-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean well what is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of feel like, you know, I want to stop talking about it. And I want to see if I do it or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it the apprehension or with the [politics sense] (ph) or what? [0:57:48.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean, politics (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean-well knowing when you see. That's kind of thing. [Makes it well] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I sort of want to see it to see if, I sort of might (ph) be testing what I said. I don't know exactly how you can make a test out of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to see if you can decide, or which prediction about yourself is right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just said that, yeah. I don't know. I just sort of want to see whether I do it or not. Because now, before I came over here, I made an arrangement to have dinner with somebody tonight. And after that, I was going to study French. This was the plan that I gave myself, about 1 o'clock this afternoon. So, I sort of, set myself up this way to tell you but I really want to see if I'm going to do it. And, I don't know. I just sort of can't-can't say anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is that-I just want to ask one question. I don't know if this is the point you're making. Is the point you're making, "Oh it's empirical now." It's not-this is speculation, I was talking about? [0:59:36.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way, that's what I'm thinking. I sort of had this, this strange feeling like if I can really do it tonight, then I will disprove this bit about me not having any control, over myself. Which, you know, I really felt that, what I said and I kind of had an icky feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I don't do it, at least maybe, that'll be-at least I'll know that I don't have any control over myself. And maybe it'll help me know that. I won't be quite as unsure. You know, maybe I'll be able to accept it if I know I don't have any control over myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not quite clear I envision this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that - not that it's going to-me not studying French, that is going to prove that I don't have control, any control whatsoever over myself. If I don't, I'll keep that as a possibility and if it may-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well and - what I don't -  I'll tell you what I think. In a way, there's a destruct (ph) in this whole 'What is this going to prove or disprove it.' Aren't there ways in which you want to do each of those things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so. I want to study French. In what ways could you envision me not wanting to do it. [1:01:29.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I could see one saying, "Uh! Thank God it's-I don't have any choice in this. I don't want to deal with it."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah just sit back and let it all happen to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, and "I couldn't have done it differently."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay. But I think the other way is clearer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think the other way is more for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hm. More in my-more important to me to find out. Although it might get (inaudible at 1:02:03.1). That's-that's more like what you said as well. If I don't study French, then I couldn't believe that I don't feel guilty. It's not that I miss so it doesn't have to happen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah if it does-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And one prays (ph) that you don't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd just as soon feel that I have some sort of control over myself, and what I do. [1:02:37.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. I pressured you a lot in this time. I think more than some times. Some of it's been a... that you seemed pretty composed about this whole problem. You figured, well, you can't do it. And you started thinking about it, and you seemed to be, as much of an issue for you [as in what I asked] (ph). And if that makes you feel-in a way, that's exactly what you'd have to do more to experience. And I wanted to see, that's probably pretty obscure, but the part about-</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, (inaudible at 1:03:32.9). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I was wondering, what that was for you. I mean I think it was a different-I mean it's a behavior I've engaged in a few times with you, but it's not my usual way of talking. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I noticed it. For a while, it seemed like, you were coming into your own, picking on that. Telling me to do it because it makes you  - what most people do it. You don't exactly come out and say, "You've got to do it." (inaudible at 1:04:15.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You were-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As a matter, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pushing me more in the direction of either like, I don't know. Even like doing it and it seems as those there's this-some of the things you say, you don't mean to take a stand either for or against you. You just sort of have to-my likes and my dislikes. You always have this to like or this to dislike. But this is the sort of thing it just seems like-you actually had a thought of what was best for me, to do which was, strange and sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you didn't exactly like it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It reminded me of my parents. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [1:05:20.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you didn't-but you didn't come out and say, "Study." You sort of-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what did you think of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I decided that I was being paranoid, accusing you of being like my parents. Yeah. Because it wasn't-it really wasn't. You just telling me the sort of thing that I already believed. I just don't - I just can't tell myself strongly enough. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you what-I'll tell you what I was, what I actually had in mind was something that would be different. Well I just came out like that. Which is, my impression was almost more than you didn't respect the reasons that you aren't doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I respect them even less. (chuckles) I don't understand what you're saying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm saying, yeah, it is-it is unpleasant to do French three hours a day. It's not so irrational to my point of view. It's not irrational or caused or anything like that, that you don't want to do it. And my sense is that-was that in a way, all those objections, all those things unpleasant about it which are what you act on all the time. Are things that when you talk about it, you kind of don't take enough into account. Your behavior takes into account a lot-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't seriously consider that- [1:06:58.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that should be taken as seriously as, as my need for different people and (inaudible at 1:07:06.8). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Now that might be-I don't-I'm operating on the notion that... unless you understand that there's something to you, holding back or whatever you call it, not doing it. You can't just jump ahead and think, "Do it!"</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're right, you can't just-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't mean understand in the sense that necessarily extract that those are great and wonderful. But you know, just that there's been a conflict.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not like you have to just immediately disregard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well it's not like the kind of thing that you can just stop and set aside. My-I don't really mean that you can't just disregard. That seems to me to (inaudible at 1:08:08.7). Decide well you can't just go and do the other thing, which will not push it open. Just do it (inaudible at 1:08:17.1). But you can't, but maybe, acts of will have been known to occur.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People have-</p>

<p>PATIENT: What did you say? You said acts-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kind of said acts of will have been known to occur. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I don't want to say, "No that can't happen." (laughs) That's probably not usual. But... but it's a probably more helpful way of thinking about how you can help you attack it, a thing. Understand it's a reason, a certain thing the way you've been. Do you understand that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You going to change your mind about anything? What are you thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I changed my mind about it, when it first occurred to me. So I'm-the bit about maybe having an idea of what I should do. It sort of, in a roundabout way, what I said before. I sort of changed that as I thought of it. Yeah, I didn't think it was unusual or anything like that. I can sort of accept it, what you just said now. You know, like recognizing the significance of my reasons for not wanting to do it. I can see how that's - that's consistent, pretty much the approach to have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does that make it seem more legitimate or less weird, or something? [1:10:33.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, less weird. I don't feel so guilty. For not having done it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like before it seemed like I was writing about, what you should've done? You know I just made you feel worse for not having done it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really, no. But, knowing now-or, if I really believe that, these feelings are powerful motivations for not doing it or something like that, I don't feel like it was any big neglect on my part or something like that, not having done it. It's just sort of saying, maybe I'm not strong enough at the moment to do it. Maybe I did the best I can or something like that. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean maybe it wasn't a matter of being weak and out of control. Or kind of choosing-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it wouldn't matter-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a sense choosing, (inaudible at 1:11:56.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it wasn't a matter of being weak. I did the best I could. I've tried, as hard as I could, to study. But things that are keeping me from studying are greater than my will, at the moment. So I'm not going to feel guilty about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if that's the sense exactly, that you're not - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not accepting that, that they're greater than my will. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'm not going to try in the future, but I mean just the fact that they are strong things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it means they have to be dealt with. What it means if that's so that they have to be (inaudible at 1:12:42.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but, but it's-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you're-you're not recognizing that and you thought it might be easier to overcome, than it was. (inaudible at 1:12:51.6) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel like saying the fault is my own. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's - soon, not to have done it. It's  - . I can't put it in words.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a relief. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A relief from the guilt of not having done it. I feel like I should-I still should do French. And... it's - I should have to make an effort to overcome the unpleasantness at least, to do it. </p>

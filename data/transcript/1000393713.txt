<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (7-minute silence) I was thinking about, the usual way about school and things to do, but suddenly I realized that uhm, I, I was beginning to think of a particular boy who I found hard to deal with. And especially if I'm in a bad mood, I find him hard, because he somehow then acts worse or at least it seems to me he does.  Today it was that way too, and then I then I just began to think about really the children want to know each other first before they can really respond to me as a teacher. Or at least somehow I get the feeling that the way I set up the classroom I don't allow them to have an outlet for at least the interest they have in each other.  I used to think I did, but just now it was striking me that what I really want, no matter what I sort of pretend when I'm setting up things, is that I have a one-to-one relationship with each child and that each child has one only with me.  He may know others but not that well, so he's really dependent on me.  And somehow I feel it's a threat for 2 children to really like each other and feel close, unless they are already responding to me in a way that I want them to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And in having this one-to-one relationship it doesn't seem that I really think of them as individuals or — well, I think this is part of the trouble with some of the children, like the one who becomes so difficult to deal with if I'm easily angered.  And I just know if I went out of my way to look at him as a person all on his own and — I don't know, it's almost as if we don't have any pleasant associations with each other.  It's always my having to scold him about something, which is sort of a negative or a nonrecognition of him as an individual.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, you wondered yesterday if it had anything to do with, I mean, if some of your feeling about it was because they are little boys.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's something that, not that particular thought, but today I well, even before I got to school I had a headache and I didn't really want to go and I had a horrible train ride, which just made me feel madder in a way.  I suppose I was already mad and in a sort of angry mood and, so then nothing the children did all day was right.  And when I realized the day was like that, I wondered if it had anything to do with anything I was thinking here yesterday.  But it's always things where they're being a little bit boisterous, or just sort of what people would say is being all boy and showing any independence.  Those, those are the times when I get really, if I'm sort of inclined to be in this mood, I'll get really upset.  And also, I, it's the same problem of thinking one way and feeling another because when I think about how to teach, I want very much for them to be gaining more and more independence and ability to take care of themselves, think for themselves and all that.  Yet what I, how I handle them, because of the way I feel about things, is just the opposite, is making them more and more dependent on me and worried about what I'll think of them.</p>

<p>(Pause) And something that I did today which is bothering me, because I feel I took advantage of my position and as authority — uhm, one boy who has found it hard to sort of fit into group things and not always do just what he wants, uhm, I know really is very concerned about what other people think of him.  And today he kept doing the wrong thing at the wrong time and talking out and so forth.  And it didn't seem my speaking to him alone did any good.  And I think if I'd been in a better mood I wouldn't have done this, but finally I just felt so mad that I sort of scolded him in front of the others in a way that I knew would be embarrassing to him because I felt that was the only way I knew to get any control over him.  And yet at the same time I was feeling angry at myself for doing it because I think it was a misuse of the power that I had.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I began to think of the time when — just now I was — of the time when I won't be there and sort of speculating if FHYZ takes my place at all, which she'll probably do some of the time, uhm, that she'll have no trouble this way that I've been having trouble.  Almost as if I'm expecting criticism of something I'm doing or a comment this class really isn't the way you've said it is at all.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I keep feeling I, well I was thinking about school then and some other little thing I could do with grouping children and I have this feeling there are things that I might just as well have thought of earlier today, but I'm thinking of them now almost as a way to avoid thinking about something else, and then I had that thought, then I also remembered that I was supposed to call the admitting office at the hospital today.  And I finally remembered it this morning when I had a few minutes that I could have done it.  But I had sort of not thought about it earlier when I might have had a better time for going to do it.  And then I just said well I guess I'll do it tomorrow because I want, I want to get a cup of coffee.  So it really seemed as if I were putting that off too and not thinking about it.</p>

<p>(Silence) I just started thinking of something else that was disturbing whenever I thought of it today, uhm, regarding my assistant.  Because lately I think I've been comparing how FBS is with hers and their relationship to my relationship with mine.  And just like I was saying with the children, it seems with her too, it's I'm not looking at her as an individual at all.  It's just we have a business relationship and I'm, I don't know, sometimes I think I must seem very bossy.  And it's almost as if I don't know how to be any other way.</p>

<p>(Silence) It's funny that — I was just thinking that my thinking about my relationship with my assistant bothered me.  Particularly today because I almost felt that, well I did feel that she was happier with FBS and her assistant or with her assistant, either way or both ways.  And uhm I think I've been feeling that way for some time.  But today I thought of it more and then at one point she mentioned something that they had done in FBS's room, which I immediately took as almost a criticism of the fact well, "We aren't doing nice things like that; you should take that idea from them and do it too."  And I'm sure she didn't mean it that way, but that was — immediately I jumped to that assumption.  And, I almost felt like either saying well that's not so great or well, I do that too.  I've done that other years, just to sort of prove myself.  And what happened was, I realized that was the reaction I was having so I didn't say that.  But I didn't say, I couldn't say anything like, yes weren't they nice, or something like that.</p>

<p>(4-minute silence) I was thinking for another time of just another type of activity I could do at school.  And when I realized it, I began to wonder if I'm not trying to think of things I can do that I think, well, would be, either make the class go better or help me more, but mainly that it would somehow mean I was a better teacher.  And, as if I'm, by thinking, well, I can do this, building myself up because I don't know, somehow I have this feeling I've go to make myself better.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, that's right.  That's the theme of your whole feeling today.  Again as though there is something wrong with you and you need to make it up — and one way of getting control over these boys now, thinking of things that will convince FHYZ and FBS what a good teacher you are and so on.  But behind it is this central assumption that you're — something is wrong with you.  Hence you're left-out, you're on the outside looking in at other people.  You feel jealous, envious of their relationships.  But behind that is this same assumption.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) When you say that, it makes me think of 2 things.  First, when you were pointing out that the basic assumption is that something is wrong with me, I immediately started thinking about how when I was younger and I had things like, i don't know, something wrong with my feet.  I can't remember, I mean I literally had things wrong with me that I had to go to doctors to have fixed.  I was knock-kneed and then I think I had low arches or something and then my teeth had to be, my jaw had to be enlarged before I had my second teeth and then I had to wear glasses first in the family and, and then finally I had, and I had several accidents and finally I had the one where I had to go to the hospital.  And later I used to think why was I picked to be the one to have all these things wrong with me?  But it seems like that was just sort of an outlet for feeling,another way of something being wrong with me.</p>

<p>And then MSCZ last night was just sort of teasing me and saying, "Do you realize just in the last few weeks these are all the things you thought might be wrong with you?"  And it came because of the fact that I have a cold and he just doesn't believe that I'm really sick, which may be true.  I mean it may be true that I wouldn't have been sick except for the fact that I wanted to be.  So it seems like I'm always taking physical things now, being afraid of physical things, so I don't have to face what I really think is wrong with me.</p>

<p>And then I thought when you said that about being on the outside looking at other people's relationships and being jealous, I don't recall feeling that way about my parents but that's what I immediately thought of when you said that.  I was being outside their bedroom door and the door being shut.  And really feeling as if I were intruding if I ever went into their bedroom.  So that I hated to even knock on the door and talk through the door.  But I didn't ever feel that way when it was just my mother there, because I don't think she shut the door very often when she was there.  Even if she were taking a nap she left it open.  But I think even if it had been shut I wouldn't have felt that way.  But it was when my father was there or when they both were there that I hated going in.  And I think to some extent even though they're living in a different house now, I still, I think I'd feel that way in the bedroom.  And sometimes I've had to sleep in a room that adjoins their bathroom and I almost feel like I'm intruding when they're not even there and I'm using their bathroom.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because saying that just made me think of something I used to wonder a lot when I was younger.  Uhm, well I suppose mainly because my father would be so upset at the thought we might come in and see him in any kind of an undressed state.  And I used to wonder what he did when he used the bathroom that he and my mother shared, if he became as hysterical over her being there when he, well, was using the toilet or taking a shower, anything.  And it was hard to imagine his being able to have her around since he felt so violently about us.</p>

<p>And that makes me think of MLWZ.  And well one reason why I was anxious that he be a boy was so that I'd get to see what a penis was like, although I know I've, i had at that point seen them before at school.  Because I know that uhm, well, I'm sure at nursery school we shared, we had one common bathroom.  And I'm quite sure I remember kindergarten or some type of play group where boys and girls were using the same bathroom.  And I remember being interested then, but with MLWZ I wanted him to be a boy so I could see his penis and then I wanted to change him all the time when he was born, just so I could have an excuse to look at it.  Or I'd like to watch him being bathed because then I could look at it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I think of the fact that I think I was always curious to know what my father was so anxious to hide.  But later as he, I mean he's not quite the same way now as he used to be with us around, because he'll appear in his shorts and not be upset.  Whereas before he had to have practically his full suit on in order to have anybody look at him.  But I'm always now afraid I might see something.  (Pause) It's almost as if I've wanted to for so long and I then thought I shouldn't want to as badly so now I'm afraid of it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I started thinking about some boys at school who I had to scold today because of a rule we have involving the use of the bathroom at school.  And I don't think I see any connection except that it happened in the bathroom.  And all they were, I mean, all it was was that it's a very small one so we limit it to 2 boys at one time.  And 3 were in there.  And it was 2, 2 of the 3 boys who are always doing things, one to get away with it, and one just because I think it's very hard for him to do things very long the right way.  But I just got, I don't know, I feel now when I think about it I was much more angry than I should have been, as most things made me today.</p>

<p>And then I, I just started thinking of where we are in the steps of teaching reading and the fact that I'm probably behind where I should be in comparison to what FHYZ used to do when she taught.  And sort of immediately thinking of something involving competition again.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I thought of the fact that well, when I thought of competition it made me think of my brother and where he used to have his bath was in the bathroom.  And then I just began to get the feeling that there was something I didn't want to think about.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Sorry, I didn't understand where you used to have what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where he used to ha—, be bathed when he was little.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I wanted to go watch was in the bathroom.  And then I began to wonder if I had always, or just wondering when did my father feel we weren't getting along?  And or did, was I always reacting to him in a way that we didn't get along?  Because I'm sure that my reaction was just simply because he wasn't giving me what I wanted.  And that made me think of the boy who bothered me particularly today and who always does when I'm in this kind of mood.  Because it almost seems like that's parallel to my father's relationship and mine. When I don't give him what he wants, he just acts up.  And what he wants is recognition as an individual, so seems like it's perfectly parallel.  And it's really frightening to see that the same thing that I've always held against my father I'm doing to somebody else.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this is going to sound completely neurotic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I made a list of complaints.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like about life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that it's more because I need to get this stuff down on paper, maybe. But also because I wanted to focus a little bit on what's really bothering me. And it turns out that it's a lot. Like up until here, up until there, [is all Franklin] and it's a big issue for me right now. Because obviously we're in a relationship and we live together, and we're trying to make things work, and like he might propose soon. Like these are big things, and I talked to him about them a little bit [kind of amounting to] the last time that we met and things that have been bothering me. The whole idea of raising the stakes if we get engaged, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>[01:05.8]</p>

<p>And now it's just become bigger, I guess, for me. Everything is amplified. Every little thing that's bothering me is amplified. Now my best friend Amanda (sp?), who is married to somebody who I would not want to be married to, just in terms of how he acts and whatever. And like she kept sending me texts about feeling upset this past weekend. And she kept sending me examples of why I'm making a big deal out of things, and we all have to get used to things in relationships.</p>

<p>For example, "I'm five months pregnant with his child, and he can't even come and bring the car to me to get groceries, and I have to do the groceries by myself." I'm like, "I wouldn't accept that shit." But she's just like "This is what I have to learn to live with." Like "Okay, for you." And like how he didn't say Happy Mother's Day, and I guess he did have something waiting for her later, but he didn't say Happy Mother's Day or anything and she'd been working all day. I was like "I wouldn't accept that shit." But she does.</p>

<p>[01:59.5]</p>

<p>And then my other best friend is, of course, the opposite like "No, of course not. You shouldn't have to settle for anything." Here's an example — there are so many. I had my big event last weekend. It went perfectly. I mean, it went off without a hitch, everything was beautiful, everybody was happy. I mean, the one thing that went bad is that we forgot water in the first panel. We got water last minute, and we had to run down with plastic. That's okay, big deal.</p>

<p>So I get home — no, he comes to pick me up on Saturday afternoon when the event ended around three. He had come to pick me up and I had flowers and other shit, and I didn't want to take the car that day. I felt bad because he didn't — granted, I didn't start to offer up any information, but I guess I kind of expected — and I guess I expected too much — that he would say "Oh my God babe, you're done. Congratulations. How did it go?" Nothing.</p>

<p>[03:00.8]</p>

<p>I felt like he was being standoffish. He was asking like what I wanted to do, and I was like "Go home and nap." And he was like "Well, it's a nice day out." And I was like "Well, you can go and do something." He said "I thought you wanted to spend the day with me." So anyway, we go home. I don't say anything. I take a little nap, and I end up waking up feeling upset and bringing it up to him. He's fallen asleep and he's waking up, and I bring it up to him how I was just hurt that he didn't say anything.</p>

<p>He said that I'm being unfair and that I make up these scenarios in my head, and he's supposed to abide by them but how does he know, I don't even say anything about the event. Like he was waiting for me to bring it up. And it turns into a huge fight about our relationship. Basically, it's just another example of me not really knowing how to or figuring out an approach. Like I'm literally looking at my notes because I have so many things in my brain that are bothersome that I can't even remember.</p>

<p>[04:02.6]</p>

<p>But first of all, everything ends up getting turned around on me. And every argument about our relationship, everything gets turned around on me. Like it's my problem. First of all, he says things like "I don't care about this relationship anymore," things like that, when we're in the heat of these arguments. That's a really powerful thing to say, even if we are having an emotional relationship talk or whatever argument about whatever. To say "I'm leaving, I'm done, I don't care," for me that feels like a really powerful thing to say, and I don't really say it. I don't really say it. I don't say things like "I want to end this relationship" or anything like that, even in the heat of the moment. Because if I say that, I want to mean it.</p>

<p>He started telling me how these are the reasons why it's so difficult to live with me. I don't seem to have any ambition. I always say I'm going to start something, and then I never follow through. Like "You say you're going to work more on the wedding business, you say you want to get into photography, you say you want to get more into fitness, you say you want to learn this or that kind of dance, and you don't do it. That's really upsetting for me."</p>

<p>[05:09.0]</p>

<p>Okay, first of all, as if I don't put enough pressure on myself to get all that shit that I say I'm going to do done? Like to have somebody else basically telling me like "It affects me big time that you don't do this" is really frustrating. And also to say that I don't seem to have any ambition, and this coming from somebody who failed a class and got dropped from the school and didn't tell me until later, and hasn't gotten his shit together to get it fixed yet. And who procrastinates on all sorts of fucking different things. Like, "I'm going to get my photography business started." But then, really? "Oh, I'm going to go out and take some shots today," and doesn't go. I mean, like, okay, pot - kettle.</p>

<p>[06:01.1]</p>

<p>And he's always saying how negative I am and how I'm so stressed out, and how that makes him stressed out when he shouldn't have to feel stressed out. And he doesn't know why he's so stressed out, and it's because of me. You know, it just feels hypocritical and it just feels unfair that he's turning everything around on me in these conversations. I mean, it's hard enough that I can't figure out a way to approach things with him in a way that doesn't turn into an argument, or doesn't turn into him being defensive about me attacking him.</p>

<p>But then when I do feel like I do have a way to tell him I was upset about something, like about (inaudible at 06:33.9), and it still gets turned on me like I'm the psychopath and whatever. And then it starts fucking with my brain, and I can't determine what is actually inappropriate about how I behaved and what is him making me feel bad. It all just feels really shitty and really unhealthy.</p>

<p>The trust issues from the beginning I haven't seem to be able to let go of. The issues with drinking and that I worry about his drinking in the sense that, first of all, I don't think that it's normal to drink every night. Like, I just don't. Or maybe that's just what I prefer. Like I don't want somebody that drinks every night.</p>

<p>[07:11.1]</p>

<p>And second of all, he always will say "Oh, I'm going to take a little break from drinking." But he can't even do that. "I'm just going to have a nip and have a cocktail." Or "I'm just going to have a little wine." But he drinks these big glasses of wine, then he'll drink a glass of wine before bed. I can't stand the smell. He'll forget to brush his teeth or whatever. Like drink some wine before bed. First of all, I don't like the smell. It's gross anyway. And second of all, it really reminds me of my mother because she drank red wine most of the time. I can't take it.</p>

<p>And so then in bed it pulls me away from him because I'm like trying to talk to him when he's laying down, and I smell red wine and I'm like yuck. And that feels shitty to literally feel disgusted by your partner because of that. And again about, "You say you're going to do things and you don't follow through." Okay, how about saying you're going to take a break from drinking and then you never fucking can? What does that say to me? Like okay, maybe I shouldn't be nervous that you're going to have the same problem as my mother, but it's upsetting to me and I don't know how to approach it without it turning into a fight like it always has.</p>

<p>[08:10.9]</p>

<p>And then, okay, this weekend, he was away. I had my lovely weekend, but of course I got food poisoning by eating a fucking Nathan's hot dog at Coney Island with Amanda during the week. I went home early on Friday. She texted me that she was throwing up all day. I wasn't throwing up, it was just severe stomach pain. So I was in bed all day Friday, all day Saturday, and only started to feel better yesterday. So that sucked.</p>

<p>But anyway, he was away and I was texting him here and there. I texted him on Saturday at like six, like "Hey, how's it going?" I didn't hear back from him until the next day at noon. I had been calling and texting him like "What the hell?" He's like "I'm really sorry. My phone was super duper dead, and by the time it was charged it was midnight, and we were on our way trying to figure out where the after-party was." And I go "Then why didn't you just text me back at midnight?" He's like "I figured you'd be sleeping." I said "But if you turned on your phone and saw 10 texts from me in a row — like, 'hi, all is well, drunk as shit.' Like, I don't care.</p>

<p>[09:12.4]</p>

<p>And I said "It feels really hypocritical because you get on me if I leave my phone inside the house and you're calling me and I don't answer my phone." He's like "Yeah, but you do that all the time. This is one time." I'm like "Oh please. Come on. It still feels hypocritical." And if I were away and hadn't texted him back, and told him it was because I was getting drunk like going to a party with my friends, he would've been like "So? It takes like two seconds to text back." And he was getting super irate that I was going on about it. I'm like "This is a big deal. It matters, you know?"</p>

<p>So I'm like all worried about this stuff, and this is a lot of stuff. This is a lot of stuff that's bothering me. Every little fucking thing is bothering me. And then I was irritated with him talking about the dancing last night. What did I write? I wrote — first of all, I feel like he doesn't take too much of an interest in things that I'm doing anymore. Case in point, the advisory committee. That was a big fucking deal to me. Like, yes, I really did expect the first thing for him to say was "Oh my God, thank God you're finished."</p>

<p>[10:14.7]</p>

<p>I'm sorry, you know how much I've been working on this. And if you don't, then you haven't fucking been paying attention. I can't seem to stand to listen to him talk about his stuff. I get kind of snippy and mean about it, and it's not fair to him or me, me doing that. And I wish I could pinpoint and stop it, but I can't. Everything is annoying me, but I love him and I don't really know.</p>

<p>Oh, and then today he's like "This trip made me really decide that I want to do dancing as my career." I was like "Okay," and obviously I gave him some words of support and ideas of how he could do that, like spend more time practicing, blah blah blah. But in my head, I'm like "Hmmm." Like, I really don't believe in it, and it feels bad to feel that way. I really don't think he's going to be able to make a career out of that, and I want to believe that for him. Maybe I would if I weren't feeling so annoyed by all these other things. Maybe I wouldn't.</p>

<p>[11:12.3]</p>

<p>It's just a lot of bullshit that's making me become somebody that I'm not really wanting to be in a relationship. Like being that snippy person. I mean, I say that it's not fair to him, and it isn't. But also I think that a lot of the stuff that's making me so upset is not fair to me. (pause)</p>

<p>So yeah, that's my verbal dump right there. (chuckles) I just — this stuff has been bothering me, and I literally came into work this morning and I was like I have got to get this down on paper for myself. All these things are floating around in my head, and I'm not really sure what to do with them.</p>

<p>We have this trip coming up. I'm leaving on Wednesday. He's coming Friday through Monday. I'm a little worried, like what if he's going to propose? What if he has some plan? And then I'm worried because I'm having all these issues. What if the trip goes really really well, and then we get home and this shit is the same? What if I'm equally annoyed, like I am at home, on this trip and it doesn't go well?</p>

<p>[12:20.5]</p>

<p>I'm just kind of really freaking out about stuff and not sure what to do with it, and not sure if it's real big stuff that means this is not the person for me, or if it's circumstantial stuff. (pause) I mean, not being able to communicate and then turning things around on me in an argument, that's a serious thing for me. Like, it's not okay. I need to be able to talk to you about something. (pause) It's quite the quandary. (pause)</p>

<p>[13:16.2]</p>

<p>It also feels like I'm pushing myself away from him, in some respects. Like in terms of being snippy and just kind of being annoyed at talking about acting. Like, "Hey, you're not in college. Don't use terminology I can't understand." And that's not me. That's not how I usually react, so there has to be something else going on, it feels like. (pause)</p>

<p>And I guess there's the other issue of like starting to think about the fact that we are on different — I don't know — career, educational, or social levels. Like honestly, he probably won't ever catch up to me.</p>

<p>[14:24.1]</p>

<p>I'm getting a little bit worried about what that might imply, especially with all this craziness about his career, and that he wants to pursue acting but has to do a day job in the meantime, so he's going to work really hard and do this. And he also wants his Associate's Degree and figure out a Bachelor's Degree that can work in drama.</p>

<p>This is stuff I was doing years ago, you know? I mean, I'm still doing a little bit of it now. But for the most part, things are going really well for me. Yeah, I was feeling really stagnant in my job, but we have all these conferences coming up, which is great. I had my annual review today with my manager, which was really amazing. I had [leading performance] in every category except two. One of which was talking about being frustrated, being visibly frustrated when I'm frustrated (chuckles), which my boss has the same issue with. So that we were able to talk about.</p>

<p>[15:12.8]</p>

<p>She told me that one of the things she wants to do to kind of keep me not feeling she's going to lose me, is to create some more opportunities for events and conferences within the region. So this would create a huge opportunity for me in terms of working with our donors and trustees as well as traveling to the region itself and making myself a presence there.</p>

<p>So these big things are happening, and these big things are going to continue happening for me. And he's always going to be x-amount of steps behind. So there's also that aspect. Maybe that has something to do with him not congratulating me on the event. Maybe there was some level of resentment or even like "She doesn't need props on it. She just got props from everybody else." And worrying about that too. Because is that going to have an effect on our everything? Like do I need to (inaudible) that's been to college?</p>

<p>[16:15.4]</p>

<p>It seems petty, but now that all these other little things are annoying me, these kind of other things that other people have noticed, but I've kind of disregarded, are coming to the forefront and making me feel concerned. And I guess I'm just not sure how to handle it in terms of — [by you]. I'm mean, I'm just not — and at the end of this big fight we had, where the conclusion was that I needed to change everything and he needed to just continue doing what he's doing. I mean, I do agree that I need to follow through on things I say I want to do, and if I want to do it I need to actually do it.</p>

<p>But at the end of the conversation, literally, I was left crying like I need to change my whole life. And he was left sitting there telling me "Well, I'm there to support you, and I believe in you." And that's kind of shitty. Like wait, how did this happen? I thought we were talking about issues. Why is it only me now, you know?</p>

<p>[17:25.0]</p>

<p>But I literally can't bring it up without it turning into a confrontation about me and my issues. I mean, even the issues about — even the not calling me thing turned into "You're always bringing up old stuff from the past." And I don't know why he's doing that. I don't know why he does that. I don't know why he does that. And I really don't know what to think of it. I mean, he's said all these damaging things like "I don't care about this relationship, and I can't take it anymore" and all this stuff. And at the end of the day, it's "I love you so much. I want this to work."</p>

<p>At one point in the conversation I said "Okay, so I guess I'll spend all the time I need to fix everything that's wrong with me, and then we'll see if you want to stick around. Does that sound about right?" and he's like "Yep." Like, okay. I'm not sure that's how that was supposed to go. I don't know. I'm having trouble dealing with it. (long pause)</p>

<p>[20:15.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's sort of a lot (inaudible) something that I think I get a sense of. It's like that to some extent, you have a hard time believing or feeling that deeply in what you're saying about what's going on with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you mean? (pause)</p>

<p>[21:27.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you have a list of things that you're upset about, most to do with him, and it's evident that stuff really bothers you and that you're kind of worked up about it. (pause) At the same time, I guess I sort of have a sense that I don't feel like you fully believe it.</p>

<p>[22:34.1]</p>

<p>But maybe there's some degree of conviction or passion about what's going on that you, I don't know, somehow don't seem to have about it. In spite of how much of what you're describing clearly matters, I guess I'm trying to sort out what to make of that. (pause)</p>

<p>[23:52.0]</p>

<p>It sounds like you're describing ways he's kind of leaving you on your own, or is sort of not there for you and not listening to what you have to say. They sound like fairly profound issues in the relationship and in a way, in your way. (pause) I don't know, but I guess it seems to me it's hard for you to have a conviction about all that. I guess I'm wondering if that's also related to how he's able to turn your discussions about it around pretty completely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it. I think because I end up second-guessing myself because even telling you this now, it's like how much of that is actually in my head, and how much of that is me being a bitch, and how much of that is me reacting incorrectly. Because these are the things he tells me when we have these arguments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe some of what you feel more deeply is a kind of doubt or worry about how much you deserve these things in the first place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like deserve being treated nicely and being able to have a normal conversation with your boyfriend?</p>

<p>[25:55.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To really have him take you seriously about his drinking, for him to sort of be attentive in certain ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think what you're seeing there is maybe my fear that these are things that I need to make the decision that this is a relationship that I want to be in about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean that you expect yourself to be treated badly or think that you should be treated badly. I'm wondering if partly because you say that's what you grew up with, it's hard to have conviction that these are all things that you can have and deserve in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For sure. I mean, there's also coming from a divorced home with a brother who is so troubled, with my mom and the drinking, my dad being an asshole. Yeah, for sure, I think that's definitely not something that I could have picked up on, but I understand why you did.</p>

<p>[27:09.6]</p>

<p>But I do think that some of it is from the very real fear that these are things that I'm not willing to take in a relationship, mixed with a fear of maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is, and I'm not going to find anybody who is so perfect. But that again, I think, mixes with the theory of maybe I feel subconsciously I don't deserve all of that. I mean, look, if this were my friend telling me "I had an argument and he turns everything around on me, and I hate that he drinks even when I told him it makes me uncomfortable, and he still does it before bed," I would probably be like "I don't think you should be with him." So to think about it that way, it's confusing.</p>

<p>[27:56.6]</p>

<p>And I even asked him if he would consider going to any therapy sessions together at all, to kind of have a venue where we could — "Nope. Never. I will never do that." I mean, with so much conviction that it was actually insulting to me. And I think he almost aimed it, you know, like "I don't need therapy. I don't do therapy. You can do your therapy." (pause)</p>

<p>It all just kind of feels bad. It all just feels bad. (pause) I really don't know what to do to try and fix it. (pause) And I think he thinks it's all fine after we have these conversations, where it's ended with me saying all these things I'm going to do and change and fix and work on. Like I said, that night he was "I believe in you, babe. I believe in you."</p>

<p>[29:02.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of what you're saying is you're really worried you might leave him over this stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, not so much the career advancement issue, because I think many relationships have uneven educational levels or career levels or incomes or whatever. I don't think that's something that should decide my relationship. But I think our personal interactions should, and I think that being able to have a discussion with the person that loves you about how drinking is a sensitive subject, shouldn't be turned back on me. I'm not your mother. Not everyone is your mother. This is your own issue. She doesn't even have an issue with it. I mean, that shouldn't happen. Like you should be sensitive to that. I'm sorry. I really feel strongly about that, you know?</p>

<p>[30:04.3]</p>

<p>And maybe that's how they work in their family, but I've told him that's not how I work. But he's continually not — and even last night, he was like having a glass of wine before bed. I was like "I'm surprised you still want to drink after your weekend." And he says "Oh, my body is hurting." Like that's always the excuse. "I just want a glass of wine to relax." I don't know. [I get that's scary for me]. I really don't want to live with somebody who is going to drink every night. I'm sorry, even if it is one glass. I don't want that. I don't like the smell. It's all the time. Like, I don't drink it all the time. There are nights when it's nice to go out for a glass of wine or get a bottle of wine and have a glass. But if we go out, he's (inaudible 30:50.8) I'll have, you know, [a glass] and he'll have two or two and a half of those. It's like, that's not just having a glass of wine, but he's not able to see that.</p>

<p>[31:08.6]</p>

<p>And yeah, so these are issues that I'm concerned that if they aren't resolved, or if I don't think that we're able to communicate about them in a way that allows us to have a discussion as opposed to an argument, or a who-blames-who discussion, then yeah, I'm definitely afraid that these are things that will become — whether or not we get engaged. I mean, if we're engaged, that's not married.</p>

<p>And I also feel like he thinks that after we have these things that shit is sweet, and then he's onto bigger things like how he's going to become a fucking actor or I don't know what the fuck. When I told him I had a really great review today, he definitely said "That's awesome." I told him about the opportunities that might create, and he said "Wow, that's so cool." I'm not sure how much resentment is mixed with that, because he just finished talking about how he wants to travel more for acting and this and that. And then here I am, going to travel for a career that I'm really enjoying.</p>

<p>[32:15.4]</p>

<p>I do feel strongly that I deserve somebody that is going to be happy for me, genuinely happy and not happy with a side of "How can I do that too?" Because it's not about you, in that situation. And maybe part of it is feeling that if I was with somebody who was further along in their career and what they wanted to do, that they would be more able to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like be excited for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because they have things going on in their own life that they feel excited about. Whereas I think he doesn't feel like he has too much. It's all very complicated and too adult for my taste, and I think that's another part of it. I'm just like, this is just not stuff that I've really dealt with in my other relationships because they've been a year or less. It's like I don't really have to tackle these huge issues because I've not felt strongly enough about these other people that I would even consider — well, maybe consider — but would fight for a future with.</p>

<p>[33:27.4]</p>

<p>And, so yeah, it's definitely a little, well very, nerve-racking. We have this trip, and my goal is to really just try and leave issues at home and just really try to enjoy being together. I've never been there and he's been there before, so he can share some of what he saw before. And really I'm just going to concentrate on having a nice time. We'll be seeing some friends. Great. But I don't think that's going to be a band aid. Or maybe it's a temporary fix, but it's definitely not going to address these issues.</p>

<p>I get about the drinking. Like, okay, you decided instead of texting me back that you're alive, when your phone is charged, to just get drunk and forget. He can get really really drunk. Granted I can too, who can't, whatever.</p>

<p>[34:27.2]</p>

<p>But he acts really — like he gets a little crazy when he's drunk. So I know he was just partying and whatever and running around, and he likes to be the life of the party and gets crazy. I don't love it. I know that's exactly what was happening. Meanwhile I'm like okay, did he go to jail, what's up? So this has all been coming to a head, and then with the whole advisory committee thing, between that and the thing this weekend has just really not given me any space to figure out what I want — I just don't know how to approach it.</p>

<p>[35:24.8]</p>

<p>And like the drinking. Like last night, I was like "I want to brush my teeth" and he's like "Okay." I was like "Are you just going to finish your juice or whatever" and he's like "Yeah." And then he didn't brush his teeth, and I didn't want to be near his breath. Like that sucks. I would like to make out with my boyfriend a little bit after not seeing him for days. But I was totally turned off. And not only is it gross, kind of, (inaudible at 35:54.8) but again the smell really reminds me of my mother and her drinking issues. He can't understand why this is a connection that I continue — he blames me for holding onto that connection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like "One thing has nothing to do with the other." He doesn't understand why people getting drunk or drinking too much red wine or drinking too much in general affects me in terms of my childhood with an alcoholic parent.</p>

<p>[36:35.1]</p>

<p>The fact that he doesn't even take the time to try to figure out why that might affect me still, and just says it's a personality issue on my part, is fucking retarded. (pause) So then I guess along with everything else, there's this pent-up anger. I mean, when we had that conversation after the advisory committee, I was literally like well, maybe we'll just break up. And maybe that's just what needs to happen, and it's going to be complicated because he was like "I don't care about this relationship, and you have all this shit I can't deal with." It's like well, maybe that's what's going to happen. And I was kind of like accepting it.</p>

<p>And then no, he comes back and wants to work it out. Okay, fine. But can we actually work it out? Or is everything going to be this? I haven't obviously really tried to address anything with him, other than the non-texting thing which blew up in my face also. So I'm not sure what's going to happen on this trip and the days between, because I won't see him from Wednesday morning until Friday night too.</p>

<p>[37:50.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess [in a way] you sort of don't want to necessarily think about what could follow from having these issues not be resolved. But you don't want to think about not being able to deal with them with him, and then having to make a choice about whether to stay with him in spite of them or anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And how to actually bring up that these are big deals to me without it being like "Well, forget you" kind of thing or whatever to me. Like "You have too many issues. I can't deal with this anymore." And actually say "No, I love you. There are so many things that I love. These things I don't love, and I would really like to work on them."</p>

<p>[38:57.5]</p>

<p>But he has this function of being so defensive that I can't get anywhere. It's like talking to a wall that bounces back balls at you. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. We have to stop in a minute. I mean, it seems to me that you'd like to have some sort of strategy from me as to how to take them up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be helpful, I think, to talk about something. I mean obviously we just spent the time talking about what the issues are, and I think it would be helpful next session to kind of recap what happened on my trip, and talk about some things that could be helpful.</p>

<p>[40:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, the only thing I can think of in that regard is that I think you're worried about — maybe that you're sort of worried about how serious these issues are for you, and the way they could lead to your breaking up with him might make it a little harder to take them up, but in a way that he kind of feels that, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. For sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Other than that, you know, I don't know. I'm certainly happy to talk about other ways you could approach it with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that will be helpful. I think that especially after taking this trip together and seeing how that goes, but I do think it would be helpful to try to talk about that stuff.</p>

<p>[40:58.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. (pause) Okay, so next week the time we had, I think, 12:30 isn't so good for me just for that one week. Some other times I could do are Wednesday morning, if that's any good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday the 30th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I arrive at five a.m. after a red-eye on the 30th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you probably don't want to come right here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. Let me get back to you. Another alternative would be to do Monday the following week and then also Friday, double-up that week. Let me send you an e-mail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I'm pretty free.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The rest of the week, alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But after Wednesday of next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. Have a good trip.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright, I'll see you soon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye.</p>

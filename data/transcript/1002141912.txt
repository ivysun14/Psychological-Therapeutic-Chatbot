<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>Note: The following is condensed verbatim material from six sessions. The client had been seen for 3 sessions prior to this case material for problems related to depression.</p>

<p>The Client: A 43 year-old male with an MBA degree, married with 2 children ages 16 (boy) and 12 (girl). He works for a bank in the mortgage department and indicates that while he doesn't like his job, it pays very well and he's been quite successful. He has never been in therapy before. He's not on any medications for a depression that has lasted a year before he came to therapy after his family doctor referred him. There are no physical reasons for the depression according to the family doctor who said that the client refused to take anti-depressants because he feared they would interfere with his sexual performance. He has never experienced depression before and says that he has been physically and emotionally healthy throughout his life. He has no idea why he became depressed and indicates that there were no precipitating events or traumas.</p>

<p><u>Session 4:</u></p>

<p>Therapist (T): I think we've come to a place in our work where you might want to do some reading. I have several suggestions for novels and films that might provide some substantial awareness of how people view mid-life crises in literature and films.</p>

<p>Client (C): Fictional people? Will that have anything to do with me?</p>

<p>T: I think so. It's been the experience of a lot of my clients that certain books and films give them added understanding of their lives.</p>

<p>C: I watch films and TV all the time but it doesn't help my depression any.</p>

<p>T: Yes, that may be true, but I have several suggestions of books and films that have helped others. Want to give it a try?</p>

<p>C: I guess.</p>

<p>T: One of the issues you deal with a lot is the feeling that you don't do enough for your family, and that as a man, you should be a better provider.</p>

<p>C: Yes that's true. I feel that pretty often.</p>

<p>T: Two films I'd like to suggest that I know are out on video are Prince of Tides and The Great Santini. Both films are powerful and can be enjoyed for their quality and dramatic impact and both are about men  dealing with how to be a good father and husband. I think you'll be touched by both films.</p>

<p>C: Ok, I'm willing to watch them but will we talk about it after?</p>

<p>T: Yes we will, and if you'd like, you can send me an e-mail after you watch each film and tell me how the films affected you and if you gained any insights from watching them. If so, maybe you can mention what the insights were and how you might apply them to your situation. We'll use those reactions as a basis for our next discussion. Fair enough?</p>

<p>C: Yes. I'd like to do that but you also said novels. You know I'm not much of a reader.</p>

<p>T: I think a novel you'd like and one with great sensitivity to men is The Sports Writer by Richard Ford. You can order that on Amazon.com for very little money. </p>

<p>C: Is it about sports?</p>

<p>T: In a way, but it's also about men who make decisions about work and what they like doing as opposed to what pays well and the effect it has on families.</p>

<p>C: That sounds a lot like my situation, being in a job I don't like but one that pays well and the binds that gets you in.</p>

<p>T: Yes, in many ways it's about that very thing.</p>

<p>C: But it's a novel. It's not about a real person.</p>

<p>T: That's true, but novelists observe the world and often their characters are very real and give us awareness of the way many people act in our society.</p>

<p>C: I haven't read a novel since college. I don't know if I can stick with a novel. Since my depression began it's all I can do to get through the day.</p>

<p>T: Yes, but having the book handy, you might find one day that you're in the mood to read it. So let's start with the 2 videos.</p>

<p>C: OK.</p>

<p><u>Session 5:</u></p>

<p>The client watched Prince of Tides and wrote the therapist the following e-mail, which was then used as a basis for discussion in the next session.</p>

<p>The e-mail: Boy, I thought I was in bad shape but the Nick Nolte character was really in terrible shape. I guess I felt more positive seeing how he improved so much and was able to return to his family and job after some therapy. In his case the depression seemed to have been caused by something terrible that happened to him when he was a boy. I don't think that's the case with me. One day I was fine and the next day I was depressed, so I came away from it feeling that the Nick Nolte character wasn't like me at all. I began to wonder why this happened to me. I know we've talked about it before but I started trying to remember if anything happened to me when I was a kid that would affect me as an adult. Maybe it's a small thing, but when me dad left us I was just a kid. I don't even remember him but what I remember was this feeling of being different from the other kids and how poor�no, that's not the right word� how pathetic that made me feel. Abandoned. It's a terrible feeling. I think I feel abandoned by my family now. They don't seem very caring and supportive, and I can tell how sick they are of my inability to snap out of my depression. It's just a thought. What do you think?</p>

<p>Session 6 centered on this insight.</p>

<p>T: You said in your e-mail that the way you felt as a child when your father left is similar to the way you feel your family is responding to your depression. Could you elaborate?</p>

<p>C: I think I feel demeaned by my wife and kids. I feel that all they care about is me as a provider and that me as a man with feeling and vulnerabilities doesn't count for much.</p>

<p>T: Have you shared that with them?</p>

<p>C: No.</p>

<p>T: Why?</p>

<p>C: I think they'd pack up and leave and then I'd really be abandoned.</p>

<p>T: Or they might surprise you and be much more supportive.</p>

<p>C: I doubt it. </p>

<p>T: Can you explain why you believe that?</p>

<p>C: They give me no support at all. I watched a TV commercial and the dad is just ignored. Worse, when he expresses an opinion he's told by his wife to stick with what he knows best like taking out the garbage. The kids all agree. It pissed me off, that ad, but it's not far from the way things are at home.</p>

<p>T: That must be very tough to deal with.</p>

<p>C: It is. Maybe it's why this depression started. I think I've begun to think of myself as someone who works hard, provides, thinks of others before he thinks of himself, and gets nothing in return.</p>

<p>T: Have you thought about what you'd like to do about it?</p>

<p>C: I'd like to leave, that's what. I have this feeling of repulsion when I see my wife and my kids. I even wonder if the kids are mine. They don't have any of my qualities, and they go silent when I'm in the room. It's like a big conspiracy with their mom.</p>

<p>T: Do you think the situation at home has contributed to your depressed feelings?</p>

<p>C: Since I saw the video I do. Nick Nolte's wife was supportive and his kids adored him. I have neither and here I'm going through this depression and instead of being caring and positive, it's like I'm a big drag on them.</p>

<p>T: Have you given up the idea of talking to them about the way you feel?</p>

<p>C: I haven't really thought about it until now. Why, do you think it would help? I can't see that it would.</p>

<p>T: It couldn't hurt. At least you'll know for sure how your wife and kids feel instead of assuming the worst.</p>

<p>C: Yeah, I have to think about it. Maybe.</p>

<p><u>Session 7:</u></p>

<p>T: Tell me about your week.</p>

<p>C: Well I did what you suggested. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but it was wasn't so good, either.</p>

<p>T: Tell me about it.</p>

<p>C: They listened, they said they cared but that I'd been depressed for so long they'd begun to feel that I was never going to get better and they had their own lives to think about.</p>

<p>T: How do you feel about what they said?</p>

<p>C: I don't know. They have a point, I guess. After my dad left my mother got depressed and I can remember thinking as a kid what a drag it was and how I didn't like to be around all of her complaining and whining. I mean I loved her and all, but I was a kid and it seemed to me she was being weak and now I feel weak too.</p>

<p>T: As weak as the Nick Nolte character?</p>

<p>W: No, I thought he was strong. The weakness I feel is like the guy in that ad I was mentioning last week. I feel demeaned.</p>

<p>T: By?</p>

<p>C: Myself. No one can make you feel demeaned. It's like I've accepted this definition of myself and now it's become me.</p>

<p>T: And like all definitions, if you change the wording you could also change the definition.</p>

<p>C: Not sure I understand.</p>

<p>T: You've defined yourself as weak and demeaned. You can also define yourself as tough and resilient. You get up in the morning, shower, dress, go to a demanding job, come home, take care of family matters, and all the time you're depressed. I'd say that's pretty heroic.</p>

<p>C: I've never thought of myself as heroic.</p>

<p>T: I do.</p>

<p>C: Because I still function even though I'm depressed?</p>

<p>T: Absolutely.</p>

<p>C: It's heroic to be depressed?</p>

<p>T: It's heroic to be depressed and still function well. It takes enormous energy and self-determination.</p>

<p>C: But knowing that doesn't make me less depressed.</p>

<p>T: But it should. Knowing that you're tough and determined is a good thing. It's something many people lack, and yet you have it. The more you focus on positives, I believe, the more the depression will go away.</p>

<p>C: I don't get that at all.</p>

<p>T: Being depressed often means that you are inundated by negative thoughts about yourself. One way to offset negative thoughts is to do a reality check. It seems to me that you're very successful at work. No one talking to you would ever think you're depressed. You have a strong value system. When I start feeling down, as we all do from time to time, I do a reality check, count the positives, and come out knowing that the positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot. It gives me a different perspective about myself.</p>

<p>C: Like positive thinking?</p>

<p>T: Yes, like that. </p>

<p>C: I do that from time to time, you know, or at least I try. The problem is that this little voice inside of me keeps insisting that I'm a failure.</p>

<p>T: The little voice inside of you is, of course, your voice. It's the voice that insists on focusing on what's wrong about you rather than what's right.</p>

<p>C: I talk to myself?</p>

<p>T: Sure, we all do. It's not always something you're aware of but still, we're always processing information about our lives and making judgments about what we see, hear, and feel. The way we process information can often affect our emotions. Your little voice insists on saying negative things about you when you could easily train it to say something positive.</p>

<p>C: How?</p>

<p>T: Instead of focusing on how badly you feel because you're depressed, and depression is definitely a feeling no one likes, why not say something like, "It's true I feel depressed but I'm able to function at a very high level and that says a great deal about how tough, competent, and resilient I am." Give it a try every time you get intrusive thoughts and see how it works.</p>

<p>C: The Nick Nolte character sort of did the same thing didn't he?</p>

<p>T: That's true, he did.</p>

<p>C: Yeah, OK, I'll give it a try.</p>

<p>T: The first time you try it why not e-mail me with the results. Writing about an experience can often reinforce the positive benefits of the exercise.</p>

<p>C: You don't get tired of reading my e-mails?</p>

<p>T: Not at all. I'm thrilled with the insights you develop when you write.</p>

<p>The E-Mail: "Doc, I did what you said and while I felt foolish, a little light bulb went off in my head. When I say something positive about myself, even though I don't entirely believe it, I feel better�happier, actually. I found myself laughing out loud about the third time I tried it. Is that normal? I mean this isn't a joke or anything. So I'm anxious to tell you more in person and I'll keep trying."</p>

<p><u>Session 8:</u></p>

<p>T: Tell me more about your homework assignment. How did it go?</p>

<p>C: Great�no, good. I still hear a lot of ground noise in my head about what an incompetent jerk I am but then I also hear some positive stuff.</p>

<p>T: Like?</p>

<p>C: Like that I'm a very competent worker and I've gotten raises the past 2 years while most of my co-workers haven't. Like women find me attractive but I just haven't been picking up on it because  I've been so depressed. One woman in particular, and she's a pretty amazing person.</p>

<p>T: Are you thinking of doing something about it?</p>

<p>C: I'd like to but it wouldn't be right and anyhow, I'm in no shape to get involved with anyone. Do you agree?</p>

<p>T: I guess infidelity is a troubling thing to do to anyone and it's also a lapse in our value system that often ends up hurting everyone involved.</p>

<p>C: Yeah, I agree, but still, the male in me is pretty happy that women still find me attractive. I'd stopped thinking that they did.</p>

<p>T: Does it give you a sense of empowerment as far as your wife goes?</p>

<p>C: Yeah, it does.</p>

<p>T: How?</p>

<p>C: It makes me feel less afraid. If the family ups and leaves there are other people to take their place. I know that sounds cold but it's the way I feel.</p>

<p>T: You might want to continue the discussions you started last week about your perceptions of the way they are responding to you. Being positive also means that you have a sense of optimism about your ability to resolve issues in your life.</p>

<p>C: I have to think about it. I'm not so sure I want to resolve anything when there are other people to take the place of the family I've lost.</p>

<p>T: Did you ever watch The Great Santini?</p>

<p>C: I did.</p>

<p>T: How would Santini have handled the situation?</p>

<p>C: He'd have done everything possible to keep his family together.</p>

<p>T: And?</p>

<p>C: Yeah, I see where you're going. It's heroic to keep a family together if you can.</p>

<p>T: I think so.</p>

<p>C: So do I. (Short silence). I guess I'll give it a shot then.</p>

<p>T: Good, I'm glad.</p>

<p>C: Doc, do you think the depression will go away?</p>

<p>T: I think it's already starting to go away.</p>

<p>C: Yeah, I do too, but will it come back or is this just a temporary improvement?</p>

<p>T: Lets hope it's permanent. Let's focus on the gains you're making and the fact that you're feeling better about yourself.</p>

<p>C: Yeah, let's do that.</p>

<p><u>Session 9:</u></p>

<p>T: Tell me about your week.</p>

<p>C: I spoke to my wife for about 2 hours. She said what I'm picking up about her withdrawing from me is accurate, and that she doesn't think things are working for us and suggested a divorce. I wasn't surprised. When we finished talking, I got in the car and drove around and actually felt good. I felt free. I called the lady I've told you about and we met for coffee and discussed the situation and what it meant for us. She said that she had strong feelings for me but that we should wait to get involved until my divorce agreement was finalized because this was a period of time when things could be sort of crazy. She said she wanted us to be close friends until then and she wanted me know that if I needed to talk about the situation at home that she'd always be available and happy to talk to me.</p>

<p>T: What did you think of her suggestion.</p>

<p>C: I thought it made a lot of sense. I don't need sex right now, I need stability and good friends.</p>

<p>T: That makes a lot of sense to me. Have you done anything about the separation from your wife?</p>

<p>C: No, not yet.</p>

<p>T: Could I suggest divorce mediation. That's a process of working with a mental health professional to work out the divorce decree. Once you have it worked out then a divorce lawyer working closely with the mediator can do the necessary legal work. It saves a lot of money and the research I've read says that after several years, most agreements are still in place as opposed to only 20% of the agreements done when opposing lawyers are involved and the proceedings are adversarial.</p>

<p>C: Can you suggest anyone?</p>

<p>T: I have a list of names of people I've been told by my clients and other professionals do a good job. I don't know anyone personally and I want to assure you there are no referral fees involved. You can choose from the list or perhaps shop around.</p>

<p>C: I think my wife wants out of the marriage pretty bad so I think this would be a good way to go. We spoke another time this week about the divorce agreement and she's going to write something up and we'll negotiate from there.</p>

<p>T: That sounds like a very good idea.</p>

<p>C: Yeah, I wasn't surprised when she said she wanted out but I did feel pretty foolish. I mean, getting divorced. Everybody does it. It's like an American ritual.</p>

<p>T: Many people find that the best way to deal with the emotional fallout of divorce is to focus on the good times and on making the divorce itself as rational as possible. I have a number of clients who tell me that when they've handled the divorce in a rational way they've ended up getting along with their ex after the divorce better than when they were married.</p>

<p>C: I hear that in the office. I also hear the people who fight all the time. I wouldn't want that to happen.</p>

<p>T: Do you think your wife will be angry when you and your lady friend become involved?</p>

<p>C: I don't think so. I told her about Linda and she was fine with it. We spoke to the kids and they didn't seem surprised. Jane, my wife, wants to move to Virginia to be close to her family so that might make it tough to see the kids with my living in San Diego, but we'll work it out I'm sure.</p>

<p>T: How are you feeling otherwise?</p>

<p>C: Good. I think the family situation was largely to blame for the depression. When I finally confronted it, I felt a lot less depressed. I think I'm going to be OK. Linda is a very gentle person and wise. Having her in my corner helps a lot and, of course, talking to you has helped. So thank you for that. Do you think I should continue coming to see you since I'm feeling a lot less depressed?</p>

<p>T: Until the divorce is settled and you're on your own, I do think that would be a good idea plus a support group to join for men going through divorces. I know a very good group in town and I'm happy to give you information about the group if you'd like.</p>

<p>C: You mean like AA, sort of?</p>

<p>T: Not really. It's a group run by participants who aren't mental health professionals and who are going through the same things you are. The research says that groups like this one can be very helpful. Why not give it a try?</p>

<p>C: Yeah, I think that might be good, but I'll continue seeing you, doc.</p>

<p>T: Then same time next week and keep the e-mails coming.</p>

<p>C: I will. See you then.</p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>CLIENT: How you doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, how are you doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doing good, yeah. Little stressed out for the holidays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you stressed out about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's different. It's like a family argument going on, I guess. My dad's sister, they come up from Texas after Christmas Day. And usually what our family does is we – usually, just to get together, it's my parents, my brothers, my sisters, my girlfriend. We usually just do that Christmas Day. Well, my dad feels bad because his sister said something to him about another holiday about not inviting her kids and they had nowhere to go and my dad just feels really bad, you know, that they had nowhere to go and he wants to invite them over for dinner on Sunday and we're all against it. There's a lot of tension towards them. I don't know why. It's just, well, one of my cousins, we just don't want anything to do with him and my dad's going to invite him. But my other cousin, like we don't care, we get along. But the whole fact of the matter is we want to be – do what we've been doing for the last couple of years. [00:01:25]</p>

<p>I mean before, when we were younger, we used to go everywhere on Christmas Day. Like Christmas Day we wake up, open our presents, and then next thing you know we go to my mother's mother's and then we go to my dad's mother's or my dad's uncle, my uncles or my aunts. And it was just a busy day of just running around until we finally got older and it was just us. We'd just do dinner, do our own gifts with the family, and just hang out.</p>

<p>So it's kind of frustrating because now my dad wants to have all these people over and we don't want them. You know? So I mean it's real tough. I feel bad for my dad because he wants to do it – he wants to have everybody but we're just like, "Whatever." I mean I'm at the stage right now where I'm just like, "Alright, I'm not ..." – you know, I haven't told him but I don't want to go because I don't want to see those people. You know? I don't want to associate with them. This is our day, it's a family day. I understand that. I understand they're family. But there's people I want to hang out with and I don't want to hang out with. And you know, I do feel bad for my dad because it probably eats him up inside because he – it is what it is. You know? [00:02:44]</p>

<p>And then a couple of days ago [I witnessed] (ph) my parents get in a heated argument over it. And I'm just like, "Whatever," like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the argument about in particular?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About having people over. About how my mother is upset because she really has this anger towards my aunt and her kids and all that stuff, which I can understand, you know, and how she just doesn't want to do anything for them. And in a way I guess that's kind of how I was brought up because my dad was always working and that's the version that I got. So that's pretty much how I'm taking things because I don't want to associate with anybody. I'm just like, "Whatever." I'd rather just sit home and do my own thing. But then again, I don't want to be at my house because then all those people will be there and there's no place to hide. You know? Or I mean do I just – I mean – yeah, it's just – it's a tough situation. [00:03:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who would you be hiding from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just like to keep to ourselves. I'd be hiding from my cousin because I have a lot of – I guess have anger towards him, even though he didn't do anything to me personally but just the way he's talked to my dad and this whole situation where he's living in my grandmother's house and not paying anything and thinking he's privileged and how everyone's bending over backwards towards him, kind of irritating me a little bit. Kind of sick of the whole process. We just want it to be over with and everybody to move on. I do feel that as long as my cousin's still living in this house, my grandmother's house, that's where the brunt of all the anger from my mother is and I'm kind of just getting irritated by it where it's to the point where I don't care anymore. I'm like if it's – if that's the case then we should just sell it. I mean I kind of want to go behind everyone's back and get a realtor on my own and just put the house on the market with nobody knowing. I know it's kind of farfetched but that's been going through my head. [00:04:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm – I'm not entirely understanding what the controversy around it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The controversy around it is back a couple of years ago when my grandmother first was ill, before she moved in with my aunt, there was talk about – that house was abandoned for a couple of years and my brother and I – my brothers and I wanted to rent it out and my parents said, "Absolutely not. You're not doing it. We're not getting involved." Fine. Well, a couple of years ago my brother gets in trouble with the law – not my brother, my cousin – gets in trouble with the law. He's not allowed to leave the state. And the next thing you know is he's living at my grandmother's house. And pissed us off because we already said we wanted to do that, we wanted to move away from home. It was a perfect, ideal house for us. We'd maintain it, we'd do everything. But my parents were the ones against it.</p>

<p>Well, my cousin moves in and the next thing you know he's got all his friends moving in there and his girlfriend's moving in there with her child. Then now his fiancée is – you know, his girlfriend is now his fiancée; they now have a baby and everything in that house is like it's their house. [00:06:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whose – is your grandmother still around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, she is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is she cognitively aware?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's 90 years old. She has severe diabetes, so she's losing her hearing, losing her sight. So she understands but she doesn't because she doesn't really know what's going on. When she stayed with my parents a couple months ago my dad was going through her checkbook and just saw that my grandmother was paying for everything and my cousin was living there just reaping all the benefits. She's paying still the mortgage, the electric bill, the utilities, all that stuff, and that's irritating to us. And then my dad had an account with my grandmother that had $30,000-plus in it and when he asked my grandma about the money, she had no idea. And then he asked my aunt about the money and it was gone. [00:07:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is the theory that they're stealing from her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They've stolen from her and they stole $30,000-plus from my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she doesn't really know that they're living there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope, because my aunt writes all her checks. Well, and this is what's messed up is my uncle, my aunt's husband, told my father that she said – that my grandmother said it was OK for him to live there and that she didn't mind. But when my dad talked to my grandmother she spread a whole new, different song and dance; how she can't stand them living there, she doesn't feel like it's her house anymore and she's not comfortable with what's going on, how the arrangements are. But my whole – my dad's whole theory is as long as my aunt has my grandmother he's not going to do anything about it, he's not going to say anything. And my question is why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your aunt is taking care of your grandmother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. My grandmother lives in Texas with my aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, do you think your grandmother thinks this is kind of an exchange for being taken care of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's really not because my aunt lived in Michigan for 10 years and my dad was usually taking care of the house when they weren't around. And then when she moved up here like 15 years ago, they lived in Jackson. So they were never anywhere close to where we were so it was always like my dad who was paying to fix stuff. It was usually me and my brothers maintaining my grandmother's house, cleaning her pool, taking care of the pool, taking care of her yard. When she needed stuff done it was always us doing stuff, shoveling the driveway. You know, all the upkeeping of the house, the burden was put on us. And now that my cousin is living in there, all this stuff's falling apart and he's calling my dad to fix it, which is kind of frustrating a little bit. It's like, "Well, he's not living in the house. I'm not living in the house. You're living in the house. You fix it. You're the one using all the stuff. You're the one ..." – and then to find out that he's not paying for anything really just adds more logs onto the fire, which keeps it going and gets really frustrating. [00:09:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're jealous. He gets – he reaps the benefits of something that you were unable to reap ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess, I guess. There you go; I could be jealous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's being taken care of in a way that you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, in a way he is but in a way he isn't. I mean knowing the fact that my dad's money was used to help pay for this really eats me up a lot where I want to say stuff to my aunt and to my uncle but because of my dad I don't either where I don't want to stir the pot. You know what I mean? I just – it's not my fight but in a way – in my head I think it is. Because this isn't the first time that my dad's had a sibling take advantage of him because my uncle passed away in 2003, my dad's brother, borrowed 20K from my dad and never paid him back but was going on all these luxurious trips, buying luxurious cars and doing all this stuff after he filed for bankruptcy. [00:10:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you certainly don't think your dad is dumb, so ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think my dad's soft. I think my dad lets people walk all over him and use him a lot. My dad, he's very smart in his ways but in some ways he's very dumb, to the point where he doesn't feel like starting confrontations where I'm different, where I don't mind it. Sometimes it needs to be done. And I do feel bad because I look out for him because my dad's very – he's a very caring person and he will help you out in any way possible. But when people screw him over, he just brushes it off his shoulder and just lets it go and just takes the fact that people used him, which kind of really irritates me a little bit. Because knowing how he is and knowing that that's your father, that people are – you know, you see him hurt but he just doesn't show it and he doesn't say anything. But then when you go to address the problem he'll get mad. And that's what's frustrating to me is because I want to say something. I want to say, "I know what you're doing." [00:12:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in a sense, he does sort of stick up for himself but you don't feel like he sticks up for himself in the right times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. In my – from what I've seen – I mean he's very calm and collected but if I ever found out that one of my siblings stole 30K from me, I'd be pissed off. If my brother ever asked for money and I helped him out and he never paid me back, I'd be pissed off, or was spending it on shit that he didn't need to be spending it on, I'd be pissed off; pissed off to the point where, A, I'd either file a lawsuit on him or, B, I'd never speak to him again. Because I just don't understand how people can hurt your siblings and go to that extreme and just not care about it and then whenever I see him my dad acts like nothing's going on. You know?</p>

<p>I mean in a way I kind of don't – I don't know because we just had our big family reunion for my dad's side and I don't know if people know that there's tension going on in our family or not. Because whenever we go to these functions we always have the happy face on like everything's fine. And to me it's kind of difficult because I do want to tell people what's going on. I do want to tell people that my aunt is a scumbag and she's stealing because she used to say bad things about us to everybody and people would look at us like we were the evil children and that my mother was the evil person when really it wasn't. You know? I mean the river flows both ways. You know? But everyone's only getting one side of the story and we're not allowed to stick up for ourselves. [00:13:47]</p>

<p>So I guess in a sense I'm – yeah, I am jealous that – you know, I was brought up by my parents to just not confront people. But as I'm becoming my own man and doing more often, I'm doing a lot more confronting. But it's not the confronting that I want; it's more reactionary as to, OK, I hear one thing but don't process it and then I [bolt out] (ph); where I'd like to say, "OK, this is what happened," gather my thoughts, plan out how I'm going to attack somebody, and then go after them. Because that's the one thing that I can't do. Like I, previous sessions, I have two sides, there's no in between, and I'm looking for the in between. It's either don't do nothing and just let it build up or just go full throttle and just do it and deal with the consequences after. And that's kind of how I feel, you know, because I do – and it is funny because I do have the sense of when it's my dad's problem and I don't say nothing but I do digest it and in my mind I'm like how I would attack the situation and how I would say things. [00:15:07]</p>

<p>So it is frustrating because I don't know if he does it. He could be doing it. I don't know. All I see is that he is getting walked all over and it just – it bothers me. It bothers me that he's allowing these people to take advantage of him. Because I mean I'd never do that. And I do see it, in a way, where my dad, if I asked him for 20K he'd give it to me and I could screw him over if I wanted to but I don't. You know? He's that type of person where he'll just if you need something he'll help you get it. And I don't know if he does expect anything in return or not. You know, it's just – it's frustrating. And I guess that's where I come in because I'm more hotheaded than he is and he takes everything in stride and processes it where I got my mother's personality where my mother just – reactionary; everything is reactionary with my mother. And in a sense that's how I am. And I don't like it.</p>

<p>And I had a conversation with my girlfriend the other day about trigger words and we talked about her mother. And her mother has Lupus, she's very disabled. She expects a lot out of her daughter. But she has a new boyfriend that my girlfriend and her brother don't really like. They did a background check on him and found that he'd been arrested multiple times for assaults. He was sued multiple times for fraud. He was just – you know, he wasn't a good person. They confronted her mother and her mother just didn't want to hear it. Fine, let it go. You know, I keep my mouth shut. But their mother just keeps trying to push the boyfriend on the two of them and I have to listen to the complaining about this, that, and the other thing and how they can't stand their mother and all this stuff. And to me I'm just like, OK, I do suggestions. [00:17:27]</p>

<p>But this weekend she told me about what her mother wanted – you know, asked her to do stuff. She started complaining to me again – just venting, which is fine – but I snapped. I told her, I go, "Well ..." – you know, and I started cursing. I was just like, "Well, you know, you can't have two ends of the stick." I go, "On one hand your mother's got this boyfriend that, A, you don't like and you say you don't like and the guy's never around. But your mother is disabled, he does all her grocery shopping, does her laundry, picks up after her, does the stuff that if he wasn't there you'd be doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was actually thinking about that with respect to your aunt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your grandmother lives with your aunt, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot of work to take care of an elderly person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) No, I agree. Oh, yeah. Ninety-year-old woman, tough to move around, can't see, can't hear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess in that context – like I understand you have a whole history with your cousins but if your grandmother, in sort of exchange for being taken care of the way she is, wants to help out your aunt's kids ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... in that context it makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I agree. And that's why my dad doesn't say anything. Because he says, "Well, my sister watches my mother and that's why I'm not going to say anything because ..." [00:18:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that doesn't sit well with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Because she's watching my grandmother it's OK for her to steal from you? Like where does that balance out? You know? That's what's frustrating to me is just because, "OK, because you're watching my grandmother and you have access to accounts that my grandmother has accounts with my dad's name on them and you're taking money out of his account ..." – well, her account but his account as well – "and you don't fill him in?" Because what irritated my dad was that money was put away for her funeral. And he said, "OK, well if something happens to her ..." – because she had a stint where she was in the hospital, wasn't doing well; we thought it could have been close to the end. And my dad mentioned this account and my aunt goes, "Oh yeah, there's nothing in it." And my dad had no recollection of taking any money out. And if they didn't slip the tongue and tell him, he would have already thought that that 30K was already there. He would have went looking for it for the funeral and it miraculously wouldn't have been there and then it would have been worse. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>So I guess, yeah, it is to the point where, yeah, she is taking care of my grandmother but, you know, enough is enough. Just because she's taking care of my grandmother, she's allowed to steal from my dad, her son's allowed to live in my grandmother's house for free, and everything that we want to say we can't because she holds the trump card and that's my grandmother. So I guess, yeah. And I mean I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is your grandmother the trump card? Like what is she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my grandmother will defend my aunt to the death and my grandmother will – because of my grandmother, we're not allowed to say anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wasn't she the one who treated you badly growing up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. She's the one who just pretty much disappeared from our lives for 20 years. You know? And that's, I guess, what's frustrating, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that your dad just doesn't want to come to terms with that? Because it doesn't sound like he's angry about that or maybe he is and I don't understand. (phone rings) Oh, sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me turn this off. [00:21:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never thought of it. I never thought of it like that. I don't know if he – I don't know if he understands how hurt we were. Like he does understand that we were hurt but I don't know to the extent of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think he was hurt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. He never told me. Nobody's ever told me. I wonder if he was hurt. I would hope so. I never really thought of it like that. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most sons don't want their moms turning their back on them and their family. It's painful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. No, I know you know. I mean that's why ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I know and I guess – I kind of guess that's what scares me about my situation a little bit, too, is because I see what's going on and my mother always tells me, "I don't want to be like your grandmother" – like not her mother; my dad's mother – where it's just to the point where I drive a wedge in between me and my girlfriend. And it's to the point where I pretty much have to make a choice. And I kind of feel like that – the more I think about it that's what my grandmother did to my dad is she kind of, you know – I do know for a fact my grandmother wanted him to have kids. Fine. But she wanted him to have kids and then go back, like I said earlier, to being with my grandmother and just deserting us, I guess, in a way. I guess when my dad said no and chose to stay with my mother, I guess that really irritated my grandmother and she was like, "OK." [00:23:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she really wanted him to leave his wife. Like divorce?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wanted her – she wanted your dad to divorce your mom so that she could – he could live with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is divorce common in your – it doesn't seem like divorce would be particularly accepted ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my aunt, believe it or not, was married at 21. She divorced and then remarried. She divorced after like a year-and-a-half, two years because my aunt was married, living with her husband. And this is what I've been told is her first husband didn't like the fact that my aunt was always over my grandmother's house. You know, he bought her all this stuff, had a beautiful house; she was never there. From what I've been told is, you know, during their first couple of years of marriage they were always over my grandmother's house for dinner every night just hanging out there. He didn't like it. He wanted to just come home to his house with his wife and live his life. And I guess after a little bit of time he just couldn't do it anymore because he didn't want to be with my grandmother or my grandfather or anybody that was going on there. [00:24:52]</p>

<p>And from what I've been told is that my grandmother really didn't like him to begin with. But yet she still allowed my aunt to marry him, which I don't understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean "allowed"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She let them get married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would she have done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean instead of, you know, allowing them to get married and then get divorced, why not just talk to them and split them up before they even went and got married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How – I mean she can't control what – what would she do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know she can't – I know she can't control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would she like try to tackle them during the – I mean how would she do that? How would she ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's – well, I guess my aunts got – they're very manipulative. They put people against each other to start the fire and then just let the fire grow and grow and grow. So I guess in a way my grandmother – I don't know, maybe she should have started a fire. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think that – well, I guess what you're saying is that she would have had the power. You believe that she would have had the power to break them up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, not a doubt in my mind. Not a doubt in my mind. Because I know for years she tried with my parents. I mean when my dad had his office – and now his office is at our house, in our house. When my dad had his office, when we were growing up, at my grandmother's house, he'd be gone at like 7:00 in the morning – well, 8:00 in the morning – take us to school. If he wasn't working til then, my dad would be over my grandmother's house having coffee with her, breakfast with her, go to work, then go back over to my grandmother's house with his reports, type them up, sit down, have coffee with her, have dinner. He wouldn't come home to us til like 8:00. [00:26:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm still confused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you – she didn't want to acknowledge his family but they would spend a lot of time together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he was – I mean that sounds like he's spending a lot of time. But if you had a birthday or if you – then she doesn't care. So did she just not want to acknowledge that he had a family, do you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think yeah. Because I mean we'd go over once in a while but that was it. I mean she always had negative things to say to us but I mean now that you think about it, my dad used to spend a lot of time over my grandmother's house; even when we were all really young. I mean unless we had – I mean I guess it's not true because even if we had sporting events, he'd take us to sporting events if they were at like 5:30, 6:00. And if they ended before 8:00, we'd stop – he'd have to stop by his mother's house before we went home just to see her. So yeah, I guess – I guess yeah it was. I mean but if we didn't have sporting events he never used to come home before like 7:00. [00:27:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she didn't turn her back on the whole family; she just turned her back on everybody else but your father.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your father was OK with it, I guess, because he ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know if he was OK with it or not. From what I remember is like my dad – you know, if he wasn't working he'd – (clears throat) excuse me. If he wasn't working he'd always be at our sporting events or any extracurricular activities we had outside of school. But for like school plays, growing up, when we were younger, my dad's – my dad would be there sometimes, not all the time, but my mom's mom would come; my aunts would come, on my mother's side; and that would be it. Like there wasn't no interaction with my dad's family; like none of them would come. But my grandmother on my mother's side would come. You know, we'd tell my grandmother about it, that this was happening, and she didn't come. [00:28:48]</p>

<p>My dad's grandmother never came to any of our graduations. My mother's mother went to my brother and my sister's high school graduation but she didn't live to see mine. She didn't come to any of our college graduations or any of that stuff. I guess, you know, it wasn't good enough for her I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean it seems like one theory is that your grandmother didn't want to see your dad grow up and so she could acknowledge him but not his family. And for whatever reason, your father was, on some level, willing to go along with this and spend a lot of time with her and away from his family, which is really about his adult life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Yeah. Well, and not for nothing. When we were younger, like my aunt used to live in Michigan. So she was in Jackson, Michigan; good two hours away. So she was never around. But my dad's brother was always around and I guess my dad felt like he had to be the one to look out for my grandmother because he was the one that she depended on the most; financially and just any other way, like she depended on him. He's the only one that actually looked out for her. The other two, in my opinion, could give a damn less if she lived or died. To be honest, they'd rather her be dead. [00:30:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel he was maybe living up to an obligation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Maybe it was some thing that he promised himself way back when that I don't know about or I've never heard about. Or maybe, you know, him and his mother talked about something like that that I don't know or heard about. I'm just an outsider looking in on what I see and what I felt and how I was treated and how I just can't process the behaviors that were just being shown. It's just – it's really complicated and I can see why I'm confusing you because I'm confusing myself with everything that's going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it. It sounds like it's very – it sounds like the most confusing part is people's motivation; why are people doing what they're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like is your father over there because he's betraying his family? Is your father over there out of loyalty to your grandmother in a sense of obligation? It's very complicated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. It's very – it's extremely complicated. And you know, when we have these family reunions it's just like, OK, like I don't mind going to them because I like seeing my dad's cousins, I like seeing my great aunts and my great uncles. That's fine. But in a sense I kind of feel like my dad's great uncle – well, my great uncle; my dad's uncle – him and his wife are kind of like my grandparents because I like them. I never got to really meet my grandfather but from what I was told is he was the one who adored us. And I think that's what set off my grandmother because my grandmother didn't want him to adore us but he couldn't stand his daughter's husband, who's now my uncle, and he couldn't just fathom the fact that – you know, he was giving all his grandchildren equal love. [00:32:13]</p>

<p>And I think that, from what I was told, in my mind is what I believe is that my grandmother didn't like the fact that my grandfather gave all his grandchildren the equal amount of love that they deserved, where he didn't treat us as individuals because I was my dad's son or that was my uncle's son or daughter or that was my aunt's son and daughter. He didn't treat us like that. He treated us all the same. You know? From what I was told, when I was baby he used to come over every Sunday morning and have breakfast and coffee with us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like the way things are set up – maybe this is sort of an obvious statement – that it seems almost inevitable that you would feel competitive with your cousins since there was so much preference and favoritism and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Oh, yeah. Well, there was favoritism from my grandmother but from what I understand about my grandfather – and I've heard this from multiple family members – is that there wasn't. My grandfather was the open, loving man who accepted all of us, embraced all of us, was very proud of his grandchildren; where my grandmother, on the other hand, I don't know what it is about her but she just couldn't embrace my dad's kids, us, or my dad's brothers' kids. I don't know what it was about that that she just couldn't embrace. [00:33:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is your dad older or younger than his brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad was the middle child of three. So it goes my dad's uncle – my uncle, my dad, and my aunt. My aunt's the baby in the family. So – but my dad was also the last one to get married because my dad's brother was married; again, early, at 21. My aunt was married at 21 as well and then divorced. But my dad didn't get married until he was like in his mid-30s. So I don't know if that had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he live with his mother that whole time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems to run in your family, living with parents for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, again, I hate to go back to this but it's culture.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you hear it as a criticism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't hear it as a criticism til I started dating my girlfriend, where she couldn't understand the fact why I was still home at 25 years old, where she moved out at 22, 23 right after college and was on her own. I didn't look at it like that. I was like, "I'm going to stay here until ..." – in my head, I had a plan where I was going to stay there til I got married and then I'd move out and get a house and do all that stuff. [00:34:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So now when someone comments on it, it feels like maybe criticism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I – at first, before our sessions, I did but now I process it. And like I said in previous sessions, me moving out was not the issue. There was something unfinished that I had at home. Well, actually no. This is crap because now I kind of feel like my dad because I kind of feel that I had an obligation because my mother, when I moved out and when I was gone, I found out my dad did something that I wasn't around for and I wanted to be and nobody told me about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He went and did physical labor after just having chemotherapy. And it pissed me off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Do you know why he did it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was just in the process of selling – you know, he owned a three-family house. He needed to install some things, because my brother's a plumber. My brother needed to install some things just to bring it up to code with the fire hazards and all that stuff. And instead of calling me and telling me to go over with my brother, he went over with him and was doing all the work. And I – it irritated me because I got home and they're like, "Oh, what are you doing?" I'm like, "Where are you coming from?" "Well, I was over the other house." I was like, "Why?" "Because this needed to get done." I go, "Well, why didn't you call me?" And I guess it just irritated me to the fact where I was just like I kind of felt out of the loop. [00:36:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I was thinking; in fact, out of the loop was what just came to my mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I kind of felt out of the loop like if I was living here I'd know what was going on; I could maintain what he does. Because with the treatment, my dad's very tired; he's always tired all the time and he's always pushing himself. And that was one thing that I'm trying to limit was, you know, as long as I'm there I do all the bulk of the work. Well, I don't do it; I try to do it as much as I can so he doesn't have to. And I figured if I moved out my brothers would do it a little bit more. My younger brother stepped up to the plate more than my older brother. My older brother just kind of does his own thing. Even though he's the plumber and does it, he just does it but he's got an attitude towards it, how it's bothering him and, you know, it just – he and I are like two different people. Because if someone asks me for a favor, I don't mind doing it. If someone asks my older brother for a favor, it's a huge process. It's to the point where I won't even ask him for anything just because I don't want to get – don't want to listen to him. I don't want the argument. So I guess in a sense, yeah, that's ... [00:37:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean in some ways it's the fundamental dilemma of moving out of, you know, and anyone moving out of home, is that you are more separate and you don't know as much about what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of – that's part of it. (Patient coughs) And it sounds like for you that's really hard to imagine giving up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, and in a way I can see it, too, because my – we live in a neighborhood behind a main street. I don't know if you're familiar with (inaudible at 0:38:28) at all. But we live in a neighborhood and my grandmother's house is on the main street. We live two streets behind my grandmother. So in a way, my dad never really left because we were walking distance from my grandmother. So I guess that's why he was always there and I guess when me moving from (inaudible) to Arlington, I think being so far away really irritated me a little bit because, A, exactly I wasn't in the loop but if something needed to be done I couldn't get there in two minutes to do it. I had, you know, to do like a half an hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it that it was like practically the travel time was hard? Were people also less informing you about ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. The travel time was hard because if something needed to be done soon, I can't just get up and do it. But also the fact that I was less informed. Like I mean I talk to my parents maybe once a week but I don't know what's going on on a day-to-day situation. (coughs) [00:39:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think, in a way, that you can even feel left out in those situations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. And not – I didn't feel left out all the time; only when I knew like major things were happening and that I knew I could have helped with that I wasn't told about. That's what really irritated me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel less needed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. And I guess because my girlfriend tells me I like to be the center of attention, which is true. I like to actually feel needed and feel that people want to see me and that I do have a relative – not relative but a level of importance. In some way, I guess that kind of eases my mind a little bit. So I guess, yeah, you could say that. I kind of felt like I wasn't needed. It wasn't – I don't know it was just tough coping with it, I guess. Or actually I still don't know how to cope with it because I'm still doing what I do but it's – you know, the more and more that I'm home I'm like, "Well, why did I really have to move home?" because not many of this stuff is going on. So again, I just confused myself even more by making reactionary decisions and just dealing with the consequences. [00:41:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it seems to me, you know, starting to get to know you, that this is one of your primary conflicts, between wanting to be at home – wanting that sense of closeness; the familiarity; the fear about being on your own and not being able to take care of yourself; not wanting to be – and wanting to feel included and part of something and wanting – and then, on the other hand, wanting to strike out on your own; wanting to be a man; wanting to feel more independent and less dependent on your family. And this is like where you are right now. This is sort of a critical moment in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Mm-hmm. Yep. I'm telling you, I'm like playing tug-of-war. Some days I get pulled more to this side and then the other days I get pulled right back there. And I – you know, that's just like hitting it right on the nail in the coffin. Like I just – it all depends. It really does; it all depends on how it goes. You know? I mean it's to the point where if my girlfriend is pulling me over here I'm like, "OK." But then something happens to my family and now they're pulling like, "Hey, don't forget about us."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I also imagine that there's inside pulls, too. [00:42:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was interesting, when you said, "Yeah," that you put then "Everyday is a nail on a coffin," like as if something is dying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The death – what might be dying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because a coffin you're burying something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or was it just an interesting expression?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's – I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if I'm dying. I don't know if someone in my family is dying. I don't know. You know? There's just a lot going on. Maybe a part of me just wants to close off the relationship that I have with my grandma and my dad's family. Maybe that was the expression; that it's just, you know, in order for me to actually forget about it I just need to seal the coffin, move on, pretend like everything's not alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like your dad has a sort of close connection with his mother so it's sort of hard – wanting to shut her out, it's hard to know what to then do with your relationship with him. [00:43:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, and I mean I hate to be negative and sound heartless but whenever my grandmother's up, I don't make an attempt to go see her. I don't want to go see her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you feel rejected by her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. And every time I go there she still criticizes me. I mean I've never seen her say anything positive about me or my siblings. Everything's all so negative. "You don't have a girlfriend because you're too fat." You know, my sister, she's overweight like myself a little bit. "You don't have a boyfriend because you're overweight." Tells my girlfriend all the time, "Get him on a diet. How are you still with him? You can do better."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she say this on your – without anyone around or with your dad or mom there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, she says it when we talk to her, like say hello at family functions and just sit down and try to be nice to her and try to talk to her. And then it's just like, OK, that turns me off and I get up and walk away. I get up and walk away. [00:44:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She can be quite mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's ruthless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And hurtful. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's ruthless. But it's different, you know? I mean I don't know if she knows that I had my episode with drugs but if I did something wrong, I'd be the first one to get criticized. You know? But my Aunt Trish, her kids do something wrong and they're the ones, "Well, they got the shit end of the stick." You know? Or why everything bad happens to them and – you know, they get the sympathy card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But somehow you deserve it; is that the message? When bad things happen to you it's (inaudible at 0:45:24) doing ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I feel like it's common to me. You know? I mean I – to be honest, I don't know if I mentioned this but when I overdosed on heroin and was lying in the hospital almost dead, I was thinking about that and I was thinking about how they'd all play pity to my dad about how much they love me and how they really feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it was convenient?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:45:53) we need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. I didn't mean to do it so abruptly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then we're going to be meeting in two weeks, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The scheduling. I have conflicts on the 2nd and the 9th because I have soccer at 3:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not 3:00 but 3:40. I have a game on the 9th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can meet – can you meet a little earlier?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can do – I was going to ask you that. I can do like 2:00, 2:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could do ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: 2:15 would work, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would – because I actually don't start here til 2:15. The person who has the office has it til 2:15. But I could do 2:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 2:30 would work?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the 2nd and the 9th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the 2nd and the 9th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the 2nd I don't have school because that's like a holiday for us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the 9th I'd just – I'd leave school early. Yes, that would work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. Let's do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's going to be the only problem upcoming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The rest are just – the 3:30 would work; 3:25 would work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Great, great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, great. Oh, thank you so much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. And then starting the 2nd, we'll just do the two weeks and you can just send me a bill and I'll pay you every two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, great. I hope you have a very good Christmas.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You, too. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, very good and I'll see you in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright, sounds good. Thanks, Doctor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, take care.</p>

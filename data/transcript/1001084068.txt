<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So, yes, what is happening with [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, uh, I think since I saw you we went to North Carolina to, and [NAME OTHER] grandson is, um, [AGE] birthday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we stayed at a hotel and we went to their house for dinner. And everything was nice. Everything went well. My son made a comment that hurt my feelings, but I didn't let him know it 'til about 2 months later. I was just helping in the kitchen and he came in and he said, yknow, I was doing some things in the kitchen, he says you don't have to be a hero in my kitchen tonight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's not too bad.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it hurt a little bit and I said, [NAME OTHER] I am finishing putting these in the dishwasher cause your mother in law has been in the kitchen doing the cooking and everything and she's outside having a piece of birthday cake and I'm going to finish what I'm doing and then I'll come out. So that was a good trip.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we went to Washington and we were there several days. [NAME OTHER] got very nervous. And I understand, yknow. We looked at all the museums and we stayed our time and 2 days he was ready to come. And I remember when I used to be like that for vacations. And, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What, did you drive all the way up there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, we flew to Charlotte and then we flew to Washington and flew home. The driving has just gotten way too much. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't do it anymore.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With all the construction and all, yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I just hate it. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then us, we've been home, he went back to work. Sometimes I think he comes home tense after that. I know he listens to people all day and I know how it has to be and then when you're not busy or you're too busy, yknow -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, I think there's a problem. And he's told me there's a problem. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Personnel problem?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, drinking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he admits it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What'd he do on vacation?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, a couple of nights, yknow, he didn't have much at our son's and in Washington we didn't either. Just a couple of drinks, uh, maybe 2, but we got back home and it just, he just starts and he can't, he can't stop. He can't be at 1 or 2 and he told me this week. He said I just can't, I said leave [NAME OTHER], you've got to do something the next time you're off because, I said, this year for 40 years yknow it's not been a good Christmas since we lost our kids and I think this has been a crutch every year while we're not having a good Christmas. I said I'm having a good Christmas this year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So we went. I went shopping. I went and bought that, we haven't put up decorations in, I know, probably 10 years. Just a little, yknow, not a tree, nothing outside, it's been a long, long time. And I know at least probably since, uh, '96, '97, but anyway, so he decided when he drinks he wakes up during the night and he's depressed and he can't go to sleep and he told me he's depressed during the day. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow, drinking can mess up your sleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It can?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. I mean, it's supposed to go through 4 stages of sleep, yknow, 4 times, and it messes up that rhythm and you don't get into deep sleep and all, I mean, if you drink too much.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then you're sort of tired the next day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, cause you didn't get good sleep. So he is doing that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay. But now it's been, he's tried a couple times and we can't stay home. We'll go to a restaurant, I mean, we'll like, I said let's go to Cracker Barrel. No alcohol. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or we'll go to a sandwich shop, no alcohol. He'd rather get out of the house. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he's got the habit all tied up with coming home and all, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he's a good guy. He's been good, if I just get in the way. I just go in the other room or go read or, yknow, when he just wants to go on, and I but he's been very good to me. He's not hurt me, not said anything about my shopping like he used to. I know [NAME OTHER] always gets depressed at Christmas. And, yknow, it's time that it's not the kids. That's been for, I mean, the baby, our first one was 1968, the other one was 1960, 1970, and that's a long time ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty long ago.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's time to enjoy these little grandchildren. They're almost gone. He gets nervous with them. And I think that makes, a lot of that makes me nervous. But, he's having time today, he had a hard time, he went to bed at five o'clock.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, last time we thought he was taking the antidepressants.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, he tells me no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now he told me that yesterday he took a half a nerve pill and he tells me that he's not taking, when he takes a pain pill he tells me. I know his back has hurt him for a long time. And [NAME OTHER] what if goes up there and bike ride, maybe this is it. I don't, I don't know. Go get an x-ray or -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, would he come over here or what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I've tried to get him to come see you. I know everybody's going to make their own decisions like I did, because I went a lot of years and I didn't handle myself right. I let him handle me. And I can't do that anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, damn. It sounds like he's the kind of person that should always take it, yknow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But is, what do you getting off, he realized it, he told me, he said, [PATIENT NAME], I know it's too much alcohol, I've been doing it about 6 years now and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He drinks straight whiskey or straight vodka or straight gin And then, yknow, a diet Coke or something with that. But I mean he does like 6 ounces in a glass and he does several glasses.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, see that's too much.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, he says, no, and sometimes he'll say, well, I didn't take, I can't think of that, I think I've told you what it was before, now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There is a drug that supposed to make it so you don't drink as much or that, I guess, that less, I don't know how to put it. It doesn't make you feel good so you stop drinking. But it's not Antabuse because that'll make you sick as a dog.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can look it up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I forget the name of it. I should know it, but. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so I says, [NAME OTHER], yknow, I can give up drinking. I like a glass of wine or a drink at night, but I can have 1 or 2 and I can stop. So last night I didn't have any, night before, didn't need it. But he's starting to get fussy with people. I notice that a couple of times where, yknow, when somebody can't understand what he's trying to explain, like we're going through having a TV put in on the wall and having to have the wall cut and I said let the professionals handle it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. Yeah, I would.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Let them do it. That is too much stress. So at Best Buy yesterday he got upset and I, uh, I just went walking around and he told the guy, he said, yknow, you don't understand, you're not answering my question, whatever, yknow. And I said, [NAME OTHER], let's go. I said these are part time workers here today and it seemed like to me they don't know a lot about it either. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the one I'm talking about is naltrexone. And I'll just give you this. It may be enough. Well, they do have us doctors in a bind. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Apresoline, yeah, I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He takes the Apresoline.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Apresoline.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, alprazolam, that's Xanax.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That must be what it is.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But that's just -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> an anxiety agent, oh, yeah. Well, as long as he ain't writing it for himself, yeah, it's all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. Yknow, one of his partners.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, he can, he could try that. I haven't given it to many people.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, yknow, I just pulled out 3 articles about it, so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe, let me take this, and maybe he'll do it, I can get him to come in and see you. I think he needs help.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But it's real hairy. I mean, I wouldn't do it, but technically if a doctor come in and said he's drinking that much you'd have to report him. And then this PRN gets on you and they are like the Gestapo. They make you go to meetings and check you. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And they say absolutely no drinking, no drugs, no nothing. They're horrible. They're horrible. So and he knows that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but when he goes to work I guess he's okay.  I don't, I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, oh yeah, probably. It's just that amount in this case, yknow. It's not that it's affecting his behavior. But they would jump all over that amount.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he's not, um, he's not -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I drink plenty believe me, so it's not like I don't drink.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let him try these things and he's got to cut it down somehow. And some people the only way they can do it is completely stop. It's true. I had a friend who used to do that. He'd have 3 martinis all right, but, yknow, big ones.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He has 3 when we go out and sometimes, several occasions he's had 4.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's a lot.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And nobody needs to see you walking out of a restaurant like this and walking to the car.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No. And it scares me to death about getting a DUI. You can just have 1 or two drinks you can get it. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know. That's what they say. If you drink one you don't need to drive. You've got to have a designated driver.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And night before last and more and more and more he doesn't drive. But yesterday I know he got a little upset and then he asked me to drive home. And then last night he told me, oh, he took 1/2 a pill. I don't know what he really takes. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He tells me when he takes a sleeping pill. I don't know what he takes for that. But he reads a lot. So he mostly reads to himself and I usually take his glasses off and take the books from him. But if he goes back to have a drink then he needs to get. He told me this morning, he said, [PATIENT NAME], this is the 3rd day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of not drinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not drinking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's a good sign.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then one night last week he only had like 3 beers. He seems to be fine on that, but now I mean he's not abusive anymore. He's seems calm. We're doing things around the house. Yknow -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's good. He just needs to keep busy sorta.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. Yeah. He told me that. And I know that. And I said yesterday, I said, well, yknow, our church is, we went to church and then we have the preacher always has open house once a year around Christmas so and I said, well, let's go. He said, yknow, [PATIENT NAME], I'm just having a hard time being around people. I said okay that's fine. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah I get like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He said maybe we'll go to the music thing tonight. So I was up doing decorations. He came and helped me. He said he would. And then it didn't come up again and we were still, and so I didn't bring it up to go to the music thing. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we avoided that. There was a Christmas party downstairs in our lobby every year yesterday and we just avoided it. We were, we were trapped for 2 hours because it was the only way out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. Yeah. We, uh -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So we watched bad TV rather than go talk to people.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know. I tell you, [NAME OTHER], we didn't, we haven't been to any Christmas, we don't go to any Christmas parties anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. The hospital ones.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we didn't go to that either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I haven't been to one in years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, we haven't either.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been that long. But now what's going to happen if he gets so bad that he wants some, needs, I don't know what to do?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you can't do much about it except remind him. I mean, you pretty much have to stay out of it, I'll tell you, because the person has to do it theirself.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you can reinforce that he's doing so good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah. This morning I was so proud that we sat down and had a nice breakfast. And, um, he's waiting on the cable guy to come.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is there a doctor that specializes in that or?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there are, but the trouble is -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, [NAME OTHER] is strong and I think he can do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The trouble is that PRN. I mean, that's no -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a nightmare.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know if he knows it or not, but. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And in almost every state they're the same way. It's become these addictionologists that taken it over. And almost all of them are ex bad drinkers or pain pill users and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's just so far from what it started out to be.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Well, yknow, he's gotten over this before, so - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. Well, and that medicine may help him. That's, uh, it's not going ot hurt you, it's not addictive or anything, so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay. So the thing -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing to lose.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is a prescription.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, uh, yeah, I never saw samples of that. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But the other guys could write it. They're writing him Xanax, so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or else I'll write it for you. One way or the other.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I appreciate that, doctor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now you're still doing the Zoloft, though, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yes. That's what I was going to talk to you about. And I told [NAME OTHER], yknow, I said, [NAME OTHER], I've got to let, I've got to get my prescription filled, yknow. They ordered me some and, yknow, I'm sure you have seen this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it the 90 day one?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is where, like for Zoloft where the insurance companies, it's just when they did, it's too damn much.  Of course, now it's 15 for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's not bad.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But, yknow, and Ambien is 50 a month. And they charge like 164, they bill insurance for Ambien. So I have told her, they ordered me some at the office, a bottle of 100 and I was taking, yknow, I haven't gotten my prescription filled in a long time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That'll help.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That would, see, that's when I stopped getting my prescription filled because [NAME OTHER] had gotten these for me, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had gotten them for me, cause he knows I come to you, the doctors done it. I think his 2 partners do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, have you gotten the -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've got the Ambien.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The generic Ambien?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. Yeah, generic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's all right? Cause that's a lot cheaper, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It seems, yknow, there's some nights I won't go to sleep, but that's a little nerves. But, no, I'm resting good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. Now is this for a 90 day prescription or 30?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Three months.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Three months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, this is not the price for, this is just what, uh, is there, I want to show you what they charge for Ambien. I think they bill -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> 106 for Ambien.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's for the real stuff.  Zolpidem is the, uh -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm paying 30 a month for Ambien.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're probably.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm paying 50 a month when I get it at the drugstore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're getting the real thing then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cause that's, well, it says zolpidem down here.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they just started.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's generic Ambien.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> See the difference from the up top.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay. Then that's what they're giving me. Yeah, right. It went from 50 to 30. I mean, 50 to, I pay 30. No, it's 30 for the Premarin. Well, I haven't gotten it since then because this just came in the mail. I got what he was taking me. But I need to get a prescription at the drugstore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So it'd run me 45 a month then. So does Premarin, it says 30 bucks a month with insurance. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Man, that should be dirt cheap, man.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thirty dollars a month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the ironic thing is, you see, the 50, let me see, the Ambien they say 165 and the zolpidem, well, it's 139.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's still ridiculous. These companies just have a license to steal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know. I agree, I agree, I agree, I agree.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you have some kids with grandkids in town?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I have 3. And they're little. And they're a handful, 2, 4,  and our daughter's a RN. She used to work at St. Joe, but with the kids, 2, 4, and 7.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh they are, that is a handful. Geez. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Very active. She is very active with them. They go to the park, they go somewhere every day. They go to St. John's private school. She's a good mom. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we had -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Her daddy tells her that all the time too. He sees it. She's a, yknow, housework, nothing, but her kids are number one. She's real good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good. Don't forget that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. So, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right. Well, you made a good start. Let's see. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I hope so. I'm not perfect by any long run, but I have to keep going. I'm tired of being sad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah. Well, enjoy the grandchildren.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. I went Friday, my daughter let me know too not to [INAUDIBLE] about the little program. And she was up there 10 minutes and then, yknow, and had the young 2 [INAUDIBLE] where the older kids and up, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

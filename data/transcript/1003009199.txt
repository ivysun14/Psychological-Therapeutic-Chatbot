<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty good.  Could be better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Getting good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just a lot of things and getting ready to go back to school next semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where you going to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.  So you've been accepted -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To go back?  You've got a schedule?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Was that hard getting all that together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much.  [INAUDIBLE] whole semester [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd you do today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just go to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?  Tell me about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just boring in class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what do you got this term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [INAUDIBLE].  I'm just finishing up all my [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're out at the, uh, airport?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  And after that I'm just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to be done this term with it?  You'll get your, uh, certification?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get my degree and after that I'm just trying to get up out of here 'cause this place is [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That'll be nice having that though.  You'll have a skill and your part-time job's easy to get and you'll make good money -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you won't be on no Burger King stuff, you know?  That kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  That was my initial plan was to go somewhere and just go back to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I was going to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now how many of the credits do you get there if you transfer down to [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Any or are they are technical?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't even know [INAUDIBLE] but from what I was looking at, I think it's like 20, maybe less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, 'cause most of the stuff you're taking is kind of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not like college classes I guess, is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, this, this is more [INAUDIBLE] going to makes it industrial engineer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't know how it's going, how that stuff is going to [INAUDIBLE], but I was going to go up to [DEIDENTIFIED] instead, but they were charging like $23,500 just for a semester.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a little expensive, isn't it?  They're usually pretty good about giving money out though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If they'd give a lot.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I'm just going to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] 'cause I, I mean I have my cousins there and I'm not going to be on the campus alone.  So it works out better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to in a dorm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got a roommate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  I'm rooming with my cousin down there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What's he studying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, marketing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a good cousin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he's not really my cousin.  It's just my sister's husband's bro, I mean his cousin.  So we just call him 'cause he's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you know, is he okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He don't get into much trouble?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's not a troublemaker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's not a party guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, not that I know of.  No, I'm not trying to go down there and party.  I just want to get my education.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what I mean.  Yeah, you don't need to be with a party guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has he got a girl?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She goes to, uh, some school in, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about you?  You got a girl?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I kind of mess around with this one girl down there at [DEIDENTIFIED], but other than that, I don't have one. </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've been there a few times, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went down there for one of the games and I just [INAUDIBLE] so I just, just take it from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you have a major that you want?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yes, sir.  I'm, I'm thinking this, I'm hoping this is the right major that falls under, 'cause if it falls under [INAUDIBLE] it's better for me.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you can still do the first couple of years there and if it, you know, your major's pretty much the last 2 years anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're going to plan on being there 4 years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I plan on being there 4 years hopefully if everything plans, I mean if everything goes according to plan, yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, where are you living now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still live with my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's [NAME OTHER] doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's she doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's at work right now.  She's, uh, she's going to school and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She still working over there at the hall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't know if they were still open or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they're, they're not open, I mean they're not, uh, they're not out where the mall [INAUDIBLE].  I can't remember.  It's, I cannot -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is she over on [DEIDENTIFIED], in that brick building by CVS? </p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's where she's at? </p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's there.  She's, she's doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's she going to school for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, the same thing she's doing right now.  She's being a secretary.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, she's [INAUDIBLE].  She's a fine woman.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd you do for Thanksgiving?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just eat.  That's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mom, mom did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, no, my whole family did it.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At your house or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You go somewhere?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My sister's house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sister?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sat there and just ate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mom's done it enough years I'm sure and it's nice for your sister too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You doing your studies?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, what do you mean by that, sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Taking your tests?  Doing your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everyday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Grades okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, a little bit.  I'm hoping that, uh, one, one of my heat and air class I may be having trouble in and hopefully I pass my English class, but other than that, everything's going good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've got an associate degree then at the end of the term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not sure, huh?  You like that drama?  Pull it off at the end.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It kind of has been a rough semester for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, me and my teacher were getting into it at the beginning of the semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just my one [INAUDIBLE] been at each other for, since the beginning of the semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've had him before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had him before a long time ago like a year and a half ago, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't like him then, don't like him now, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause it's, it's, I feel like I'm not learning anything in his classroom.  So I'm, I'm struggling in his class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He doesn't teach well?  Are the other kids having trouble or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think there's just 2 kids in the classroom that are passing.  Three, well, 3 or 4 of them that are passing and, uh, the rest of us are struggling out of 9 students.  So we're all, it's half and half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you're having to put a little extra effort into studying that stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, hopefully you know,  just a little bit hopefully the final will help curve my grade.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess if you study it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  that will work, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you and the other guys that are not doing well, ought to get together and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm, I like to study on my own 'cause it's a lot easier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have to deal with everybody [INAUDIBLE] this, this, this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looks like you'll have to study a little bit more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your attitude been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's [INAUDIBLE] all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's being silly that's what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're just having a good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that one of the reasons your teacher didn't, uh, has a problem with you?  You goof off a bit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't goof off in the classroom.  It, I goof off when we go out and have breaks and stuff, but that's, and everybody else is like, they're having fun and I may like say a couple of things and just go back [INAUDIBLE].  So [INAUDIBLE] everybody laugh and it just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're a little more silly than the other ones?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I just stay in my little box so I don't get in trouble or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has that been a problem lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Except this one teacher; you guys go at it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, we've been at it for, for a little while until I finally said something to him and then he just, just backed off for a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what'd you tell him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just told him how he was treating me and how he wasn't treating the other students.  Like he would, he would basically call me out on everything that I do and like he'd single me out instead of looking at everybody else and he would, he wouldn't say things to them; he would say things to me instead.  So I just got tired of it and I just went [INAUDIBLE] about the whole situation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I cannot remember.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe he, uh, he likes you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm thinking he does, but in a way, I don't think he does.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Professors can be kind of funny when you get to college and beyond because you often find that, um, the professor that takes an interest in a particular student gives them the most grief.  It's kind of like a parent.  You know, if you've got a parent that's coaching your ball team, that parent's going to probably give you more grief than the other players; expect more of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, you know, he cares more about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So a lot of times you may find that to be the case because of the, the teacher that truly doesn't care about a student, typically just ignores them.  They don't bother with them.  I mean put yourself in their shoes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, if you're teaching some people though and you get somebody that you see a lot of potential in and a lot of ability, you're going to spend extra time with them or less?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you ought to spend more time with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, and if you see them messing up something, you might, you know, stay on top of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, just consider that possibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  I have to now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, like what you just said there, maybe he does kind of like me and you might look back, maybe you don't think he's teaching you something, but maybe he is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  That's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever [INAUDIBLE] extra help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went in and asked him [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you tell him that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, kind of sort of in a way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's other stuff that's pertaining to what we're studying now [INAUDIBLE] and he just can't explain it to me.  So I've just got to learn it on my own.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you do that?  When is your test?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's this week [INAUDIBLE] over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do you start down at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got a month off, huh?  What are you doing to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am going to sleep.  That's all I'm going to do.  I resigned from my job.  I turned my resignation in last week because they have been trying to fire me for the past, since this summer for no reason.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can't fire me; I quit, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you hung in there for quite a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they're just building up more stuff on top of more stuff.  I mean, so I was just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were you able to save some money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause I was barely working anyway so, when I asked them for the schedule that I asked for, [INAUDIBLE] give it to me.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They wanted me to work every Saturday and the week, when I took off a week in advance for a Saturday, they got mad for taking a Saturday off and [INAUDIBLE] go to the eye exam to get my eyes examined and, uh, they got mad at me for that.  So I just said forget it, I'm, I'm done.  So [INAUDIBLE] worse situation than what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So no work for the next month?  Just take it easy, huh?  Going to travel any?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not trying to.  I just want to stay at the house and sleep.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, [PATIENT NAME].  That sounds a little boring after a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] never, I mean you [INAUDIBLE] back to school cause I hear engineering is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what are you taking next term?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Industrial engineering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What classes do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have no idea yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not registered yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got to do that when I get down there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've got money that came through for you to go there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  My mom, my uncle helped me out a little bit 'cause he went there.  He's an alumni and, uh, also [INAUDIBLE] and student loans and stuff.  So that kind of helped me out a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now all I need to do is just pass my classes and then I'll be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This term you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that contingent on your, you have to pass it to be able to get in there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE] next semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you want to pass them this term to get your degree.  Now which English do you have, uh, right now?  What kind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Literature.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was literature and [INAUDIBLE] English lit, that's way too much reading.  I have to do that the next semester.  Probably, um, during the engineering program I have to do that and that's not going to be fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, [INAUDIBLE] basic, basic English.  It's a lot of reading and a lot of writing.  Uh, I'm trying to talk my teacher out of the final and see -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your powers of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Persuasion are being tested, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, all the work he did this semester and then he's putting more work on top of work without a sheet, I mean with our sheets that [INAUDIBLE].  Uh, finished all our work on the sheet that he gave us, syllabus that we had and he still added more work.  So I'm, I'm trying to ask him not to take the final exam.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He'll think about it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a lot more work than what he, I mean it's a lot more work to give than what he's supposed to.  So I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your mood overall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of anxious and nervous at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of depressed?  Not like before?  What medicines are you taking now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not taking any.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you try that one I gave you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I tried it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it didn't, didn't do much, did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm really not a big medicine, the only time I take it is when I'm really like, when I'm really feeling I'm depressed or when I'm stressed out or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, don't take that pill that way.  It doesn't work that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, you've got to take it everyday for a month to work.  So you're not sad like you were?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?  Mood swings?  So you think you're pretty even?  You getting down a time, when do you get down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's just, I really can't explain that.  Like the only time I get down is like whenever people say things, well, I don't know, say things or maybe like when I go through something, I may be down after that.  Uh, it depends on what happens [INAUDIBLE] keep me down [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] got a lot of things to do.  So [INAUDIBLE] holding me back right now.  Now if I have to take the semester over, then that's going to keep me down or that's going to make me feel down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you take the semester over?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean what if you did?  If [INAUDIBLE] said you've got to, would you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I had to, yes, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, to get your diploma, uh, your associate's degree you might.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But to move on to, to [DEIDENTIFIED], you wouldn't have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but I don't want to take this semester over again because this has been the worst semester I've had.  Everyday it's something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been sick very much, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You mean like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Headaches, stomach aches, ill, throwing up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sad little?  A lot?  All the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Self-esteem?  How you feel about yourself?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's pretty high right now.  That's high right now.  I don't know why I can't explain it.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's not so bad, is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not quite so bad.  You say [INAUDIBLE] you're all so worried about school and you say you're going to study, at least I hope you do, and you've put all this effort into this whole semester.  I'd hate for it to come down to one last test and you not be prepared.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  Well, I'll be mad at myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what I mean.  You'll, you'll be the hardest, you'll be your hardest and worst critic.  You just don't want to disappoint yourself.  You want to be content that you've done most, best possible while you can.  No regrets.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I just want to make it through this semester.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's just a matter of time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got to do the right things in the meantime.  Get that studying in.  Cram it in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mom will help you if you need help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm trying not to ask help her for help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm about to be on my own next semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can ask anybody to ask you questions or do flashcards with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I think [INAUDIBLE] if I learn to do it on my own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're one stubborn person, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I've been told.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] you know you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been told that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're one determined young man.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I've been told that a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Life's tough though, [PATIENT NAME], you know?  Being determined is not so bad.  You just got to pick your right battles.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not giving up or looking to the upside of things; not just focusing on all the negative.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just looking at all the things that are positive [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No new medical problems or health problems lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sir, it's the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bored?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In class, yes.  Very [INAUDIBLE].  I was bored at work 'cause I was doing the same thing over and over and [INAUDIBLE] doing other things.  I'm doing, I mean it could be anything.  I could be at my sister's house playing videogames and I'm not bored.  If I'm with my nieces, I'm never bored doing that.  It's just a lot things that I could do right now just to keep from being bored, but it's just that class that I'm bored in because I'm not learning anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tired a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't feel [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm, I usually go to sleep around [INAUDIBLE] and I get up at 7:30 or 7:00 and do it all over again. </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You kind of sound like you resent that a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] college, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED]'s going to be that much different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [DEIDENTIFIED] isn't going to be that much different [INAUDIBLE] totally different.  At least I'll be able to set my schedule up to where I can get my [INAUDIBLE] like an hour break between the time.  I just don't want no more 8:00 classes, that's it.  Plus I just want to go after something that I want, uh, something that I really wanted to do.  How have you been, sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty good.  Just wondering about your medicine.  You know, last time you were here, you just seemed awful down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was before [INAUDIBLE] the fact that I was working and stressed out.  It's a stressful company and doing the same things over and over and dealt with the same stuff 'cause before like I had mentioned, they were trying to get rid of me that summer.  I mean this summer.  Anytime I turned around [INAUDIBLE].  Uh, team leader, they had to change me off the team that I first started with that they had organized this summer because they were trying to get me fired, but I [INAUDIBLE] put numbers up on the board.   Then I almost got fired because I was on one call the whole day and wouldn't call nobody for help.  I [INAUDIBLE] and it wouldn't come back on and they got mad at me because of that.  So they wanted to get rid of me.  And I was also struggling with psychology at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was just a lot of things going on this summer [INAUDIBLE] matter because I'm going to another school and I'm not, not going to be by myself and I'm not, and on top of that I'm going to be graduating hopefully and I'm just not going to be down there by myself and have to worry about people that I, that are, that I have to, you know, people that I associate myself with.  I'm going to know basically everybody that I need to know and who I need to hang around so [INAUDIBLE] down there.  That's what I'm excited about 'cause I mean I don't have to worry about just going down there and choosing people, trying to figure out what people I need to be around, who I need to be around, what type of people do I need to, can I fit in with, and who are these people?   Do they, do they know me?  Do they this/that [INAUDIBLE]?  It's just going to be like I have somebody right there all the time and I, you know, if I have to tell him something or if I, he has to tell me something, we're right there for each other.  So that's how I, it works out.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So free time, what do you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Play vieo games.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My brother-in-law, my other brother, his friends, uh, my other brother's, little brother [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's where all your money went?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's where your money went.  What game?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What games you playing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We're too busy [INAUDIBLE] basketball game, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I heard that that's pretty fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  We're [INAUDIBLE] they, they kind of don't like to play because all the rules and that first I would lose and take loss, I mean I would take losses and just take losses and like I would win and then like I would lose, lose 2 games, 2 or 3 games and then come back and win a game or I'd just go on a streak, a losing streak and now it's just like I'm not losing.  Like I was going on a winning streak and then they'd be mad.  So it's, it's kind of not good.  I've got people that, that will want to play me every other day.  It's, it's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It gets you up in that pedestal; got to knock you down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 'Cause you get too good and get up on that pedestal, people will knock you down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  No, they don't like me right now because I'm [INAUDIBLE] I'm, I'm, I've got somebody that challenged me the other day and he lost 2 games straight and the other night when I played him, he lost against me as well.  He got mad at that and when I beat him yesterday, he was really mad.  So, but when I beat him yesterday twice, he got mad at me over that.  So now we're just, we're in a [INAUDIBLE].  It's like a combative thing going on right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's that working out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's pretty good.  [LAUGHING].  It's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hmm, it's a lot of things you, you don't see the real, the real people unless you really beat them at the game.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I mean you really [INAUDIBLE].  It's funny [INAUDIBLE] laugh at it and just keep on going, but that's, it sounds weird, but it's, it's a long story.  You're just playing a game and sitting back and playing other people is, it's just like who's better?  Me or you?  It's, you're showing your skill, showing your hand/eye coordination, everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to be okay, aren't you?  You and that headstrong attitude that you have can serve you well.  Just be focused on the right things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.  That's, that's what I'm worried about right now is the waking up and, the waking up part and staying focused [INAUDIBLE].  That's going to be the hardest part because basically my cousin knows everybody because he's been there for 10 years.  So it's going to be a lot harder for me to stay focused on where, uh, see I'm going to have to separate myself from him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can't take it personal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can't take it personal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I want, I want to be around him, but I don't know how he really is when he's on his own.  Uh, the last couple of times I went down there with him, we've had fun.  It was just me and him, he's not, he's not a wild person, but I don't know how he is being my roommate and that's what I'm worried about.  Like are we going to party every weekend or are we going to keep working every like partying every other week and working.  I really don't know how he's, how he really is because I'm not the type of person that goes out and parties every weekend.  I don't like that.  It's just, it gets boring after a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What'd you got planned for the rest of your day today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just go home and work on this paper.  It's due on Thursday.  That's about it.  Other than that, just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You say you're happy, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You don't look it so much, but I'm glad you say it.  Your mom got concerns about you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's just got a lot of concerns [INAUDIBLE] to me being on my own, people like they're trying to get [INAUDIBLE].  Other than that, I mean -</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right [PATIENT NAME], so go ahead, you were saying, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> As I was saying, they had taken up the house that I turned over to [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And actually to [NAME OTHER] in the future.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But legally it has to go to [NAME OTHER] somehow first.  [NAME OTHER] can get it for like nothing and then [NAME OTHER] would have to pay thousands of dollars or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Supposedly to me and then of course I'd have to pay taxes or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So the plan is that eventually that will be [NAME OTHER]'s place, [NAME OTHER]'s place?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Eventually it'll be his or [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] will let [NAME OTHER] turn it over and then [NAME OTHER] will flip some money at him and, you know, and you have a place for them but he has been working on the house.  He has improved the appearance of the house and, you know, the baby is coming, on it's way, it's just two months away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he ready to be a daddy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he ready to be a daddy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Much more so than he was, yeah, and she's, you know, ready or not, she's getting ready and so it's a blessing to have one coming for us, you know, and it's, [NAME OTHER] says that it's a mixture but it's, I think, going to be a nice mixture.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. [NAME OTHER] is probably excited, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's going to be [NAME OTHER].  [NAME OTHER] is certainly excited.  Everybody is certainly excited.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is [NAME OTHER] now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] is pushing [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it sounds good, it sounds exciting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How have your moods been [PATIENT NAME], pretty good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, pretty good.  I, with the heart difficulty, I basically run something like two days on, two days down, unfortunately.  I can't, I can't help that.  It's just too overwhelming, you know, like I'll work in the yard and I can't work hours and hours straight, I have to work an hour.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you get tired and you have pain, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Tired.  I don't let it get to the point where I'm really hurting myself with tiredness but I work within a wise level and then break and then pick it up again and do it again and it seems to be able to go for two days and then really takes two days of rest really to be able to pick up another two days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think there are things that they could do that would give me an increase on that but I think that would be pushing things, so maybe what they're doing is the wisest thing for right now and when the time comes it may be that they, you know, increase it again and I can do more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The last time I saw you in March, you told me you were psychologically okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The same?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm okay.  You have to, I'm blessed to be alive.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No mania, no ups, downs, sideways, it's been pretty good, no depression?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, I'm not having mania or not sloshing around in beer or anything and I never really did that, maybe a touch in college.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I think I had company but basically blessed in that respect.  Health is a relative thing.  I like, even if I'm not doing anything fancy that to just being alive and okay, so I can't work in the yard today, you know, so I can just enjoy myself, you know, in the house and that's what I do.  So that's good, so I'm pleased in that respect.  I'd like more energy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd like more pep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who wouldn't?         </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, really, really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sleeping okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm sleeping okay.  I don't have trouble with sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your weight is good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Stable weight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, my weight is stable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is [NAME OTHER] cooking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm the cook.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm the best cook so I do the cooking, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You like to cook, I know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Steaks and chicken, steaks and chicken, and pasta this and just like that but I don't like it out of a box.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I like to scratch it.  I consider it, I consider nowadays particularly most of that stuff to be pretty dangerous.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Potentially.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  How many years are you out of the stroke?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Gosh that was 2000, it couldn't have been 2?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, 2002.  Still making some progress or have things slowed down?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There might be some progress.  I would enjoy being able to visually read fluently with my eyes.  Now I never thought it was that fast a reader but I could read anything and comprehend it but it is a stumbling block to me and is a difficulty to me and even as little as double checking a recipe is trouble.  I can do it but it is like pulling teeth, so often times I'll call somebody, what's this, you know, and they say it, I know what it is and then I can do it because it's such a pain in the ass to do that.  Now I can write it as good as I could ever write.  I was never a fantastic speller but given that, I can write just as well as I could ever write so it's interesting but my thoughts recently has been that possibly over time I can start improving my reading and it's not like I'm going to sit down and read, you know</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This or that but you constantly, you know, are pressed to read this or that, you know, I can read on the road the basic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Signs</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Speed, you know, stuff like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No accidents [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No accidents.  I had that thing with the one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah that was - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I was standing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that was about three to four years ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I was standing still, what a bitch, and she tried to raise holy hell about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She did, lucky mom was there too to witness.  We were standing still.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But -  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Never had any fallout from that, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You thought - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No fallout, no change in my - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, we thought there was going to be a problem at one point but they went away.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she just kept trying to fight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if I had time and money, I would have - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sued her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Studied and found out what her big error was.  I think her big error was that this wasn't the first time because she had room all over the place to get around me but she slammed me so I think that has happened many a time to her but I didn't look, didn't find, didn't check, not going to check, don't care but I found it, you know, frustrating, but it's down the drain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  It was very frustrating.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No odd or unusual thoughts, you know, anger towards anybody?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm blessed in that the things as I've grown older seem to have really leveled out in smoothness and in terms of, in terms of mental health.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so that's fortunate and it makes it much easier to handle, you know, a stroke and brain damage, you know, in that things have stabilized so it's made it much more blessed.  I would, I'm hoping to really hang around for a long time but it doesn't seem that reasonable but I'm all for it if it does.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm all for it, why not, you know.  Now what, mom's [AGE] and, you know, why not run her out like her dad into the [AGE] and if they're all going to go like that then boy, the heck, not me, no matter what the condition is and the thing would be just don't be ridiculous.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Don't say I'm going to, you know, lift this gigantic stone and carry it across the yard or I feel really bad but I'm going to go do what people are expecting me to do today anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not going to make those stupid mistakes so that I can live a life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's, life is too short.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's for sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's much too short and I find it real interesting and everything so I'd like to see what happens and the kids and all that kind of stuff, I can't be a gigantic help but really if I hang around long enough, I actually will be able to be a greater help.  Like right now, I've got oh $1300, let's say, debt okay and it's basically been going down and I'm pulling in $875 or something and I'm paying, you know, my share on the house and stuff but I'm backed up with a little bit of extra with my health insurance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you know, I'm getting, getting along in that respect</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'd like to get that, rid of that $1400 or whatever the hell it is, it changes, and then I can give little gifts to the kids.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know [PATIENT NAME], more than just money, I mean, presence, I mean, you know, your time is valuable and that's something that you could give to them, help out, baby sit, do some work, you know, spend some time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's always a valuable thing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yes and as you've got to recommend that it's two on and two off, that's basically it and I've been helping, God knows what lack of health would do to the situation but, yeah, I would certainly like to do that and in two months we'll have that baby coming along and I figure, oh about a total of five months from now, that's when I'll, you know, she might pop out where I am</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, then I'll get to see</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is she?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Little [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She would be [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] treats her nicely?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, he does and he's balancing and proving which is good and, you know, well my kids came on late, I think that's just pretty dandy that he has it at [AGE], that can be pretty fun.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, hopefully, he makes the commitment to stay, you know, work hard at the marriage</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's going to be difficult.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I haven't sat and talked or something but when an opportunity presents itself, I'm going to try to say that it's difficult all the way around and people walk away too easily.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's, it can be really good to stay together and if you're not getting along, then back off each other.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> True.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then, and give yourself, both of yourselves some time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I don't think either one should be thinking it's my way or the highway, that kind of attitude in marriage, that's something that is generally going around in society or has over the last year or so, my way or the highway in marriage and that's women saying it to men and men saying it to women, that's nonsense.  That, by the way, is the exact thing that [NAME OTHER] said to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did she?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, it was my way or the highway she said and I thought, well that doesn't sound like a good deal to me, I'm not going to, I love you but I am not going to play that game and things seem like, now this the first time, you see, I went and stayed at a hotel last night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh you did?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was 100, it was terrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where was it, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and I picked a junky one so it wouldn't be expensive because no one had necessarily had invited me and I had heard maybe [NAME OTHER] didn't want me over there from the kids and I didn't see them early in the evening and if I was going, the place was filling up and if I was going to have a place, I was going to have to get it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I got it and but then today when I went by and when I saw [NAME OTHER] last night, I saw [NAME OTHER] last night and he says no, you know, give them the thing back and come on over to the house, [NAME OTHER] is fine to have you at the house and stuff like that and she hasn't been that way at all before.  I said no, they're never going to give me that back.  I was going to go back home today but they were, they said that more than once and [NAME OTHER] was happy to have me there so okay, so tonight I'll go over there.  Now all I ask is, she can be quiet, she can be pleasant.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, there are two couches in the living room so he'll have one couch, I'll have a couch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is [NAME OTHER] still heavy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't really seen her recently but [INAUDIBLE] she's still setting records, yeah, it's a shame but that's her, that's her way that it is.  I think she deals, she truly needs for her own sake, she needs to be able to take advantage of good psychological interaction for a long period of time, I think it would help her but she doesn't do that and she's not inclined to do it and I think that's where that fat comes from, that's her natural tranquilizer, that's it, it's a shame but whatever, I'm not going to bitch to her about that, you know.  So hopefully she'll just groove along and just say nothing or just be okay and if she passes that, then I'll just go, I'll go back, I'll get in the car and go. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What time do you plan on leaving tomorrow?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I wake up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm not going to hang around town.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] by herself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] by herself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] are with</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know but is she by herself in the house?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, now she is, yeah.  She spends like every other week over [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER]'s</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And she stays there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then comes back over to our place.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does [NAME OTHER] get along well with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, oh yeah, so it just goes back and forth like that so that's cool, she's doing well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how are you making out with the medicine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good, it's so damn expensive.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why do they charge you so much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's, well it's over 70 bucks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 70?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Over 70 bucks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's the generic you take too, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it's generic, if it isn't, I'll take</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you get a lot though, it is generic, yeah, you get a lot of them, you get 150.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get 150 but what I'm thinking is, but there's probably a lot of reasons why not, I think, I know there's some that are cheap, first off, first off, the system does not pay for most any of these things unless I was to be taking Stelazine, Thorazine or something like that, you know, and God forbid.  Now I thought of, I know it was cheap, of Valium but I don't know because I think it's, whatever the tranquilizer is, it's something I have to be on forever and that I think is dirt and I wonder if it wouldn't be covered. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I don't know.  The medicine should be dirt cheap.  Excuse me [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hello.  Oh yeah, okay, okay, and you're closing at four thirty and you open at eight.  Yeah, no, okay, all right, I'll pick it up tomorrow.  All right, thanks.  Sorry [PATIENT NAME].  So the medicine should be dirt cheap anyway.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Should be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the problem is that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The government.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I don't know what the hell the problem is but I know I've been down this road with somebody else and I was surprised.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If you say, I know [NAME OTHER] was talking to me something about if there's something that is said that it would be, it is of significant value for maintaining</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I tried that.  I've had people, they've taken it off of the formulary and say we're not denying you, we're just not covering it so if you want it, you pay out of pocket basically and a couple years ago they let you appeal it and I tried with somebody else about six months ago and we appealed it, appealed it again and they said look, we're not doing it this year, this year we're done so it's if you want it, we're not going to prevent you from taking it but you've got to pay for it, end of story, no ifs, ands or buts, so that was the issue.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I hope in their cases.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That they start doing that with quality antibiotics.  When those doctors get a strong infection that they have to pay the maximum amount for an effective antibiotic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't get why they did that [PATIENT NAME], I really don't, it doesn't make any sense but these are drugs that are used widely by millions of people</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they're valuable.  I can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't understand, I was.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can take care of, I can come up with some stupid thing that would give me a relaxed state but I wouldn't be as functional.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's beyond me [PATIENT NAME] how this ever happened but it is what it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And we tried and they're just not willing to, things change so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I think it will change, I think it will change within three years when, after the democrats have been in for a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I don't know how long this has been a problem but it's ongoing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it hasn't been.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      END TRANSCRIPT</p>

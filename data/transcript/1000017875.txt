<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: The eyes in my room (laughs). It was so funny. I got up this morning, too, and my girlfriend says, "Oh, it's Valentine's Day." I said, oh great. You know I don't have anything in my wardrobe that's red.</p>

<p>That's funny because, you know, the first thing I thought of is (inaudible at 0:23) how stupid it was that I feel that way. It's like I was wondering, what would I do? I was wondering, what would I do if somebody said to me you know (laughs). You know it's weird, it's like a little kid thinking like somebody's not going to accept me because I'm not exactly like everybody else (laughs). I thought, oh, you dummy. But it's just like a thought that I get sometimes that if you don't do things, you know, you find yourself not being in with people. It's kind of weird. I never realized. You know, it just hit me this morning. I said, well, isn't that dumb. I said, don't wear that dress because it's orange and they're going to think you're, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean if you don't look the right way, or - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - or appear just right, then people will think you're not something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, right. And it's - it kind of made me wonder. Like I was like that before, like about a year ago, that I thought like if you look the part you will be the part, you know? And I said to myself - that's what I said to myself this morning - I said, look, if you don't have the red, put something red on if you want to but that's it and then just don't worry about it.</p>

<p>But, you know, it's like a thing that still comes up and I realize that now that it's like I feel like I have to be a certain way for certain - you know for people or whatever so that they'll accept me. And, I mean, I'm not saying that you should be a (inaudible) for people. You know, it's like, I put almost too much sometimes. </p>

<p>And like Sunday, I went out to this girl's house with Jodie and when I got home, I felt so depressed. I was reading this story on (inaudible at 0:01:52.9). It's called - it's one if the 50 minute, hour stories. And I said boy, you know, she's worse than I am I think is hers - the severity of her hang up, you know. </p>

<p>But it's so funny, because like she says she goes on these eating sprees. Well I don't eat until I get faint, but I do eat a lot sometimes. And I said hmm, you know, a minor (inaudible at 0:02:15.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I was reading her and I could -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm losing you. What was the point of this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was reading about it. She had a real hang up I guess with her mother thinking that her mother drove her father away or something, you know. And she had a hang up on sex, which I think I have a little bit of one too. I have an idea there's something there, you know, that I'm afraid of it in a certain way. </p>

<p>And it's like she would say like she goes out on these binges and she would eat actually until she - until the point her body just couldn't eat anymore. She'd become unconscious I guess and sleep for a couple of days. </p>

<p>I said, well I don't get that bad, but I can remember like a year ago eating so much that I was - I was trying to go but I couldn't yet because I hadn't eaten quite enough. I came back more or less to my senses before then. But I had just eaten and eaten and eaten. I must have eaten like three meals in one, you know, like really unbelievable amount of food. And I sat down and I kept saying why did you do this, you know, you're going to gain weight. It wasn't really that. It was like one of these things like I was on kind of a hunger thing. I got very hungry and I couldn't fill myself up that way with food. And then I just ended up being depressed anyway (laughs) you know so it was like a vicious circle that didn't get anyplace. (0:03:22.7)</p>

<p>But like Sunday, I found myself when I got back - I guess we were talking about the two sisters. And the one sister is the one that was her student. She's very sexy. And I noticed that like even the way she calls her brother, "Oh, come on over here." You know and it's like, it's not put on it's just the way she talks. And I guess men really flip for that type of thing. </p>

<p>And so she was talking about her other sister who's got a very pretty face. She's got dark hair, right, and this girl's a blond. And I was thinking you know I wonder who this dark haired one is and the blond, you know. My girlfriend's got blond hair, by the way. </p>

<p>And she said, "What do you think of the other girl, you know, the other - the sister." </p>

<p>And I said, "I think she's very pretty." You know, she really is. She's got a very pretty face. She's as pretty as the blond as far as the facial features go. But she doesn't have the eyes. She doesn't have the right colored hair, I guess, to make her sexy or whatever it is that you know makes some girl sexy and some girls not sexy. </p>

<p>But I said, "No, I think she's very pretty."</p>

<p>She said, "Well, she's too drab. She's dowdy." </p>

<p>I said, "Well, all right, so her dress is. Maybe someday she won't be. You know, maybe she'll come out of this or she'll go to school or she'll do whatever she does and you know she won't be what you call dowdy."</p>

<p>And she says, "Well, she just doesn't have it. The other one does." </p>

<p>And the first thing I thought of is I got hungry (laughs) you know and I had to have something to eat. And it was just like I was comparing the same thing because she said that to me before that like I'm not sexy or something insinuating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you were left out, not good enough, or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I kept saying to myself, look - even my other girlfriend says, look, there's nothing wrong with your looks. And there's nothing, you know like I'm not - I don't really turn fellows off. And I've had some sharp fellows that have been interested in me. </p>

<p>You know, but it's just like the idea that this one is so sexy that when she walks - she's another one - walks in the room and every man falls all over them. And I felt when I brought Harold home, this friend that I met through my friends in (inaudible). He's not really a friend -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, wait a minute. What you're saying is that you're like afraid that you're not sexy enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, like I'm not attractive enough to men. And this is one of the reasons I get like - when I get a man, I'm very possessive with him. It's one of the reasons. I think part of it's because my father never gave me love and I'm still looking for love, you know, that somebody really loves me and that just like as soon as a sexy girl or as soon as a prettier girl or as soon as whatever comes on the scene he's taking off someplace. </p>

<p>And this is why with my girlfriend, I know how she is with men. And Saturday I brought Harold home. And like I was - well he came home. He came over and picked me up for a date is what it was and I wasn't ready yet. </p>

<p>She went to the door and introduced herself. Well, I know enough that really I should have reintroduced them when I came out you know officially. But you know, well she says my walk changed. Well I had to tell her where her voice changed (laughs) when men's around and her actions change and her facial expressions change and the whole bit. She plays the same game I do. And I said I suppose it's as unconscious as mine is except when someone tells you about it, you know. (0:06:13.9)</p>

<p>But the idea is like - well, she says you start walking different and she said that was terrible that you didn't introduce us and everything. It was terrible manners. And I said to myself, yes it was and why. And I said, I knew this. I said I didn't. I said well I didn't know definitely - I didn't know if you introduced yourself. </p>

<p>But actually deep down, if it would have been just a friend, like if it would have been Chrissie instead, my other girlfriend, I would have loved to introduce her. Because she is - she's another one like lots of times like (inaudible at 0:06:42.2). Or even, you know, like there's a doctor who's a friend of hers and then my - you know mostly it's her friend - who would talk more to her. But that doesn't bother me. </p>

<p>I think partly it's because - I guess maybe it's because she doesn't play the same game that I do. You know, it's like I want attention; she wants attention. She can't say she doesn't and that's one of the reasons I think she is so sexy. I think that's part of it. I think it's a need more than just an actual thing. </p>

<p>Maybe it's me. Maybe it's a neurotic feeling of mine because I feel like, you know, men don't do it for me so there's something wrong with me. So therefore - or maybe they did more - they did pay more attention to me when I did play a game and I didn't even realize I played a game, you know, like flirting a little bit more, and realizing I was doing, you know, a thing like this. </p>

<p>But I'm not sure. I just - you know, I got that feeling like I was afraid you know just to get down to - I didn't want Joe in the house and I knew it. I wanted to get him out of there as quick as possible because I know how she was. </p>

<p>And I said look, this is one guy who's nice. He's a sweet guy. He's going for I guess his PhD in sociology. And he's a real sweet guy and I really like him and I have lots of fun talking to him and going out and, you know, just goofing around with him. And I didn't want him near because all she has to do is start spouting about all the places she's been and all the things she's done and lots of fellows even if you know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you were afraid he would fall for that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and he would fall for her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you would be left out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and I would be left out again. So you know it's not like I try to be impolite. It's just like why feed a fire or let a fire start when you don't have to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're protecting yourself. (0:08:10.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I was - that's true. I was protecting myself from her, and maybe it's lack of confidence. But like if she comes right out and says that look every guy in the room is going to fall for me. And you know darn well that you have seen it that lots of fellows have, you know, or in fact most of the fellows that have come in. </p>

<p>I don't want to take a chance on something that might be mine. Maybe it's selfish. Maybe it's insecurity. But it's like look, I never had anything that stayed mine you know unless I really fought for it. And I feel like I'm not going to let her take this away from me, you know? </p>

<p>And she says this too. She says well you know like girls friendship should be the best thing in the world and all of this. I said fine, you know, it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you've lost too much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and I've lost too much in the way of men. You know, like I never had a father. And when I get a man, I don't want another girl there that's sexy as hell. I mean, if it's a girl like Chrissie who would not try - see, Chrissie is very secure and she's married, and she loves James and James loves her. And I haven't ever tried to take James away from her by at the same token.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So much for you to have a person like just the thought of having to give them up is like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like saying like well now he's with me. And yet I had another girlfriend that did the same thing to me. It was like she was there and I would be part of it. I would withdraw as she would come in rather than try to stay with the conversation and keep it going three ways or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is that you kind of just can't stand the pressure of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it's still like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're - the threat is there that they'll take over and then you just can't even handle it anymore because it's going happen and you're going to lose again and it's all over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, like she says things like since she's been a little girl every - some girls have it, some girls don't. Seems to me I don't have it, you know? So admit it, you're - and she said that like some girls don't even have one or two meaningful people in life. I said I don't care, but I wish the one or two would come along, you know? (0:10:05.2)</p>

<p>Because it's like I haven't - I've dated and things like this and I have a couple of friends like Jim. Like I really care about Jim. And like the same thing happens. He comes over and she's starting to move in again, slowly. The first few times he was defensive against her. But now it's been like when he comes over, when he's in the house, he pays more attention to her than he does to me. And I said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Crowds you out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I said to myself look, all right, so you've got lots of interesting things to talk about. You can say all the places you've been. You can tell them all the schooling you went through, all the courses you take, okay. Or whatever you're going to talk about. You know, like you're more interesting than I am because you've been more places and done more things. But like why with my friends? When her friends are around, even if I stay there, I don't talk a heck of a lot to them, because it's her friends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like why does she do that to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well maybe it's because of my own insecurities that I put it off on other people and say look, because I don't do it you should respect the same thing I do. You know, it's like I expect to be second best with your friends. So you should expect to be second best with my friends by the same token. I don't try to say that, you know, I want to try to take every fellow who walks in the house that's your fellow away for me. But like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's your insecurity if something like seeing it all in terms of second best.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sharing friends, it's more like one's up or one's down or one's up or one's down. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's like this. It's like I said. First of all, I don't know her friends as well. And you know like when you meet somebody and you go out with somebody or whatever and then you're just like a roommate or a friend or whatever who just sort of introduced you to the group, I don't expect to be like now are you going to be better than her. I don't expect that. But by the same token, I don't push myself in to try to be. And to me this is the way I feel like she actually pushes the issue, you know, of being - wanting to have the fellow, you know, pay more attention to her. And like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She asks for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And like she says she doesn't, but I can remember - I'll never forget the time when I walked in and she had one of her boyfriends. Now I hardly ever meet her boyfriends, hardly ever. She keeps the boyfriends away or she dates them when I'm not around like for lunch or for whatever. </p>

<p>I never really met a fellow she dug except for this one guy. And this is what kind of reminded me. Like cause she'll let me meet friends, you know, just fellows she goes out with like, you know, for hamburgers or she'll go out someplace, but she's not romantically at all attached to them. </p>

<p>And she brought one fellow home and I'll never forget that because it was like - she did the same thing that those dumb girls at that party did. And I don't care what she says. Because like see I can see it's not just me. There's two of us insecure. And she does it one way because she is sexy and she can get guys. And it's like every guy in the room has got to pay more attention to her no matter who's (inaudible) it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're also saying she keeps her guys away from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She keeps her guys away from me. And it's not like I want them. It's just the idea like I say look, you want me to bring everybody home and you want me to let my - even fellows I like as boyfriends sit around and you want to talk to them and, you know, have them pay a lot of attention to you. And yet by the same token you won't do that with a boyfriend for me. You won't bring them home. (0:13:07.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you want fair where it's not fair.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep taking people away from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she hasn't yet. Because like I haven't brought many people home. It's one of the reasons she hasn't, you know, I've sort of kept my life away from her life. And it's like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like she would do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like she would because of the way when she had that one boyfriend there. And I was like - well she was a little bit high, but like usually that's when you let yourself - all your guards down and everything. </p>

<p>Like she said this is so and so. You know, this is one of the guys she really dug for a long time. So I said I'll hide behind, you know, and then I could feel like it's time to leave. So I said hi, I picked up, and I went in the bedroom. She said something about this is my best friend. So that made me feel better, you know, at least somebody likes me you know. And then I went into the bedroom and that was it. And he left a little while later. </p>

<p>But it was like, this is the kind of respect I have and I don't expect to sit there and entertain her guests or to sit there and talk to her boyfriends. Friends okay, not boyfriends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All of this sounds like sort of the same thing, I mean like kind of grafting, hanging on to people, you know being so afraid that somebody else is going to get them and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: But not just anybody, though. See it's - I guess it's not any girl. It's just the girl that is the type like my girlfriend is. I don't know if she does it purposely or if it's inborn or it's part of her insecurity or just her natural, you know, whatever to want attention or to get attention. </p>

<p>And it's like not mine, you know, I don't want every guy in the room to fall all over me. I really don't . First of all, I wouldn't know what to do with them. I wouldn't know how to talk to every one or whatever. I wouldn't want it. </p>

<p>But when I have somebody I'm with, I don't want them to start paying more attention to somebody else when I'm there. I mean, if he wants to drop me off home and go out - go with any girl in town, I don't care. Even if I find out about it, I don't care. Because when he's with me, I should be the most important one. And that's all I am. I don't think - I don't even think that's so much of a neuroses really as just being fair. Because why be with somebody if you don't like them the best. Be with the other person. If you want to go with her fine but then don't come back to me buster because I don't want you back, you know. (0:15:10.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If they don't care about you, why should they be with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and this is why I feel too, but it's like I don't like them and I don't want to take the chance on it. Of course, they say if a fellow really likes you, it doesn't make any difference who's in the room. You know, Sophia Loren could walk in and they would, you know, supposedly - that's the theory - that they'd stay with you. </p>

<p>But it's like part of it is because like I don't know if I'll ever get over this completely because of the way, you know, like I've always been second best. And no matter how much I give or try to give or whatever - like I can get friends and those friends I don't think would ever turn on me. Like Chrissie and James and Jodie wouldn't turn on me as a person, you know. And my other - well, she's sort of my girlfriend, like I do more for her than she ever - she doesn't hardly ever do anything for me. But that's all right because I still like her. But it's like I know that, you know, like if I need something, you know, I could count on at least the three of them. (0:16:01.7)</p>

<p>But, you know, it's like why do people have to be like that? You know, why when you get something, why do they have to try to take it away from you? Or why does it always happen I should say maybe it's partly me because then I just sit in the corner and I get feeling bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's happened to you your whole life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, another person's come around and they've always been favorite. And then I ended up second best. You know like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you can't do anything about it. You run away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I remember, when was it, last Saturday that Jodie and I went to my sisters. And like she was talking all the hang-ups she saw in her house. </p>

<p>Like my sister was even worse than I have ever been like, you know, she said the same thing. She's envious of her husband. So as soon as - like she's envious because he plays piano well. So as soon as somebody comes over that's interested in piano, like my girlfriend took piano and she took music and all this, so they're talking some music back and forth, you know. </p>

<p>And I don't know, well part of it, she said something about he didn't say anything to her until she crossed her legs. She's got great-looking legs. All right, now, if she says that she is not trying to attract somebody, and she knows that just by going like this while she's talking to a fellow is going to attract them - and this is my sisters husband - why do it? You know like why start something if you know what's going happen, or you're pretty sure, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it's really dishonest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is what I'm saying. Like she says she's naturally attractive. I say she probably, if not consciously subconsciously, it's a little thought like I know I've got great looking legs. </p>

<p>You know, what's that doing? It's like saying here it is. You know, I'm really great looking or whatever and this attracts a fellow. She says I do this and she's doing the same damn thing herself. Or at least I did it more. I started again  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She criticizes you for doing it and then she does it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She does the same thing herself. And like, first of all, I don't like the idea of something (inaudible). And she said - like he wanted her to go out on the back porch to play the piano for her - to her. She says, well you better come with me, like she really needed me. (0:17:55.2)</p>

<p>And I was like if - look, if you were worried about my sister getting jealous or feeling bad, you wouldn't have even gone out there in the first place. You know, if you knew the kind of hang-up my sister has - and she is. She's tremendously jealous. </p>

<p>If I would go out there and listen to myself to the piano to him playing, or even talk to him and she'd walk into the room from someplace else, she'd look at me like what's going on here. You know? And I know this. She's tremendously, tremendously jealous. </p>

<p>Which I don't think - I'm saying this like, again, if I walked out of a room at a party and a fellow was talking to another girl and I came back, I would just join in. Or maybe I'd go someplace else. I don't mind that idea like at a party like in this situation or even a position where I'm not there for him to pay attention to more than one girl, like if I were married or whatever. You know? </p>

<p>It's just the idea that when I'm there and I'm a girl and it's obvious to me, in a boy-girl relationship - it's not just, you know, talking about the weather or something - that I get uptight, and I feel it. I know I do with girls. And I felt it then, I felt it Saturday, that she was like egging my brother-in-law on. (0:19:02.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the main (inaudible) is that it makes you really angry that she should be so sneaky about it and then kind of deny that she did it. It's like a really dishonest thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The funny thing is the thing's she's telling me how secure she - not secure, but like she does the therapy; she's come this far. She doesn't do any of this stuff anymore and it was just inborn that she was. </p>

<p>I don't think it was because I had the same problem when I was little. You know, my father rejected me so I wanted attention from males. And I think it was the same thing and it's still the same thing. </p>

<p>I don't care if - like I don't know this bit about sex bit. I don't know how much worth I put on it. I think lots of it's learned and I don't care what she says about it. Some people are just born that way. I don't know about that. I think it's partly you have to learn how to manage a man; you have to learn different things, and things like this. Then I think you're attractive to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really don't believe what she's saying, and it's like you have some things to tell her. It's about time she learned that or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the only thing is, is maybe it's because it's just my thought and maybe it's just something that I think maybe it's just because I'm trying to hide from the truth. That maybe I'm not attractive, you know? </p>

<p>Because like when I was little - not little, probably like, I don't know, like eight or nine, you know. I can remember like my - no, it wasn't that, it was my other (inaudible) don't look in the mirror, don't worry about it and things like that. And I don't even remember things like she'd say. Well maybe she can't keep a boyfriend because maybe it's because of her ugly legs. You know? </p>

<p>And so like I would get so many complexes that maybe I was not pretty, you know, and I always asked my own mother, did you ever say I was pretty? Because I never felt pretty, you know. And I really don't. </p>

<p>You know, I can look in the mirror and say, well, the face looks pretty good, but maybe - I've even thought things like the face looks pretty good in the mirror, maybe it doesn't really look good in real life, you know, like maybe you know it's just the angles of the mirror. Because I remember a girl telling me when I took pictures for modeling that I took very good pictures. I looked very good in the pictures. And when I was thin and, you know, when I got in modeling and pictures. This one girl looked at it and she said, "Well, it's a good picture. It's a pretty picture, but it doesn't look anything like you." </p>

<p>I thought, oh, shit. Here I am, and I says, you know, "My makeup was different." </p>

<p>She said, "Well, I don't think it would make any difference. It still doesn't look like you." (0:21:15.1)</p>

<p>So here I said well, you know, like here I looked at these pictures, and I thought, well, maybe I'm not bad looking. And I think, Christ, it's just the way the camera took some kind of a sneak shot and I'm really not pretty. And it's like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the main thing. You really feel like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, inside, and I guess maybe partly this is the reason why maybe I can't keep a fellow because I have too nice and I finally figure - finally somebody found me attractive or somebody liked me, you know. </p>

<p>And like she came up with that Sunday and it made me think about how I have been. You know, like I've been the good type girl or whatever and I've always been - I've always been nicer than whatever I could, you know, like waving at them and things like this and being cuddly and this type of thing. (0:21:57.2)</p>

<p>And I guess fellows just don't appreciate it. You know, they get to the point where they can have everything they want except, like, I wouldn't go to bed with everybody, you know, not in that sort of. But you may as well say I was prostituting myself the way I would do things. I'd be like oh, please like me, you know. Dance with me and I'm up in heaven, and all this baloney. Like it was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just doing everything for them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And what they - they would get bored with it. They would say well, you know, like I can have this girl any time and she'll do anything for me and move on to the next one. </p>

<p>But like it's very hard - I guess part of it she says is because I don't have enough self worth. I don't know. But it's very hard for me to be bitchy to somebody that I like, you know? Because like it just seems so like an antithesis. You're starting out and you're being - you're supposed to be rotten o somebody you love. I mean, that's dumb to me. I just cannot reconcile the fact that I'm supposed to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are we talking about now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Men. You know, I can't reconcile the fact that I'm supposed to be rotten to men so that they'll like me. You know, I just say to myself, that's not the way you get people to like you. It's by being nice to them, to give to them, you know, and be good to them. No, you can't do that with men. I says, oh, you know. Like, I said to myself, well, maybe I just never learned how to handle a man. You know? And I said but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, wait a minute. That was a pretty big jump. I mean, on the one hand you're going to be doing everything for a man. And on the other hand, you're going to be bitchy. There's a lot of room here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I guess that's true. But I mean she was like saying that like when she was nice to somebody she lost them too. (Inaudible at 0:23:27.2) I said, you lost somebody you didn't want to get rid of? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were trying to learn from her a way to be or -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I guess that's true. Because I've always been like that, you know, and I've always figured well, look at this kid's got this and she's got that and she's got the other thing. So you know there's no place to go but up, so try and learn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sort of, if she says the way to do it is to be bitchy, then you could try that out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, but then she comes out with the other thing and I say it's hard. And she says well then don't try it. You know, like wait a minute. You're telling me I should be bitchy because otherwise I won't catch a fellow. And then you say - or keep a fellow or whatever. And then you say, you know, don't be bitchy if it's not natural to you. </p>

<p>I mean, you know, wait a minute. Hold it. Slow down. I'm still back at the first bitchy, you know? It's like I just - I don't even know where I'm going partly. </p>

<p>I really feel like now I want to start a relationship with a man. Like it's just like I feel a need coming at me to you know like start some kind of a real love with a man. Because like I haven't had a real - I haven't really loved any man, really. And I realize it. It was like a one-sided thing with that one doctor that was so humane and so good. But I don't know if that was more because like he was the type of father I wanted or he was just the type of image of a man more than the man himself that really. I thought, wow, here's somebody who's honest. Here's somebody who - you know maybe I felt like I didn't have to play games with him. </p>

<p>And he was another one. Like when I was six, I still remember that one that Irish doctor told me you look more like Marilyn Monroe every day, and all of this type of thing like that a little girl just like, you know, like I was always a big tomboy, but for him I wasn't. And it was just like when he walked in the room it was like oh, wow, you know. </p>

<p>And it was the same way with this other doctor. It was like god, I would go - people would say, oh you have to go to the hospital if you're (inaudible). I'd be like yeah, the hospital. I'd be like a little - I don't know, like a little kid in the candy store or something. Like, oh wow, I could see that man, you know. (0:25:28.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's really important for you to have someone to take care of you, be good to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and at least to show me - like I remember feeling a little bit jealous like type I guess he would pay like attention to the nurses or something. I mean every nurse in that hospital's madly I think in love with him. He was just that type of guy. He was good looking but it wasn't looks. I mean, there were better looking doctors around. He just had something about him like people went, you know. </p>

<p>And it wasn't - it wasn't for me. I was 16 so I was old enough to feel like it was sex, you know. But it wasn't sex to me. Like some of the girls probably thought he was really sexy. Sexy he was not to me. You know, he was just good, you know. It was like oh, I just worship the ground he walked on because he was so good. And he was so like concerned about you as a person. </p>

<p>And he was, you know, like he turned my cast on a Sunday because he put it on on Saturday and forgot it was Saturday. You know, so he comes walking in with a suit on, puts an old coat on and trims my cast. You know, he didn't have to do that. And he made some joke about, "Well, you'll get the bill in the mail," or some, you know, some goofy thing like that. </p>

<p>I wasn't paying for it. It was under insurance so I knew like, you know, I didn't have to pay for it, and he was only kidding. But it was like, you know, like I don't know. </p>

<p>I haven't met people like this. And I guess maybe since I met him, too, I'm looking for some kind of a like a fellow who - I'm sure he wasn't as good as I made him out to be. But you know like, I'm looking for somebody who's like him who I can be honest with. And he'll take care of me and he'll be good to me and he'll be polite to me and everything. And yet I don't have to put on the airs because, like, I can't be that dishonest. </p>

<p>You know, like I try to be honest with myself. Here I am on one hand trying to be very honest with myself and on the other hand, I'm trying to put on this big feminine facade that, you know, drives me out of my mind now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really don't want to be something that you're not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm not. And this is what it is when you have to play these little games and you have to - you know, like I am naturally flirtatious and I know this. And it's not because I wanted attention. Because I can remember it, where was it, when we went to Atlantic City. And I was with this one fellow and he was just nice. And I was listening to him. And it's just natural, when I talk my eyes move or whatever and I'm not trying to be flirty.</p>

<p>But like my - I remember my girlfriend saying - I said something about well, he was really nice. I really dug talking to him but I guess I made a mistake because he asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said yes, you know. And he said, oh, a special one. So I made up this fictitious guy and it was the first time all night I had been dishonest because I remember her saying she - oh, she did this all the time. You know like she had 10 boyfriends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're just sick of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really want to be you and have someone care just about you. (0:28:13.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not - you know, like I've always felt - I felt this way about it like too. We were talking about that last night about this one fellow who's in the gym and he's got a wife who comes down. And every time - he's the one that I think I might have said is so un-cool because he came out and he whispers in my ear and he's seen me like three times. He's talked to me for a total of maybe 15 minutes, and he loves me. You know, you go oh, shit.</p>

<p>But he's like tried this with every halfway decent looking girl that's ever walked into the place. You know, oh, I love you. You know so he tried that with me. And I got to the point where like I just - you know he just repulsive. </p>

<p>So we were talking about love and like how you can handle love like for - like I said sometimes like fellow would love you like as in a girlfriend or a wife, or they could love you like a sister, or they could love you like a friend, you know. And I said you know there is all different relationships but this guy can only think of one thing. Every girl that walks in there, you know, he's got to love them sex, period. That's it, you know. </p>

<p>And so I said I don't feel this way. In other words, like every man I don't think that - first of all, I don't want every man that I meet to fall madly in love with me. I don't care. But like a fellow who I really like as a boyfriend, I wish he'd like me as a boyfriend, and one's I like as a friend I wish they'd would like me as a friend, you know. </p>

<p>And all right, I do have (inaudible) that I'd like to be the best. I do like to be the best friend or the best girlfriend or the best whatever, and maybe that's why eventually I might get married so I can at least say, you know, I've got the ring on my finger that says I'm supposedly his best girl. But I don't know. </p>

<p>And it's like - it's like it's so funny, though, like I don't feel. I feel like a little bit like I wish maybe like Daniel, you know, like my girlfriend's friends. Because I actually did meet him first at the same theater but then she got to know him better because they started going out. (0:30:09.9)</p>

<p>I liked the idea though that he likes me in this way. He likes me more like a little sister. He likes her like a girlfriend. I said this is fine. Because you can't equate those two types of love. You can't say he loves her more than he loves me, see, because he loves me in a different way than he loves her. </p>

<p>And like he'll say, like once in a while he will call and say where's the lady I love. I say which one, you know, or something like that. Well, okay, you know I mean the one I love as madly as a girl, okay that one. But it's like at least I can feel like there's a feeling there. You know like I don't - again, I don't feel like every fellow's got to love me as a girlfriend. Or you know I think I'm the sexiest woman alive or the most beautiful one alive or all the other bull. But that - I want him to - like if I like a fellow, I would like him to return that liking. You know and if I do for a fellow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's really important to have him think that you're special.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I'm not just like anybody you say hello to and not care if they're there or not when you go back. </p>

<p>You know, it's like - because that - what it makes me feel like when I go through that type of thing is like I'm uninteresting, or that I don't have a - like I don't have a decent personality, or that I just - I'm not good enough for whatever. You know, and it's like it's really like an awful feeling. Because again, it gives me that feeling of inferiority like I feel like I'm not good enough. I'm not - I'm second rate. </p>

<p>And like, when I've come this far, it really bugs me because like I feel like now with friends, I can give. I can share girlfriends to a point. I can share fellows to a point even as long as there's not somebody around who's ultra-sexy and who could, you know, who could hurt me by making this fellow like her, whether she did it purposely or, you know, unintentionally. And he starts liking her.</p>

<p>How could I possibly like - it would be like somebody taking something from you. And how can you possibly not blame the person who took it, whether they meant to or not, to? This is part of it. Like I don't want to lose my friends and I don't want to lose my boyfriends, so therefore I keep them apart. (0:32:12.5)</p>

<p>You know, and she does the same thing with me. Like I said, I met that one fellow, and it was like you could say hello to him and that's it. You know, you take a look at him. He's good looking. Good, get out of here. You could feel it in the air like this is not the fellow that you can talk to, and that was all I talked to him.</p>

<p>You know and it's like I don't know why she says - like you said, "Oh you've got a pretty roommate and I bet you two have wild times together." </p>

<p>Well, that was probably one of the reasons like you're not getting even near him, you know. And it was like I didn't care because I didn't want her boyfriend. I didn't even - personally, he was good looking but he was not the type that attracted me. I didn't care first of all. </p>

<p>I mean if he was - there are certain people, I guess there are certain girls with certain fellows that you just - you just say hi to them or whatever. And they're so either open or loving or whatever, or I guess maybe some of them are sexy that you just like to stay around. And you just go - whether you talk to them or whether you have any kind of relationship - but you know just to go like that to them. </p>

<p>But like this was not one of them. So I didn't care except for the idea that I felt look, you're doing the same thing you accuse me of doing. And I don't like it, you know. And so I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just not fair.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I figured if it's - what's fair for me is fair for you, you know. If I have to do it, so do you. </p>

<p>She'll tell me about like oh this one, oh you don't know this one. And that one, oh, you don't know that one. They're boyfriends see. You don't know those because they're boyfriends and you won't meet - you won't ever meet them. So I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like she's giving you some kind of dirty deal there. I mean, she tells you to be different, but then she does things to you that are the same things she tells you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to do. Exactly. And like I don't know where to go then, you know. </p>

<p>And I find myself for a while then, like when I was in Atlantic City and we met this first group, and I was a little more relaxed. Well then I was afraid, you know, because we were flirting with them. I said, oh, shit. You know, so, and like this all night long. I was like I a stone woman. That's what the (inaudible) said. Why is she so cold? Why is she so stiff? (0:34:07.2)</p>

<p>Well, this is why, because I was so afraid well now I'm going to go back to flirting. And I don't want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really afraid of hurting her, of taking something away from her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know if it's even that because like she didn't like the guy I was - I did. I really dug that guy as far as - I didn't like him so much as that - I mean, you know, like a boyfriend. But I mean I liked him as a person and I thought he was very sharp looking, and he was real nice to talk to.</p>

<p>But no, she had one fellow and the other one seemed to get, you know (inaudible at 0:34:36.7). But like she had to - this is another thing that bugged the hell out of me. I ended up with nobody after Atlantic City, really, that wrote to me. She had one fellow who - from the first group - who was actually was my other girlfriend's and she - my other girlfriend kind of dug him. He wrote to her or something and supposedly like he liked her. </p>

<p>The second group of fellows, I was with one and again, you know. And like after a while I really did not like the guy. And he didn't care for me, neither one of us cared for each other. So it, like, it was a mutual thing, we went out one night and that was it. </p>

<p>But like she went with one fellow who she's now putting through therapy because she found out later on that he was kind of grouped up. And then there was another fellow, and there were two fellows after I thought liked my other girlfriend. </p>

<p>But now this girlfriend can't stand that because you know I could tell one guy was really falling all over (inaudible) it was so funny. I cracked up. He had one of those things in the pool that he was carrying all over the place with it. He was like - she was like his slave or mistress or whatever you want to call it. It was funny. </p>

<p>So this guy really dug her. This one did dig her, you know. The other one who she kind of dug, and he was very sharp looking and very kind of sharp in his ways. And he supposedly liked her too. </p>

<p>Well, anyways, the gist of the story happened like after we got back, the other one was supposed to have said to the one she's putting through therapy and the one that liked her that he wished he had been first to get her. But since he wasn't, he went over to the girlfriend. In other words saying I'm best because two of the fellows out of four really liked me not her. And if they would have liked her, then it would have made me whatever, you know. </p>

<p>And I said, now wait a minute. That's, again, it's like I would do. And first of all, why are you even telling me because the fellow you're talking about does not like me. He did not like me. I didn't care if he liked you because I didn't like him anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's really bragging over you. (0:36:27.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It was like saying like two fellows really like me, and it was bragging over my other girlfriend too who was not even present at the time. And why tell me? You know, why like should I know? What is even - what's even the use of bringing it up unless it was to say look at me, I got the (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You weren't saying sort of why are you showing off like this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, why do you need to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, not only does it make me angry, but it hurts my feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And like - I felt to myself like well, why. Then again, I thought well, Jesus, you know. Luke doesn't - didn't even call me even though I didn't like him. But I mean I thought well like, the other one calls this one and then he hasn't called that one and the other one came in. He used to fly in from Connecticut all the time to see her. And I thought well, you know. </p>

<p>But - and yet the funny thing is after Paul got to know me, he liked me as a friend. He used to call sometimes too, you know, and when she wasn't home, we would talk for a little while. </p>

<p>And yet - and you know, another thing I thought too, and this was funny. I remember her talking on the phone, and I couldn't help but hear. I was in the bathroom and I could hear her. I remember she was talking I guess to Paul. Paul was going to get me something I think. So she comes out with, "Well, if you're going to get her something, why are you getting her something?" </p>

<p>Well, naturally, a fellow's not going to say, "Because I like her as a friend." Even if he did. He said, "Well, because she was your roommate, and I thought it would be nice to get her something because I was getting you something."</p>

<p>I don't think that was true because like I said we had started something. And it's not a relationship, not like a boyfriend. I didn't like him that way. I really didn't. He didn't attract me that way. But I did like him as a person. And I think he started to like me as a person. And what's the big deal if you want to give somebody a card, or you want to send them a couple of flowers, and you've got the money to do it, what's the big? </p>

<p>So she says, "Well don't you get it on her own merit and not on me." (0:36:27.3)</p>

<p>So what does that again make me feel like? First I thought - I took it that way. And then I thought, wait a minute. I don't think Paul would do that. I don't think he would do it for a show just because like I'm her roommate. What's the big deal? He used to send her flowers all the time before and never sent me anything, and I didn't feel bad, you know.</p>

<p>But now for Christmas, because he kind of liked me as a friend, he wanted to send me something. And she sort of said, "Well, don't get it for her because she's my roommate. Get it because of her own merits if you're going to do it for anything."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I hear you saying is that - you're speaking of Eliza, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, this is Jodie. Eliza doesn't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I hear you saying is that now you can see all the ways that Jodie is insecure, and you can see how she's really into some of the same things that you're getting out of now. And it makes you angry to see her do those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it makes me -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's you that's suffered because of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I guess it bugs me because I still do a little bit. Like I said, like I don't want to bring my boyfriends home because I know how she is. So I mean like probably as insecure as she is if not more so. (0:39:15.0)</p>

<p>But it's like - I guess maybe that's why I can't live with her for very much longer. Like when she leaves, it's going to be very good and she wants me to come down to California - or not to California, to Mexico to teach in two years. I don't think I'm going to do it because I just can't take that kind of - I feel like, and this is why I say it's not just me. It's partly me but I think it's like both of us together just doesn't work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't match them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because like with Chrissie I felt myself again like, oh, this is great. Just like it happened again last night. We had other people around but it always ends up like the nucleus usually. </p>

<p>Well anyway, they - Dr. Harris was one of the guys up there and his friend, Johnathan, who is also there - he was very sweet - took me home. But, I mean, usually what happens is like whoever comes in afterwards, we all sit around and we talk and we goof around. They leave and then it's Chrissie and James and I, and we leave together, you know. And then they leave and they go home because you know they're married, and then I go home. </p>

<p>But it's like I always feel very secure because I feel like nobody's going to take these friends away from me. You know, they've got other friends, and they've had friends - these friends even longer, but it always ends up that we end up together afterwards. Everybody leaves and then we go home. You know, and it's like - not like I feel like now they're mine and nobody can take them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of lazy and warm and friends with each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like they've got all sorts of other friends, and like I don't want to take their friends away from them. And like I wanted them over for dinner but they said, "I'm sorry, we've already got an engagement." </p>

<p>I said, "Okay, next weekend." You know, and it was like I didn't feel hurt because they can't make it when I want them, that means they like somebody else better than me, you know, and all this baloney. </p>

<p>But it's like I feel this way I think with her because like I said, she said one of the reasons we were so close is because I remind her of herself. And it's true; we are so much alike that it's like murder to live with and the insecurity. And yet it's fun to live with when there's no fellows involved. She says the same things, "I like it when there's no fellows around." </p>

<p>I say, "That's funny; I like you when there's no fellows around either." </p>

<p>Because it's like we both - she is, I guess, attractive and I think I am in a way, too, I mean basically deep down because I have attractive fellows. If I'm unattractive, I wouldn't attract fellows. It's just, you know, as simple as that. I wouldn't attract any fellows. (0:41:26.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in the eyes of the world, you must look pretty okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, at least decent because if I didn't look halfway decent, nobody would come to me. Or if I didn't look at least friendly nobody would come to me, you know. And it's like I don't know, I just feel like when I'm with her, too, I'm worse. I'm worse than when I'm with like normal people, with regular people. I am worse with fellows and I can feel it. </p>

<p>It's almost like a self-defense. I feel like I have to be cute. I have to feel like I have to take on her personality because the fellows like her, maybe they'll like me too. You know. </p>

<p>And like even when I was in the working out bit and when I went to the gym, it's the same thing. I felt like as soon as the fellows started talking to me - and I was me. They talked to me, they start to - I find myself, what am I going to do? There's three fellows and only me. What do I do? So I revert - oh, they know Jodie, they like Jodie. </p>

<p>And you know all this went through without me pulling it apart, but now I can pull it apart what was just flashing through my mind. But now I have to act like Jodie. And I would end up acting like her and like you know second best is second best. You can't be you know - like she even said that to me. She kept saying don't - try to be your own self. You can't be second best to somebody else or when the first best comes on the scene you're going to lose everything.</p>

<p>So like when I find myself even with my other friends, and I find myself doing something either like sometimes Chrissie and I will copy like her presence, and sometimes you copy a little bit back and forth. But again, like that's a little bit of subconscious just from association, but it's not a lot. It's not like everything she does I do, and everything I do she does. (0:43:00.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what you were saying it is so different with Jodie. I mean, there you get thrown into all of your - the things that you don't like to be doing. And with Chrissie you can just relax.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and that's part of it. I guess with Chrissie it's - she's in a different atmosphere. Like partly Jodie is with the dress bit. Okay so you know it's like she's - everything is meticulous and everything. </p>

<p>Well, I've never been this way. I just haven't, you know, like I have to look perfect and I have to look very ta-ta and everything is put together completely. I mean I don't put my clothes together badly, but like I don't spend two hours putting together either. I say, you know, this is good enough for work, I'll just go out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you don't care to, either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, this is it. I don't want to look rotten but I don't want to sit there - because clothes, I don't have a lot of them first of all. I don't have the money to get a lot of them. And they're becoming less and less important as I get a little bit out of this bit like you know clothes make you or outside appearance makes you. </p>

<p>I feel - I'm starting to feel a little bit better because I said something like well, why do you wear makeup and that and why do you still, you know, fix your hair or whatever it is so you don't look sloppy. I said, why is it? There's got to be something there that you do. And I said what's the thing inside? You know, it's got to be inside then. </p>

<p>I said well, yeah, maybe it's because I feel that the world can't see the inside of me, so if I put on - not put on, but if I at least look presentable to the world, then they can get down to what's inside of me. But like if I looked really repulsive, like if I didn't take a bath for a month or whatever you know, it would be like an expression of what was inside of me like I didn't care about me, period. And so then why shouldn't the world take a look at me and say well, look, if Wendy doesn't care about herself as much to take a bath, or at least about people around her -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you're saying two things there. One is that you have to look decent to have people come to you. That's kind of a fact. </p>

<p>And the other one is that the way you look really does reflect how you feel. And if you feel comfortable about yourself, you're going to dress all right and people will see that, see both. Kind of, see how you feel about yourself because that will be the same as how you dress.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it won't be like the old way of kind of trying to put on or force or an appearance </p>

<p>PATIENT: And taking somebody else's looks like I used to do too. I would try to do everything she did and try to even put things together the way she did. It looked good, but it looked just like a carbon copy of her only with dark hair, you know. And I didn't like it. (0:45:40.4)</p>

<p>And I remember like over a year ago some fellow saying that to me. "Oh, you're like a dark-haired Jodie" because like we double dated. And these were her friends and both of them liked her. You know, like she's known them for six years, and so what does she do, she brings me into it. Right? Here I am insecure. And how could you possibly get one of these fellows to like you when they've liked her for six years, both of them. And I don't know. So anyway, we were dancing and I can remember him saying that.</p>

<p>And then I had another (inaudible at 0:46:06.3) like about three months ago or so we went out again, and we double dated with the same fellows. And I ended up with the same guy again that I had before. And he said, you know, first he started giving - what did he say, he started making remarks about my waist. I probably must have gained about four and a half pounds. I said, well actually it was five. And I gained about 15 since the last time I saw him. And he knows it and I knew it. But it was funny.</p>

<p>But then he said something about, you know, I said this year you're lots more relaxed. And I liked that because he said like last year you were so stiff. </p>

<p>And I realized that. Like last year, I had to act (inaudible), walk this way, you know, this that and the other thing, you know and it was like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Jodie does this and you had to be -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had to be exactly the way she was. And like now I don't want it, but then again I don't want to be left in the sphere where that's all around. You know, like the people she attracts and the people who are her friends and that. I usually can't seem to get in with, you know. </p>

<p>It's funny. Like well part of it - some of them are really super intellectuals and things like that, which makes - puts me on my guard right away because then I'm like well, Jesus, my IQ's not that high, first of all, even to begin to get into that type of area. And I say well, hmm. And then that puts me out right away and it makes me feel bad. Because like that's it. </p>

<p>Or then she's got like the other one's that are really all too rich - like one of, I think, one of her boyfriends. You know, and I haven't met him, but just talking about it, like one of the richest lawyers in the city and this one's this, and this one's sad. You know, you go oh, Jesus. But in a way it makes me envious. Like I wish someday, you know, that I could attract something like that.</p>

<p>And then I think to myself look, I have to be realistic. I always like to play like - she's like probably in the upper 1 percent or at least the upper 3 percent in intelligence and all sorts of other things, you know. Like okay, then she's going to get the fellows that are out there. You know, like I couldn't take a fellow who's got 180 IQ. I wouldn't know what to do with him you know (laughs). (0:48:08.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, so it really is like you want to find the kind of people you fit with and feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean I do agree with her one thing, like we were talking about that. I don't want to marry a fellow, if I ever married one, who made like 10,000 a year and there were six kids. You know, I mean I want a fellow who - I mean I can get a fellow like an accountant who makes 35 or 40,000 a year because most of them are not all that smart, you know. They're - they might be a little above average and they might be up where I am or whatever, you know. But usually they're not really brilliant and yet they make a good salary. </p>

<p>Now this - I'm talking about the type of person because an accountant would probably drive me crazy, but I'm think like just the area of the money level. They make enough so that you're comfortable, not so much that you're so darned rich you don't know what to do with the money. You know, and that type of thing. And this to me is okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something in there I'd like you - you'd really like to make it big, but kind of, but that seems like it's not so right anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not just - I mean, let's face it. Any girl I suppose, if the prince of some country came along with all sorts of money and wanted to marry her, you'd be crazy to say no, you know, if she half way liked him. </p>

<p>But I feel - I said to myself, look, I have to be realistic. I don't fit into this upper 1 percent or upper 3 percent even, I may be like in the upper 8 percent or something. So I have to lower my standards a little bit. I can't expect to get the same type of fellow or the same type of position that she can, you know. </p>

<p>And like for a long time, it was like a competition. It was like if she can do it, why can't I do it? If she can get that fellow, why can't I get that fellow? Or not that fellow, but, you know, like a fellow in equal.</p>

<p>And you know what the other thing is, you learn that Jodie is starting to do the same thing now. I started drawing out of competition. I say, hell with this, you know, and that whole I don't care, I don't like to go to your parties. I don't want to be with you socially with fellows, you know. I'll be with you maybe on Sunday if we're by ourselves or with some girls, but anyplace where there's fellows, go away, you know. I don't want to be with you. (0:50:08.2)</p>

<p>And I find that - what happens is that I find that like I don't know, maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just - maybe it's just coincidence. Jodie gets money for her trip from a boyfriend. Eliza gets money for her trip from her boyfriend. Jodie gets a ring from her boyfriend. Eliza gets a ring from her boyfriend. </p>

<p>You know, you think wait a minute. What's the big, so what? So one gets a ring, so that means you have to get the exact same thing because this one's got it and it's got to be just about comparable? And I thought to myself, hold it. You know, like, she's doing the same thing you did. And I see it now. </p>

<p>I can see her starting to imitate Jodie more like they'll get together and they'll both do the "oh" like this and this is at typical Jodie. When she talks she gets this type of "oh" like this. And the other one started to do the same thing, and I went, wait a minute. She was never like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a silly pecking order.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I thought to myself, uh oh (laughs). You know, another one's doing the same thing I did. I said, well, you two have fun on your trip. I've got to try and make something out of my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But for you, to find out - I mean part of it for you was seeing Eliza kind of prostituting herself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and it scared me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You ended up losing yourself. You were kind of so close to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I still - I'm still in it a little bit. Like, again, like I said, I always - I'd always love to be rich. You know, everybody - you know, I'd always love to just sit there with my, you know, get this for me, and get that for me (laughs) you know. And it's a nice thing, you know, to want to be I guess. But, like, I'm also realistic about it. Like I figure, you know, I'm not going to - again, I'm not going to marry somebody who's making 10,000 a year. Because I'd like to have a couple of kids if I got married. (0:51:53.5)</p>

<p>But like, all right, so I can't make it with a big time. I don't really - it really doesn't bug me all that much anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not what really matters.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and I'm starting to write a little bit. And I remember talking to James last night about that. And Jodie and I had talked about this one night too. Sometimes you meet people for certain reasons. </p>

<p>And I said that to James. I said, you know, I feel that way when I met you, you know, and I had to make sure I got Chrissie out of that because like now I'm a little bit more sensitive to other people and I don't want her to ever get insecure. And I mean every girl is a little bit insecure if her husband. I don't care who isn't, you know. Everybody is a little bit insecure.</p>

<p>So anyway, I talked to James and I said, you know, I think I met you because you're a writer. And I think somebody - something in me wants me to write and I can feel it because like I've written a couple of short stories now. And I'm changing one around but I think it's pretty good. It's got Jim as a theme. </p>

<p>And it's like I can just feel like with them like I can know I can always go to him and he can - he'll look at my work and he'll encourage me. You know, change this but it's good, you know. It's a good effort. Change this and work on this and whatever else, you know. And then I can go from there. </p>

<p>And again, like I'm using that creativity that's been there all the time and I have just never used it. You know, I'd always say well, you know, in high school I would get good marks and this but oh well, so what, I can't write, you know. And now I feel like I want to take some English courses and go into writing. At least part time, maybe I'll never be able to go to full time. </p>

<p>But I consider - I remember sitting like the other day, my boss wasn't there. I sat writing for three hours. And like if I - my God, it's time to go home, you know. It's like enticing you know (laughs). But writing -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, something you really like to do. It's something that comes out of you and it is yours. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something like, this is it. I guess that's the whole thing. I can say it's mine and it's my own whatever you want to call it, child or whatever. You know, it's like it's not anybody else's work. I will take inspirations from something maybe someone said, but I mean every writer does this. And then I'll build a whole story around it just from my imagination. (0:54:10.8)</p>

<p>And like I feel that, like I feel this is something - and this is something I actually created. I guess Chrissie feels that way when she paints something. I created this, you know. And I can see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two things, both that the thing is really there that you feel like it's in you kind of to do that. Like it's something in you that can do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well and actually another thing, I'm not letting Jodie see it. (Laughs.) I let her see the other one and she said like you know my thoughts get across a little better in this one. And he said yeah, but he didn't like the story as good as the other one. And the first thing I thought was, oh, I thought this was my masterpiece, you know. </p>

<p>But I guess like every artist, again, feels the same way. If somebody says well, look, you know. But I'm just beginning and like I feel really good because this time I'm going to rewrite that story. It's not going to be like something like the last time I said well, then the story goes in the direction (inaudible) I'll start over and start on something else. </p>

<p>But now I feel like I'm really going to revamp this. He wanted me to change it from the first person to the third person. That was all, really. He said otherwise the story, you know, fits together pretty well.</p>

<p>So like I didn't mind it. I said okay, this is constructive criticism and I'll change it. But like there's ways of doing things and there's ways it shouldn't be done. And that was me. </p>

<p>Like - oh, this is another thing. I finally did it by myself, too. I'm really bad when it comes to somebody I like. If I really care for somebody and I can feel like with them. Like my friend at work, his mother died. And like he lived with his mother and I guess he took care of her. She'd been sick for many months and that, and she died. And on top of everything else, he's also a preacher, right? (Laughs) You know, so you don't want to go - you don't know what to say, you don't know how to say it. </p>

<p>It was the same way when I was (inaudible at 0:56:04.0) I'm trying to go, how can I say it. I've got to make sure I say it in the right way. And how - what kind of word do you say. </p>

<p>Like, he believes in God and he's a good man and he believes like, you know, like there's a heaven but there's a good afterlife. You know, I also believe there's some type of an afterlife. But it's like, you know, you go to heaven. You want to say look, like she's in heaven or whatever. I know if she's with God or you know like don't feel badly, like it's only our loss, and she's not feeling any - you know and all this. </p>

<p>You try to be - there are all these things you should say, and you walk in and you go - you kind of half smile because like I get like - I was like a little kid. I was like a little kid going up to him and I went up like this, and I could just see myself like a little kid like, how can I say it? It wasn't really like when I was - I can't explain what it looked like. But it was like a little kid doing it. You know, like, "I'm really sorry to hear about your mother." And I'm going like this because if I didn't go like this, I'd go like this and start crying, you know. </p>

<p>And it was - I didn't want him to think I was laughing. I kept saying don't do it because like I was almost hysterical. I walked out of there and I started to cry but not cry. I was like this. And then there was tears in my eyes. I didn't come right down and break down. I don't know why, why I kept myself in, but it's like - and he was so sweet. </p>

<p>And I found out, I said shit, he's giving me strength. I'm supposed to be giving him strength. Well she was sick and, you know, and she's with God now and it was her time go. He was very calm about the whole thing. And I went (cries).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was very sad for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, yeah, I felt very sad for him for losing his mother, and like, it was very hard. I knew about this for like two days. And for the first day I didn't like - I was looking for him when he came back. I guess he was back the day before yesterday. And I saw him here and he scared me. I was like - and I don't know why. I know part of the reason is I like him. </p>

<p>In fact, it was so funny because I was walking out and I was thinking, what was I thinking to myself? Well, shit you wouldn't want to marry her too if she ran by. And I said oh, now, wait a minute kid. And then I'm thinking - all of these things are running through my head while he has to wait five years. He waited this long for his mother, he can wait five years. </p>

<p>And I said to myself, what are you thinking about? And I realized that I actually had thoughts of possibly like marrying him. I said, oh, no. Then I get back to the reality. Can you see me with a preacher? Oh, Christ. What a hang up, you know. (0:58:26.8)</p>

<p>I just - we're just about getting over my hang-ups in here I marry a preacher and start all over again. Oh Christ, what a mess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I don't know. I keep feeling like I'm getting someplace and I'm not getting someplace. I feel like I'm just going around in circles and I'm not doing anything. I don't know what the heck is going on.</p>

<p>You know, I feel like sometimes I come away and it's like well, I realized a little bit more about myself. And then some of the things happen again. Like I still feel that stupid inferiority thing. I just about get over it, or I don't feel it for a while, and the darn thing comes back again. It just bugs the heck out of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it takes a while. I mean, you got something for a long time and then you see it, and you get to see it in, you know, lots of different ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you don't really recognize exactly what you see, is that what you say? Or is it just like the train the threat if rejection that's always there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you see it, then you start seeing it all over the place and for a while you (inaudible). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess maybe it's the rejection. I wish I knew what it was with my father, and I still think there's something there. I can't help but think that because like my mother says I was the same way as my girlfriend was - said she was. </p>

<p>You know, her - my father didn't know what the hell to do with me. And I think that's why I'm so insecure, especially with men. You know, cause I'm always afraid somebody's - he's not going to really love me or something like that. You know, it's going to be very easy for somebody just to walk off with it. And that's very sad to feel that way with a man, but have to get over that too.</p>

<p>(Inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

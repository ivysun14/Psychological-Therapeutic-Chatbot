<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you were just saying he's been angry, aggressive, threatening.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He gets extremely aggressive, loud, violent, um, suicidal comments, killing comments, and then it's like a sudden decrease, but it always escalates to that level first, and, uh, he didn't, even in the mall in [DEIDENTIFIED], he grabbed his mom because she wouldn't buy him something or look at something for him, and he grabbed her and cut her mouth open, and he thinks his answer is he can leave home as soon as he gets, if he don't get his way, then he wants to leave home.  If we don't let him leave home, then that's when he becomes very violent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How come, [PATIENT NAME]?  What's happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, something's happening.  This doesn't sound right at all, right?  And this is pretty, for any count, it's pretty dramatic, kind of almost scary, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's not scary for you to beat your mom up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or to threaten to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You're going to kill everybody in the house or yourself?  What makes you say those things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The way you spoil [INAUDIBLE] and not me.  That's why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, do you take any responsibility for any of this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is all someone else?  Nothing to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, um, let's make a change in the meds.  Um —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, and it, it's mainly at home, but it's happened at work now, and at school he's had more issues in the last 9 week's than he's had, and contrary, we do notice it more if he misses a dosage of his medicine, but we're trying pretty hard to stay on top of that, and it's still, he's still having those outrages almost, definitely weekly, and it's more like every other night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Did you get the results of his blood work?  We did get that done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  The blood work was okay.  Um, his glucose was a little bit on the higher side, but otherwise it looked okay.  Well, does the Strattera help because if he says some of this could be bipolar, not, you know, all of it the ADHD, and certainly it's not all of anything.  I mean there is a lot of it that's common, but —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I'm not sure if that's bipolar.  I'm just thinking because it's just a sudden outrage and then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> After a period of time, he'll kind of come down and be normal, but sometimes we have to give in —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> In order to get there, but most of the time when he does lose control, he'll, he'll realize it a little bit later and then he wants to apologize, but it's too late then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  He's made all the threats.  He said all the things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How have your hands been still?  I want to see your other one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Let's see that one.  Doctor, we looked at his hands lately, he's still, uh, show him that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He must still be doing that a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know it would be not be a bad idea to talk to them outside about case management as well, um, where they can have someone come where they can meet [PATIENT NAME] outside of here, you know, whether it's at school or somewhere they could sit down and talk to him, do some counseling there rather than coming here like for sessions, and that often works very well.  You know, it's like natural.  It's like someone more like a peer, but someone who's a trained counselor, to sit down and talk, whether, again, as I said, it's at school or, you know, it's on the sidelines of baseball or just in the regular environment, um, but let's add something for the bipolar.  I'm not saying it's bipolar.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is that symptoms though what —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm describing or not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This can be pretty generic.  It can be due to the ADHD as well.  Um, we do see a lot of the agitation and impulsivity and saying things and then backtracking later as part of that, but either way, the seizure medicines like Depakote and Tegretol, which are for epilepsy, treat bipolar and treat impulse control problems as well.  So they, whatever it's from, they do help settle, whether it's from bipolar or it's just impulse control problem.  Um, because, you know, the ADHD part is being treated, and we are on the medication for that.  Now, the Tourette's, the tics, that can cause that impulsivity as well, but again, we have treatment for that, you know, that's ongoing as well.  So, it may be good to add something that'll help that impulsivity and see if it can take the edge off, but do do the case management.  I think you'd really see.  [PATIENT NAME] would see a difference as well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I talked to him about pop too.  I know you talked to him over and over, but he seems to think, and we try to limit it when we're with him, but see he's at that age where he likes to go do things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But we can't let him go because when he comes back, he's a holy terror, and, and we're thinking when he goes place, he drinks pop after pop after pop, and when he drinks a lot of pop, it takes away from that medication working, doesn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It does.  Not only that, but let us, remember what I told your dad, the glucose was high, and that pop will raise it even more.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And that's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a problem.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And we told him he needs to find a Gatorade or another kind of drink he likes instead of pop, but he, he, and especially when he gets away from us, he'll drink pop after pop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if it's caffeine pop, then it's quite a difference.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But he is drinking diet, but I told him that still don't make any difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Do you need the others as well?  Now, the Depakote has to be monitored for the liver because it goes through the liver and sometimes it, it can hurt the liver.  So we have to do a blood test on it to check the level as well in about a week, 10 days, but start 1 Depakote at night.  Everything else stays the same for now.  That should help settle some of that impulsivity down.  It's not going to be a magic fix [PATIENT NAME].  You have to fix it.  No one else can make you mad unless you let them.  But talk to them outside about case management.  I think that'll be good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is, is there a generic for Depakote, or is that generic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, this one is not generic.  Um —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because that's going to be, that's expensive.  That's going to be hard for us to afford.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Generic won't be bad, but if it's not generic, I'd rather have something generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There is none of those.  This does come in a different generic.  So I can change that.  That's fine.  Okay.  And then the blood test in about, uh, a week or so [PATIENT NAME].  All right, [PATIENT NAME].  I hope you do better, [PATIENT NAME], okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do you have any Strattera on hand?</p>

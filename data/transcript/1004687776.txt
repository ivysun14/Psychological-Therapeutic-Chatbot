<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come on in. I'm just going to get you some water.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:00:10] to 00:00:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are ya?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good (inaudible at 00:00:37).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Well, things are going good. The one thing I do want to say is that, you know, my girlfriend and I's relationship is probably stronger than it's ever been. I kind of feel like for the first time, we're actually on the same page. We're actually seeing things, you know, as one - as a couple should, as like a team, and I want to thank you for your help in my treatment. Because without, you know, me understanding and me, you know, taking a look at myself, I don't think I could be the person that I am today. [00:01:16]</p>

<p>With that being said going forward, there are a lot of other issues that, you know, that are still bothering me. And the one thing that, you know, I've really, you know, been noticing a lot of and really never sat down before and analyzed it until we started talking about it, was my eating problem; it disturbs me a lot. For instance, the other night, I ate dinner before we - you know, before I had my baseball game at 7:30, so I ate dinner at, like, 5:30. Not a problem, was fine. Go to the baseball game, eat a little bit of candy, some sunflower seeds, and that's that, no big deal. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>But when I get home, my girlfriend's asleep. And I go to the kitchen to get water, and, not even thinking, I go in the cabinet, I grab crackers, grab peanut butter and jelly, and the next thing you know, I ate half a sleeve of crackers, a quarter jar of peanut butter, and a quarter jar of jelly. And I just feel bad and I wake up the next morning, I weigh myself, and I'm like "Why am I like this? Why am I, you know, gaining weight," when the reality is I wasn't even hungry when I got home, you know? I had already eaten dinner and was, you know, doing what I do at the game. I chew on the sunflower seeds, which is fine, which I try to, you know, keep myself to is sunflower seeds, because the candy I just - if I eat it I know I won't stop. So I'll have like a couple of pieces and then I'll give them to the other coaches, I'll give them to my players, just so I won't eat them. [00:03:01]</p>

<p>But when I get home, the un-conscience, it's just like a natural reaction for me. I go in the fridge, I get a water, and next thing you know, I'm in the cabinet, and for me, that really, really bothers me, how I can just do that, not even thinking. I mean my stomach's not telling me, like, I was just eating sunflower seeds. I was, you know, drinking water, hanging out with the guys, and then the next thing you know, like, here I am, you know, eating half a sleeve of crackers and peanut butter and jelly, and it's just - it's not what I want to be doing.</p>

<p>Same thing the other night; we went out for my little brother's birthday. And I said the whole day I'm going to be good, I'm going to be good. We get to dinner, and the next thing you know I'm eating, you know, fried calamari. I'm eating a whole prime rib. And I'm cleaning my plate, and it's just - it's not what I want to be doing. And it's just the un-conscience just coming in. Like I don't know what it is. I get stuck in a moment and I just go with it, and for me, I don't like that. I don't like how I can just, you know, not even think about it. I just go and - my stomach's not even telling me I'm hungry. My body's not telling me I'm hungry. It's just me going in there as kind of like a routine when I was younger. Whenever I'd do something, or if I was just hanging around, I'd go to the cabinet, I'd grab a snack, grab a soda, just sit down, and, you know, eat and watch TV, and that's kind of like what I do. That's how I - you know, I used to unwind when after doing all this activity. [00:04:49]</p>

<p>And, you know, I am seeing some weight loss, which, you know, I get excited about, I'm happy about, but on the other side, I see, you know, the potential where, like this weekend, where I don't watch everything I eat. I'm constantly, you know, eating. I get on the scale and I - all the hard work, I get even more depressed, because of all the hard work that I put in. It then, you know, reflects back on negative, and I'm like, "All right, well, "F" it. Maybe I'll just go eat some more. Excuse me. And for me, it's just a viscous cycle. There are a lot of - a lot of things that I truly just like the taste of. I wish I had the power that my girlfriend has to just not like them. I - I loved everything, and I feel that's one of my weaknesses is because if I do taste something that I haven't had in a while or not had before, I kind of want more of it. [00:06:01]</p>

<p>Same thing, to give you an example, with the drugs. If I did a drug that I liked, that I never had before, I wanted more of it. If I did a drug and I knew how it felt and I knew that's what I wanted and craved, that's what I'd go get.</p>

<p>So again, here's the addiction part of me that's kicking in again. Even though it's not in an illegal drug, it's not alcohol, it's food. And for me, the temptations are very, very high, because I don't feel I have the support from my family, my mother, because me and my little brother are - you know, his girlfriend and him, they're doing a class to be healthy. My girlfriend and I are eating healthier, on a better diet. And when we hang out with my mother, she gets upset that we don't eat. "How can you just eat this? Why are you only eating this? You're not eating enough."</p>

<p>And part of me wants to tell her I'm fine and leave me alone, but if I do that then she comes back with more and more temptation, like "Eat this. Here you go. Eat my food. Take this." And it's not helping me. You know, it's not helping someone who, you know, likes that kind of food, to be around it and to keep having it shoved in my face as it was before. And growing up with it for, you know, 20-odd years, it's - it's a tough habit to break, and I constantly see myself struggling with it. [00:07:55]</p>

<p>I mean when I go grocery shopping now, I constantly avoid the stuff that's, you know, at my parents' house. I constantly avoid, you know, all the fatty foods and all the garbage, you know, because at the house that my girlfriend and I live in, we have fresh fruit, we have fresh vegetables. We have, you know, lean meats, which is fine. We have oats and grains and stuff like that, all healthy food. [00:08:24]</p>

<p>But even though it's healthy, there's still points where I eat an excessive amount of them. And when you eat an excessive amount of them, it doesn't really help you, it actually has the reverse effect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. (inaudible at 00:08:41) can you hold on for a second?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just going to turn up the air.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah, not a problem.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:08:47] to 00:09:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, please continue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's, you know, where my problem lies is it's not just what I'm eating, it's the overeating. And this is something that I really do struggle with, because when I'm hungry I'll eat and then I'll be fine. But when I'm not hungry, I'll eat, and then that's when I overeat, because there's no filter, there's no trigger that's saying, you know, we're hungry, keep feeding us. I just - I get in like a zone and I zone out and I just eat. And, you know, it's not like I'm not thinking of anything. I'll just be watching TV and know what I'm doing, but I'll just be eating, no matter if it's carrots or berries or the crackers and peanut butter. It's just if it's there, you know, I'll eat it when I don't need to. And for me, the hardest part is the seclusion eating, because if my girlfriend was awake I wouldn't have eaten. [00:10:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't like to be caught and I don't like people watching me snacking, you know, late at night, and I kind of feel ashamed. I feel embarrassed when people catch me in the fridge. And I even do that - you know, if she is awake and I try to sneak a snack and she'll - I'll hear her feet coming and I'll try to shut the fridge real quick. And she'll catch me and then she'll go, "What are you doing?" And I'll say "Nothing," and I'll have food in my mouth. And it's something that I just don't like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you feel that she's catching you, what do you feel like she's catching you doing? [00:11:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something I'm not supposed to be doing. You know, it's kind of like I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. I kind of feel like it's stealing in a way, when, you know, you have what you have, but then you always want more, so you go back and get it when you don't need it. And when I get caught doing that, I don't want people to see me with my hand in the cookie jar, in the end, doing it.</p>

<p>And this is what's weird is I don't have a problem eating in front of people at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. When we sit down as a family, I don't mind eating in front of them like that, because that's when I feel like I can control myself, and that's when I feel I'm okay doing it. But it's the snacking part, where if no one's around I'll do it as much as I can, as long as I can. When someone is around, I either won't do it or I'll try to be very quiet, and when they catch me that's when I'll put it away, and for me, it's not healthy. It's not - it's a routine that I've had for a long time, and it's a routine that I've had that's just - it's consistent. It happens all the time, and I don't even think about it, you know? I just - I come home, especially, you know, with hockey, you know, or whatever. Late at night, after I've already eaten, I've already eaten dinner, I'll come home, and if everyone's asleep, I'll go to the fridge if they're... [00:12:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>(Pause [00:12:50] to 00:12:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just what I - I guess it's just what I do. It's what I know. I know I've always - used to run to the fridge for closure, for, as I said before, the drugs. The food will - it won't hurt me. It won't attack me verbally, even though it does really physically after it's consumed. You can end up, you know, expanding your body and being bigger. That's how it attacks you. [00:13:35]</p>

<p>But I think it's more the verbal - the verbal abuse that I don't get from the food or from the drugs, or got from the drugs, that I get from other people. I think that's - for me, is kind of comforting. It's kind of relaxing to me where I can just go and be in the fridge and have my moment or so with my food. You know, and I know it's just as bad as, you know, doing it with the drugs. [00:14:17]</p>

<p>And I think it's - it's - it's gotten, you know - I've turned more to food now that I'm trying to focus more not on turning to drugs or tobacco or to alcohol. I feel that that's the easier road to take, because that's always going to be - no one's, you know, in it for me. You know, when my grandmother was alive, she used to always comment on my weight.</p>

<p>And I think as I got older, when I lost all my weight, I think that's why I stopped eating and was doing more of the drugs. Because people would always tell me "Why are you eating so much, you don't need that." And then that's when I turned to the drugs, because they would comfort me. They wouldn't verbally abuse me. They wouldn't tell me that they didn't need me. They wouldn't tell me that I was overweight. They didn't tell me that I was fat. They would comfort me the way that food do and (ph) now. [00:15:34]</p>

<p>But for me who has - and this is just me - I feel I have a very addictive personality, where if I get a taste of something that I do love, I want it. And I won't even think; I'll go get it. And that's - that's the hardest part of the addiction that I'm still fighting today, even, you know, recovering from the drug addiction. I was, you know... [00:16:08]</p>

<p>Well, here's a story. You know, when I was, you know, in college, I lost all my weight, you know, and then I broke my leg, had surgery. And the next thing you know, my mother was taking care of me. And instead of, you know, eating right and giving me the proper food, like, all the time, she'd bring me two sandwiches for lunch. She'd bring me like a bag of chips, a big bag of chips for a snack. And she'd bring me, you know, candy and all this stuff. And so then whatever - when I couldn't physically get, you know - get food for myself, my mother would constantly just bring me the junk. And instead of not eating it, I would eat the whole thing, because for me there was - well, there was a little thing like people left me alone because I couldn't really do anything. I kind of felt sad for myself because I couldn't really, you know, physically do anything and run away from the situation. [00:17:12]</p>

<p>So I felt, oh, if I'm going to sit here and be miserable and depressed because, you know, I hurt myself, well, the food is going to help me out, and the next thing you know, I gained, you know, half of the weight back that I had worked so hard to lose.</p>

<p>And then the cycle came in again where I got more depressed and turned to the drugs, because with the drugs I wasn't in pain, I wasn't eating. And, you know, unfortunately, when I was on cocaine, I could go all - you know, two, three days at a time without eating, and I was okay with that. Because people will always tell you, "Wow, you look great, you're losing weight. How do you do it?" And I'd just tell them I watch what I eat when I wasn't really eating. [00:18:13]</p>

<p>And then, you know, I had my drug overdose. And after I overdosed, as part of my healing, you know, I was on tobacco and then I quit the tobacco. And then I kind of got back on marijuana, but pushed marijuana to the side. But old reliable is always there, and that's food. Food has always been there for me since I can remember. Food's always been kind of my best friend, kind of the one to always cheer me up. Kind of the one to always, you know, change my mood, whether I'm sad, depressed... Just sit there and go eat and it'll be fine. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>And no matter what I do - exercise, keep myself busy, do this, do that, stay active - I always find myself running back to the food, even when I don't even want it, and I don't know why. I don't know why it's un-conscience thinking that's processed through my head. It's - it's - it's like a routine, umm, it really is. I know it is so hard because, you know, I told you I crave chewing tobacco every day. And at baseball, all my players and the other coaches chew tobacco, and for me that's the hardest thing, because all I want to do is I want to put in a chew and have some tobacco, but I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want to tempt myself. But then, when I get home after the game, I'll go to the fridge. [00:20:15]</p>

<p>I think part of my addiction is craving something else and wanting something else, and when I don't get it and when I resist it, in fact, not get it, my other addiction kicks in, and that's food. And I know that's there, and I know that's not going to - you know, I know I'm not going to resist that, and then I go after the food, and it's - it's very bothersome. It's very bothersome because I kind of - you know, I don't get blacked out, but I don't feel I'm in control of myself. I feel like there's something else that just takes over and - and just attracts me to it. I guess, you know, responding to why I get - you know, why I try to hide when people come is I think that kind of puts me back into reality, and it kind of brings me back to a conscience state and saying "Oh, no, you shouldn't be doing that. Hide." And that's why I try to not eat with other people. Because when I used to do drugs, I used to do them by myself; I didn't want people to see me doing them. And I think that's part of the reason, too, because even when I was a little kid I used to eat and do stuff by myself, alone. [00:21:56]</p>

<p>And as I've gotten older and starting to - to - to evolve as a human and as a man, you know, I find it harder and harder when people are all around you. And I find it harder and harder to have some time to myself. And I think that's the best time for myself is me, you know, alone, next to the fridge or the cabinet and that's my closure. That's how I deal with stress, and I - and I want to change it so bad. I do, I really do want to change it. And I feel like I fight even harder than most people, because I am fighting a drug addiction, I'm fighting a tobacco addiction, but I'm also fighting a food addiction. And at times it's just really overwhelming, because one craving comes in after the other. [00:23:11]</p>

<p>And when all this - it's not even temptation from other people. Even if it's there, it's temptation from myself. The temptation to just "It's okay, it's one time." The temptation that it's just there, go ahead. That's why it's there; it's for you." That's the issue that I have a problem with is I can, you know, avoid all things. Like, I can avoid people I dislike. I can avoid people that have screwed me over in the past; that's not a problem. The temptations are coming from within, and for me that's the most difficult part, because when I fight off the drug temptation and the tobacco temptation, and then trying to fight off the food temptation, I can't do it. I feel very overwhelmed. I feel stuck. I do feel stuck, because when I fight off the food temptation, I fight off the drug temptation, that's when the tobacco gets the best of me and I'll go have a cigarette. [00:24:25]</p>

<p>Or, you know, same thing which was before, when I was fighting off the tobacco, you know, sensation, craving, and the food craving, I turned to marijuana, and that's - I kind of feel like I'm being attacked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking that. It sounds like being besieged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, I do. I feel like I'm being - I'm constantly - you know, got my guard up to defend myself, and unfortunately, at times you can't defend everything all at once. And that's what I feel I lack is I need a better defense to help me defend one urge from the other urge from the other, where I can defend them at the same time, as opposed to - I have no problem doing two. It's always that third one that - that I have the major issue with. [00:25:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like when you go toward these things, that you can take even a second to sort of pause?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could try. Have I? No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because one thing I wonder that might be useful, and this is certainly helpful when people feel they - or on an addiction, or even what you're describing; it's almost compulsive behavior.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of - they're very related.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're similar, I understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the question is, if you can get - even just rather than sort of just sort of an automatic, on autopilot, going to the food, tobacco - it sounds like the food is most concerning to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether you can build in a pause and write down what you're thinking. [00:26:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like have a journal or that kind of thing, and write down what you're thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, at the moment that I feel the - kind of like when I used to get enraged, like, okay? I mean I think that would help me out a lot is if I can write down and try to understand where it's coming from. I can say that throughout baseball this year it has come from the tobacco. And I don't understand the food aspect, because there's really no drugs at baseball.</p>

<p>So I guess when I'm not hearing it or surrounded by it, I guess I just put it out of my head. But when I'm at baseball, the tobacco is there, and I think there's no denying that. It's everywhere, and it drives me - I want it. Like I constantly have to have something in my mouth, because that's the sensation that I feel is like, okay, I need something else in there if I can't have tobacco. Like I'll chew up a piece of gum and I'll put it in, like I have a piece of tobacco in there, and then I'll think it over a little bit. Or the sunflower seeds; same thing. Put them in my cheek for the other chewing tobacco. Same thing, just so I have something in my mouth. It helps me, you know, cure that urge at the time. [00:27:41]</p>

<p>But the food thing is just, well, I'm doing all this stuff to do that. If I actually didn't - you know, as before, before my thinking and not responding to stuff, if I do pause and think about what's going on, why am I doing this, what's going on in my head, and write it down, I think that would help me. As I explained before though, most of the time it is autopilot. [00:28:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's why I asked if you think that there was a possibility to take a pause.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can get that, because exactly... I mean and as you're saying, you're curious that you're doing rather than thinking and thinking -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the question: Is there a way to build in the thinking and if you'd like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sort of stop the action so that you can figure out what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Oh, yeah. And just thinking about it, I'm getting overwhelmed, because I really don't know - I never thought of that. I've never done it. And I would - theoretically it sounds awesome. I wish I could just go the next time and pause, but I do have that fear, where I'm going to forget and the autopilot is just going to take over. And for me, that scares me, because I do what you think. I -</p>

<p>(Pause [00:29:09] to 00:29:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT: for me, you know, knowing my routines and how I do it, I - I - I wish I could say, well, here I am, looking at the future, and I haven't even tried it again. The pause scares me, because it's just a routine. I come in, I do this, boom, and the next thing you know, I don't even know why I'm already down and eating. I guess that's where my fear is, is just to go in there in the pause before I even go in the fridge. [00:29:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What scares you about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That - that - the fear of not doing it. The fear of not succeeding. The fear of, you know, doing what's right and taking the next step. Because before, I never really - never thought about things. I guess this is another part of me using every portion of - of my brain to analyze things.</p>

<p>You know, the - the - the steps we took before, with me analyzing conversations before reacting to them, it was difficult at first, and I kind of feel that's in fear of jumping into something, jumping into something, you know, that's not unlike (inaudible at 00:30:51). And, you know, I think it's - it will help if I do it. I'm very tentative about jumping into new things because, again, as we mentioned before, I was very fearful of change, very fearful of failure. And again, this is one of those things with the failure that just - it scares me, because I know in my heart I know I can do it, but the doubt is always up here. [00:31:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it difficult to think about depriving yourself of something that you really enjoy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because that's the message I was brought up with. And again, this weekend, when we were out, my mother said "Why are you doing this? Why don't you eat this?" And the guilt comes in my head like, "Yeah, why am I not eating this? I like this. Why can't I eat it?" But I know why I can't eat it; because I'll eat too much of it. I'll eat even more than what I want to eat, and then the next day I'll feel bad about doing that. And that's, again, what the struggle is that I have is I have my mother who supports me. Yes, does my mother love me? Yes. But does she realize she's hurting me? No. Where my girlfriend loves me and tells me, "What are you doing?" [00:32:26]</p>

<p>For example, when I was living at home, I'd go in the fridge and I'd eat. My mother would come and catch me. And I'd go to put stuff away, and she'd be pulling out other stuff. "Hey, do you want this? Do you want this? Why don't you eat this? Do you want something else with that?" That mixed message right there eats me up inside all the time, because I do have that little devil on this side saying go for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and she's tempting you. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. The temptation is very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tempting you with food, with money, with security, and you don't know if you can break away. And I think part of the reason - I think part of it is you don't have confidence in yourself, and part of it is that you feel deprived and worried you'll feel more deprived. And part of it I think is a wish that she is going to do something, do things, so that she can let you go and encourage you to be out on your own, and I think you'll be waiting forever if you wait for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and I would agree. I would agree. As much as she tells me she's ready to let me go, she's not. And I think, you know - I thank God right now that my little brother has a girlfriend, where he's kind of in the same boat as me, and now she has more to juggle, where she can't focus on trying to just bring me back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's still waiting for her to do something, or feeling like, because of the circumstances, things are easier for you. It's not about you taking initiative. [00:34:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I would agree. I didn't think about it like that, but no, I would agree with that. And - and again, I just - there's that one big leak that - that scares me and I don't know why I can't take it. Well, I do know why, because everything's there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can I ask you? I know that your work situation hasn't changed, but is there at all any feasibility of you coming back to - coming every week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At this moment, no, but eventually that is my full intention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because we've gotten a lot of work ahead of us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know we do. Believe me, I know we do, and - and that's the struggle that I deal with is that I - I do have a lot of work that I need to do and I know it's not easy work. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I accept that. But the summer is almost over. You know, I've had a bunch of interviews for jobs and I've -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For the school year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For the school year. And I'm just waiting to hear. I feel, no matter what, come September, whether I'm working or not, is when I'm going to make my decision on, you know, probably working in a grocery store or something like that, just so I can have some income, just so I'm not just hanging around. Because I think this summer has helped me clear my mind a little bit, has helped me think a lot more clearer than I have been in the past. And I think because of it I, you know - I'm closer to my goals, but I'm not quite there yet. And I do agree that, you know, I do need to take that, that big step, and that scares me. [00:36:16]</p>

<p>And I do think that I do need more treatment, but at this moment I just - I can't. I can't move on with the weekly, even though I know - I know I need it. And that's when it hurts me the most is that I can't commit to it, and that's frustrating. That's real frustrating.</p>

<p>But, you know, like I said, I've had interviews. And even though I haven't gotten any, you know, job offers yet, I feel that they've gone well, but I've also been rejected three times, which, as you see with my confidence, doesn't really boost it that much. You know, because I feel as if - you know, in the interviews, I feel confident. I feel, you know, very relaxed, very, you know, personable, myself, and then you get the letter, the generic letter, saying "Thank you. We liked everything, loved you, but you're not the right fit for this school, and then I have to go back to the drawing board. [00:37:37]</p>

<p>And I kind of feel like that's the way my life has gone is I've always stepped up to the plate - well, at least I thought I'd stepped up to the plate, did the best I could, and I was always put back on the bench. And until I find my time to get a chance to get back up to the plate, and it's very frustrating. It's very, very frustrating for me, because, you know, I've had that for - you know, even before I left my other full-time job I've had that problem. I'm going on multiple interviews, not being the right person, and just being kicked back down. [00:38:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds so aggressive, being kicked back down. Is that what is happening to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I feel is happening. Every time I've tried to do something and, you know, I lost over 100 pounds and I felt great, and then I injure myself (ph) and I feel like I'm kicked back down because I gained most of the weight back. [00:39:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It almost sounds like there's this outside force that's preventing you from doing what you want to do.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:39:07] to 00:39:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could be. I mean in my mind I know it's me keeping myself from doing what I want to do. But the bag of excuses that I have that I tell myself, why I'm not what I want to be, it's - it's - it's just full of garbage. I mean it is, and it tells me that, oh, well, they didn't want you; their loss. You can move on. You didn't really want to be there anyway. I really did. I really did. And that's the hardest part for me. That's the hardest thing for me to accept. As I say that I - you know, I'm sort of impressed, I might say I can't because I'm a failure. [00:40:09]</p>

<p>But I really - I've been failing my whole life in my mind and haven't really accepted it. I haven't really been the person I want to be. I haven't really done the things that I wanted to do. I haven't really felt that I have succeeded on my own, and that - that hurts. That hurts me. And until I can feel like I have succeeded and feel like I - I did something on my own, I think it's going to be very difficult for me to move forward. Because I just have such negative feelings, you know, that - that - that someone is - something is keeping me back and I don't know why, and it - it bothers me. [00:41:18]</p>

<p>It bothers me that, you know, I don't really talk about it. I don't really talk about how I'm feeling. I kind of hide my emotions at some times and just let it eat away at me. And I know I should talk about them and I know I should, you know, be more vocal about them. But for me, that's my comfort, that's my closure is I am - I feel like I am two different people. There's me who's the coach, who's very outgoing, who loves doing what he does. Then there's me as the professional, who would rather just sit in his office and keep to himself and do his own thing instead of having to be bothered about it, you know, other stuff, and I felt like that. You know, I do feel like that sometimes at work. That's why I want to just sit in my office and close the door and don't see anybody, you know, and I don't know why that is, I really don't. I really don't - I don't know why that is. [00:42:34]</p>

<p>And for me, it's just been something I've dealt with, because I've always found closure in being, you know, by myself, being left alone a little bit for a period of time, and then the next thing you know, I'm out and about and might be in crowd of people.</p>

<p>It's just I feel like I have dual personalities and - and I want my real personality to come forward, which is an outgoing person who's not shy, who's not fearful, who's very, you know, enthusiastic about what he does, who embraces any challenge, any opportunity [if I go out} (ph). That's how I see myself, but that's not who I am. And I think that's what holds me back a little bit is there is the fear of failing, because I feel like I've failed more times than I've succeeded. And you know, it's one of those battles that I'm just going to have to keep fighting. [00:43:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, you need to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just - I realize we're going to need to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'll see you in two weeks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you, (inaudible at 00:44:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. very good. Have good trips.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you, Doctor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good bye. [00:44:31]</p>

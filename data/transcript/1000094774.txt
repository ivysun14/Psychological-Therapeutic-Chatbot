<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(phone dialing and ringing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Ana.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi Josephine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you doing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty good, how are you doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm doing okay thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how how's your abstinence going? Does it feel a little more obsession free?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah it feels more stable. It does, it feels more obsession free. I, I feel a lot of just emotional stuff coming up and so every now and then the thought of the addiction comes in but I try to stay with the emotions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah...I feel like I still need to learn how to handle situations differently... when the things come up, I find that if I don't use the eating addiction then the thing I want to do is to obsess and fix something right away. And so that's never worked either obviously. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so when the emotional stuff comes up, is it emotions that you're familiar with or emotions that you're unfamiliar with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Familiar emotions I think... it's more like an energy that comes up and it's this - how do I describe it? It's something that I recognize from when I was a kid that I, a problem or a challenge comes up and I want to jump on it and fix it or run away, run away from it instead of just letting it sit for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it can be anything. Like right now it's Jenny hating the second the school we put her in and my Highlands. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, that's what's up for me big time right now. And I think just the lack of security in the future in terms of knowing where we're going to live and are we going to be able to make our home in Washington? Where is Jesse going to get a job that lasts? I don't like the not knowing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so the things that I listed here are Jenny hating the second school and all the components surrounding that move to Highlands and then the overall lack of security particularly around Jesse, Jesse's employment,... when you think of those things do you think in terms of wonder what God would have me believe or what's the spiritual truth about these things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, okay. Well, that would make sense since you're working on getting rid of your old God idea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't your old God idea kind of more around your punitive parenting mentality?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's more around it wouldn't even occur to me to think, "What would God have me think about these things?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, so I know you've been really good, especially with your homework e-mails, good at identifying what I would call the old beliefs and putting into place new more spiritually sound ones, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you as you've been doing that, have you thought more in terms of just beliefs or more in terms of God concept?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're kind of related but they're not identical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't think I've separated them in my mind clearly. So you're saying, you're saying look at the difference between my old or new beliefs and a God concept?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I've thought you've done a good job of coming up with your new beliefs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I was wondering if that's really what you're focusing on like, "What are my new beliefs about how the world works in this situation" or where you really focusing on a new God concept and that and then your statements came out of the God concept?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was kind of looking at it as they were inextricably entwined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I didn't know if you were focusing on one component more than the other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No not consciously anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay. I can I can more easily list my old or new spiritual beliefs in a list, but if you asked me to describe my God concept I'd probably be more flowery and longer paragraphs. Do you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, sometimes just starting from listing our beliefs will kind of disclose to us more of our flowery God concept.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the question. "Is the universe friendly?" is in one of my handouts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd read that Einstein was interviewed one time and he was asked, "If you could have one question answered what would be the question that you would want an answer to?" Because they thought he was the smartest man on the planet, like what does he not know? And that was his question, "Is the universe friendly?" And when I read that I thought, "That's probably the question all of us, at some point unconsciously ask and answer and then live our life accordingly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If the universe is not friendly we're going to live one way if we decided the universe is friendly we're going to live a different way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I try to encourage people to more consciously answer that. So, do we want to live based on fear of the universe or do we want to live based on partnership with the universe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ooo okay, wow that's big. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, so in a way you have answered that in the past as fear of the universe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what I was hearing in some of the e-mails that you were sending out to the group was shift in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That now you're working more with trust and with faith and in the future and trust in faith in the universe and trust in faith in a positive reality. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when, based on that, if then as you have put that in more solid terms it will be easier than to say, "What would God have me think about the situation with the move?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From the old perspective that would not be a question that would work well from you with that punitive God concept right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it wouldn't at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But with a more solid foundation now it might be a tool that is going to be real helpful because we want that partnership.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "So what would God have me think of the move?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if God were saying, "This is all in divine order Ana, just trust me that the the move is going to help your life unfold in the way that I want it to guide you to have it unfold." So if you knew everything was already in divine order and that you're only seeing one piece of the puzzle but you knew the whole puzzle was there, you could relax.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay you know what I just got?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If God is going, "It's okay and this is going to be a really cool adventure and you'll see you'll find out as we move along what's in store."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd be going, "Well, but then what will I do now I'll just have to live my life."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Boring. That's it. That's how I live. I live in crisis. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how...not living in crisis means I do what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just get up in the morning and do my work?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's sounds like so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...slow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so if it's not about getting up and doing your work and being bored what do you what do you think God would be wanting you to know about what life is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it is really just about getting up and doing your work and loving each other and finding purpose in everyday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My purpose was always to put out fires.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then now I don't really have fires in my life like I used to so now I'm lighting them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ahhh, okay. And so again back to the God question, if it's just getting up and loving each other and finding purpose and adding to life and growing in ways that would make us the grandest version of ourselves does that sound okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because in general we all do hit challenges that invite us to stretch and to use our faith and to use our trust and to find more strengths within ourselves. Those kind of come naturally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah they do I mean life brings those along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But I think that often times when we make life harder than it needs to be, it's kind of like an ego dance. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I can spend my time figuring this out and doing this, the right thing for this situation the right thing for that then the ego has figured our life out as opposed to God kind of guiding us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Often times struggles and fires are about not realizing or utilizing that we have that partnership with God that can kind of help us let go of the ego guiding our life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh okay. Yeah letting go of the ego guiding our life. Hmmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had a pattern in my early recovery about struggle. And I thought I really need to do a meditation on this and I went in and did a mutation and all I saw was my smiling face. And I thought, "What?" And then I got a sense of it...it is like a little kid who learns how to ride a bike and they're just grinning ear to ear... and a little kid who learns how to use a serrated knife like the rest of family and they're going to cut their meat and they're just grinning ear to ear. Well here was this younger self face grinning ear to ear because the only way she had her competency needs met was to have struggles. And so I had to have a talk with her about it's okay to not have a struggle. It's okay to not have to have our competency needs to met to where we're in a crisis mode all the time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Enough change will come our way in life...  there'll be enough upsets that life will bring along but I can meet my competency needs met in other ways. It's not that I have to keep reproving to myself I can met life on life's terms. I can suit up for the battle it doesn't have to be a battle. </p>

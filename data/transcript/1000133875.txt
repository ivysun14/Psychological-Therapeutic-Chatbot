<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview Number 19. Interview Number 19.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This one little girl in, she's in...one of the rooms and she comes up...and she asked me to dance and I said, "Okay, Lisa, you know." And it was like a slow dance...so we were just like holding hands, (chuckling) one hand and dancing. And she looks up at me and she says, she says, "Are you married?" (chuckling) And I said, "No." And she says, "You do have a girlfriend don't you?" (chuckling) "Oh, yes, Lisa." You know and just like oh, wow! (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that really bother you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, it was really, it was really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought it was cute?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really thought it was cute...and I just, I was trying not to laugh in the girl's face...just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Oh, she was being real serious about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she was being very serious...and she's just, very serious questions you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think she was thinking of you as a possible beau?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, really...and I'm thinking, "Oh God!" (chuckling) Oh and she was really...something else. But that's the big thing and to watch it is just unbelievable...and they're dancing and if one girl dances with another guy and the other, this other girl gets mad because she's dancing with the boy that she likes you know. (chuckling) It's just, oh, unbelievable, just unreal. (chuckling) And then...the rest of them...those who...who aren't as mature, they're...sitting...the boys...the boys are sitting there, they're playing cards or...throwing peanuts at one another or...something really...kids would do...but the other ones, oh, they were dancing up a storm you know. And then, oh, then one of the mothers was in charge of the records and they wanted all slow dances, they didn't want any fast dances. (chuckling) At that point I said, "Oh, wow!" But it was interesting, I had this friend, and he's really kind of amusing, every year they go through the same thing. (chuckling) Oh. Yesterday was nice, we just - I went downtown, I met Tanya downtown and we just...I got a lot of shopping done that I had to do...for Father's Day and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's coming up Sunday, so it's Sunday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's Sunday. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's this Sunday, right. And...like my sister's birthday and my niece's birthday, they're coming up next week too, so and I killed two birds with one stone. Then we went back to my place...and I was, I was tired but it wasn't like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't real bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it wasn't like, it wasn't like a mental fatigue... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it was just like, just physical...just from walking around...just I'm tired from that way, which is really...it was a different type of a tired you know. And we started making love...and stuff like that...and I was thinking about...getting an erection and all this stuff but it really wasn't...that...like it wasn't really that big of a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it wasn't like you felt really anxious and brought it about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you thought about it but didn't have that real anxious... [overlapping voices] [0:03:13.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...trying to... </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it really...like it really didn't have that anxious feeling...and...like we were just having a good time...and it wasn't...as if, well...I was this - it wasn't like an 'I don't care' it wasn't exactly an 'I don't care' because I did care and I was thinking about it but it wasn't as a serious... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't with the intensity you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, it wasn't really as serious...and I wasn't...getting all...stiffened up about the whole thing...just, well...it was...I wished I could but if...I wasn't, well that was okay too...so it was really...it was okay...by the end of the evening...and...we...I finally ended up reaching a climax...so it was...it was all right...because...it wasn't, it wasn't any big deal you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it didn't have the heavy... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was kind of like you felt a little more - I don't, I hope - this sounds wrong but it's right in a way, uninvolved from it, like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...sort of, like...you were taking it more for what it was rather than as some, something that you put so much meaning, it's...kind of like reflection of yourself is only the problem... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and...just felt it didn't have that many things attached to it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just...well...and...like and she just said she could tell and...if I started thinking about it, she could tell that I was thinking about it...and she said she just knew...and it just...and I suppose...it's like giving me a chance that's probably as frustrating as to you as it is to me (chuckling) but it's just wild. Yeah, right, but...well. But...like I said and she really didn't make...it wasn't really that big of a deal you know. And I never even, it was a good time though, I enjoyed it. (chuckling) [silence from 0:05:10.4 to 0:05:34.2] Wow, I've got a sore upon my lip. I thought it was just a pimple...and I keep on thinking, "God help me it's, it's a..." - what do they call it, cankery?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A canker sore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A canker sore. And I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, if it's a canker sore." You know and you keep on thinking about it, but I'm sure it was a pimple...'cause I busted it...and I just said, "Well don't worry about it." You know but I just...ever since I had that one experience. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you have one of those once?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and...like it's just...like well, you just (chuckling) but I don't think it is. (chuckling) I just...tap off a number of problems. (chuckling) Like I said...worrying about nothing again. (chuckling) [silence from 0:06:14.6 to 0:06:30.9] I had to get out of those clothes, they were so hot today, oh! Oh, it was just unbelievable. It wasn't bad in the building but once you got outside it was just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...really bad, it's really bad outside, (chuckling) really bad. [silence from 0:06:46.3 to 0:07:14.9] Oh and Tanya called me Wednesday night...and she wanted, I knew she wanted to go out...and I was supposed to call her back but I was sleeping and she called...and, and I knew she wanted to go out and I just didn't even mention it...I just felt like no, I don't want to go out and what I want to do is I want to go back to sleep you know. I thought...and I could just tell by the tone of the voice, the tone of her voice that she wanted to go out and I just said, "Well tough you know." (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you just wanted... [inaudible at 0:07:39.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really kind of avoided the whole subject 'cause I figured it would be...I couldn't even bother arguing about it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and didn't even want to make up any excuse or any reason...and just don't even ask; I just don't want to you know. But I'm glad I didn't too. (chuckling) [silence from 0:07:57.7 to 0:08:07.8] Oh. [silence from 0:08:09.0 to 0:08:16.4] If they'd come up with one more form or slip I have to fill at that school I'll burst. They just...at the end of the year you have to fill out this, you have to fill out that...and all this stuff and it just, they keep on, every time...you just do all these things you know. But today really wasn't bad at all. (chuckling) Maybe if they'd have a party every day. [silence from 0:08:36.1 to 0:08:47.6] It was like a, it was a luncheon...and the kids brought all...their mothers had...baked all this food and everything; it was really nice, the food was good; they just...brought all this stuff. 0:08:57.4 to 0:09:27.1] And I was thinking the other day, I was saying to Tanya, you know, "It's really kind of nice being able to come...to the, to a psychologist...it really is you know. She says, "Yeah, you can go into one of these...for the rest of your life. You know some of these people will see psychologists for 25 years at a time and stuff like." And I said, "I could understand why." You know I could really understand why...if they could afford it...it would really be fine you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know how true it is. I understand... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean...if it's just like...if you could...there's someone, like an outsider you could really talk to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, somebody you can talk to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of get it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...and you just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's something you don't have to...you don't have to watch what you have to say and...who you're talking to and stuff like this, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just someone who you could talk to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's nice to be able to have some...friend... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...who'll listen to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, you know. Oh, I should start going back to confession. (chuckling) It's free. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but they tell you all sorts of stuff (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true too, that's the only drawback, they tell you all sorts of things. (chuckling) It's really kind of bad. (chuckling) [silence from 0:10:35.5 to 0:10:44.8] You must get bored listening to all these peoples' problems. I mean is that boring?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean, all this - yeah, it must be you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why, do you think that you're boring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I thought maybe you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's really, it's just, it's very enriching...I mean I... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel only like I grow from it too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I mean? [silence from 0:11:15.9 to 0:11:23.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it would be kind of frustrating in a way. You know like...someone approaches you and you have a problem, there's nothing you can really do about it...it just really, I mean it would be rather frustrating...just really be kind of hung up in the whole thing. [silence from 0:11:38.9 to 0:11:54.0] That's like...you're working with kids and you can't, you can't like step over certain boundaries...dealing with their parents and stuff like that, you can't tell them what to do...and you know what you say is right and it's correct but...you just can't...there's just this certain point where you're not supposed to really say much you know. Like that one kid who's living with his mother now, when he was living with his father before, and she had - this other teacher and I were talking to him and then we said, "You know where are you, who are you living with now?" Because I wanted to find out, and he said, yes, he's back with his mother. Well I knew it...I could just tell by the way he is...and we said, "Well what school are you going on to?" He said he's going back to this school that he came from, which is Piedmont, which is on 43rd or...it's right next to the ITT Tech , you've probably seen it and it's really a mess...really... [0:12:48.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, I know where it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just, oh, it's really a lousy school...and he really would be better off staying where...going to the school over in our area...it would really be better for him you know. But...there's something about...he had them saying to him, "Well you have to make a choice, either number one, you go to the school where you want to go or and live with your father or you live with your mother and go to Piedmont." You know just the choice he had to make you know. I, I mean I, and you don't, you can't...you're like, and you say to him... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't tell him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you can't tell him...like you say, "You don't want to..." You know saying, "We don't want to get into your business. We're not really concerned about your business, we're only concerned about you, you know? We're just, we really, you know, we don't care you know who you're living with or who, how, if your father's divorced, if your mother's remarried, you know, it's just, we're just trying to help you, you know?" And it's just something you really can't tell them..., you know, "Go back and live with your father, you'd be a hell of a lot better off." (chuckling) You know what I'm saying, I mean and having his father off but his father is...he's the type of a man who you couldn't tell either...and he'd just say, "Well I've done all I could for that kid, you know, and he'd, you know, what did he do for me? You know, he's shutting me off." You know and all this crap you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just...like, I mean you really can't tell him. (chuckling) [silence from 0:14:16.3 to 0:14:28.8] And that's really sad that...like that I don't think the children even realize...and what a difference it could make...in their life...if they really followed someone else's advice...because they don't know, they really don't know. Of course the advice we might be giving would be wrong too. I think it's easier to follow someone else's advice than some, than your own. (chuckling) You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, 'cause it's kind of like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know if it's all mapped out for you... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, like you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you don't have any problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and you feel [that you can go on with something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, then, then you know what you have to do...but...to make up your own mind really is the most difficult thing to do, you know. And I imagine it would be difficult for him too. (chuckling) [silence from 0:15:24.1 to 0:15:49.2] Of course the right road always seems the most difficult road to follow. (chuckling) You know the road...you know is right for you and you know the thing to do is just...it seems like it's...it's the most difficult thing to do. [silence from 0:16:05.2 to 0:16:37.5} The thing is...all the tape that they use up. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get a lot, a lot into these, on one tape.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A tape like that holds 12 interviews.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you close around this one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well a friend spoke, come up to me today and he said...he was supposed to - he said to me that he couldn't find my card in the summer school cards; he said that...my card wasn't there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean when you, to apply?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I applied, yeah...and I said... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, he came up to - yeah, I remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...so then he came up to me today and he said, well he found my card but it wasn't in the assigned...like you're an assigned teacher and you're a temporary teacher, an FTB, said it was in the temporary file and I said, "You're kidding." You know, he said, "No, you know, and no one is getting...hired if they're a temporary." And I said, "Well you and I know that I have been assigned for three years now." He said, "Yeah, but they've got it, you know, somehow messed up down at the Board on this you know." All you have to do is, they have to have one dealing with the Board of Education in the city of Chicago and it is unbelievable. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that explains why you weren't, [I mean this?] (ph) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, right...why I wasn't asked...it just all... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of seems that it's probably just some kind of clerical error?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, it was, but yeah, and then he said, "Well..." You know he said...he...if I wanted a position he'd have...he had one for me. I said, "No, that's all right, thanks anyway." But then calling up the Board and then I thought well I'll give it a telephone try and...if you're lucky that works. But then I, after talking to eight people I finally got it straightened up and I thought, "Oh, Christ."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was just a mistake in their part, it wasn't then on your records, you weren't... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...temporary? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Luckily I...I've saved my past...every year you get an identification card, so I've got three identification cards saying that I have been certified and assigned you know. But they, oh, they'd screw up anything down there, honest to God. Oh, they lose so many things and just, unreal, it is really sad. And they make it so miserable...for people going down there. They think...like they're talking to another child...and...you're not dealing with another child, you're dealing with adults...and they make you wait and then when you finally get up there, they, they're really nasty to you and just oh...just... [0:19:15.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just generally unpleasant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, they make it just really rotten for you to even...if you go down and apply for a job and they say, "All right here it is, take it or leave it." You know and just really unbelievable. And then if you don't like it they'll tell you to go and clock (ph) to unemployment, they don't care. (chuckling) And also I'll be interested to find out what, if they're going to have this integration thing that's in the city of Chicago, they're going to have to try and integrate the faculties and nobody wants it, black and white both don't want it. (chuckling) 'Cause the blacks want to stay in the black schools and the whites want to stay in the white schools...it's just...nobody else wants it...so the proposal is that they'd have to freeze transfers for until November of '72 and that's going to hurt a lot of people. (chuckling) But AGW says if you don't comply you don't get any money. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know money talks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [nonverbal 'yes'] They'd cut out all your funds and then you're sunk. (chuckling) Somewhere out in the suburbs of Chicago they took them to court on it. But just...it just doesn't make any sense though because, number one, the area in which you'd have to work with them...like the black teachers would have to travel, some of them would have to travel from the south side all the way out to the northwest side to find a white school to work in, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they'd have to...get up at six, 5:30 in the morning...to go out and go to work...and just...and take all that time traveling and all that stuff, it just, I mean really it's, it's a mess. [silence from 0:21:07.8 to 0:21:17.8] I really, I, I'm by far going to get transferred. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're by far what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would never get transferred since I'm the only white one there, me and this other, (chuckling) well this other woman and I are the only white woman, only white people there; they wouldn't transfer us. (chuckling) (big sigh) I have one more left after this, is that all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that bother you or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckling) I don't know...it would be kind of like getting...it's kind of like...like you're going to the dentist and it just gets into like a habit...and you just keep on going, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And then never being able to see me again.] (ph) [0:22:14.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then all of the sudden you're through...and you're just saying, "Wow!" (chuckling) It's really strange, it really is...it's just like it keeps on, it's like getting into a habit. Something I'll have to get adjusted to, really. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how do you feel about...not having...me to talk to about some of the things that you talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's kind of bad...not being able to talk about things that...yeah, that's kind of bad. I was thinking about...like, I was thinking like...who could I talk to...really...and there's just, something you just wouldn't talk to people about, you know. (chuckling) You know, especially what I've done and gone through and stuff like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things, some kinds of things that you just don't feel... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you can really talk to Tanya about them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, you couldn't talk to her about it or you couldn't talk to anybody about...yeah, that...it really feels kind of bad. And that is just being...you just have to solve it within yourself...but then...it's kind of bad keeping it within yourself, too...just...like keeping it within yourself and trying to solve it too, because you got to realize...once it is out...a problem...you can - I don't know there's just something about...you just arrive at your own conclusions, once it is said out in the open, you know. [silence from 0:24:00.4 to 0:24:17.5] And then it seems...like you can go around, you can go out and really you can solve your problem after it's been said...it's just it's easier to solve your problem after it's been said. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of being able to get it out kind of makes it kind of feel clearer or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, yeah. And then...like, say for...if you have a problem then you, you... like say for instance come in here and...you wouldn't...you'd feel kind of guilty coming back and saying, "Well you still haven't solved your problem or you haven't done anything about your problem." You know 'cause it's like...that's there too...this... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like if... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it kind of gives you kind of a pressure to do something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. You know someone says, "Okay, now you know what your problem is, it's solved. All right, what are you going to do about it?" I mean you don't say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but kind of like you feel like when you talk about a problem it's kind of your duty kind of somehow next time to talk about it... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, talk about it and say, "Well what I'd..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then show what...what you've done is all... [overlapping voices] [0:25:17.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I've done...right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A progress report for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, that's it...I...I just haven't been sitting on my ass worrying about it...it's just...what you've done about it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...really. [silence from 0:25:29.2 to 0:25:57.9] That's really kind of interesting. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's as if...like throughout your whole life...it's like...you need somebody...and...you just...you can't go about it...on your own. (chuckling) You really have to have some sort of direction...and as...what you have to do. (chuckling) Which really isn't very creative. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of even makes you feel... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...as if you're still a kid or something, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need some kind of help and direction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...like you really shouldn't, you know. (chuckling) [silence from 0:26:45.9 to 0:27:09.9] But I think people really enjoy that though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Enjoy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well...talking...to someone close and...just like...solve...and telling them about their problems and stuff like that...it's really...it's something else, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's kind of being able to share something... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that's very personal and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: ...it feels kind of nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, really, you know. The time (chuckling) both Nina and Kathleen came in this morning...they both had had hassles with their husbands...and they're sitting around talking to me...about what...this hassle...about...waking up fine in the morning and then he has to start something...and it just seemed that this could carry on and I just said, "Yes, yes, yes...yes, yes, yes." You know. And they just...keep on...and carry on and that, so that...it must, it's probably good for them just to really just let it off (chuckling)...really just say it...and just get it out. It's funny though, really, I mean they just, some of it is just hysterical you know. (chuckling) And Nina was saying, well not this, the last time, oh, her husband had packed his bag or something, and he was going out...getting in the car and he left his suitcase out in the street...and drives away (chuckling) and ran over his suitcase and left it there, you know. So then a couple of days later a woman came up to her door and the woman, the only reason that the woman knew it was husband's suitcase is that they got the identification through the...the laundry mark on his shirt...and it turned out to be an old friend of hers, you know. (chuckling) [0:28:47.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really hysterical. And today she said, well she went out and she bought him a new suitcase for Father's Day and she felt like shoving it at him and saying, "Here, go! Try not to run over this one." (chuckling) Oh. After...I did this listening to them, I think, "Christ...it's really unbearable." And they were saying about the fact like, if you say something and, and then I could really agree with them...if you say something to a man, say - her husband says to her, oh, Nina husband says, "Well I'm going to go out with my father and we're going to [Hide Awhile] (ph)." And Nina had told him previously that she was having this, the thing for her great grandmother who is 90 years old or something like this...blah, blah, blah. She says, "Okay, fine, go off to the Poconos...and take your son with you. I think it would be nice, you know."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are the Poconos?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he said - it's about a five hour drive - and he said, and he said, "You know, oh, you don't want to go. You didn't even ask if you could go." And he was upset because she...she didn't ask if she could go...and she says, "Anybody else would've been fine...great, my wife is letting me out...I can go alone...and he says, 'no.'" And I was just thinking...like, thinking...after I had this big hassle with Tanya and I was thinking to myself...I was just being very presumptuous in thinking that she would call, and that if she didn't call I would really, probably would've been pissed...if she didn't call.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of insinuated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like just kind of assuming that she would call. And he probably was just kind of assuming that she would ask to go and she didn't ask, so it was just kind of like...that he just really didn't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where's his communication skills?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right...he really got upset...and I could understand...I could really understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could understand it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like wow, she just made it to the point where...she said, "All right, go ahead." And this is what he didn't want to hear. (chuckling) He wanted to hear, "Well don't go. We've planned this other thing...you can't go, you know." And he was just waiting to hear something like that. She should've used a little psychology herself and done that. (chuckling) It's just, oh, I think it's just really, it's human nature, myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of the games that people play.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right...it's a game...and if you don't play right...and just someone really gets upset.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's always behind (ph) the unsaid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right, (chuckling) that people want to hear. The same thing with Kathleen, she said the same thing. She says she was having her father over...for Father's Day and her husband said, well he was going to go up and see his mother or something like this, and she said, "Fine." You know, well this is upsetting him too...'cause it was really, it's really funny. (chuckling) But I think...it's really kind of, they, you really enjoy it...'cause after a while you can talk about it and you sit back and laugh at it...and you can really think of it, it's really, it's childish...it's really childish and I don't think anybody really grows up...'cause it's...I don't know what constitutes being an adult but it sure isn't... [inaudible] [0:32:05.0] (chuckling) And this other teacher was telling me today, she was, she was driving, she was out at O'Hara at this new motel or hotel and they were having...they had been invited to this big opening or something. Her husband had a couple of drinks and she said she knew that he could drive but she just...thought...why take the chance and so she says...she was going to drive. And he says, "No, you're not." And she goes, "Yes, I am." So she got in the driver's seat and proceeded to drive. (chuckling) Well she said, she said she had to go to five gas stations before she could find her way onto the highway...really...and he's sitting there snickering...all the time...just snickering and laughing...and she was getting angrier and angrier and angrier (chuckling) because he wouldn't tell her where to go and she wouldn't ask him...it was just, just the game, it really was. [silence from 0:33:02.2 to 0:33:19.1] They have all the philosophy courses and all the psychology courses and nobody has really figured out anybody else. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's really, it's just...no one can just really figure out anybody else, you know. Because no matter how, how well you know a person, and I really don't think you know a person that well that you can predict what was going to happen. (chuckling) [silence from 0:33:43.1 to 0:34:00.0] And so, I mean I was even noticing about Tanya...seeing that my attitude has changed, her attitude has changed too...it's just really, it's really interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's just really...she's not to the point where...she's unsociable or anything else like this...it's just...she's very pleasant...as a matter of fact... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you changed and bring different things out in her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just it's really, it's really something else...it's just like she's not as...as cold as she used to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and she's really, it's really kind of nice, you know. [silence from 0:34:41.1 to 0:35:00.9] I was thinking...well how one person can affect another person's life so drastically...and...it made me realize...I really must mean a lot to her if...if this...just because...if I, if I were going to be kind of like...rotten towards her, did something that...she didn't like or something like that...she just takes offense to everybody (chuckling)...it's just as if everybody...slapped her in the face...and I couldn't be that way. You know if someone was going to...if I was going to be upset at someone. I mean maybe it would affect my attitude but I wasn't going to be, I wouldn't be downright...mean or arrogant towards someone just because...I had a fight with my girlfriend or something like this, you know. And like the old saying goes, you know, 'if your boss comes in rotten you know he had a fight with his wife last night', you know. (chuckling) [silence from 0:36:04.0 to 0:36:13.6] You haven't been packing much lately, are you all finished?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I've been working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) When did you say you plan to leave?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Good luck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to be a busy weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can see that. (chuckling) Are you originally from New York?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, near, well first from New York City, then from the suburbs of New York.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's different you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean than Chicago?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's, it's really, I prefer Chicago a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've heard so many other people say they really preferred New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...Chicago is big but it's still kind of like that there are neighborhoods; do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the neighborhoods... </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very ethnic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it... [overlapping voices at 0:37:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't like it about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I like it about that 'cause like I like to do, (chuckling) I know it sounds prejudice but I like to be able to go like and get Mexican food or... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's also...each neighborhood has its character and as people are unfriendly here but I think they're much more unfriendly in New York and it's just a big mushroom or something. And I don't really care that much about all the things there are to do in New York.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know all the shows and stuff, I mean that's great but I'm just not that... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah...it's nice to visit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just...I mean like I never really lived in New York for that long, I mean I was there a week but like just...reading about it and seeing things, I mean it seems to me that the people in New York, they don't play around...it's like (chuckling) their strikes, well they have a strike and they have a strike, nobody's going to dictate or tell them what to do... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I haven't heard about that, no I haven't heard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...they have a strike, they have a strike, you know. It's not like it is here...Mayor Dailey is going to come in and mediate and...then we're going to have this big hassle and negotiations are going to go out and...they'd just do it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well I think that maybe in part because Mayor Dailey has more of an affect, you know. [0:38:07.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true too, that's true too. But I thought...really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People listen to him... </p>

<p>CLIENT: They just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...he's the boss.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's it, that's literally he's just really something else. But I've really, I just...I kind of admired it...something about New York where... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The independence of... [overlapping voices at 0:38:22.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, the independence, they seem to be much more independent... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...than any place else...they just do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, they're not, they don't bend easily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Right, right and they don't take any crap from nobody. (chuckling) Really something else. Plus I never...I never had went in, well I was in Harlem...and I've saw Harlem...the... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think the slums in Chicago are much worse than they are in Harlem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, they are, oh God, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the south, know a place on the south side that would make Harlem look like... [overlapping voices at 0:38:50.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like a heaven.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, that's the truth, really. It's just...God knows. And see I think, I don't know, I just, I, being brought up in an ethnic area all my life, I just get to the point where I don't like it...it's just, it's [a same] (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, it's, I mean, yes, you can go across the tracks and you can go across the highway and you'd be in a different area, in a different thing...but it's just everyone seems to be afraid of everyone else...it's just like, oh, we're all scared to go over here, we're scared to go over there...and stuff like that. And it's getting to the point where this is that way any more in Chicago I think, because Chicago is black and the rest, the suburbs are no longer...they're not becoming...they're not ethnic areas...they're just a conglomeration also, you know. Besides that I really...I just think it's, I don't know, I just thought it was so cold and cruel. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is very cold.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's just...you're, you're not welcome in this neighborhood unless you're Lithuanian and you're not... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...welcome in this neighborhood unless you're Irish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's very true... [overlapping voices at 0:39:59.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and it's, oh, God, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We'll take your money but... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's about it. (chuckling) Don't you...and if you can't speak the language well then you're lost. (chuckling) I mean at the beginning it sure served its purpose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I, I don't know, I suppose now in a way, it's not good for outsiders but I think people assume (ph)...I don't know, sometimes they'd rather be with their own... [overlapping voices] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, it was very stabilizing...and it was very good...as far as...coming over from the old country...they...it was just like...there was someplace to go...it was just like okay, you went here and you lived with such and such a relative and...you stayed there until this relative was able to get you a job...and just you did for your own was the whole thing...it just, it was like...the Godfather all over again with just...that each different area had their own thing. [silence from 0:40:47.7 to 0:41:00.0] But they did make out all right. (chuckling) You know they did the, they did do their thing. And that's what I find about black people in general, they don't have this unity amongst them that...the ethnic groups...within Chicago did. You know they weren't to the point where... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More now I think maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, yes, yeah, more now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean with the black... [overlapping voices at 0:41:24.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. But...like even still now they have a very difficult time, even in their own communities, getting together and...there's always someone who has to stand up...and just, they have no leadership that's the whole thing...if they had like, okay, the Godfather, the head of the family who comes in - it was the same thing in the Irish clan too...he said what went and that's what went... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and no one was going to tell...say, "Well do you can such and such and such and such." You know, and they just argue about it and nothing gets done...this is the whole thing, they have no one to tell them - like I said, they need direction (chuckling)...they really have to tell...let someone tell them what to do...and right (ph)...sometimes they can be wrong but at least something is getting accomplished. [silence from 0:42:06.5 to 0:42:17.3] So just seeing the community...that I work in and just...their meetings and such...and half the time most of them don't show up and stuff like this...it's just - of course in the ethnic groups one thing that maintained their unity was the church...this was the whole thing that really...the whole community was centered upon and there was leadership there also to tell them what to do...and this is where it all was, it was centralized around the church. And...black people...some of them are very religious but they're...that as far as being church-goers and things like that, I mean they're not all of the same faith...whereas...they had that advantage (chuckling) if you were from Ireland or Italy or whatever...you all attended the same place...this is the meeting place on a Sunday morning. (chuckling) [silence from 0:43:07.7 to 0:43:21.9] So I was reading and started to read - what is it by Caldwell, it's about Saint Paul, The Lion, something like that, I've forgotten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, The Lion in Winter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, it's not, it's in, it's a, it's sonnets...he's writing of Saint Paul... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in the preface he's referring to the...an analogy between now and did the time in which Saint Paul...had, was...there...making his bid debut, and it's just...like...with the decline of the Roman Empire and stuff like this and saying how it was the same way then as it was now. And I...I was really, I was...after reading the preface I felt like throwing the book out. (chuckling) It was really kind of depressing...I don't know but...it's, he just said...going on, oh, about how everything is in such an uproar and everything is in such upheaval and...and all this stuff and blah, blah, blah, no one is going to religion...or... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...seeking God and stuff like this, and this is the whole thing, this is what's really saving...and what saved him, civilization then and well, saying it now and stuff like that. (chuckling) [silence from 0:44:37.0 to 0:44:51.2] I was watching Dick Cavette last night and Zero Mostelle was on, he is the most hysterical character. I've never...really seen him on a talk show but he is funny. They had to - oh, they had to cut...bleep him out about I don't know how many times, he was really hysterical...he was pouring water all over the rug and just really carrying on, and I thought...this is what people are really interested in...they're just not looking for someone who is phony. I mean this, he was having, he was really having an... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A good time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...honestly good time, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was just really enjoying himself, and...they, they were just...really playing games and just carrying on...foolish. [silence from 0:45:32.7 to 0:45:58.7] (chuckling) With...just getting back to the point of what people would think...what other people would think, you know. Say for instance...like I really enjoyed it but someone could say, "Well isn't he an ass...doing all these stupid things...and stuff like that." And then I thought to myself, "You know here I am calling about, worrying about what other people think about this man...who really, honestly couldn't care what people think...he's doing it in front of...millions of viewers and really couldn't car." You know and I bet he was loaded, I don't know, but...I just, he really couldn't care what they thought, and I thought this is really fantastic. [silence from 0:46:34.9 to 0:46:50.4] Then...just think about...just think about myself, okay, where are you; who are you and where are you going? But you can never really be sure, you know? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of when you wonder about how you'll be and what will happen to you... [overlapping voices at 0:47:04.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, you really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...this is true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you can never be sure. And...okay... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What all you'd be able to feel like ten years from now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right...and you just, you think to yourself, "well...you've, you've reached this plateau but there's always another one...and another one after that, and you never can be sure...who, who you are...and the people are...running around and just saying, "who am I", you know, and "what's relevant", and...I've done that..."where is my identity", and all this stuff, I think you really don't know...I think there will always be a question mark, just as long as you go on living. I don't know if that's right or wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's... </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...kind of the way in which life goes... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it leaves us with a question mark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just...like, I don't think that anyone could find life - I mean you could find life satisfying but you really couldn't find life totally happy because no matter...you may be happy at one time but then you go onto the next moment and...something may happen and you really, you really aren't happy then...and just, I don't think anybody could really say that they're satisfied with who they are or what they are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know there just seems to be that there's always going to be something... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...else that you want to be and you want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do, and there's always kind of going to be some, you could always think of some other kind of possibilities... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...for yourself... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then feel obsessed by it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Our time is about up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Four thirty Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fine. [0:48:43.9]</p>

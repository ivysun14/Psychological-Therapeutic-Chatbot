<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would have thought you would, uh, be needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, for all of the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You wouldn't want to be up there, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It looks kind of crazy.  Have you ever been to that kind of thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not much for that, huh?  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not much for that, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Party scene.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what it looks like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I really would have thought you would have been up there.  That you would have taken a lot of [INAUDIBLE] because you do, you do write for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, but not for, um, like we do, I do like student letters and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I would, he [INAUDIBLE] a lot of that kind, you know, [INAUDIBLE], you know, and then getting to the elevator.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know [INAUDIBLE] I'm assuming his personal assistant and maybe like the head scheduler was gone—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Didn't take the lieutenant, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's got to, to be here to hold down the fort.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but, uh, we heard a little kind of like he might have been coming back either last night or this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think he needs to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get those lanes turned around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your sister coming up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, not that I've heard about.  She, um, [INAUDIBLE].  So but she [INAUDIBLE], but that'll be fun if she could come home.  Not that she'd like have to [INAUDIBLE] and stuff, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, people probably need to lose if another agent's going to be inconvenient, you know, because they're going to be without electricity for a few days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anytime you get windstorms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They talked like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  It'll be flooded and you won't be able to get around and they won't have electricity and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm.  Sometimes we, um, [INAUDIBLE].  We all [INAUDIBLE] where we work at the call center like on the weekends, um, during hurricane season and, thankfully, one month already filled up in June so we didn't need it and then our other one is like not, about 3 weekends [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  You might just, uh, skated on by that one.  They might need some extra people this weekend though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, probably.  I mean, you know, [INAUDIBLE] get a better idea of where all the [INAUDIBLE].  We had a, um, like a practice time one morning.  It was just like really strange and it was like practicing for the people working in the call center I guess like normally, um, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we had [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was, I don't know [INAUDIBLE], but anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm sure he'll do what the people recommend [INAUDIBLE] also, also as you're ordered.  After the, the governor when Hugo was here who said, uh, who didn't allow them to reverse the traffic, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was a good move.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was in the second grade.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't remember either.  But he, I remember him saying, you can't reverse the traffic.  That's, uh, traffic's supposed to go that way, you know?  So a lot of people were stuck on the road.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  They, um, and I guess they have [INAUDIBLE] what their duties are [INAUDIBLE] hurricane, um, [INAUDIBLE] and, um, water stations and port—o—potties—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and [INAUDIBLE] for their patience and equipment [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Evacuated all of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you guys aren't going to get much work done over there this week.  It'll all be about the hurricane I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, probably because, um, like if we start getting a lot of calls [INAUDIBLE] then extra people have to jump on the fence to, um, to get all the calls like [INAUDIBLE].  Like a barge or something that hit the bridge [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like [INAUDIBLE] calls on that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] because someone was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, well, that's nice of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  So hopefully [INAUDIBLE] is helpful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get that guy's name.  You do okay with things like this, uh, it's hectic in the office and chaos and upheaval?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I'd much prefer like [INAUDIBLE] day—to—day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No conflict.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do what I'm supposed to do and then, um, and I think it's hard for me to like stay, stay neutral and not get kind of emotional about it too when I talk to people on the phone and if I'm like really upset about something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's hard just to like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just the facts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and you have lots, lots of empathy as you well know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  So I'm not looking forward to having to answer their calls.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like we all take shifts answering phones, um, because our receptionist, uh, left to go to Texas and with the budget cuts and everything we're not hiring a new receptionist.  We're just all like [INAUDIBLE] about that.  But I think we all have like two two—hour shifts that we, so [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many lines are there to call in on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know.  Maybe like 5 or 6, but most I've ever had on were like 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll have 6 today, sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They give you a standard script, don't they?  How to answer different things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you'll need to stick to that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And just focus on the script and not the, um, the details that are—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that are coming in.  Just the, just the facts and look at it that you need to get whoever it is off the phone as quickly as possible so you can answer the next one.  Not that you want another call, but you don't want to belabor—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, that's another thing that, um, I think [INAUDIBLE] in my case that, um, because like, you know, when you, just like on a normal day [INAUDIBLE] because we know we're going to have to transfer them to like one of the case workers—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we're just kind of like the directory, um, a big part [INAUDIBLE] where they launch and then they'll pull away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it is, because then you have to like, okay, now you [INAUDIBLE] and all that and [INAUDIBLE] is going to help you.  So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so you don't want them to get frustrated.  You'll just have to say, excuse me; I don't mean to be rude.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then especially when they've already [INAUDIBLE] through it like twice—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] me again?  What is this?  It's like, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you still enjoy your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the student letters, um, are probably [INAUDIBLE] going to pick up again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because [INAUDIBLE] like a summer break [INAUDIBLE], but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do they, they write you back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, they, they just write, they about how they're doing in school [INAUDIBLE] and they have to stay in South Carolina and [INAUDIBLE].  [INAUDIBLE] and stuff and sometimes they have for like specific things or [INAUDIBLE] if it's something we can find relatively easy or just not [INAUDIBLE].  But sometimes we do direct them to the archives.  Like it is not [INAUDIBLE].  It was just somebody doing [INAUDIBLE] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like most of that stuff could be on the, in the library, on the, on the internet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um, yeah, and then, and we refer them to like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's kind of standard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just modify it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and [INAUDIBLE] there's like a standard [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and then we do, uh, copy letters which we do, we're supposed to do, our quota is like 15, but [INAUDIBLE] or, um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, like birthdays [INAUDIBLE] and like anytime [INAUDIBLE] congratulations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that one of your communication people I guess finds that?  Those things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, there is a guy who, he was an intern and then he graduated, um, I guess this past spring and then he came back and started working, um, or actually, um, I think that now he's working fulltime and that, but he does kind of a [INAUDIBLE] I think.  He's working on a big, um, project with all of our files because we ran out of space for file cabinets—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so he brought [INAUDIBLE] I think they determine that we're not going [INAUDIBLE] refer to again, um, [INAUDIBLE] but he also looks through the newspapers and looks on [INAUDIBLE], but then it's, um, I mean I don't mind doing it, but it gets time consuming [INAUDIBLE] and can't find the, doesn't give any other information about like, like [INAUDIBLE] organization they belong to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you put out about how many letters a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I would say maybe like 6, not that they actually go out—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You process.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got enough to do at your work?  You busy enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  I, well, I do that and then also one receptionist left—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] then she did it and then I would check over that, but now it's like [INAUDIBLE].  And usually that doesn't take like more than an hour.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Unless it's just like a huge [INAUDIBLE] that come in.  Like there are lot [INAUDIBLE] and stuff going on with [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get too bored in the daytime or have a lot of downtime?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I usually since I come usually about like 10:30, um, and stay until 6:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't take a lunch.  So I do get sidetracked sometimes [INAUDIBLE] and like, um, or if they work or [INAUDIBLE] what they do and other stuff like that [INAUDIBLE] get sidetracked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do get sidetracked?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Real easy I'm sure.  Well, these computer screens, they really can focus us specifically if you have attention problems anyway.  They hyperfocus you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like don't even hear the phone ringing kind of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the, um, I work in an office with two other women and, um, [INAUDIBLE] big room and I can never tell, like because I can't see them directly if they're talking to [INAUDIBLE] or talking to the other person—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or on the phone [INAUDIBLE] on the phone and sometimes I'm like not, I don't hear like when they're like asking me a question [INAUDIBLE].  But it, it's never like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that embarrassing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think in other situations it could be, but with them, I don't [INAUDIBLE], but I mean I think [INAUDIBLE] like about a year doing the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, gosh, has it been that long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's gone fast, hasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It does.  It, um, [INAUDIBLE], but it gets, it gets like, it's more repetitive.  It, it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], um, go by and that's the thing that I'm worried, like they have certain [INAUDIBLE] or like careers—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] pretty much when you see the [INAUDIBLE] you have to redo them.  So they're very [INAUDIBLE], but I think because I'm, I'm really like detail oriented that, um, I don't mind [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  I imagine your letters are quite thorough in the first place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They, um, they're, I keep, um, like I'll do one and then I have to do [INAUDIBLE] and then when I read it again, I kind of re—do it [INAUDIBLE] and then I change it again [INAUDIBLE] sorry, I changed this part.  So but I'm kind of, uh, it's like [INAUDIBLE] even if I'm not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any problems at work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  They [INAUDIBLE] library, but, um, don't know for sure and don't really want to know, but I never, I don't, I [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, I [INAUDIBLE].  Um, I would like to get [INAUDIBLE].  Um, still working on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On what, going to bed earlier?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, and just, and getting up when I'm, when my alarm goes off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What time do you go to bed now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably like 1:00 or 2:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, what are you watching that late night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, I get, I like all the like [INAUDIBLE] and then the [INAUDIBLE] and I think the cats are like because they're sleepy and like if everyone else is sleeping [INAUDIBLE] play with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And kind of like that [INAUDIBLE] because I don't get to see them all day.  Yeah, so I think I need 8 hours of sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  When I got to bed at 2:00 and I'm up at [INAUDIBLE].  But I, I mean [INAUDIBLE] sleep, I'm sleeping well [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] constantly waking up or, uh, I didn't like [INAUDIBLE] I had.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so I think it's refreshing sleep—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel like you kind of miss out on something at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, I think there's, because I'm not any kind of like [INAUDIBLE] during the day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your mom think again?  Does she have any concerns?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She'd probably tell you, wouldn't she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, they, yeah, I think, I don't think [INAUDIBLE] be okay, um, but I do think [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, why wouldn't she come out directly and just ask you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know.  I guess she, she [INAUDIBLE] talk about something and they'll bring it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm, nobody does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, [INAUDIBLE] not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you two are getting along okay.  Is that an accurate assumption or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Me and [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and your mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she, um, um, [INAUDIBLE] so much like [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But like 2 Fridays ago when I was coming home from work, I had a wreck at that new intersection of [DEIDENTIFIED].  I was turning left, um, off of [DEIDENTIFIED] to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE] and, um, I was [INAUDIBLE] intersection waiting for the light to turn yellow and, um, [INAUDIBLE] was like constant traffic—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] came up after it, but, um, yeah, so and then the light was yellow [INAUDIBLE] like the other cars were slowing down [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ran the light?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was, it was yellow when I started my turn and I think when they caught, when they came to the intersection—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It had the yellow light though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you had a red light?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was going the same direction [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even though he, but you don't run yellow lights either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it would have been red by the time she crossed underneath it I feel like, but because it was technically yellow, it was my fault.  So I didn't [INAUDIBLE] everyday and to like anywhere else I had to go pretty much unless [INAUDIBLE].  Um, and I know she doesn't like having to drive downtown everyday.  So I feel it was really fortunate that she could do that.  Um, and then [NAME OTHER] was, she didn't have a wreck, but she was [INAUDIBLE] and she was merging onto [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, there was an 18—wheel logging truck in the right lane and she [INAUDIBLE], she realized that she wouldn't have enough time to like [INAUDIBLE] she was going to like [INAUDIBLE] and get it behind it like before her merge lane [INAUDIBLE].  There was another car like right behind it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so she kind of like, uh, [INAUDIBLE], she like swerved really fast and said she was braking or something and in that she lost control of the car and like [INAUDIBLE] and then hit the cable and went back across the interstate and landed, um, between like the emergency lane and like the [INAUDIBLE] side of the road.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gees.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Time for a new car, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they total it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, her car was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she was fine.  Um, miraculously.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm, what kind of car is this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, um, a '96 [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Not a [DEIDENTIFIED], huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it would not have been good if it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What car?  What, what make?  A what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did for quite a while I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she, um, I think it's the kind of thing that, well, [INAUDIBLE] woke me up at like 7:44/:45 in the morning and she was like [INAUDIBLE] mom said she's going to be here in 5 minutes and you have to go with her.  [INAUDIBLE] what could it be?  It could be anything, but, um, [INAUDIBLE] ride with her [INAUDIBLE] to drive [NAME OTHER]'s car and then I drove her car.  So, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's nice how you all support each other for the most part, count on each other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I'm thankful that like my job is, it allowed me to do that too.  It's not so strict that they [INAUDIBLE] personal life [INAUDIBLE] number one priority.  So, I, really my mom kind of never really catches a break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You worry about her a lot, don't you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who?  Just my mom and my dad's going to be there and two of his sisters is all that I know of because I think because my mom's alleging something [INAUDIBLE] on my mom.  So she doesn't, she's not like bringing anyone to [INAUDIBLE].  Um, I think they're like presenting stuff tomorrow and not, and the judge won't issue [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know when that happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I have to go to court next Thursday for my wreck and hopefully get a ticket [INAUDIBLE].  Um, so, yeah, I mean there's always something going on, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was your weekend?  Did you have Monday off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was your weekend?  Did you spend it with the family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  It was good.  I [INAUDIBLE] on Saturday, um, and then Sunday and Monday we were just at home and tried to clean, um, like [INAUDIBLE] area—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do they both live around here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They live in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm kind of, I'm looking forward to those things and the showers and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] did you graduate from and stay up there?  Get jobs in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think a handful of them did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, they got [INAUDIBLE] but they do stuff with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's nice to have that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a close—knit society and once they, they went to block scheduling up there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No more of the trimesters and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and [INAUDIBLE] started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kids hate it because they've got to take like 4 classes instead of what?  Three?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They've got to take 4 and it's freaking them out.  It's like I don't know if I can do 4.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, especially for the upper classmen.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I've, 'cause really the fall semester, well, they start earlier, but it doesn't seem like it would be [INAUDIBLE] longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you guys used to start after Labor Day, didn't you?  They started last week instead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  A week earlier.  You ready to go back to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Um, [INAUDIBLE] school and [INAUDIBLE] girlfriend, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who I used to live with [INAUDIBLE] she's there too and, um, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?  Just general interest or are you thinking law school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you'd never go in the Army either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, just, just the [INAUDIBLE] going to law school and being a lawyer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause she was always like [INAUDIBLE] trial captain and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you always, uh, kind of dream of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, more, well, [INAUDIBLE].  I kind of thought about like being something in the medical field—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't like chemistry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Didn't like chemistry and, uh, oh, and then after [INAUDIBLE].  I don't like, um, being responsible for [INAUDIBLE].  So [INAUDIBLE] and then I kind of thought about, um, like museum work or like, um, not [INAUDIBLE] but, but preserving—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Artifacts and stuff.  Yeah.  I don't think I would make very much money doing that.  So and not that I'm making like loads now, but I feel like [INAUDIBLE] more secure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] secure just through this term or are you going, can you stay longer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think technically everyone goes, but in the past, um, like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has it?  So people that are in there now have been there with previous administrations?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, there's, um, one of the women [INAUDIBLE] office for like 25 years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think she's like been doing different things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] education.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There must be a lot of divisions there in the governor's office because I know some people at times I think that's where TNA is in the protection advocacy.  Aren't they part of the governor's office?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So for, and then like all these different offices that over in the [INAUDIBLE].  I remember those too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But your office is where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's on the first floor of the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, it's like not one of the ones along the street, but it's like in between the brown building and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many buildings are there on the grounds?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe 6.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Including the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know your way around I bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, kind, like a [INAUDIBLE] the building is so there's two buildings close that I've never been in to even.  Um, I finally got a garage parking space.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  No more getting wet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that seniority?  You've got to work up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean even to get in the garage though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was there like 16 months or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All those buildings are connected, aren't they, underground?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] help me [INAUDIBLE] underneath—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] level [INAUDIBLE].  It's really confusing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you, you were thinking that maybe you'd like to get to work at 9:30 instead of 10:30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cut out at 5:00 instead of 6:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  But then it's like the traffic at 5:00—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'd be crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  That's why, that's why I don't leave at, there's no use leaving at 5:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You might as well just work until 6:00, yeah, 'cause that just, just sit in traffic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why doesn't the governor fix that?  Can't he fix everything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] be able to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He did do that, didn't he?  He fixed the DMV.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was a good one.  Those people are much friendlier too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, good.  I haven't been there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They really are.  I haven't heard, you know, I see lots of kids that have to go for their licenses now and they, they get them in and out pretty quick and, you know, and actually, I, when I got my license the last time, I actually walked in the door and instead of somebody standing there going, we can't serve you, you're not here early enough, because I remember that too, you know?  We don't, we already have enough business here for the day, we want to get out of here and that kind of thing, but they were actually, I walked in and, um, a woman over here says, um, I can take you.  I go, uh, okay.  I'm free.  Give me work.  Because you never see that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's always like, but they were very, they were very friendly.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you got, he has another year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Next year will be interesting for you too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I've never been there through like [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Election season and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now you making any contacts that you can maybe use for another job or something else you might rather do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not actively that I can think of because I think we could go out and work with all, it's like we all do the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and, and I don't really have any in, interaction with people outside of the government's office—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't, I don't know what the other people in the governor's office [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where do you have lunch?  Do you, uh, eat, uh, on grounds or do you leave or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I eat at my desk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I don't take a lunch since I'm there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's right, you don't, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is your mom okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.  I think she's kind of nervous about [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About court, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what all could happen, but, um, [INAUDIBLE] think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not going with her, are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You going with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To court and your sister's going or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no, no point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 'cause see there's like only one issue that like [NAME OTHER] could have I guess gone up on the stand and talked about, but it's basically hearsay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They should have things, they usually solve, resolve things even before they go in.  They're just jealous, threats, and silliness before they go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah, see our dad and his three sisters are in town and he, um, called me last night down at [DEIDENTIFIED] because he knows that I [INAUDIBLE], um, until about 9:30 on Tuesday and, um, asked if like we could do lunch today or [INAUDIBLE] after work or something and, and so I called him back Wednesday morning and was basically like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Kind of uncomfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Was like, yeah, [INAUDIBLE] and I got my [INAUDIBLE] and he [INAUDIBLE] kind of [INAUDIBLE] and, yeah, I, I, like I would like to see him, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's working out there then.  I understand you'd like to see him at all, but listen, is your medicine okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood's pretty even it seems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.  No problems with Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

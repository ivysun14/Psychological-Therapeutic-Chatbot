<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 2, interview 2, January 12th, client 1325-017. Interview 2, Napolean, counselor, January 12th. Should have - should have mentioned last time that, you know, we have 20 hours together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know, each hour is really yours to deal with as you want to deal with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:00:35.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I get, you know, how much interaction is there? You know, because, like, I deal with it all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, that depends on how you deal with it. I really - when you say, "How much interaction," what do you mean by interaction?</p>

<p>0:00:52.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, how much kind of, you know, participation would you - you know, would you expect to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean how...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of been thinking this out, you know, like, last time it was kind of like an interview.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the thing is, I - last time I realized felt like - may have felt like an interview to you. I mean, to me it just felt like there was a lot of things you wanted to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you started to say something and talk about it for ten minutes. Because I felt like what you were trying to do was give me a certain amount of background or information.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess I felt like it was important for you to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, that's what I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You understand what I mean? I mean, I - if you would have come in here and just really been feeling miserable, and prior to feeling miserable you said a few words about it, that would have been okay too. But I felt like you felt it was important to.</p>

<p>0:01:57.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say all that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did, yeah. But I just wondered if...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I didn't feel terribly interactive, but that's because I felt like you really wanted to do the talking there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I - yeah, I just - I wonder kind of how long - since it is only the 20 sessions, how long it would kind of take before you felt that you understood things well enough, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well enough for what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, to deal with them kind of more...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you see, I guess I believe in - this whole type of approach really believes in dealing with and understanding things as you're saying them, you know, with the level kind of which you're into it. That means by the level that you (inaudible at 0:02:42.4), which you were into with the - and you can really talk about things, say a lot of things about them, that may not do much for you because you're really not into (inaudible at 0:02:57.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting into, like, the feeling parts of those things you're talking about (inaudible at 0:03:01.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I haven't answered your question because there's really not an answer to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well (inaudible at 0:03:13.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:03:13.2) you're feeling very up in the air.</p>

<p>0:03:15.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I also felt - you know, I realize that, you know, 50 minute session thing is, you know, really set up, but it seems like - you know, if there's some way to kind of focus things at the end and stop it, it seems like it's more kind of manageable thing for a client to handle, you know, than just to say, "Well, okay, time's up," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess - so do you mean, like, make things feel tied up better, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes it's really good to kind of go away still processing that uncertainty whatever it is you're talking about because that would - that's not something you could just do in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But the uncertainty, you know, is nothing new to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, but, you know, hopefully, from what we talk about, you know, you knew (ph) now it might feel different, and maybe (inaudible at 0:04:12.6) do it that way (inaudible at 0:04:13.8). I feel like you're looking to me for something, right, I'm not giving it to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I know, I look for a messiah, you know. I know that that's not what I'm here for. But it does seem like there must be some kind of median point between just going over the same thing totally by myself again and again and again, and then (inaudible at 0:04:40.3) with somebody who is aware - I mean, has a more sophisticated awareness of these kinds of problems and who might have something to offer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess what I feel like I have to offer is that - really trying to understand what it is you're saying but trying to focus you on what the feeling there is in what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, I mean, I was - I understood that, you know, you felt kind of nervous your first time. (Inaudible at 0:05:11.5) really struck me last time - you were talking of very, very heavy things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know, they are heavy.</p>

<p>0:05:18.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, what I'm saying is the content of them was very heavy. And from the content I can realize that they really upset you, but I couldn't really feel like you were upset. Do you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, well, I do have a habit of seeming like I'm in control, everybody tells me that I look totally self-sufficient, self-reliant, calm, composed. And, you know, I'm ready to pull a gun out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you see, like, hopefully in time that will - you know, hopefully, maybe this can be a place where you don't have to be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where I can start screaming and have the temper tantrums.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If that's what you're feeling, you know, that's fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, it's not really, it's kind of a dead feeling, you know, it's not the kind of thing - I'd probably be better off if I started breaking windows (inaudible at 0:06:06.5). But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, you know, sometimes really feeling the feelings, I guess I really believe that feeling (inaudible at 0:06:15.6) letting your control go all the way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I just have this incredible guilt thing about having said too much, like, you know, with other people. There was, you know, kind of an interesting thing happened last night. This one person I mentioned, you know, I didn't understand what had happened in the fall, just quit calling me up for some reason called last night. And we talked and it really - that really got heavy, you know, I mean, it was just a very honest thing (inaudible at 0:06:45.4).</p>

<p>0:06:46.0</p>

<p>And apparently, what had happened was that - you know, he could have become sexually involved, but he realized that the stakes I put on the emotional part of the relationship were very high. And he felt that he probably couldn't come through with that. And he told me that, you know. And I got - I really resented the whole thing because, you know, I felt like because - you know, the same old thing about not being taken seriously as a person. Okay, there I was with this - you know, somebody who is physically attractive to him but still didn't have the kind of personal qualifications, you know. And so that kind of came out and he said, "Well, it actually is - it's the other way around." It's being taken very seriously and therefore, you know, not - you know, you didn't want to kind of impose on me, tread on me, you know, because he did take me seriously as a person.</p>

<p>But it just seems so ironic that I sit there at home alone, you know, pasting out little passages out of Nietzsche to comfort myself, while everybody else loves me so much they won't come near me. And I got pretty resentful about it and kind of angry. And I really - then I felt terribly guilty that I just shouldn't have said that much. I shouldn't have shown resentment to him because he was really being honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, and what you're saying is - I mean, I really feel that it's like - it's kind of strange because it's actually complicated because it's like, you really feel just terribly sad and lonely, but people are really seeing you, but why the hell aren't they caring for you in a kind of loving kind of caring you really want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if they respect me so much that they can't come near me because I'm so vulnerable - you know, like he was saying that vulnerability is a really beautiful thing. And it's - you know, it's not worth getting - trying to make myself hard and invulnerable. That's not my point at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I sense (inaudible at 0:08:45.8) which you were thinking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't see any other way of survival, you know, if I'm so vulnerable that people don't dare touch, then, you know, I just - then I'm not living. You know, I really don't see...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I really kind of sense, like, you're throwing up your hands and saying, "You know, I really don't know how to live anymore."</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's precisely it, yeah.</p>

<p>0:09:11.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I know the way of living that seems rightist (ph) for me is placing importance on emotion, not being cruel at heart.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can't be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the thing, if I try, it just doesn't come off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what you're saying is - you know, I guess you're saying, where the hell has that gotten me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's not - you know, it's not like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like no one's - you know, the things about me that are important to me, that not being hard and being open.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not a matter of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No one's really cared for it the way I want them to care for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's not a matter of it just being important to me. It's a matter of being me, it's a matter of being unchangeable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes, (inaudible at 0:09:56.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it, you know, I - you know, people who know me know that I can't be invulnerable. There's just no way I can do it, you know, I can't just sit there and say, okay, I'm going to get hard and then get hard. And as a result - you know, okay, people respect me for the kind of stakes I put in relationships, but they don't dare get near, you know, and so, you know, the irony is just incredible. I suppose I could just consider irony and laugh, but, you know, the loneliness is pretty hard to take.</p>

<p>0:10:34.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, yeah, I kind of sense you do need that laughing (inaudible at 0:10:37.0) or the feeling of loneliness and taking that, kind of like you're stuck in the middle right now. I mean, that's how you're feeling now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't laugh at it when you say it's irony.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of a bitter irony.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I say, that's really great, it's irony (ph). But (inaudible at 0:11:01.6) feelings terribly alone and sad. It's like, you don't want that either (inaudible at 0:11:07.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, it (inaudible at 0:11:13.3). It's really what I do all the time, you know. You know, this whole thing about, you know, that it's good to express yourself, you know, the guilt thing, I feel like this other guy called up after Christmas and everything. And, you know, he wondered how I was and stuff. And, you know, I kind of apologized for, you know, having had this scene with him. And I don't know whether I mentioned last time how much this friend helped me to see about what I was doing. You know, she knows my whole family background. The family - I haven't told you anything about that but it's really incredible, you know, it's - like, my mother pulled a knife on my brother when he was 14 and stuff.</p>

<p>And my friend is extremely perceptive, and she saw that the way the whole family is operated and just become - it's become an unconscious behavior, is these incredibly subtle forms of punishment on each other. And, you know, the best way that I found to punish my parents was to punish myself. And what I was doing with this guy was lashing out at him by lashing out at myself. You know, that was the most effective way that I could kind of just unconsciously come up with. I wasn't really aware that I was doing that. You know, I really felt what I'm saying. And, you know, I think she's really right about it. But at any rate, it was a very undignified thing to do and I kind of apologized to him, you know, he accepted that and was concerned and everything.</p>

<p>And then, you know, I told him I was not, like, you know, kowtowing to him, I wasn't apologizing for what I said, I really believe what I said. But I told him that - you know, that I felt badly that I'd used indiscretion telling someone who didn't - was not really capable of understanding. And that - you know, that was a really - you know, it was an honest thing to say but it wasn't, you know, a gracious thing to say. It was again kind of - it was like I kind of goaded him into something and then turned on him again or something, you know.</p>

<p>And, you know, just - I think it's a bad thing in that sense to be that expressive with hostility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, I can see what you're saying from that. But I sense - how you started that was you were talking about, like, you really feel guilty about expressing what you did really feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I think - I feel guilty not that I, like, hurt him or something because I think he really deserved it. You know, I think it was a really truthful thing, but I feel guilty that I lost that much control, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You said before that you were - you felt like all you had to live with now - you were living with is your loneliness and sadness. And I really want you to say more about that because I can understand that situation (inaudible at 0:14:35.1), but I really don't know what that feels like to you.</p>

<p>0:14:37.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it just - it doesn't make life worth living, you know, (inaudible at 0:14:44.5). I guess I've really gotten that (inaudible at 0:14:47.6) kind of suicidal thing now. I can really feel that having changed because before I was just - I really - my roommate finally said that she had been really scared because I just hadn't been myself for days, you know, she knows me. And I just - I wouldn't express anything. I was just practically catatonic, you know, I would just sit in my room and just try to barely exist through another day. And now, you know, I'm, you know, active. I can really handle people, you know, at almost any - even the kind of level of honestly last night. I can really hack it.</p>

<p>And so I know I'm kind of out of that, but I think part of it is that I've come up with other alternatives. Like, I'm definitely planning on leaving New York and leaving school. And I'd like to, like, maybe teach in this progressive boarding school thing that my roommate used to go to. It's in Idaho, it's a very selective thing, very free, creative place. And I'm going to try that. And so, you know, I have kind of managed to construct other alternatives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like - because what you're saying is, like, you somehow managed to structure your life so that you can see some things ahead. And it's like, chosen not to let yourself really know what that loneliness and sadness is like inside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know that it's a matter of just kind of repressing that feeling anymore, but it's a matter of trying to set more positive goals, you know, and trying to - like, part of the loneliness is being in a very cold, intellectual atmosphere like this, you know, and sitting around doing monographs. I'd rather have - like, I think that I could create a certain level of my own - of happiness, and having a dynamic kind of interchange, you know, with students, you know, where the ideas suddenly take on some kind of form because they're being communicated. Because ultimately, I don't think any idea has any meaning outside of just the process of communication.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:16:59.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that - you know, so I just - I think that maybe in a teaching situation that I could have some kind of social thing going, you know, that would at least be something to kind of hang on to. I don't see it certainly as any kind of ultimate happiness, and I don't think I would be going into it with any of those terms and suffering this incredible disappointment. And it wouldn't be like an all or nothing thing. It's just the kind of middle point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you can see yourself doing and getting at least some enjoyment from it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just something to hang on to for a while. I just don't know what's going to come next.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kind of get the sense of, like, when you see yourself living the life ahead of you, like, (inaudible at 0:17:42.4) see yourself (inaudible at 0:17:45.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's exactly the word - that hit me when I was a junior in college, and that's the first time I really thought of suicide. You know, it was (inaudible at 0:17:54.2) I'm not living at all. I am marking time, I always look ahead to some really great thing that's going to happen. And the moment, you know, is just - is meaningless, it's nothing and I just sit and kill time until, you know, for the best to come. And the best, of course, never comes because I've never - I never let it or, you know, I never think realistically about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you don't let it? What is it that you'd like to come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, a serious relationship with a man and, you know, I can't sit around and wait for this white knight thing. And so as a result, you know, I keep putting ultimate kinds of values and it really - I was going to show you this thing with politics I'm just very - or the politics experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where he talks about the experience of negativity. And it really, really hit me, this thing about, you know, the distinction between the absence of relationships and the experience of the relationship as an absence. The division between loneliness and perpetual solitude and then, you know, provisional hope. And, you know, I just realized that I was in this bag of every relationship being in absence because I'm putting a kind of ultimate value on this ideal that I've created. And so I'm not really letting myself explore, you know, a wealth of different kinds of relationships because I'm...</p>

<p>0:19:33.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you're saying is that you're looking - you look so hard what you want. It's like you want that so bad, you want a serious relationship and you want it so bad. It's like whatever there is, you know, almost it's bound to fail in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't - it's almost like you'll do things so that - because you want it so bad, it can never be because you do things in the relationship because you want so much to prevent it from being (inaudible at 0:20:01.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's one thing, and then just the kind of real satisfactions that come from different kinds of relationships just with very close girlfriends and guys who are also close friends, you know. I kind of resent the limitations of the relationship and then I kind of negate it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sounds like you just want that other thing so bad, it's like in comparison with it nothing else seems very meaningful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's really true. That is - you know, and I know that that's - I know I'm not the only one who feels that way. So at least I feel like I'm not just some kind of freak. But, you know, I know it's also a very kind of childish and perhaps selfish thing to feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really get - I get the feeling that, you know, you constantly look at what you feel, and it's like you can't even have that feeling because you're looking at it and knocking yourself, or calling it childish or not rational or not realistic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:21:12.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you're constantly putting yourself in a bind between what you do feel and what you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because when I do feel is something that's - well, is really ruining my life, there must be something wrong with it, you know. It's not a realistic thing - way for me to look at the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's not a realistic way to look at the world?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, to constantly be hoping and longing for something that is not there, is not tangible, is not - you know, it makes me miss what is there. And that's, you know - and that is bad in that sense to feel that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of bad because it's like (inaudible at 0:21:56.6) either wanting it so bad you miss everything else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it, and I don't know how to quit wanting it. You know, I sometimes can manage for a while, but ultimately, it just comes up again. And it's like this thing, you know, it's what I felt, that's what I really meant I think when I was saying that I just didn't think I could be involved with a man right now because I'd be so afraid of what I would do to any possibility of a relationship, because I would be setting these kind of ultimate standards on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you're wanting it so bad could have the effect, or you're afraid to, like, have the effect of the - like crushing a (inaudible at 0:22:42.1) comes to my mind it's like you want a tree so, and you step on the - afraid you would step on the seedling that way (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wherever (ph) that chance to grow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, because I'd resent its smallness and its triviality and paltriness, you know. (Inaudible at 0:23:00.6) I know this is ridiculous, but, you know, just - now, I can look at other people, I look at this guy that I knew last spring and everything, and I could see how he could construct his own happiness. Admittedly, he does an awful lot of it with drugs, which is - he does it in a pretty pathological way. It's really escaping reality but at least it creates something that he can live with. And I just don't seem to have that strength. I can't construct things and I can't construct goals.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like, you don't have your moment-to-moment, day by day happiness. You can't find (inaudible at 0:23:38.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also - and beyond that, like this other guy that I knew last year who his marriage had just broken up and he was really cracking up and everything. You know, he managed to find somebody else, you know, limited or not, you know, this other woman that he's living with. And I don't know - you know, I don't know how deep his feelings are. I think they're pretty deep. But, like, you know, even with a problem that huge, you know, which in objective terms, is much, much bigger than mine. You know, he still managed to direct things. You know, I mean, he could control things. I just feel like I'm - like, everything that happens around here is just totally beyond my control. It's just, I have absolutely nothing to say, I just accept fate, that's, you know.</p>

<p>0:24:25.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean things happen to you it's in the stars as they say (ph). And kind of getting to feel like you're fate is (inaudible at 0:24:37.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I definitely believe that. And it's, you know - and what I see is the ultimate control, you know, for me is to learn to accept it, but I also resent the fact that other people don't seem to have to do that. They don't have to accept things, they can - you know, they can change things, they can really control and manage the conditions that - you know, that make things rough for them, and find ways out of it and find things that make them happy. I just - I don't know - I don't have the power to do that. And I really don't have the creativity or imagination or strength or whatever it is to guide things at all. (Inaudible at 0:25:16.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't really find it in yourself to just appreciate the smaller things even when you don't have the big (inaudible at 0:25:28.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and also to find the big thing like other people can do, I can't do either. I can't either accept limitations, nor can I go beyond them. It's just like a constant battle. And I can't even - I don't even have the strength to escape reality. Just totally caught in between (inaudible at0:25:51.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess again I get the feeling - I mean, as you talk, I mean, I kind of get the sense of (inaudible at 0:26:12.1), those things really sound like they would lead someone to feel terribly desperate and lonely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very hopeless too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I don't know, do you feel that way inside, I mean...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you see, I can sense that feeling from, like, the situations you talked about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you say, but it's almost kind of like I have this feeling of you looking at yourself from the top of a five story building or something, and saying (inaudible at 0:26:54.6) can't get...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I know, that's - I'm a fairly inexpressive person. You know, before I would really break down and cry about things. I'd swallow a bottle of pills.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible at 0:27:10.1) what you mean by that is that if you let yourself really feel what that sorrow is inside you (inaudible at 0:27:18.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, I can - it's almost like it's a more manageable thing just to end it all than it is just to give in. It's like a very self-assertive kind of thing. But it's some kind of ultimate power just to end it rather than to submit and just agonize, which I have been doing more, you know, it's a totally inside thing. It's a desperate feeling, you know, my stomach will get tied. I'm kind of a stomach person. And my stomach will get tied up in knots or I'll just have this total - totally helpless physical feeling, you know, where - you know, I'll try doing all kinds of things and I can't even sit down and do them, you know. I just kind of pass time just trying, you know.</p>

<p>0:28:14.5</p>

<p>And it's not like a (inaudible at 0:28:15.9), you know, because I go the other way, I get super energetic and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can't do anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't - yeah, I can't really focus any of that energy because I resent the fact that I'm...</p>

<p>(Audio gap)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like, you really might be able to take school more in stride and feel probably that it's more meaningful than you feel now, if there was something that was really meaningful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, but as a result, you know, I resent the lack of freedom I have in choosing this, you know, this life because I feel like - you know, I - well, you know, it's just a resentment that it's imposed - that I'm imprisoned in it rather than that I'm choosing it. You know, even though it's the same thing, even if it's the same lifestyle, you know, I just - (inaudible at 0:29:28.6) this feeling of just total - of just having things beyond my control.</p>

<p>0:29:34.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really sense that what you're saying is that it's not like only marking time, but just the way you are climbing pulls your foot up, you know, kind of as you (inaudible at 0:29:49.0) puts it down. The step you're taking marking time is all controlled from without. You feel like you have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah, I really do feel that way. I know - the problem is just what to do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you like to do about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I really don't know, you know, like I said that I am being able to get - find those other possibilities, you know, to make decisions about staying here and everything, you know, that's kind of the first step. But as far as, you know, finding this ultimately meaningful thing, you know, I can start advertising newspapers, you know. And I would see that as a satisfactory solution. You know, I don't see any solution. So, I know I have to find, you know, this really - you know, this kind of inner meaning that will stand up under anything, that will, as a result of it, you know, of a kind of personal integrity within being the kind of person that somebody else could respond to.</p>

<p>But as it is, it's the vulnerability that people talk about, you know, there's really kind of a lack of definition and a weakness and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a second. I'd like you to say more about that. You feel like it's because you're so vulnerable that you can't really respond to people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it comes from weakness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe in a way, but in a healthy way it means I don't respond. It means that I just kind of - I suppose in a way I kind of bower and scrape, you know. Like, I'd like to just be a much more independent person. You know, that is after all the only kind of person that can really offer another person something, you know, is by having your own kind of real integrity. I don't mean integrity (inaudible at 0:31:42.3) honesty, but in terms of an integrated kind of wholeness where you kind of know where you're at, you know.</p>

<p>0:31:51.3</p>

<p>I really - I've just come to the conclusion that the kind of women who can relate to men in terms of a permanent relationship are the women who don't totally love the man. You know, they don't drown themselves and, you know, I really don't know that it's a weakness or something to throw yourself totally into a relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that's really a very confusing thing for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you don't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I - you know, I just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like doing what - what - in a way, I mean, what's the right way to be in a relationship and how should you be in a relationship?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, because, like, I know that for myself, you know, I really, really loved somebody but I know that at the same time, by loving somebody that much, it was really an imposition on him. And so maybe that wasn't real love, you know, and that really confuses me because I know what I felt was just this total kind of devotion. And at the same time, I'm just not sure that that's a really mature kind of love. I mean, that's a childlike dependence. I don't know. You know, it was a really beautiful feeling to me, but, you know, is that really an adult feeling and is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:33:09.6), I mean, I'm not talking about giving the context of the situation. But it's - (inaudible at 0:33:15.3), well, is that the right way to feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And I don't know - you know, I think that the right way to love, at least in terms of, you know, the 1970s and given what relationships are now and everything, you know, the whole thing about personal freedom, but that isn't the right way to love at all. That I should be a really very independent, self-assertive and self-sufficient person, and that, you know, that the relationship is like secondary thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I really kind of sense (inaudible at 0:33:51.6), maybe that's the right way for the 1970s, but I just kind of sense that (inaudible at 0:33:56.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:33:56.8) not right for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I would have been fine in the 1870s, a little Victorian woman who just gave her whole life to managing the household and making the family happy. That would have been perfect for me, but I don't live then, you know, I live right now. I really don't know how to change myself to conform to my expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe you shouldn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but if I don't then the alternative is to be miserable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:34:26.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, from all the evidence that I see around me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:34:33.4) like in a - can say well, I have a - this and that of experience, and that experience tells me that I have to change the way I'm going to be with a man if I want to be happy and ever have a man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not sure I would really be happy in that, you know. I'm constantly holding myself back from giving too much that would be a real strain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't - I mean, I guess I have the sense as you were talking about the way it felt like to really love this person, this guy, that felt like what love's all about for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really did. And, you know, like I said, people who saw me could see I was really at my best. You know, I was really - the whole - you know, that's what kills me because I'm really the most kind of whole person I am, you know, I'm, you know, that involved with somebody else. So it's not like I'm really giving up my ego. It's that I'm really building it up.</p>

<p>0:35:33.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like, through that, it's not like you're throwing yourself away, it's like being able to feel that kind of love makes you really feel solid and full inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really does. And also, you know, it comes out in being a much more active person, in dealing, you know, in a secure way with all kinds of people. Like, during that time, during those three months, I have - you know, I made so many friends, I developed so many interests. You know, and it was such a battle when the whole thing ended. You know, I felt like laughing at it because that had been - it had been the outcome of that. It was a real battle to try to keep those things in mind (ph) and hang on to them as something really valuable, and something really me, you know. And I just - you know, the whole thing seemed like such a wretched joke, that all the outcome of it seemed like the same kind of joke.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I just - you know, I really had trouble kind of keeping, you know, a very positive attitude about myself...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the kind of - I don't understand that "wretched joke" business. Is that because (inaudible at 0:36:41.3) were being full and more alive really yourself and (inaudible at 0:36:48.3), you (inaudible at 0:36:49.4) that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and also - yeah, like I - I don't know, it seemed like a kind of mocking situation. Like, this guy was watching me change and give, you know, give whatever I could and thinking, you know, wow. Well, I know he felt very badly that he couldn't respond. So I know it wasn't a total joke, you know, I'm sure it was, you know, a very difficult situation for him too. And I don't think he probably was sitting back thinking what a fool. I think he did for a while, and that was when I became, like you said, totally (inaudible at 0:37:23.5) about what a fool that I was.</p>

<p>0:37:26.5</p>

<p>But I'm sure he probably - but I thought what a fool I was the whole way through, you know, looking back on the whole thing. And then it just kind of negated everything that happened to me, you know, and all the positive things became like this kind of mockery. You know, that it was all foolishness, all - so I got kind of bitter (inaudible at 0:37:46.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's what I'm really - (inaudible at 0:37:49.3) hearing a bitterness, like if I love them that I get - I'm a fool to love that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. (Inaudible at 0:38:03.4), yeah, like, you know, if I were a really strong person, you know, like I want to be, I probably would hang on to that ideal and just - and really try to believe in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:38:16.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I - you know, but then - but looking, you know, it's just - it's such a contradictory kind of thing because, you know, I just don't think that there's any person around who really wants that kind of thing, you know. Maybe they did in the 19th Century but they just don't anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a pretty strong statement.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, that's just what it seems to be like. Nobody wants the kind of responsibility that, you know, is - you know, hinges on somebody who's that devoted, you know, and that tied up in the relationship. They're really scared of it. And that's just kind of like a whole ethic now. People are really terrified of commitment, just terrified, you know, both men and women and I'm not. And I really wonder about it. I think I'm being really na�ve.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you being na�ve?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, to believe - you know, like I really ultimately believe in marriage. And that's pretty strange too considering the kind of thing that my parents have gone through. And the kind of marriage problems all over the place, all around, you know. And I just somehow really, really believe that it can work out, you know, if people kind of give it a chance. And, you know, everybody else, you know, when I say that they look at me like I'm crazy to be that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you're crazy at all, but I know that doesn't mean very much to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, it probably does.</p>

<p>0:39:59.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand what you're saying about the times, you know, but it's like - you see, I mean I guess what I'm saying to you is, you know, your experience is limited, it's important to remember that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, I know, that is true. Like, I was thinking last night that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, from what you said, you know, it didn't sound like you had an incredible number of relationships.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just didn't, especially in these times.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess. For me, you know, the experiences I've had are very telling, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're telling because they're the only ones you've had.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I guess I really don't believe I'd going to be having anymore. So I better just go on the available evidence. But, you know, I know that it's limited and I know that, like - it just suddenly hit me last night. I was thinking when I was 22 that seems like decades and decades and decades ago. That's only three years and it really seems like ages. And I hadn't really taken account of all the things that had happened. And, you know, how I reacted and changed, and that's a really positive thing, you know. I think the thing that was frightening me the most, and that just sent me into the worst depression was I felt like I was regressing, like I was losing everything I might have gained out of that time. Like, that period of my life was becoming, you know - was meaningless because I couldn't make it meaningful. It was, like, a totally negative thing that I was going right back to what I've been before, which I really disliked.</p>

<p>And - but then - and when I think about the change I made between 18 and 22, it's like, you know, a tenth of one percent compared to the change I made in three years after that. So I know that - that really - I hadn't even thought about that really until last night. But I guess I feel like I've come to this kind of dead end right now. Like, there's really nowhere to go now at 25. And I don't know quite where the alternatives are, you know, I was thinking for a while going back to Bulgaria, you know, and just kind of living this mystical, solitary existence until I pulled myself together. I'm not even sure that's really that bad an idea because I...</p>

<p>0:42:25.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pull yourself together what, so you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just totally in my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean so that you could be the kind of person who won't want so much out of a relationship, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe that's one goal. But I mean, creating a strong enough thing in myself that I won't need that deep a relationship. You know, where I can really exist pretty much on my own, which is - you know, that's all part of being kind of existential man. And you know that you are kind of (inaudible at 0:42:54.6), you know, that nobody else can ever really get into and that you - you know, this whole thing about Nietzsche that eternal change, you know, is ultimately a negative thing. That you have to be, you know, such and no other, you have to be something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know I change all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of like you're saying that maybe I should (inaudible at 0:43:23.7), just, and no one can get - really get into me anyway. That's what some of those (inaudible at 0:43:31.6) would say, but that's not what all of them say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe they can get into me...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not everyone has a cynical view as Nietzsche.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think he's a very affirmative person, I really do. I think, you know, by saying it takes a lot of guts to just - to be somebody instead of to constantly wait to change and become perfected, you know. That's really a pretty ridiculous goal. And then if you say, this is what I am - you know, I think that's a really funny thing at the same time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I hear you saying, "This is what I am. I know that what's most meaningful for me..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:44:13.3) is to really be totally involved in a relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I know when I'm totally involved in a relationship, I mean, I know how I feel inside. I feel incredibly alive and (inaudible at 0:44:26.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>0:44:27.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ecstatic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yeah, that's the way I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe that's you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you want to - but I guess you're saying, that shouldn't be me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It shouldn't be because, you know, given the conditions that I have to live with right now, it's a destructive thing. You know, it's perhaps a very unsophisticated thing to be, you know. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you do mean unsophisticated?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's very kind of childlike thing to be that idealistic about love.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds very limited to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there aren't that many people I know who really are - I mean, they build up their defenses, they are protected. And their self protection was a good thing, it's a very functional thing, they get along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I kind of really see, like, you know, you really feel like you're at a choice point. I mean, you're saying, well, maybe I should but it's not an easy choice for me. Because you're saying, like, maybe I should be able to be more like them, more self protected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Build up my defenses (inaudible at 0:45:36.3), and I know that that's not me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah, I know. I just - I don't know how to live - you know, when there's no way to express what is most me, then you just, you know - I don't know how to sublimate is maybe what it comes down to. I can't find anything that really - now, the closest thing I can think of is to be involved, like, in a really close teaching situation to be really involved with those kids as people. And, you know, I think that could be - it's maybe ultimately much more than a single relationship could be. You know, in the end it's probably something more tangible you would hang on to.</p>

<p>0:46:21.4</p>

<p>But I know that the most expressive way I am is just - you know, as one close person. And, you know, it's just a matter of finding alternatives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A matter of finding alternatives because I don't have it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't really have a choice except to find alternatives. And also, you know, the positive thing, you know, like, Ronald (inaudible at 0:46:50.8) says, that there's a real difference between an absence of relationships and every relationship as an absence. And I know I'm really into the past - you know, every relationship is an absence thing right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is - you know, there's just no way to live with it. It's a very unrealistic way to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's kind of like just not taking what you can have (inaudible at 0:47:11.5) meaningful. I mean, defense (ph) can be meaningful. It may not kind of like - they may not be the ideal but they're not nothing (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's exactly it. And it's certainly not fair to people who really do care about me the way they can obviously, for me to negate that caring and to deny it, which is what I did that really, really hurt this one roommate I had. I have - things are definitely patched up now, it's okay. But I told her at one point that I knew that, you know, that my girlfriends are going to get married and wander off and build their own lives and that men friends I have get more interested in the people, this is, you know, something that happens. And she - you know, it just hurt her to the core because she thought I really didn't trust her at all, but I was just denying the best kind of friendship she could give, you know. And I know it was a terribly selfish thing for me to do. I just - it was totally me at the time, though. I wasn't trying to be selfish, I had even no awareness that that was a selfish thing.</p>

<p>I was really - what I was trying to do was say, look at, you have your freedom you owe me nothing. And I've really been trying to do that with everybody now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your reasons are not selfish, though, (inaudible at 0:48:30.3) they appeared.</p>

<p>0:48:31.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, what you're saying is, you're trying to do that with everyone, I guess you were saying that. It feels like a nice thing to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To tell people they owe me nothing, it doesn't feel good to me, but in a sense, it feels like it's kind of a noble thing or just, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I guess they owe you nothing, and I guess part of that is maybe why you would say this because you're not sure what they give you really means that much to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if that's really it or not. I feel like I have no right to make demands. That was pounded into me by this person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you have no right to make demands?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess because I just don't believe there's anything I have to offer. And therefore, what conceivable right do I have to expect anything from anybody else? That's what I had to live with for six - well, yeah, six months. I'm still processing that, you know. And I know that what it did to this guy - you know, I know that obligation he felt he owed me because I had put so much of myself into the relationship. And he knew it was going to kill me. And he was trying to make it easier just by kind of, you know, slowly letting the thing...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt that was patronizing, and I felt like the strongest way I could be was to not allow people to have - feel that they have to be patronized sometime. And this other guy telling me that, you know, that it's a real imposition to care more for a person than that person can care back because then what do they do? They can't - you know, they can't create a caring thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and it probably makes them want to run away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, yeah, he wasn't talking about the result of it, but still, just the fact.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:50:26.4) come - you say, well, I have nothing to give. And I guess with this guy you felt like you had nothing to give to (inaudible at 0:50:38.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the end I felt like I obviously hadn't because he - you know, it was not something he could really respond to, you know. And I think I was kind of really - I think I was giving totally inside. But I was aware of the limitations from the very beginning, you know. And where - even at the point where I had become totally committed, I was still kind of unconsciously playing this role and this game of it being a casual relationship, and not even being aware of the dichotomy, you know, of kind of external behavior and internal behavior.</p>

<p>0:51:11.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, you mean you were acting outwardly like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty cool about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:51:15.3) you know, external.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like I never told him I loved him until after the whole thing was over, you know. And I guess to me it had become internalized as kind of understanding. But to him, he probably thought he was pretty safe because nothing had ever been declared. And then all of a sudden when - you know, when the whole thing just broke, and when he became aware of how totally involved I was, he couldn't handle it at all. He just completely, you know - just completely blew his mind. And so, you know, in that sense, you know, I hadn't really had - I hadn't really made any commitments from his point of view.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So the giving thing was just kind of implicit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think he just took it as being a giving within a casual framework, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but, you know, like I guess - I mean, what I would infer from that or what I hear is that, you know, like you're saying you don't have anything to give. What right do I have to make a demand? But yet, I'm hearing that you say, you know, you do feel like you have a lot of love in you to give.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do, but at the same time, I think, you know, I can't kid myself because people don't want it, that must not really be the kind of adequate really thing, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a very meaningful thing (ph) to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's...</p>

<p>0:52:54.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just not something people really want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sense you really don't know. That's what you think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, pretty soon the thing - the difference between what I think and what I know and believe just - it just gets so vague because I try to convince myself so much of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's what I mean, the last two times I've been hearing you kind of do. It sounds like you're trying to sell yourself a bill of goods instead (ph) what I want out of life, what I want from a relationship is not the right thing. The love I have to give inside to someone people don't want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I shouldn't want to give it.</p>

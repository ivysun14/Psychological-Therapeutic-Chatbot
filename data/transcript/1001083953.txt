<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think that's why it was so important for me to find a doctor to begin with.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was because people I talk to, they don't know how to express their, or tell me what it is to begin with. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, when I come to you, like with the daylight savings time. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I watched the View Friday. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't understand that was a clinical thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because [NAME OTHER] has it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she said she has a home in [DEIDENTIFIED] just for that reason.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I always thought it was just me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I just liked it more than other things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because if it gets gloomy and rains for like two or three days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's like I wanna hide away in my room.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to be around people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And since my mother has Alzheimer's,</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a little hard for me to do things like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, sunlight sometimes means something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And just like [NAME OTHER] said, you [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED] and there's more sunlight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> More days of the year, unlike here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then of course that's why it's called affective seasonal. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seasonal, yeah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Affective disorder, it's a seasonal depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And uh, did she say anything more as to, is it more common in men or women or anything like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it is in women.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, women, it is more common in women.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And because sometimes you know, they, in women becomes more serious.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> During their menstrual cycle. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And because the sun's...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm also post menopausal. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I think that has something to do with it too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That, yeah, and not only, you know, having active periods you know the hormonal change.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's like a, you know, the periods, post menopausal you know, time and all that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have something in common, is hormonal change. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and so since you saw that and you know, looking at the life situations so far that what did you think or what did you learn from all that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that I try to hide too many things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I always try to be the one, I've been, see my mothers left us when we were little.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my father took care of us.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, the, everyone says like good job I'm doing taking care of my mother that has Alzheimer's.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you don't understand, I keep saying to myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I gotta tell everybody else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My mother married a man with three kids.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was five years old. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My sister four, my brother three.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I mean, look at what she did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That when you look at what she did, what I'm doing is nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You don't understand it's nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The person that you refer to as mother, not your biological mother, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is the mother that you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Raised me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly, because the other one is just foreign. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I have nothing bad to say about her, I just don't know her to say.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anything good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm, yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I mean and when you're young and everything I'm not judging anyone</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, that's just the way it is. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and of course, that's how life situations are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That you know-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just so happy I am. I just know she was meant to be my mother. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, yes, and you know, she fulfilled the role of the mother, she took good care of you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And now you know, you feel that uh obligation to return that favor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just like things I do are nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Compared to what she did,</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean just nothing, and when people just they praise without knowing and I feel so bad because I keep thinking you have no idea. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm doing nothing compared to what she's done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What, yeah, because you know, she, she raised all three of you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel like no one wanted us but my dad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then she just gave us a whole life and family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm, yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So,</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, and the, the so called mother that you did not have, she was able to... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just made a whole family group.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, when it came to schooling and everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and I'm sure that you know, if she was uh in uh, right frame of mind. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because she never worked, she always held the PTA.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She said I'm here and not there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because my children need me the most when they come home from school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And with their homework and that...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't need to be running out...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Every place else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I thought, oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It felt good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I think if she was not, did not have the Alzheimer's she would have been able to say thank you for the, what you are doing, you know. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes she does, she doesn't know who I am...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, she keeps saying I like you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I keep going boy, that's...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I'm [INAUDIBLE] there, most people don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah because you know the [INAUDIBLE], you know one of the few things about Alzheimer's is that they get very paranoid with it, delusional uh, you know, and... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See, she went through a real rough part of being...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Real mean and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Trying to run away and everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that was short term.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right now she's really going down hill, but she is so pleasant...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And nice and I'm going, thank you God, thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because she's just as pleasant as she could be and she goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] right across the street.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And down the street a little bit...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they said she's just as pleasant as she can be over there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And physically she is falling apart.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Isn't life just...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sign. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, before you can become guardian.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She was climbing up second stories. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To get in the house and she locked herself out of that every single day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they said there's not anything we can do about it...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To the point, I was crying and I'd ask police officers and everyone, you're telling me my mother can kill herself before you can help me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they said, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You've got to be kidding me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they said no. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pass the buck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah that...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because the HIPAA act was so strong, </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No one could break it, 'til I had two doctors sign.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That she was incapable </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of doing anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you, you have no idea...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What she was doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah because you know the, when you know because the doctors have to declare her incompetent. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I almost went crazy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I well, actually, I wound up in the hospital... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With pneumonia. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then I got MRSA. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn't talk...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I had been so upset that I got so run down. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I almost died twice in there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my family they, if you don't believe prayer works, </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then you just have no faith.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because there was six doctors, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is the head of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They all shook their head because twice I should've died, </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twice my family was praying in the church...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And by the side of my bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And twice I didn't die. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they all just shrugged their shoulders because they said... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Medically there's no reason why you didn't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So how you came out of that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well and I think you know, something that you know, there was still some purpose that you had to fulfill.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See? Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why I believe whole heartedly.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why I believe I was here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To take care of my mother.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And there's no one else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, otherwise, how are things going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Real good, real good, with the time change, uh, remember when I'd come in here and tell you how tired I was?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I realize it was that seasonal thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I've been so like happy with things from the weekend-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And after seeing that show I thought...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My God, once you realize what something is it's so much easier to take.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah and you know, the mere factor of winter, you know, when people are</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You said there's a light or a lamp or.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Something you can buy it, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been gloomy too long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I was going to look into that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah there is a light actually it's a bright light.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bright light?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, which will be about fifty times brighter than all the light bulbs that you know combine in this room. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what it does it basically it will simulate the amount of sunlight. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sunlight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That you will be getting or something similar to that. Okay, and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I was counting the, I always have to have a lot of light, I was counting the lamps I have just in my living room.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have five.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was counting them in my dining room I have four plus.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh a lamp, a stand with lights on it</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I went I do have to have a lot of light.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah and this is a lot brighter.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, that's what they were saying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and so that in some people that works very well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mmm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's another device that you know also has been used it the uh two small magnets and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and you know, you, the, made to fit the temple.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, you can wear it, maybe a cap or something like that, that you know magnets on, some people uh respond to the magnetic field. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some people respond to the light. And because you know the, some people need light or all the magnets and the medication. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And a few people you know do very well with the medication only. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See, I, I was gonna say, that's what she was saying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She said she kept saying oh I'm not depressed, I'm not...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Depressed and I thought why was I so upset over saying that I'm not depressed. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mm-hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was like you're ashamed to admit things. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like that's a weakness that you don't want to admit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

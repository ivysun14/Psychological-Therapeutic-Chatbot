<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wondered if it would be possible to come earlier on Friday, tomorrow.  Just tomorrow.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm afraid not tomorrow.  You have something that would interfere?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, well, my grandmother died last night so we'll be going up and we can leave, you know, any time that I'm free, but it probably would simplify things.  Doesn't, you know, exactly have to be that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you could make it a good deal earlier, you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well, I have to still you know, have my day at school and 2 o'clock I guess would be good.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Let me think about it just a second.  No, I was thinking of, you know, uh, yes, I could make it at 2 tomorrow, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 2 o'clock?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Uhum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine.  One thing that surprised me very much when I spoke to my mother, this was her mother who died, was that she, I don't know whether she actually had been crying, but she sound—, her voice sounded very husky.  I knew immediately what it was before she said anything because of the tone in her voice and the quality of it and this surprised me because she's always had such a matter of fact attitude toward death and especially people who are old.  And also so often she just seemed so impatient with her own mother and what she did with her seemed more because of her sense of duty and the fact that she was the oldest of the children and was the one nearest to my grandmother therefore it became her duty to care for my grandmother so I never was even sure how much she was actually fond of her.  (6-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, all day I've been able to stop thinking about her when I've willed it and now I don't really want to think about it and I can't stop.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Ah, but you're keeping it to yourself?  Are the things you're thinking you don't, you'd rather not say, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I don't know.  I was just thinking about why it was that I feel very upset because for so many years she's hardly been a part of my life.  And I knew she was sick and that as much as a person can be ready to die, she was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you also said she was in some ways very important to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I was trying to clarify what further picture I had in my mind when I would think of her with sort of a feeling of emotion and near tears and because sometimes I can think about the fact that she's dead now without feeling that way.  And the closest I could come to, to what it is that makes me feel most upset is when I think of — I can't say it.  (6-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny about my feeling that I can't cry here.  Because I was (clears throat) thinking it's probably part of the training I have that you just don't show emotion to other people and I just realized that even though right through high school I used to cry a lot alone in my own room, I very rarely would let my parents know that I was.  And I know I've sometimes used tears with e but I feel funny even then.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you worry what I will think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.  I just can't, I suppose I do.  I just feel sort of ridiculous lying here crying, and somehow I just, I just don't want to button myself.  (Pause) And I know the few times that anybody has been around other than e when I have cried I don't think of anything in particular except I know it would have been girl friends of mine and they were trying to help me.  I always felt very embarrassed and I just have never liked being in anybody's presence.  (Pause) And I was just thinking, it seems like when I am alone I either will start to cry and will quickly control it or else I'll let myself cry and if I let myself cry it's because I'm sort of venting a frustration or a rage and that, that's the way I get it out of me.  But then any real sorrow that makes me come to tears I can stop myself.  (Pause) But I don't think it's really sorrow either that made me feel tears when I was thinking about the image of my grandmother because sometimes when I've been here I've almost felt like I could start crying and I don't really know exactly what I was thinking about, but it would have been something to do with my family, connected with feelings of love I had or lack of feeling of love, but so then it wouldn't have been sorrow that made me feel like crying.  It would be something else.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What image did you have of your grandmother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What image?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was just her, how she would be welcoming me.  (Pause) It just makes me start all over again.  (Controls tears; 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I have the idea that you must be afraid that if you do let yourself cry here you'll really lose control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Control of me?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Temporarily I would, I'm sure of that.  (Silence) For some reason that my thoughts somehow got to thinking of the time when well, I can't remember how old I was but I was questioning life after death and wha—, how could you know there was a god and all the things that children would wonder and I don't even remember what my mother said to me in response to my questions but I, but, simpl—, it seemed to me that she, what she was saying is there is a god and that's the proof there is a god and uhm, I don't know somehow it just seemed like her arguments were going in a circle, going nowhere and I was just so frustrated and it was, the whole thing was something I so badly wanted to grasp or have some sense of and her answers just seemed to cut me off and after that I just though a great deal about death and that's when I first, am aware that I was thinking a lot about death and after that I just never had any real feeling for religion or the church that we were sent to or any part of it.  (Pause) And I've just really in a way had faith in nothing, except maybe my grandmother.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And something I've had a very strong reaction to and again I don't know whether it's because I'm concentrating a lot of different emotions into one thing that I can focus them all into.  But my grandmother had, her younger son I think was always her favorite and he, he lives in the mid west and had seen her earlier in the summer before she'd her stroke.  And then afterwards I think just about a month ago he came back to go to a wedding of a niece of his in PNG, PNG, and he didn't come up to see my grandmother then and it might have been that it was very inconvenient for him to, but it was quite obvious that she wasn't going to live very long and I don't know, I somehow think that if he'd had any real feeling he would've come up.  I just can't understand his not coming up.  And I know that there had been indications that she would be seeing him some time in the fall and I think she must have been extremely disappointed when he didn't come even though her other son came, and his, he other son was the one whose daughter was getting married.  And somehow it just makes me feel very upset for my grandmother and very mad at my uncle for not coming, and I just don't understand it anyway.  Except that in a way my grandmother would be sort of stoical about the fact he didn't come and maybe just the fact she could be this way made my uncle even more unfeeling than my mother because my, that uncle and my mother are both quite similar I think in many ways.  Because I know at times I question whether my mother has any feeling at all, when probably she does, but just isn't showing it.  Because there was some talk at first but maybe the actual service for my grandmother wouldn't be for 2 weeks and e was saying well, we'll go up anyway this weekend no matter what it is and I just didn't know whether or not it would mean anything to my mother if we came up.  I think it probably would mean a great deal to her but sometimes I'm not at all sure whether, what she says is what she actually is feeling.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny I was thinking back on this idea of my not wanting to be out of control and I know that's true for crying but it's really true about everything even to the things I was talking about yesterday and not wanting to have intercourse with e unless in a way, I'm in control of it.  (Pause) And it just makes me think again of the fact that my father used to well, he used to call me a bitch a lot of the times for things that I didn't realize I was even doing, but it must have been again another aspect of feeling I had to control things.  And he would say, if we were deciding on a route to go or just anything, I never was aware that I was saying anything more than my opinion like anybody else was but he'd always get furious at me and say I always wanted to have control when, so I must have had an attitude or a tone or something that I wasn't even aware of that well, that certainly enraged him partly because I think because he, I thought it was disrespectful whatever it was that I was doing.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Now that I feel more in control I feel my mind is also going sort of blank.  Because I was thinking now that I'm more in control I can think about my grandmother again and then thoughts won't come anymore.  (2 And ½-minute silence)</p>

<p>Something else I do too that my grandmother is the first person to die of anybody that was, really meant something to me.  But uhm, with a cat I was close to once (chuckle) I did the same thing and that is that once you're used to being away from them it doesn't really sink in that they're dead when you first hear it because what you, what images you have are of them alive and it's what you've been carrying with you all along and so it just doesn't seem to suddenly close off and I know sometimes a, a thought will quickly pass through my mind, well they're dead now and you've go to make yourself realize they're dead and right now you have to make yourself realize.  And so think about them and start missing them and I keep thinking well how can you make yourself realize they're dead and yet on the other hand my mind keeps telling me I have to.  And then I st—, probably start getting more of the pictures in my mind trying to see them dead.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  When you said those things to yourself, as though you were talking to yourself, now think about them, you sounded harsh to yourself, as though you were admonishing yourself.  Like now think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I suppose in a way I would be because of something that I just, how does one do it and so, and I would —.  (Pause) I mean it's like putting yourself through a sort of a morbid torture or something and I don't know why I feel the need to, but even, even when both of both this cat and my grandmother were alive, every time I would leave, especially when I went to PEC, the thing that I made myself keep thinking over and over and which upset me the most about going to PEC was the fact that either one of them could die before I came back.  And then once I was back I in a way stopped thinking that way about my grandmother, although occasionally I still would.  But every time I saw this cat of mine and then left again I would make myself go through the whole process again and if I didn't make myself go through it, I f—, had a funny feeling of guilt or something as if I didn't really care about it after all.  And it's almost like if I really cared about my grandmother then I should be missing her every single minute and last night after I heard, I know I felt kind of guilty that then I could eat supper and things like that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's almost like I'm trying to let myself experience something or feel something or know something by feeling it rather than just knowing it because the idea is in my mind.  (Pause) And even carrying this thing further when the cat we have now had kittens, uhm and I had to give, I gave everyone away except for one, I did it in the slowest manner possible, just torturing myself.  Every one of them I had to go be in anguish over parting with them, there were a few I had become particularly fond of and so the days they went I would just sit there and make myself think of how they had been and bring back pictures in my mind of them playing and little things I had found so attractive and I just wouldn't let my mind get off it.  And I didn't make any attempt to distract myself by doing something else.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and then there is something to it, I was just thinking of a friend I had at camp one summer and again knowing that after the summer was over we probably wouldn't see much of each other again and we would certainly never have the close kind of friendship that we had had that summer because in a, many ways, she was entirely different person and yet I thought that and I just didn't want that to happen.  It just somehow seemed so cold and and feeling to have somebody be such a close friend for a while and then just slowly get used to the person not being around, not missing them and things, so I tried to make myself miss them and keep feeling something.  Then it almost seemed like there'd been no meaning to it at all if you couldn't retain it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: This is Interview Number 18; this is the 18th Interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know anything about cats? I know this is strange but I'm really upset by a kitten who insists on not pissing in the box. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't know anything about cats... </p>

<p>CLIENT: They just piss on expensive... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...except that I know that it's bad when they start pissing somewhere because [one of them pissed on that] (ph)... [overlapping voices at 0:00:28.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, not at all... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible] ...is much better about that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...he goes anywhere... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...he goes on newspapers, see if newspapers are on the floor and we stopped keeping newspapers on the floor so he goes on brown paper bags, so we stopped keeping brown paper bags and now he's discovered that the comforter (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you need to, yeah, I don't think you need a cat who will... [inaudible at 0:00:45.8] ...I think you need to go to somebody who knows more about behavior modification, and it seems to me... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [You mean, I know.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...like what you did was probably take away like the newspapers too fast without substituting something else at the same... </p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...time and you just need to figure out a way to successively change the thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's an idea, I hadn't thought of that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So probably some of these things (ph) [that you've can get a little bit of course of in college.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I took it too and... [overlapping voices at 0:01:08.5] (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you did... [inaudible] You get the point, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I get the point too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know when they change the light from red to green and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if you do it slowly enough you can keep the thing packing (ph) to it even though it's completely different... [overlapping voices at 0:01:19.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that only works when he's just, that plainly he's got one, the ritual pattern, but he's got five rooms so we've stopped it... [overlapping voices] ...somewhere on the floor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now though, but if you put back newspapers he'd probably piss on newspapers all the time and so... [overlapping voices at 0:01:31.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, but if I start keeping my newspapers on the floor in the bathroom... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I think he might see how it works. Yeah, I hope so because their, [then the odor is stinky and he pisses on a lot of stuff] (ph)... [inaudible at 0:01:44.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been really discouraged this whole week but I just have not gotten myself together to do anything and I finally finished the dress I'm wearing... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just drawing to a zero, I refuse to get up in the morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Refuse, what do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I just don't, like it took me about an hour to get up this morning because I ended up having to take the cat to... [inaudible at 0:02:09.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I kind of, I hear the alarm and I get up, I turn it off and I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you say to yourself then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I say to myself, "Oh, this is too early." (chuckling) And I turn the alarm and... [overlapping voices at 0:02:23.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just "this is too early", not anything about why it's too early or... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I can get, I can get a little sleep before and still get to wherever I have to go or I really don't have to do what I had planned to do, I can go back to bed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On days that I really wasn't that sleepy I kept on falling into this dead sleep that, that kind of gave me a headache but I just didn't want to get up and I didn't feel like it at all, (chuckling) I didn't feel like it at all yesterday either. And I just, I've had all this extra time because Murphy's been working and, uh, I just haven't done anything! I don't - I read the entire issue of Harper's Magazine (chuckling) but it's like that's all I did; I sat from ten o'clock until two in the morning and I read Harper's Magazine, I just completely wasted my time. (chuckling) Um, I have all these things I would like to get done and I'm just not doing them, I'm not even doing the dishes anymore, I'm just letting them kind of pile up in the sink as I'm sitting around feeling really very useless, and I'm very upset with myself for doing that. [0:03:22.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you said there all kinds of things you wanted to do but you find it isn't true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I've got about three dresses that I want to sew and I've got two or three articles I'd like to get out for him (ph). What I'd like to do is to give myself just some reason my... [inaudible at 0:03:35.6] ...and say forget that I have it at all... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and get started I mean again. But I, I'm much better when Murphy's around because then I have, I can usually be balanced off Murphy's, some way to pick up some energy from him instead of just being alone and by myself, I just don't do anything, I kind of wait for him to come home, which really [having those times of absolutely crying.] (ph) (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you cry in front of him though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I'm disappointed by myself, I mean and the only difference is that...I really wish I knew why... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I think it's really stupid...kind of waiting for somebody else to step in and give me some sort of motive or some clue or shape... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to what I'm doing and that's ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that going to give you; I mean if you're conflicted in your kind of feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, well usually some sort of a... [inaudible at 0:04:35.7] ...of sorts, I mean there's something to do, somebody else who is there and that's what I'm dealing with or I'm completely fucking off. Um... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you're not telling yourself, "Yes, you have to get up that's bullshit." and he'll tell you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I mean he'll say, "Didn't you want to do such and such today?" You know I should've of yesterday and I say, "Yeah." And I start doing it instead of sitting around and doing nothing, sometimes, and, but I mean I feel worse about sitting around and doing nothing, completely wasting my time, so I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [overlapping voices at 0:05:09.5]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, usually because if Paul has something to do he gets it done, I mean he goes and he types out whatever he has to do with something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see like he if prepares and then you're a wreck at that thing, this kind of thing? You mean it's embarrassing to be around someone who can do it and not be doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he's a pretty good procrastinator too (chuckling) but I mean I'm just, I've just been, I kind of put myself outside of my own head and say... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."This is, this is stupid, I mean this is not a worthy caricature..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "...this is just self indulgence, why don't you get off your ass?" (chuckling) And if, and if there's somebody there who kind of reinforces my feeling that it's self indulgence, but it's more my projection than anything else; I see it as self indulgence and I expect him to see that it's self indulgent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm a little embarrassed about it you know... [overlapping voices at 0:05:52.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See that's kind of effective if you think it's for him and if you don't think it's really there then in a sense it's from yourself, if you're saying the words then to yourself anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, um, basically because I've lived with myself for 20 years and I know that suddenly I'm [paper blank] (ph) and then... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you trick yourself into thinking that you mean... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then you believe it and you don't believe it when it comes from yourself, when those judgments come from yourself, like this is self indulgence or you shouldn't be offended (ph) [if you don't see me.] [0:06:28.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'd be like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can kind of shove you off to the side really easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Well, so what are you asking, for a solution or for knowing why this happens or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I'd like basically is, is to stop doing it and (chuckling)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, get some... [inaudible at 0:06:57.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And...like I'm usually [go and could be the newspaper in the bedroom...] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...okay and the cat can piss on me in the floor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I guess I'm having to try and put... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, wait, I want to tell you something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to think about it Jessie, because one thing is that I can think of some specific things... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you might be able to train yourself to do that would help. But I also have been thinking about you that, that there's a more general issue about you getting things done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See I'm beginning to think (chuckling) what's happening is this is yet another kind of trick mechanism inside my own head. I can set up all these things that I "want to do" or I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I really feel I should do but the ones that really get done are the ones that I really want to do deep down, down in my gut.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not really true that you want to do all those things... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you have on your list?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when there's something that is... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why, what is it you felt then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think because well, I mean if it doesn't really have to be done... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's much better to have a plan but if you never do them it really doesn't... [overlapping voices at 0:08:09.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well though these have to be done and there's no way around that paper, sometime in the next two years or three years or four years, depending on when I decide to graduate, that paper has got to be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think well now it's your fault that now... [overlapping voices at 0:08:21.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]...it's not on your list for four years from now, so... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you're saying that you aren't going to honor that [if it's not really an experience,] (ph) right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (big sigh) Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why have it on the list... [overlapping voices at 0:08:31.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I am I mean I know I am eventually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't going to honor it on the list for now? [silence from 0:08:36.3 to 0:08:50.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why would it be nice? That's the other, the main question that I have is, well that that paper is indicative or it isn't, do you want to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to do the paper but I do want to have the knowledge for [a way,] (ph) I mean like they're really hanging over my head at this point, but I have no desire at this point to sit down and do them... [overlapping voices at 0:09:13.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think if anything you want the intrinsic process of doing it because everyone believes that we shoot after these goals... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and for them. [inaudible]... (both chuckling) But I think it's only an intrinsic problem and that you're okay now with it but I'm not sure you want the outcome. Do you know why? [0:09:34.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't have any friends, I mean that are taking, I mean I'm really frightened to turn out a shitty paper, I'm really afraid I will... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...without a doubt turn out (chuckling) a shitty paper, yeah, I guess so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you'll do it...now that that outcome?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like an unavoidable thought that is the act of doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which leads me to think that the thing to think about is that I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think you're going to do a paper that you think is shitty... </p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and it won't, won't agree with you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[when you're finished doing it?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean and then what will happen, what are the particulars of that, I mean [if that happened?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would feel badly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm counting on this paper kind of academically. Um... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Meaning I really need a good grade, because I only took three courses in a quarter, one of them I'm going to get just a C and one of them is another incomplete. (chuckling) And so, also that's just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's a way to now say - you shouldn't be saying you're counting on it, you should be saying that you wish... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that it would be good... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if you really think that it's that kind of... </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's, it's the field that I kind of want to make my undergraduate specialty in a long, I mean...I'd like to concentrate on it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and doing experiments coming completely out of the course material... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and, um, it would be really embarrassing...just trying to get into a graduate school, kind of having the production is my big thing and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...[if I hadn't gotten a really crappy mark in this course so therefore I can actually do something.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. So I guess you're saying that it's that getting back [or it won't pay me back to do, is when you can't think to do and feeling like you can't?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [silence from 0:11:49.7 to 0:11:59.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean what would that mean, I mean do you have any sense of, that you could do anything else or would that be the - that would be really serious I know because we've talked about it many times?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it would be... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:12:11.0]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean it would really be very serious. Um, I don't know what I'm going to do, I mean I really don't, I can keep on trying to go in the same field, like I really want a career in that field. It's that it's, (big sigh) it's all based around a basic feeling that I'm not too bright, I mean yeah, I'm bright but I'm not terribly bright and I'm not terrifically (ph), and my various mental advantages call for being a perceptive person to a degree and so I'm working pretty hard at it... [0:12:52.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I mean I've kind of got a feeling that I'm always second guessing, kicking around and that so many of the things I say are kind of intuitions as opposed to knowledge but they're just coming from...my process of guessing and I'm kind of running out of angles and guessing to get by on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's this guessing, can you tell me that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, previously, I mean like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I know what you mean, you don't deduce, you aren't obviously... [overlapping voices at 0:13:29.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel... [inaudible] I mean I have a feel... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...up to a point or I can come up with... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that can come up but you don't know whether it's going to come through or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, where I can come to where it's very intelligent sounding things about, just about anything... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but it's all just... [inaudible] ...I can sound like I know what I'm talking about just about. [0:13:43.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now wait, do you mean that you're tricking people and you really don't know what you're talking about... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that I trick myself a good deal of the time too, I mean I sound very official and I sound very authoritative and like I really know what's coming off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact you don't believe any of it, you don't, you think it's a matter of form; you're saying form but... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...many people think that there's... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Precisely. And okay, there are certain things which I do have some... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that you mean... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ... background in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you mind doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mind a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then why do you do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't know I've just always done it. I mean as long as I can remember the sound of my own voice I've done it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's seem like why, I think why that...a person would do it... </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a certain degree of importance, I mean self importance about being knowledgeable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...is that you want the goal even if you don't deserve it, even if you don't think you... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...deserve it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that is liking for people to think that you're smart and like nobody will think you're smart... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...then anymore if you are guessing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But like for the past two years (chuckling) I kept on having the feeling that they're going to catch up with me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...any day now... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, and this paper is like really it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like this is where the shit hits the fan, because I've really got to know something for this paper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, you're going to get found out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's on something that you, that you in a way think you should've gotten found out on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right but now it's becoming really, really important to me. I mean okay, so I get a crappy...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is it important to you to like not get found out at this time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's important for me to become what I want to be with this particular subject (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this time you feel you want to deserve it with... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I really do. Like I mean it's terribly, it was kind of exhilarating but at the same time kind of discouraging to me when it happened. I talked with these friends of ours in Greene and the guy is like really brilliant, I mean there's no doubt in my mind that he's just one of those first-class minds and anything he gets involved in (snapping fingers) is picked up immediately and he just starts turning out really interesting theories. And he was, and we had been talking about [prof's. assignments] (ph) before and he's into a whole other area of it...and just being neurological (ph) in the biochemical aspect, and he quoted some sources which I haven't found yet; considering I that I've done research on this like for almost half a year now that's pretty upsetting; and came out with the theory, I mean like he's just been thinking about it and he's done, he hasn't done any reading on it, one article in the New York Times which is training precise... [0:16:32.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and he has come, come out with the next - and kind of his thinking is exactly parallel to the people who have been researching [about the class] (ph) for the past eight years... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and he's got their thesis, which they haven't quite come out and said yet, he has got, he's already, he's already put the finish on and says, "this is what's happening, that...I do all in one day to figure it out, they'll figure it out like this" and it's, and I mean he's got it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm sure he has.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is what I'm expected to do but I don't have anything like that, I mean I just don't have that comprehension on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You expect yourself to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I think that's what's expected in this paper; the paper is to criticize the field... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...which is what he was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but now you're talking as if he got his thing by chance, not by skill, as if it came to him out of the kind of intuition that you say you yourself have. It sounds to me like it didn't come out of that at all. [overlapping voices at 0:17:30.0]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact is that first of all, in fact...that he's got a really good background in all the things which I wish I had more of a background in, so he's... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah, now how does a person get that? Is that intelligence or is that experience as those are the combinations, but it sure doesn't sound... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know but he's already done (ph) this stuff for two years!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, like you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, he's had some different courses, I mean his zoology courses, so his zoology courses they're just really kind of incredible. But he's just, I mean he's just able to assimilate this so much better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas I just have not assimilated; I've had some basic courses in it and it's like water between my ears, like it just, it's not there for me to call upon.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it occurs to you that there's some kind of, [maybe a] (ph) difference between you and him that means that you're never going to do that particular thing (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, okay, well that could be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a couple of classes... [overlapping voices at 0:18:20.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like doubting what's required of you? A negative (ph) intelligence?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but that's sort - and, but the ability to assimilate what I've been taught in the past, to remember it and apply it to my future courses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so I didn't or I remember some of Freeman's course, I don't remember any of the... [overlapping voices at 0:18:38.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]...I never remember much of any of his... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I took this course that I really should remember when it's this 201 course, this bio-sci course and I've totally forgotten all of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then you have a [negative lapse memory] (ph), what does that mean? I mean that could mean different things; it could mean that you have to practice more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's great when people can do it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you're saying... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I meant, that whole year I meant to go back and do 201...just kind of review it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so that would be a problem and [that could be responsible] (ph)... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't even, and I didn't work my ass, I mean... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you're irresponsible (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't responsible for having less neurons than he... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or less intelligence (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am responsible for not disciplining myself adequately, and I'm starting to think about the coming school year and I think I'm going to do the same thing all over again, and it's really a pain in the ass because I'm going to be stuck in the, the identical position that I was in last year that drove me up a wall and it's, and it's just not, it has not gone away. I mean all the physical, external situation elements are there, boom, like the way they were before. [0:19:44.9] (getting emotional)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which are work... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...20, 20 to 25 hours at the restaurant, Murphy... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and very demanding classes... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I would be left with the exact same problem of juggling these, with these things. And I guess what's happened is I have not found any different way to present things to myself and any different way to handle Murphy, which means he's going to make the same very large time demands on me that he did before and not... [overlapping voices at 0:20:16.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With him you're going into the same thing though you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (big sigh) I don't know, I mean it's really difficult, like the time I was doing the best in my own mind in terms of what I was doing and how I was doing it was the first quarter last year when I was by myself... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...where, yeah, I was kind of, I mean it was a really strange situation because I was very depressed and I was not seeing any people at all, I had a zero amount of social life but I still ate like a fiend.. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I got through all the shit work that I had to get through... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that was really nice. And I haven't even started to do that paper and I, I took an incomplete in one course but then by that time Murphy was there and I was already, already devoting most of my time to him but I did manage to finish that incomplete in the next quarter, um, because I had done all the reading on it before. Uh, but that's when I felt I was studying the way I should be studying, I was like devoting, I was doing two things, I was working and I was coming home from work and I was sitting down and I was studying... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that's when I got my work done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't do that, I know I can't make, and I'm not even sure I'd like to but I cannot do that, I cannot do that with him and I can't do that to myself either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well like, I mean you, is what you mean that last, like first quarter last year... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you provide (ph) a situation with such that it had only two factors and that is why you could do the things that you had to do... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because all arrangements pushed toward that, right... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...well all arrangements push toward your studying a lot, now all arrangements do not push toward your studying a lot, therefore you cannot study a lot, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So there's not any kind of sense, just first of all, that you really did anything about that; the arrangements were right and so you studied or maybe your depression, you took advantage of the depression which you felt maybe kind of... [overlapping voices at 0:22:26.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I could've sat around the house the way I'm doing now... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Well something about... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I mean I've deeply grown in that, in that depression.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I did get up and I did get to 90 percent of my classes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there was one class which I only missed twice because I was sick and I was really religious about getting to... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I got the work done for it. [0:22:47.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. See the trend of your argument appears to be that you, that in circumstance it hasn't changed and that would mean to me that the circumstance, of which could be, sounds to me like the circumstance that would have to change if you want those two goals is Murphy. I mean if there are three factors in your life where before there were two and you think that there is one less then it's this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unless you can figure out some other ways of dealing, it's kind of a matter just of priority... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...priorities, so what then are you really saying, that Murphy has caused you not to be studying, which is something you want to do, and if that's so... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to a certain degree... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...he has. I mean like I think we've really got to sit down and work it out and much better than we did before. Um... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in addition it sounds to me from the way you were talking before, and that we kind of got lost along the way, is that it isn't just [circumstance involving Murphy?]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right but it's also certain to be me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean I just didn't. I mean it would be unfair to say, "Well I only think he conspires against...me studying."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's because I consider that I to a certain degree conspire against me not to study.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we can take things one at a time... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that would be a good thing to try.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think well, (sighing) I think he'll kick and scream but I think I can get him to see reason, especially if he's working. If he's, if he's working that I can, well then he knows exactly where my time schedule is and I can just insist on, on large blocks of time for, so I'll have some time being just to myself which will help, um, and I'll be on campus just about every day and that will make life more simple.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes like just hitting the library and sitting down is my best study time, like when I have maybe two hours between classes and nothing to do. If I make myself go to the library and get some reading done the amount of work I've got done in a week just shot up... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...astonishingly. Um, but a lot of this is just going to take sitting down and talking to him and establishing guidelines.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Now why haven't you been willing to do that before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (big sigh) Because what I would be doing in essence is setting down kind of a, a study schedule for me, which I am notoriously bad in keeping, um, and I kind of needing, I kind of like a much looser arrangement but I haven't been functioning very well, I mean trying to do it that way, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. You've been holding onto the idea... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that is that you could do all of this kind of studying and you'd set your own time... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with everything... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...despite a lot of evidence [to the contrary?] (ph) [0:25:48.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and, and forgetting that I had another person's moods and feelings to contend with. I mean I was saying, "Well when the mood strikes me I will sit down and I will work for 36 hours and I'll be..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "...able to get it done and then I won't have to worry about it for the rest of the week, over, um, for the next two weeks." Then I'll sit down where I can and then I, or maybe I'll just be disciplined for the next weeks, but...I won't hold myself to anything, which is much easier to do than saying, "I will pluck away at it every day for an hour."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I usually wasn't able to do that because when will I, when some, when an intense interest grabbed me I just wanted to sit down and plow through a lot of stuff and say just spend the night, which I used to do frequently, I couldn't anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well convince him (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now though it's really a difficult, um, because I was thinking about Murphy and agreeing that going to bed at the same time, I mean whether we had sex or not, and it's a big thing with him and it's not a big thing to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well but it is a big thing to you apparently when you've... [overlapping voices at 0:26:53.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well and it's not like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...else you could do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, um, during the year, yeah, I was really annoyed, I mean I really got pissed a few times, um, well so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:27:02.8]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's just one of those things I gave in on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right and now I think I don't know what to take for an unmovable within your situation... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in a way that you do have to work around and I realize that in saying, "well you have to change your move (ph) schedule and start moving day by day" and starting to talk like that, I was granting, I mean you become... </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know like why should I be immovable?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want it to be an immovable, [is what you said?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said wanted to be immovable but I have found in dealing with it that it is. That unless, that (sighing) if I don't go to bed at the same time as Murphy, Murphy claims he cannot fall asleep, (chuckling) then he claims he sleeps less well and then he, he bitches the next day about how poorly he slept and how he's tired... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and how it is my fault for not going to sleep with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a Yiddish term (chuckling) which comes to mind immediately and it is the butt of [all of this is with me,] (ph) grandmother's fairy tales...what utter crap is this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But maybe, maybe it is valid for him, I don't know, it's totally invalid for me. And when I look at it I put myself in his place and I say, "Oh, come on, I want to sleep now, I'm dead." There's a lot of fear of that that if you really wanted to sleep, but that's his emotional makeup it seems to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well right now are you going to grant or not grant that this is actually the case, I mean you seem to be saying both things at once?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I end up granting that it is the case, begrudgingly that I am just granting... [inaudible at 0:28:36.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you believe it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighing) I don't know whether I do or not, but life becomes so uncomfortable and I get so mad when I don't that it's much simpler to give than it is - I have, in essence I've reworked my life around the fact that I go to bed two to three hours earlier... [0:29:01.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...than I would given my own choice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just the way things are, I mean like my biological clock is almost used to that but not yet... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because instead of sleeping the nine hours I used to when I went to bed at two, I now sleep like 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're on a regular clock, you're on his clock, right? You're getting up at the same time and... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right while I'm going to bed much earlier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but it's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is really phenomenal?</p>

<p> CLIENT: ...and it's really strange. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [inaudible at 0:29:36.9]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sleeping much more than I ever did in my entire life and I'm much more tired than I used to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it actually is a phenomenon in some people when they sleep, by the way, that some guy who was just studying sleep found that people that are married sleep, within the lab when they sleep separately go to sleep less well or some shit like this, but they don't even know what less really means... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in sleep with research done on that with controlling human...but that's still an issue, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well it kind of is in my head. Now I would... [overlapping voices at 0:30:09.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I would think it made you change, that it would change your mind is that he bitches so much and you can't stand it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that he really pisses me off more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've decided (ph) not to, not to be bother by this particular bitching... [overlapping voices at 0:30:24.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what happens, what happens... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...is it's always an incredible fight (ph), what really happens is if I don't go to bed when he wants to go to bed and I'm staying up later, in 20 minutes he's outside asking me to come back, come to bed because he can't sleep. I cannot play music, I can't run the TV... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I have to sit in the back of the house... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and feel just closeted up and if I turn on the radio so it's barely audible, because if a pin drops he's going to spring out of bed and start complaining and say, "Well see, come to bed."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's intolerable!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean so if you stay up... </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's very hard to work under those conditions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if you stay up when Murphy is in bed, so why do you have to stay up if it isn't the way that you want to be staying up anyway?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what about those objections?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, well they're not that important, what really bothers me is the fact that he pops out of the door every ten minutes and says, "Why haven't you come to bed yet? I can't sleep", yeah, and goes... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...back into the bedroom.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so you say, "It wasn't meant to bother you." You say, "No."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) But that's what I say and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It still happens? I mean why is there... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then he goes back to bed and usually comes out again with, "I need you. I really can't sleep without you. Um, I'm going to be a total wreck tomorrow and I have to get up at seven o'clock in the morning and do this and this and this and this and how can I do it if I can't sleep and how can I sleep if you don't come to bed?" At which point I just say, "Oh, fuck it!" and "Go to bed and leave me alone." And I'm very tense because I'm not going to get up at seven, I'm going to have a hard time getting up at 11 and I'm going to have totally had too much sleep and have not gotten any of the things done which I'm willing to do and which I would've done that night! [0:32:10.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. And why do you do it, again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (big sigh) This is losing time listening to him complain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hear you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He claims that I am greatly impairing his efficiency.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you really think now, do you think that makes a big difference if he, that it could be that you really feel guilty about your imposing your view, I mean and your schedule on him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not, I'm, (chuckling) I'm not imposing my schedule onto him, I'm not asking him to stay up with me, I never do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [overlapping voices at 0:32:49.7]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well why should he ask that I come to bed with him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [overlapping voices]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]...possibly there may be some side effects.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes, it makes a difference whether you do feel that he's in a way very annoyed (ph) in terms of what you [just think that you need to do.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's true that he's going to wake up around seven, between seven and nine the next morning, whether he'll be all upset or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's only for a social clock?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know (chuckling) it's really terrible. He eats by, his clock is just geared to getting up really stupidly early in the morning! (chuckling) And it really pisses me off, well just because mine is not! And it's just like zero way... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're both on this bizarre social clock, just when you've learned that everyone is all homing status and adjusting in equilibrium and everything is the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Well we're not, it was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, bat each other over the head and you're too picky about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, okay, he couldn't get... [overlapping voices at 0:33:49.2] ... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]...because he's tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you think what about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he has no right to blame me if he's tired. If he got tired the night before he should go to bed and sleep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's incorrect for him to blame you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I'm really sorry that he's so neurotic and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is it that he... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...can be that dependent upon me for his sleeping patterns.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you're saying that he is dependent on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either to be dependent or to have psyched himself up into being dependent, I don't know which is true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean he claims this great dependency upon me and he claims that in effect that he's having another body invented (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) ...and I don't know how to take it but I end up giving up and giving into him and feeling that my efficiency is impaired therein. I'm just much better at doing things late at night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm and if you're better at doing things late at night and in response to the situation, which is one where you're going to be blamed unfairly for something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're giving up the time when you can work best. [0:35:08.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I really am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[and not at, now at] (ph) this time in your life in exchange for another time when you need to work... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't...theoretically, yes, I should get up earlier, utilize that time but I'm no good in the mornings and I hate the mornings so I don't want to do it! And I'm not!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 0:35:27.7]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I just know that I'm not, I am not willing to get up in the morning, it is not time which I utilize well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I really, and I am worried about it because in this coming year where again, I'm going to be dropping two or three hours out of my day... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well wait a minute, what's immovable then, I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see him as immovable about this. I don't know whether that's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well just... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...rational or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to talk to him about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See but you know what I mean, it might be that he's not movable but you don't want to go along with it; for instance, why should a person go along with something that they consider being blamed incorrectly, and I'm giving your (ph) own instinct as an example, an example but because this is not a very good example but the truth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is almost irrelevant but right (ph). You weren't here during the last, [with him] (ph) I don't think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, um, people said, "Well," I mean they're here, "to get screwed out of life and limb." Because they knew when you went into the building that this was what was going happen to you and people at least then arrived at. Well I don't know, I mean if you know you're going to get a shock for doing something it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, I mean they should be shooting you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But loosely there is an analogy between these situations... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in the sense that well like - or a better analogy is he's doing it as a kind of punishment to get you to do the courses that you should avoid getting shot if they're really going to do it, but to the charges that were made, like... [inaudible at 0:37:09.4] ...and people like that about what we were doing with human birdfeeders (ph) like, um, not just giving birdfeed but to the country and... [inaudible] ...and you're not to use any [real evidence seen] (ph) in all this. And, um, so it is they blamed us for certain things... </p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or they said we were doing certain things and that he shouldn't be influenced by these things and telling... [inaudible at 0:37:31.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think with him, are you thinking... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's always that you blame us for these things, but... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, um, or I lost - my sister just is just here for a little while and she's, and, uh, it's the same kind of, I mean it's bothering me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to use and example where that construction that, that the parents put on this and also that she had been living with him, um, well the construction that she was agreeing with, I mean that living there and not saying what's bothering her, sadly, but they don't know that feeling, they would blame her. [0:38:16.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like just being very disappointed with her; there's a lot of blaming around on that point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and she, she had us saying and we had to, to train ourselves to say, "Well...you, you're really wrong to construct it in a way that..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "...you'd hurt (ph) yourself." So we just, we, we said with the blaming her for a thing that, that doesn't, is it a thing that means to call out blame, so you're constructing it wrong, and so we can't not get married and not stand for something because of this, even though they cannot see it or won't see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is a possibility, this is not going to be true in every case and particularly when you love somebody, I mean [it's the little things like a poem] (ph), um, with caring and kisses, but it's still an option for it, to decide that your actions shouldn't be controlled if the person who is making you address it incorrectly, is making you address the issue... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but are incorrect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And well of course and you also have to consider the consequences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. Well...I don't want to start off with up at three every morning, (chuckling) I think that there are a few where it would just be more convenient for me and that's just the way my adrenalin comes at the moment and I would not like to break unless he had a lot more time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did all the, I did the basic research for the prof's. assignment because they really started my head going in the right direction, between one and four one morning, I mean I just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just got my basis for it, um, which just started by doing the research, just getting, getting up on... [inaudible at 0:39:52.6] And I guess what's going to happen is I'm going to do the same sort of thing again. I'll just sit down one evening and start reading over my notes and getting the process (ph), I mean by really getting excited about it again and done with this paper I think. But...I don't know whether Murphy is an immovable force or not and I have to talk to him about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it seems to me like what you have to think about is, one, if you can move both... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...which of course is to, for him to change his mind and not keep on constructing this the way he does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [It's groovy.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, and how the problem or I guess there are problems in how you speak about it... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with him also, which you might want to talk about, um, but the other problems are if he is immovable what do you do then? I mean do you move or do you work around that or do you try, like you said that you tend to really ignore that, and what are the consequences you get into when you're dealing with Murphy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That...I have to, I have to talk to him and see what's going on. I mean I think he'd be much more flexible about it, I mean he becomes progressively more flexible about these sorts of things if we spend more time together... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and feels less threatened about time being wasted, um, now I don't have the feeling that there's any sort of time limitation on the time that we spend together, but if we just do not spend a lot of time in this particular weekend together, well three weekends from now we won't be doing anything except going off someplace together or just really being together a real lot. [0:41:27.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So to me it completely equalizes out... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and to him it doesn't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that's what I'm dealing with here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what I'm dealing with whenever I talk about setting up my own kind of schedule and getting my studying done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An issue of the time perspective in which the inequalities... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...aren't and then a piece of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. And it just seems to me that sometime in, for the next two years and in our lifetime...if we'd (chuckling) stay and if my life's his, because it's also (ph) where he'd go out and be completely mundane... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Well... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but he doesn't feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that's, that's what happens when...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's the kind of empirical question that can't be answered then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but it's also a gut reaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean my reaction to the situation is well it doesn't matter, it's the longer we've come...if this is not an issue. Whereas his reaction is this is an issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and my reaction to say, "Okay, just leave me alone, let me do what I want and I'll be with you later." His reaction is, "Yes but you're neglecting me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, and then what, then you have to decide whether he's right or not... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I, I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...[and also talk to him about it?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...feel I should do that while I'm [being vigil in a relationship.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a lot of discovering about how I'm feeling about him and whatever else I am going to do [that he's not.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have just, I've, I hope I am going to spend, expend the whole record as being for him able to think or see, I'm going to have to learn that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and carrying five (ph) courses... [inaudible at 0:43:04.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's the other aspect of this if you say it's one thing that just, your mood style in scheduling stuff, it seems to me like you've been to Murphy... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...an incremental ... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and that's the kind of circumstance then that you were finding before... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but, um, so that's really not the same, so it's not anywhere near, I mean you're holding... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with all this, um, there are always going to achieve new levels and have to change peoples' views. I mean or the ways... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in which he... [inaudible at 0:43:33.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the drawbacks here are then saying that there are ways in which you know that it's set and it said more to me right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Personally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I say I won't set anything for myself...for a number of years... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I know.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I just don't have self discipline...if I were really self disciplined I would take chemistry and then get up three times a week, I mean at 7:30 and get to campus at 8:30 and do all the shit work, and I know that I am not going to do it for years and I'm just not going to fool myself about it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...there's just no way I can. So that's... [overlapping voices at 0:44:12.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think, okay, there are things in which, where you know that you aren't going to come through... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you know do them, but there are also a lot of things where you keep trying to catch yourself that you are going to come through and you don't. There are a lot of things that you don't really treat, like chemistry... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...when maybe you should be or else change your ways, don't you think? [0:44:30.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And those seem like the, um, things you should be talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, then maybe when I do these three fucking papers that have to, one of which has to be written and two which have to be researched and written. I keep on saying before the end of the month, [but...in actuality these scores are saying] (ph) because I have to decide whether I'm going to try and get into the honors programs, this pheromone experiment... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I don't know and I haven't decided, I haven't gotten the experiment working yet... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to figure out whether I can do that or long (ph), intelligent talks with [Roger I still have got blocked.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's these three papers... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible at 0:45:19.5]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but that's just the one paper which is the main one you talked about, um, again, just three to rewrite up some of the main issues, whether you, it's that you really expect the outcome isn't going to be good and you think you deserve a bad outcome and yet you want, I mean the things that would come from a good outcome, and that's just not a point or something that's going to happen with that, [you don't think?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to get back into the paper and weight it down with something I can handle and go at it again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's true but I meant something material (ph) from that, um, which seems, which has to do with these kind of styled marriage and intuition that you've seemed to have answers (ph) and that it's the style that makes you very insecure at all times... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...as well as it ought to. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah and part of this can be rectified by going back to my 201 and just going through and thinking out what I really know and what I really don't, but the other [stuff stuck with my tool and there was no comparable end] (ph) of what I should know or what I feel I should know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, and I don't know where to go for this, I really don't, there aren't any courses here to help me at all. I mean maybe I should be taking some, two honors like the bio courses but none of them are headed in the direction in which I want and well which I need, which is going to - okay, I'll be taking chemistry next summer (ph) but I need some more neurology and I need some more complex neurology (chuckling) but so many of the courses which I would take I'd need organic chemistry for and boy I don't even have...organic, much less in chem.. Um, and I would love to take a course in neurology but I can't because I don't have organic...organic or bio chem., all... [0:47:36.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...of which are required. Um, and...the neurology courses just don't exist on any, [some sort] (ph) of level of basic neurology; basic neurology is what I had in 201 but it isn't enough. And I, and I really feel stuck and I don't know who to go to, my advisor is worthless, I mean absolutely worthless, Freeman is no help whatsoever about anything, I mean he really makes it impossible to talk to his... [inaudible at 0:48:06.5] ...about, he has not affinity for these sort of things. The graduate students shrug off everything, "Oh, don't worry about it, nothing matters." Poof, they pick it up by osmosis, [the clinicals and the utilities.] (ph) And I'm very, just confused because I'm diving back into this same situation again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but this seems like a, I mean I guess it is difficult but it seems like a simple need, question of need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, in that sense it seems like, um, and it may not be simple to find them but you know what it is that you need and, um... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's too...when I go back home to meet... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and finding, I don't know like just struggling with, with more of the same fact it seems like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, except that you to drink it again, you have to figure out how to do it, supposedly you're supposed to be a psychology lecture in this space and time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true, supposedly, yeah, or I should get on with just some basic bio psych test or a feel for the psych test, find out which one is good and just have it for a reference I think in... [overlapping voices at 0:49:33.3] ...or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like horrible (ph)... [inaudible] ...the right thing, is that the kind of level that you're talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's too advanced but it would help. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean that even...it's like and possibly a basic physics I think, but see actually 201 covered (ph) that very well to a degree... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, then there just doesn't seem to be anything on the intermediate level and I'm going to talk to... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Mark this time and with this about the spring quarter... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that there just isn't anything on the intermediate level and no courses taught on an intermediate level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just jumped from...the very basics to the very advanced and, [I'm really slowly I end up find - every time I think about it I find this total image and I'm just really different.] (ph) (chuckling) And I don't know if it's like this everywhere but I have a feeling it's more a fear of this kind of nature of the crappy part of the nature of the university... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I think you know it is.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and they really make me mad but I really wish I could stand up at some big meeting and just tell them all off and say, "And I'm dropping out of here today!" (chuckling) You know like just quit... [0:50:42.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...make a dramatic exit, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, it may be in the nature of things that you aren't going to find that intermediate text... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and it prompted these thoughts (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that it's wrong for you to assume that, it's just, um, what will you do then but still be with... [overlapping voices at 0:50:59.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it means that I'll have to get, oh, I would have to continue with... [inaudible] ...which is pretty poor or else I'll have to get the advanced text and just keep working at it, I mean keep pounding at it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that's about the most frustrating thing to do. I mean like I have this huge list of about 50 vocabulary words, about 50 words I came across in the process I am doing which I cannot understand, which I really didn't know what they were... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and some of which I was able to find in a, um, medical dictionary, something which has no definition for it, I mean a place to get the definition, the way the text uses it just doesn't enlighten me at all as to what it really is... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so happily most of these are going to become sequential. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, precisely, or things that I've just kind of caught on the periphery and can just be issues of finding and belief, I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. But you see we're talking about something very fundamental in this, that maybe getting lost in the... [inaudible at 0:52:07.5] ...which is a way of dealing that's going to mean that you deserve the rewards you're getting and that means a very big transformation from the way of dealing, of...making people think that you deserve them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well and it seems to me that, that what I should be doing is being more self disciplined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that...my whole, my whole ideas of how to rectify the situation or sitting myself down with all these books and how to remap and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...figuring it out and chiseling... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...at it until I get some sort of understanding... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...of how do I [feel for him,] (ph) then I get into the first chapter of these books and I don't finish... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I don't get any further and then I manage to kind of muddle around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you mean you just muddle around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like well how come you don't get [finished with what you're studying?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I, I finally get discouraged because it's very frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If something more interesting comes up and I think, "Well if I, I won't do it right now." To me I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I mean, you don't really, aren't really kind of reconciled to having to... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...feeling that you want to have that solid basis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it would be in, I guess, the things that you'd rather have if you could have just this one thing or so it seems?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, and then like how that changes things is, uh, but it's not as if that's not a very good thing along with... [inaudible] [0:53:51.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not even around so much with decisions, it's getting myself to... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to also thinking about... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and not to at least allow that something is... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just not actually coming across to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but why are you [wanting it to lap?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's a lot of effort! (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, and it would be nicer if you could do it another way... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [I mean it's what I make it.] (ph) [overlapping voices at 0:54:13.7]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because... [inaudible] ...to really find out. It wouldn't be, and say what would it be like if you could do it that other way... </p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in the sense it would always leave you feeling guilty and that you're going to be found out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It means that you, and you don't really believe...and it's just that you're lucky [and with effort you pass this again...] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you think with this? Also the other thing that I'd think, uh, I think there's another thing that stands in your way, um, which is that you want to be like the guy with an answer and the idea that you're going to have to read the whole fucking textbook and read it over... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and over again and not understand it in terms of, until you've read it six times... [inaudible at 0:55:00.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [It is really easy, very easier than what you think.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and it depresses you enough that you aren't willing to see that that's how it may have to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that I feel in many ways as if this, as if I'm in possession of a very, that I have a spoiled attitude, which comes from having done things the way I've done before, of things coming very easily and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...managing to get through without doing work to the inth (ph) degree... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the way I should. Um, and so that things will just kind of happen...I mean if I'm failing really truly, and I'm very much... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that it's cooler for it to happen and then so you so don't... [overlapping voices at 0:55:40.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and every time I'm confronted with everything it's just myself I've been turning around... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, and that includes never getting started.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) And kind of having to admit that I'm spoiled a lot and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm, I see, oh, not the thing about having a really good time but having to admit that [you really haven't even then?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and that I just... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you've really gotten going in a way that's kind of cheap?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Um, and then they say, and it makes it very difficult to deal with these problems and I really don't want to admit it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know that I would, I would, it just is not tallying with all the things I would like to be at all... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and so that I tend to just totally, totally... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, and it's a combination of the two, a combination of the fear that I'm really just not too bright... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and the fear that I am just, um, I'm a completely self indulgent person, that I just don't have the self discipline to get myself going in any direction which would compensate for my not being too bright... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that I'm just kind of leaning (ph) around things... [overlapping voices at 0:56:42.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which it really, which is true, you know like... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you've really screwed yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like but that's, that's my whole reaction to this, to the big experiment this summer and I really feel as if I completely fucked it up and it's really my fault for just not getting my notes together. [0:57:01.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just really do, I just really put it off and that's a stupid way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like basically wanting other people to tell me what to do and figure out my work for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that that's basically what I want, I need somebody to tell me what to do... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...about everything...not just school as much as my life in general... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that's pretty crappy. But I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think there you aren't really... [inaudible at 0:57:31.7] ...I mean with anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. Then I've, then I expect myself to be and I've kind of set up my emotions that way that I'm just now coming through with the [we self issues.] (ph) So that then it's basically what I do is, I set up unrealistic goals and I fool myself a lot of the times, but again, that's why we're doing that treatment and like I'm continuing to do is walk the same while finally being new at this, what I'm doing, by not doing anything about it, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean realizing one of my goals would be pretty decent, which is a help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Realizing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean being real honest in realizing whether I am dishonest, trying not to be dishonest when it's very hard to tell the truth, kind of very hard to be honest with myself. And then I, but it comes afterwards in, in this same way that I'm afraid that, um, I'll do a really crappy job on the paper, I'm afraid that in a couple of years the end result is looking at myself and saying, "Oh well, you really are at work too much." (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And you really don't have any self esteem, you really don't know too much, you really are very self indulgent since you really aren't able to get anything done. So why don't you get a degree of, a masters degree of education or something like that?" You know, um, and it's a very disconcerting feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To think that maybe that's what you need?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, and...I, and I know many times what I should prescribe for myself to get myself out of that sort of thing but also knowing it's my basic problem that I don't, I don't follow that sort of directive for myself kind of though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. It doesn't sound to me like you've described the situation where there's any kind of basic lack of self discipline to think that it wouldn't be without fearing... </p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that it's just not happening even if I would be able to control it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To me like you've described it, like you yourself described the situation you were in, um, you can quite bring yourself to the part of that where you could get what it would mean to get this finish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That every time that you have to examine it like that, that means that you're not going to be able to do it like this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And why I feel that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. [1:00:08.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean it's just [a mess and] (ph)... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and a lot of it, a lot of it is dealing with the fact that I'm not that sort of quick mind, that I'm not artistic, that I am not creative, that I guess that in order to really [blend in well] (ph) I have to work very hard and I'm not one of those quick people who does, who takes X steps and gets them wrong (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean I really have to go all the way with it, step by step by step but I've never done that before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm, you've always kind of bullshitted your way through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right or I, I really have just taken the extra jumps with, but with...just situations where that like where I seemed to have been one of the brighter people but I'm learning that I'm really not...[overlapping voices at 1:01:00.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you're thinking of it as being... </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm not creative and I'm not artistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...because you were lucky those other times you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and that's the basic adjustment which I am making and it's very difficult and in fact it's still painful very much to learn that I'm not good at fear. I mean, yes, I know... [inaudible at 1:01:19.8] ...[and I really can't hassle with it yet,] (ph) um, and it pains me, actually pains me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because all my life I've, I've been considered and have considered myself artistic... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...creative, but I'm not, I'm just, I'm just not a creative person and it upsets me very much and I don't have a quick mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. Well now what do you think - but what you seem to do about that then is to say, "that's how it is" as if the, like being able to try and become those things is worse than just making yourself really wrong (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, all my life I've been trying to become those things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Willing or not?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, (sighing) well it seems to me that both, that both of these things, I'm not talking about maybe intelligence but I'm concerned of really negative (ph) intelligence. I mean I'm talking about kind of [for these benefits.] (ph) (chuckling) Creativity at times just quickness of interconnections [leaning towards connections] (ph) that it's, and it's something it seems it's just basically mine, it's not, it's not a basic facility... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...something you kind of either grasp or your don't, something that you have that's like it, it seems to be like a mathematical ability. I have a scientific ability... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean I can put the facts together, but I'm not particularly quick and I'm not creative and I have always wanted to be quick and I've always wanted to be creative and I have always looked as if I were.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm learning and the, the whole crisis with my life I think for the past two or three years is built, has been built on stuff that I'm finding out I'm not creative, I'm really not. And now finding out that I'm not blending (ph) with this work. And that's very difficult because it changes my entire self image and the entire things which I must expect from myself, I mean I'm feel split right down the middle of what I expect and what I can produce. [1:03:19.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean that you expect yourself to be better than people who can really do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I set up goals for myself... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you expect yourself to do good by a need (ph) that you can't use [and then acknowledge it?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I expect myself to be creative in a certain way... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and evolve (ph) with it in a certain way and I set myself up in situations where I'm continuing to disappoint myself or that I continually protect myself from finding, from really finding out that I'm really not creative and that I'm not quick and that I'm really - [and like what I'm doing, what the prof's. going to think,] (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...where I just allow myself just not to do it rather than find out what I think is the actuality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that...I mean it's, it's a new game from the first 16, 17 years of my life, I mean when I was seen by others and when I saw myself and what I expected of myself. I mean I just try to find realistic goals for myself about what's really happening with me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...[and what that my talents really are.] (ph) And it's very tough, I mean it's really hard and it's very frightening to kind of see the way I can hassle myself in my own head and protect myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. You want to protect yourself, why's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know whether I do or not, I just know that I do... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...protect myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's really complicated. I don't think I could come up with a clearer cut answer as to whether I do or whether I don't. I mean it, it seems to me I'm... [overlapping voices at 1:04:52.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, thinking that if it works out that you kind of, [it would be more things, things to work at especially that] (ph)... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you have to find out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that, and this all goes around that part (ph) and I think it has for years, [a need to use.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm. That you have from, from this if you need something that it's too lapsed (ph) to use?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that that's, I will be really afraid and I'm finding out that I know but I'm at the same time afraid of that discovering and I don't know what I'm going to replace it with... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and what's really happening, that I really am, and that very much a part of me is still worried about this and would very much like to be these things and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Oh, sure.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...there's just still...kind of real ideal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right but it's not a man (ph) and it's kind of a marriage of, um, fearing (ph) with it and you know you have to, you can't redefine it this way, the way that you'd really want to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think it's mainly that...if this means that you could have it, the things you really want to be... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and...that isn't really standing up and it means they're not possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just [audio blip at 1:06:04.0] have to deal with it and [say every month...it just comes and I just do it.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it shouldn't but yeah... [1:06:21.2]</p>

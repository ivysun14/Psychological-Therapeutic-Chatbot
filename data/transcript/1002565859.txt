<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so I'm looking, you know, I, I looked through these forms and I'm wondering, actually here's the question, I'm wondering about your, these things from the teachers.  We can tell, one teacher didn't fill out the back so we can tell that, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She forgot I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know what's with this one, but, um, it doesn't seem like, I don't know like if you go to class.  I mean I'm getting the sense from these that you kind of sit there and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't even talk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and you don't say or move or do anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do.  They, they don't notice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they just don't notice you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not that small.  I mean you're tall.  How do they not notice you?  They don't see your head bopping up and down, but so you don't, you don't cause any problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't cause no problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you're there, so nobody, all right.  So you're, you're in, um, 12th, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm already out of school.  I just have to go to summer school to get my diploma because I didn't do well in English.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One, you just have to take one class over the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Half a class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Half a class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's only for 14 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, that's good.  Um, does that start like next week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it, wait, when does it start, next?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It starts.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They have 2 sessions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks.  Oh, it's the second, it's the second part.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But they have 2 sessions of English.  That's why.  He's going to take the second.  Probably the first was already full, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's only half a class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but it starts the end of July?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The end of July to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I don't know why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's in some of the schools.  It's not in every school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I mean do you know what you're going to be doing like things, you have to read books and?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no idea what I have to do so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a way you can find out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably if I call the school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because then you could, you know, I mean, I don't know.  Sometimes you can actually either see if there's a movie or you can go online and look at Sparks notes before the class so when they actually do you know something about it.  It's not quite as boring if you know what they're doing, and it might help you.  I mean we may do something else as well which would help you and that would be, be good if you can knock this out and be done.  So, all right, so anyway, so we, we've got, um, you know, we've got these, um, you know, staying focusing, concentrating, you know, if, if it's not interesting.  Even if it is, it has to be pretty interesting, right?  Um, and we talked about procrastinating and all that stuff.  Now what, now what about, um, the, uh, the anger like the frustration that this stuff causes because it's not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I can't get anything done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and what happens?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I have to stay home and I can't go out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, at home because, because of your consequence for not doing something or you have to stay home and do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just not doing something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I mean do you ever, do you get frustrated at yourself or other people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, just at myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, all right.  Now what about the days you go to, go to the school, but don't go into class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I just don't feel like going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, nothing much, just drive around [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Um, what's, and somebody, they said something [DEIDENTIFIED].  What's [DEIDENTIFIED], is that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's the, um, other school where he goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For auto body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  So, that you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you miss that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He missed classes there too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I missed like 4 sessions the whole year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four sessions, 4 days you mean or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just 4 days, just 4 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Um, now when you talked, when I asked you before about the tires and stuff, that's something else.  That's not [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's your job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, where do you work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh [DEIDENTIFIED].  Oh, okay.  That's a good, uh, good company to work for.  I read about it and heard and stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We both work there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, I heard they're reasonable with their work with the people working there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah.  You get a free membership.  It's not bad, but you end up shopping [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'm not, I'm not allowed to go there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No because, you know, I mean I buy stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that would be bad for me, but, um, all right.  So, um, do you ever feel like desperately sad, empty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um, how's your long term memory?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Long term's memory good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And short term is somewhere, you don't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't where that went, right?  Um, you know, can you go to the store and buy these 3 things you might go in the direction of the store, you might make it and you might not.  Would you remember any of the things if you took you 5 minutes to get there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, most of the time I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do, okay.  All right, um, sleep, is that okay?  Do you have trouble sleeping, falling asleep, staying asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not really.  I just like to go to sleep late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Twelve, one in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, is that because you can't get in bed or you can't go to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, if you, if you got in bed, you wouldn't go to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so is that new or you've always been like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've always been like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do you get up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just make myself get up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He has 10 minutes to get ready for school.  I don't know how he do that.  He got to shower, you know, brush your teeth—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In 10 minutes you can do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I shower every day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But not in the morning.  Many times I have to wake him up because he would miss [INAUDIBLE].  One time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't have to worry about it anymore.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Let him sleep so he could be late, so he was late from school.  The next day he get up by himself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was late [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You still have to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Appetite normal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, energy level?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Energy level?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It depends what I'm doing.  If I'm just sitting at home like I have a lot of energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But sometimes, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I can't even do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I just walk around my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just run around or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so your motivation varies greatly, um, as well.  All right, um, your sexual interests are the same as they were 6 months ago, there's no change, they're normal for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's no change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, is he worried about things constantly, the same thing over and over?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What about [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you worried?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's not my girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, what are you worried about like a specific thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like what I want to do next year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, but I mean do you ever worry about what you said to someone and why and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And like for 3 days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like text messaging to Mom.  You know.  You don't remember?  I can show you.  It's still in my phone.  You can't remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He text messaged me that he doesn't have any family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No I said because you don't, cause you always want me at home and you never let me do what I want.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You can do whatever you want all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mom, I can't sit at home all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But no obsessions or compulsions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, cars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just cars mainly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But like if you don't, nobody's going to die if you don't work on a car like you don't have touch something 3 times or, I mean if you had to stop working on a car, you could?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I could.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you don't want to.  All right, suspicious, people following you, talking about you behind your back?  Um, all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If he have car problem, you know, he will just call.  If you don't have your brakes, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I had that happen once.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I remember you told—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did I tell you that story about my son?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's why I am telling,   Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you was right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I could not believe it.  He, he rear ended somebody, um, when he was like [AGE] or something, [AGE] I don't know, and he said well I don't know I just jammed the brakes and I couldn't, and they didn't signal and they were turning left and then the brakes didn't work.  I'm like yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean so it took like weeks to get the body work done and then we got the car back, you know, I guess I drove it over the weekend and for some reason, I drove it to work one day, and I'm on the [DEIDENTIFIED] and I just go to step on the brake to slow down a little, bam down to the floor, nothing, and I'm like, you know, so I started pumping them and it works, but, you know.  So the whole time driving here, it's like I'm, you know, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  I was like freaking out, you know, but I'll be damned, he was telling me the truth.  Turns out we brought it in like 2 or 3 weeks before the accident to get them to check the brakes because they weren't working right, and they didn't find—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Was it an American car?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, a Taurus, of course.  Um, but it was, it's a wonder if it, if it was raining, you didn't even have to drive it, it would just on its own, it would go sliding—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but, um, all right.  So, separate from your grades, you're smart like the problem is they can't measure how smart you are.  I mean is that probably, it seems like that's, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm smart a lot of things I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really in school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean, you can't perform, you can't learn the stuff, but you're doing or perform well, but you're still smart.  All right, um, okay, so suicidal, homicidal?  Never?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um, hallucinations, paranoid, suspicious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sometimes my husband would tell him to do something, he'll say okay, okay.  He won't do it and then if [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but do you ever get to the point where you think you're going to do and then you don't?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just forget.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't I just ask you, oh yeah, I forgot.  What do you mean you forgot?  I just asked you like 2 minutes ago, how could you forget, but you forgot?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He would tell my husband, oh I was, I was just planning to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but sometimes you just blow him off, right, but sometimes—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You actually think you're going to do it, is that right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he won't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well lately [INAUDIBLE] you didn't even graduate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um, no drug allergies?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so, um, all right, now I just asked about, you have a few friends, a lot of friends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A few.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Between a few and a lot.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You have a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know them.  I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why should I go out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you can meet my friends.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You have to bring them to my house, right, so I can meet them.  If I go [INAUDIBLE] with you guys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so you have never been involved with mental health before?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, we have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, when?  I don't have that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I didn't write it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh well, I didn't give you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, when he was in middle school, he was suspended from school.  We had to go to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	For how long, 6 months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, 30 days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, 30 days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think it was the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was holding drugs for one of my friends and they told on me, so they kind of set me up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The friend you were holding them for told on you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was like yeah, I'm getting searched today, you want to hold it and I was like okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum, and he got, he [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and so you had to have an evaluation?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And did you just a couple of times or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he was for there for 30 days from school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, the evaluation.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.  Yeah, I think he went one time, and then I took him back to, um, to counselor later on like 2 weeks later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, for how many sessions?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, I think it was like 5 or 6, but I asked him if it helped, and he said not really.  So then I wanted to take him back to the, um, like we had at [DEIDENTIFIED] they have a family—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, that they help you, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So I was trying to call them, but [PATIENT NAME] said no, no, I don't want to do it, but I said okay, well and then when we started coming here with [NAME OTHER] and I talked to you and my husband about it, I said maybe it would be a good idea to bring him here first because then the, um, counseling didn't help or anything, maybe there is something else going on.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, I mean, you know, it seems like there's a few things going on.  Um, you know, I mean it's, it's, you know, it seems like it's, you know, you, you do have, um, ADHD, like you know, you're, you're, there's something that you just can't focus when, even if you tried hard, you know.  Um, and I think because of that, you also have some other, you know, symptoms, the frustration and anger with the, I mean I don't know what you would, it's like crying or sad, but it's, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He can get some kind of depression or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but, but yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's not that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I think it is, but I think that's, that's just, that may be secondary, but, um, I don't know.  I mean do you want to, do you want to try some, um, medication to see if, if it'll help you, you know, focus and stuff?  I mean if we do this you have to agree, you have to promise me something, okay, if this stuff makes you 1% less funny or changes your personality even the slightly little bit, you call me, you're off it, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause there's a lot of different things we can use and, you know, I wouldn't tolerate that in me or any of my kids and I have ADHD, I don't know if your mother shared that with you, um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did I ever tell you this?  I didn't tell you this?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Really?  I can't, I don't believe it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm on medication.  Yes, 6 or 7 years.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've been on medication.  I could sit, 12 minutes was pushing it.  I mean I used, like I used to do home visits with homeless schizophrenics [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like because I could drive there and it was exciting and, you know, [INAUDIBLE] stuck in my face once, and I'd go to these places where there was no white person you would go.  I mean it was crazy, just horrible places where you get housing for, but it wasn't boring.  I mean, but I, you know, all through do these crazy things, you know.  I mean like, you know, hold this for me or get this thing for me from the store, you know.  I mean I could be talking to crazy things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You can get in trouble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, I got in trouble a lot.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I mean it was never vicious or mean, it just—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was stupid.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then the things that would sometimes come out of my mouth was like, you know.  I mean I was like why would I say that?  I mean, you know, I didn't mean to insult someone particularly, but you know, I mean does that happen to you like sometimes you say things?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah.  What he wrote me, I'm sure he regrets what he wrote.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he's not, he doesn't have hyperactivity like [NAME OTHER] does, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, he has some, but it's not the same.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he does have enough.  He has the can't sit still, fidgety, um, moving, changing, doing this, you know, I mean he has some, but he's not, he doesn't have, you know, it's not like, like his, his motor is speeding, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bouncing off the walls.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's different, um, types, and he's probably got, you know, some impulsiveness, you know, like saying things that, you know, or doing things like and it's like boy, that was dumb.  I mean I don't know, have you done stuff like, uh, I think I was like [AGE] or [AGE] and I said, I was bored.  I was this camp counselor in the summer and I took a stapler, and I said I wonder what it would feel like if it just went in a little bit into my fingers.  What a moron because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll never do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm like oh, I'm trying to pull the staple out, and I thought what an idiot, I'm really stupid.  I mean, you know, it was just like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it was a mistake.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like I, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's your trash?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that's recycling.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I missed.  All right, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I'd take my hands and if I'm working on a hot engine, I'm doing so much I don't feel, if you turn your car off after you're driving—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can put my hand on it and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm sure he does crazy things.  I don't know about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I don't have any pain.  It's just that it's really hot for like, my skin's pretty thick up here, so I don't feel the heat that much.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Crazy kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, well let's do this.  Let's try—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's because, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we came [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's not, yeah, but he's not in the system yet.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I'll do this stuff.  Let me just get you to sign this.  I mean why don't we just try, what are we doing, 5, 10, 5.  Want to do the same thing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Same for [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean it's, chances are, I mean if it works for him—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, we would try it.  You know, that would be the first thing I try because they—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, because they work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're related.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's, right.  That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um, all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know for [NAME OTHER] it helps a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He is just a different person.  Was it Sunday, he was like an angel.  He said he will take ten kids like that, but when he's different, not more than one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let me get you the, um, you want to sign this or get him to sign it.  It's the side effects, you know, just make sure it doesn't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You don't take it on an empty stomach [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Yeah, all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Make sure you'll take it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, first thing in the morning, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	After breakfast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once a day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, once a day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Once a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	First thing in the morning and just make sure it's not affecting your appetite, lowering it or your sleep.  Um, now I know we did, um, let me see, we did the whole, uh, and [NAME OTHER] we sent off to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, to have his, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The cardiologist because why?  I can't figure out why.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think just to make sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean did he have any, where is the [INAUDIBLE]?  Did he have any risk, I'm trying to look, I just pulled his thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I bet you about the headaches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that was about the, um, yeah, but it was about that one of your something—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it turned it wasn't, it was like one of your relatives or something who died.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah, my brother.  They, they never find out.  My Mom never knew what happened.  The baby died like 3 months, 3 months old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, now do you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But probably—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean do you want to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They never find out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take him?  Do you want to do a screen on him or no, with the cardiologist?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  Do I have to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, do you have chest pain or a heart murmur or any problems with your heart?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If it's not necessary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But my Mom never find out what happened.  They just said that, you know, the baby had some kind of problem, that's why he died.  They never find out.  You know, that's back in 1969, '67.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They weren't even thinking straight.  If they said your kid was sick that's why he died, then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They, they take it, you know, but now if the baby dies, they want to make sure why, what happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What really went wrong or if he got sick or he, you know, if he was healthy when he was born, why he died 3 months later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, sometimes it can be helpful, but sometimes not.  All right, now I'm going to give you a little bit of this.  Um, we're going to give you like, it's going to look like this, this blue one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, same as [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Same, yeah, but I'm going, the first couple of days I'm going to have you take less than a whole one, all right.  Um, I'm going to have you a third for the first 3 days.  Now, I don't, I don't know if you want, if you want somebody to help you figure out it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I'll help him.  I'll do it because I did it for [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it doesn't have, as long as it's less than a half for the first 3 days, and then you go to a half for 4 days and as long as you're not having any problems, I really am not, I mean it's not, we're not in a hurry to, you know, and I just assume you take it slowly and we work up even though it's, you're going to work up to the lowest dose, but I just want to go slowly and make sure you're not having any problems, okay, and remember, you promised you let me know if there's a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it has a good or a bad problem?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, a good isn't a problem.  I mean it's, hopefully it'll help you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Focus and those things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be able to start to focus.  I mean, you know, I don't know what you're going to do, if you can start to focus on reading something that's boring.  You never did that before, so what do you do?  How do you, how do you decide how to make a decision if you can think about something before you do it when you don't have that experience of, you know.  So, you just have to see how, how you do with it.  Um, all right, no acid containing foods, um, an hour before to an hour after you take it like orange juice, um, et cetera.  So, I actually went through, let's see if I can find it, my, uh, stuff yesterday and huh, wonderful.  I came across, maybe I didn't.  I thought I came across a coupon for it.  Shoot.  Um, I did.  I came across—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, that would be nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One coupon which I had no idea I had any left.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Remember you had one for [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I haven't had any new ones for a while.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this one's still good.  So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get it for free.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, [DATE].  So no problem.  All right, so we'll do this and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You get free medication for a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah the first month, so you don't have to pay for the first prescription.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, thank you.  I mean we have the insurance, but it's nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well still.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We pay like $17 for [NAME OTHER]'s instead of $100 before, my other insurance.  Yeah, they didn't cover anything.  I ended up paying, it was $100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Geez.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The first medication we got.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But we had no choice, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just show them this in the back.  Yeah, I know and then they, they, sometimes—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They mess you up really, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well sometimes they're supposed to pay and they don't pay and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you have to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That one I got in.  All right, so I'll finish this paperwork.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] need it, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, can I get the super pill, no?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably the next time because—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Next time, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me just leave all the stuff here because—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know what, I'm coming with [NAME OTHER] on Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you can get it then.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, Wednesday.  Can I get it then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The reason is they have to enter him in the computer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sure, okay, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this for the teacher.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just make sure I don't forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, now I'll give you, did I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Don't forget your recording.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, oops.  Let me turn this off.  Here and if you just give this to them up front.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

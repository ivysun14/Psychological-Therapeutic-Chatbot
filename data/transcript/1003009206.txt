<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I got, I went in on Wednesday and Friday I was working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's almost like it's just meant to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you could just see this big smile on your face.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's a hectic job.  It's busy, very busy.  It's like I work from 8:00 in the morning all the way till 5:00, sometimes till 6:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, you are amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Long hours and, but we're moving, tomorrow we're moving to [DEIDENTIFIED] so we're packing up boxes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?  You're kidding.  Is the whole office going to set up there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The whole staff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I bet he's so glad you came along when you did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We were in the [DEIDENTIFIED], we're in the cancer center at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In back of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, and we're moving, we're moving from there because, um, they don't want to renew the, the lease I think it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we have to all move.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So we're moving to [DEIDENTIFIED], the medical -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Building there.  We'll be in there in a couple of months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could be nice to be closer to the hospital and just more of a medical -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Feel, yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Setting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And setting there, yes it is.  It's like, it's like I have met so many people.  I have done so many things I didn't do before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was working 16 years with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I never did what I know, what I know now, I never did it before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm learning, I'm learning a lot from him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're able to have more responsibility it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, yes.  I'm getting, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do injections.  I put injections that I didn't do before.  Um, I take the blood pressure, the pulse.  Um, I do everything in computers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We, we don't do nothing in writing.  Everything is computerized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of offices have the computerized medical record now, and they're saying that's the way it's going to go in the future.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's much easier.  It's easy, so easy.  The other thing when [INAUDIBLE] but, um, it's good.  It's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You don't have to be writing as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You just feed it in the computer.  I put the BP here, the pulse in there, the, um, the [INAUDIBLE] the complaint, the chief complaint, everything in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And even the blood test, when we do blood tests, we put it in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's so great to have it all in one place and then if that person ever went to the hospital -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or another doctor's office.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's going to be [DEIDENTIFIED].  So we're going, in the medical building, they have to go to emergency, it's right there.  If they have to go to the hospital, it's right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's going to turn out to be a good move.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> X-ray, x-rays and everything right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, in a way it's good.  It's going to be a little further for me because I live all the way down north.  So I have to travel.  I will have to leave the house probably by 7:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, so that's quite a commute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then again, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're there for a while, and you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He's, I've been there already 2 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two months.  Oh my gosh.  So you got this right after the last time we met.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I started [DATE].  I was supposed to come here [DATE], but I, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No wonder I missed you.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I have to, because I couldn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't take off right away, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.  We could keep you at the last appointment -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of the day, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's right around 4:15, 4:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so let me, so give me the latest appointment because I have to, but I already made my 80 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I made, today I made my 80 hours, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm going to keep, I have to work tomorrow so I'm going to have to be complaining because it's overtime that I have to go in, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure he's just glad that you're helping out, that you're, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said Saturday we have to come to help out and move boxes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh well, let's see because I have my grandson.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, um, my daughter works on Saturday sometimes, and my daughter, uh, she's, she's another basket case.  She, you know, I try to forget at work, you know, talking to patients and doing this and being happy with everybody else, except myself, you know.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I close in.  I close in a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  You often put your own needs right on the back burner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so my daughter, she, well her baby's daddy, she went to, she stays over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she gives me the baby.  I said don't leave the baby over there.  Come with the baby over to the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she's staying over there.  He's not, that guy's not working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, frustrating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's frustrating for me because he's not working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then, um, I don't want her to take the baby all at once over there because there's other kids over there, and, and they're not responsible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I told her, okay, you can take him, but bring him by 9:30 because at 9:30 he sleeps all night.  He sleeps with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's sleeping with me.  He sleeps at 9:30 till 6:00 in the morning or 7:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, which I'm glad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was, he was waking up at, he would go, go to sleep at 8:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And wake up at 12:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And won't go to sleep until 4:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But now I have him in a schedule.  At 9:30 I say come on, we're going to bed.  He goes to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until 7:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now that he's sleeping better and you're sleeping better, are you finding that your attention and concentration are better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like you can focus on things at work, not feel as distracted?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  The only thing is I feel like depressed.  Like I feel like, like it's closing in on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have, like I want to let out, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I want to let out some of this hurt because it's bothering me, because it's bothering me because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It builds up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's building up.  It's building up.  I'm, I'm trying not to let it go too far, you know, but it's building up.  It's like because she's, uh, she's disobeying me.  You know, this is like, this is my point.  I say you, you could see him, but you don't stay over there.  You got your house.  Oh, they're arguing always at home.  The old man's always arguing, my mother's friend.  I said don't pay no mind.  He's, he's going to be [AGE] and he's old, pay no mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Go up to your room, just take care of the baby, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't leave your baby because I just, the father, the baby's father don't even encourage her to go home, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like go home and take care of our son, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's so sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He just wants her, you know, and that's not the way it goes.  She has a baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then her days off, she's still over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why I'm trying, I think, uh, you know, she was too young to have, you know, she was young to have the baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she doesn't comprehend the responsibility that it's a child.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I have to like squeeze a little bit, a little bit like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then my other daughter moved.  She got her own apartment, which I'm happy for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She just rented an apartment right here on [DEIDENTIFIED], on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those are supposed to be nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nice apartment with a garage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's doing okay.  Well so far, so good, you know.  She hasn't complained about anything.  She just moved last week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  She wanted out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the little one is what's worrying me because it's like she, she doesn't have no, um, no future with this guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, and she still stays kind of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and she's not stable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stuck on him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she does.  She leaves him.  She goes back to him, leaves him and goes back to him.  She's not stable with this guy.  Then they, they didn't have no heat last week -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yikes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just found that out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it was real cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then my grandson was over there, and she never told me that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She told me about it, oh they already fixed the heater.  I told her you mean to tell me you were taking the baby over there with no heat, a house that doesn't have no heat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he could get sick, and when he gets sick, he, he does get sick.  I have to rush him to the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she looks at me.  I said you, you exposed the baby to something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of getting sick in a house that's cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.  I would have been really upset too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was so upset.  I was really upset.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So first thing she did, well I'll take my child with me to his house.  So I tried to like even stuff out, you know, so she won't take the baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's, I'm holding that in because sometimes I feel like going like, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, bless your heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And saying that's not the way, you know, and I mean she doesn't, he's not working.  She says oh, he can't find a job now because it's seasonal.  I said before Christmas he could have found a job before, since October.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel like saying look for a job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well but if he looks now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I said not now, I told you before.  I mean his mother's not pushing him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because if his mom would push him out the door, he would find a job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He doesn't have any motivation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nope.  No.  His mother goes to work at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning, comes back in the afternoon, doesn't say anything.  So even his, his sister, he has a [AGE] sister, 2 babies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE], 2 babies, one's [AGE], and another one [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you can see the writing on the wall.  That situation is not likely to change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, it's not going to change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm telling her.  I talk to her.  I don't know what, what else to tell her.  I, I talk to her and talk to her, and then she says, she tries to bring me my past.  I said we're not talking about me.  I'm talking about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I already lived.  You, you're just growing up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly, and you're setting a good example now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You have an excellent job.  You're coping with the things that are stressful to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now let me double check with you.  The last time we got together, you had mentioned some liver concern.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Any news about that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I haven't heard from the doctor.  I'm going to have to call -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And make an appointment again because they were supposed to call me for a biopsy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, that's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they, they never called me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yikes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have medical insurance yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I still have the medical insurance.  I still have the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can get your prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My job is going to offer me a, a medical insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but since I'm in probation now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's 3 months' probation -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then they give me my insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Will you be able to get your prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, with my new insurance I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would just have to pay like $5 or $10.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And plus I, um, I'm getting the Ambien, see because I go to the pharmacy down where I used to work at before -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he gives me the prescription for $10, the generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Oh, that's wonderful.  So you are getting the generic of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's helping you sleep, and, um, I chose the Lexapro so it would sit okay with your other medicines and not cause too much interference -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Interference, no, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In your liver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm fine.  I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we've been through the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trazodone, Remeron, um, some Seroquel, Risperdal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And none of those things really sat very well with you, and plus we don't want there to be a situation where it gets in the way of your attention and your concentration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, at work, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not letting that work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm doing, I'm doing fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like the only thing is this, like I'm holding in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And sometimes I just feel like crying, you know, and, um, the day before yesterday my Mom was saying, was arguing with me again and said well then, you know, look for yourself a room, but she doesn't mean that because if I look for myself for a room, she's going to be by herself and then she'll be crying in back of me.  So one day, my Mom is bipolar.  One day she's okay, the next day she's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does she have problems with her attention deficient as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Sometimes they, they do travel together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she, sometimes she goes, and she says things to me that hurts me, and then the next day she's like nothing happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have lived with that all my life.  So when she tells me things that, what bothers me, I feel like crying because it bothers me, but I don't say anything, you know.  I keep it in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bless your heart.  Well I think you realize sometimes it's the illness talking too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what, I try to ignore it.  So when she starts arguing with me and telling me things, I just feel like what, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Out of all the people in your family, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try to do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I pay, I pay all the bills.  I mean every little thing I pay, you know, so she won't complain, and, and sometimes she just gets upset with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could be Mother Theresa and she'd get upset.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And of all the people in your family, you've always taken the biggest responsibility both for the family and for dealing with what you're struggling with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, if there's depression, we work to find an antidepressant that works well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When there's attention deficient, we look for something that sits well with your medication -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your, um, liver condition.  Um, you've been very resourceful.  You know, the Ambien you've had off and on 3 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now that it's generic -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it's even more available.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it doesn't last in your system and get in the way of your -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Attention during the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've found a good balance -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It works fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty kind to your liver too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it works fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and so when you do get that biopsy done, I'll work together with your primary doctor.  We'll make sure -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're staying as healthy as you can -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the set of medicines that puts the less amount of stress on your liver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I, I, I, I'm just, I'm just like debating here and there, you know, because I had an appointment for the doctor.  He didn't take, I said I need the earliest appointment on Wednesdays.  That's my late day.  I work from 11:00 in the morning to 8:00 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you could make a first thing in the morning doctor's appointment -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is good because you usually can get in and out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that day I did make it for 9:00 and they were calling all these people, and it was 10:30.  I said I'm sorry, I have to reschedule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you were there for 9:00 and they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before 9:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you sat there for an half and an hour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before 9:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's awful, [PATIENT NAME] that's awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I said, oh no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was like I feel, I said no, I have to leave.  I'm sorry, I have to leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's so frustrating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, um, how you call it, I'm, I'm going to call again and see if I can get the first thing in the morning and see what they say again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's smart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because they need the, they need to checkup and I have to call this other doctor, the liver doctor -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because they never called.  I'm going to tell them they were supposed to call me from [INAUDIBLE] in July -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they never did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In August, they didn't call me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I thought you would have results for me today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, it's July, August, September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I was off from work.  I didn't have a job.  They could have called me all that time.  Now I have to redo this appointment in the morning, early in the morning so they could do the biopsy and I could get back to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  So let's see what's what.  Well, then last week I had a toothache.  I don't know if it was a toothache.  I had fever blisters here, fever blisters here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I had this pain in this tooth right here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And this was like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had problems with your teeth before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This looked like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is the first I've heard you talking about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had, I had so much pain in that tooth.  I don't know if it's because the cap came off this one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That can do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I got an infection.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the thing is this slit was like, like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Up like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That sounds like an infection.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my boss says wait, I'm going to give you stronger, he gave me Bactrim.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  How long did he give you the Bactrim for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He gave it to me, he gave me for 10 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said you have to keep on taking that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Antibiotic -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Until it's gone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until it's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he gave me 1 gram.  That makes it even for two 500.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I was taking 1 gram, I got 1 gram.  He gave me, he found the samples.  He said here are the samples.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're going to take this and it went down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have some good people on your side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Look it.  This cleared.  This cleared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It looks so much better -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Than what you're describing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm still, I'm still taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  You take it till it's gone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You follow his, his directions exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said you have to take it because this infection was there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he did, right away he came, he said you don't need Amoxicillin.  You need a real strong antibiotic.  He kept on it and this started to go down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you must have felt awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said I know I have to go to a dentist.  I have to take time to go to a dentist, but since I'm so sick, he doesn't have to, I have to calm myself down before I go, but I need for them to fix this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you use a lorazepam prescription just to fill before you go because some of my special needs patients I do that sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, they get really anxious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just get nervous.  I just get nervous -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'll be like stiff in the, in the chair, I'll be stiff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever taken anything before a doctor's appointment before which helps?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.  No, I just try to hold it.  I just go like this and go like this real tight, but I said I'm going to have to get a dentist, one of those dentists that calm you down.  They give you injections.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that puts you to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'll be scared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give you a prescription for some lorazepam.  That's Ativan.  If you've ever heard of that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a little bit similar to Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but it's more often that people take it when they're awake before a doctor's appointment.  It lasts about 6 to 8 hours.  It's very relaxing.  Um, it's a benzodiazepine like Ambien is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so when you go to that appointment, you probably want to have somebody else drive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You may be drowsy, and I mean between that and the dental sedation and so forth, um, but what I could do is write for a couple of doses -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, not a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That you could try beforehand and just make sure that it agrees with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think it will based on your response to the Ambien.  It's good to your liver.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it doesn't stay in your liver as long as something like Valium or clonazepam.  You know, this is very common to have before a procedure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it would sit okay with your Lexapro, with the Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, with medication for the attention.  Um, so, you know, those would all be okay together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And even if you have a little bit of liver compromise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, the medicine for attention deficient also -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I am going to call.  I am going to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are broken down very quickly.  We don't use an extended release.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to see if tomorrow in between patients.  Well tomorrow we don't have no patients because we're moving.  So we're -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  You've got your work cut out for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So we don't have, so when I have a chance, I'm going to call.  I could call from work and make an appointment with that doctor, the GI doctor.  I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have to get this done.  Get it done, over with, and you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, and you know what it is, and I eat a lot of, I don't eat fried food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get a lot of stomach upset?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.  I do get a lot of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that also since the Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I don't, I can't tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get a lot of gases.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has that been true for a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And constipation, and constipation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has that been true the whole time we've been working together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we've changed medicines a few times -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I don't remember it being more or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The, the one that helps is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or less bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The one that helped me was the Zoloft.  I used to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, you had some diarrhea with the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but with the, with the other medicine, I get constipated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get gassy, but, but with me, I think the thing I, I don't eat greasy food like that, but I love eating like pastries.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah ha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or buy coffee.  So I think the pastry, the fat that's in the pastry -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is causing the fatty in my liver.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I do not eat fried, um, food like French fries and stuff like that.  Chocolate I don't eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  So I think it's the pastry that I'm eating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's getting the, my cholesterol's up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I think it's because of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You may be right.  You could very well be right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was thinking that this morning.  I said oh my God, I'm eating the wrong food because then, I don't know if they do that here, they bring breakfast to the office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The reps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, once in a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The reps, they bring all this food stuff to the office.  They bring, uh, [INAUDIBLE] or bagels or whatever, you know, and I'm like oh my God, all this food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get them to bring fruit, like they can get those little -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, you know, he eats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fruits things at Wawa.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he eats organic.  My boss, he eats a lot -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  He eats a lot of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he eats organic.  He eats organic.  Every fruit, all the fruits he eats is organic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's very healthy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's very, you know, he sticks to his guns.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everything organic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what, he says what did you eat today for lunch?  I said oh God -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not going to tell you about that Big Mac, no way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I ate a grilled cheese sandwich.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty healthy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's looking out for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says, he always he asks me, what did you eat?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.  Well you are what you eat like they say, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I said if he only knew I ate French fries and whatever yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he is very, yeah, he's watching us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stop eating fried, fried stuff, um, fatty stuff.  You eat organic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good advice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he drinks all this, his bowl full of salad with the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tuna fish.  That's every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And fruits.  You see him eating fruits.  You know what he drinks a lot, tea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably green tea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he drinks green tea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he drinks ginger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He grinds the ginger over at the office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's really something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Grinds the ginger with lemon, he squeezes the lemon.  He has a squeezed lemon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got a good example there in front of you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And tea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before I used to walk off.  She gained weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like she needed to gain to a few pounds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, she was 115.  She went to 124.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure she could afford that if she's a normal height.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and the doctor was amazed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was like oh my God, look what you did to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I would ordinarily suggest is considering going up from 10 to 20 on the Lexapro unless you're feeling strongly about considering the Zoloft again, if you think that that sat better with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Zoloft is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The 25.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The 25.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The lower dose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard to find samples of the Zoloft now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I know, but I could get a prescription -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is the generic affordable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For generic.  Yeah, if it's generic, I'll talk to the pharmacist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because Zoloft is pretty kind to your liver as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you weren't having the constipation problems, the bloating and that kind of thing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh that helped, that helped me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Zoloft helped me go to the bathroom regularly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm not constipated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it does sit well with your other medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  When my, you know, I digest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I don't know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's go back to it then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if for some reason it doesn't pan out, we could look into going to Lexapro 20.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'd love to, you know, get a better handle on what's going on with the liver, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is one of the problems I have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are your medicines sitting together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, um, remember I was fighting SSI.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wouldn't you know that after I started working, a week after, I receive a letter that I have a hearing to go on the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is exactly what this paperwork is about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which I have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we can work on that together, and one of the staffers here too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my, and my lawyer, my lawyer wrote to me too, but I sent them my paystub.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I already sent them my paystub.  He hasn't said anything, so that means that we're waiting for the [DATE] but I know they're going to deny it because I'm working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ei yi yi.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm working.  I'm like losing $1,000 every 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you still want to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go for it, or what do you think we should do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, I don't know what to tell the lawyer.  I called him up and I told him I started working.  I'm not supposed to make over $940 a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm making all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about if I go back, is it [NAME OTHER] in the back who's working with you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the blonde hair?  I'm so bad with names.  Why don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  What's her name?  There's 2 [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's the tall [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  She gave me her name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll see if I can find her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] her number.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to, um, shut this off for now, go back, talk with her and figure out if we need to, you know, put our heads together on the paperwork or if we just say, you know, maybe you don't need to go to the court hearing.  I mean if you're working.  You're happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want to tell the truth when you're up there on the stand -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I'm working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.  This was a fallback.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I go to the, to the chiropractor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's amazing what he does with my neck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're getting some relief from the chronic pain as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, because he puts me, he, I haven't been there in 2 weeks because of all the holidays and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I have to call them because on the day that I want to go, the doctor says oh, we have a meeting or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yes, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't get there before 6:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a busy office where you are.  I know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know exactly what you're talking about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We're so busy.  I never get out at 5:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But as long as you get paid for overtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's the problem.  He got, the girls said you better not make over a certain amount of hours.  I already have, yesterday I had 77 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said, he's going to be, I said he's the one that doesn't want me to leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm working, today I made over the 80 hours, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keep track of all your hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said I'm, I have to leave at 3:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You should get paid for the time that you work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] take care of this patient for me and do this and do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, bless your heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to leave I told the girls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They go leave, I'll take care of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And even though I know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], everything's confidential, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it's totally up to you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's so busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you tell him that we work together or not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He tells me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's totally up to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He tells me, um, get that patient, put her on the nebulizer.  Okay, give her this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's used to a staff that, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is going to jump, but if you have an appointment, you have an appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said I have to leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You did well to get here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I go to the girls, I told this appointment like over a month ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to leave because I have appointment for, for today because I already changed it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the girls said go ahead, I'll take care of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's good.  You all are looking out for each other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well there's 4 girls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There are 4 [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he says, you're leaving?  I said yes, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have an appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you could also say I've already done 77 hours this week.  I don't want to overdo it, and that would point out to him you're working really hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he doesn't want, he doesn't want the overtime.  So with tomorrow, I'll be having over the 80, 80 something hours.  In fact, today you know what I did.  I went to lunch for an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it won't be, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, and that might build a break into your day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And with some of the stress.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But tomorrow I'm going to see -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When he sees my schedule, he wants me to come Saturday to help out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm, well then you have to say listen [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] tomorrow when you exceed your 80 hours, say [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I just want you to know I've just exceeded my 80 hours.  I don't want to go doing a lot of overtime without your permission.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can help this weekend, however, I do need to be compensated for my time.  I'm supporting my family pretty much single handedly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and I'm sure he will understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So tomorrow, I'm going to talk to them because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When he says I'm leaving, that's when I'm going to tell him because hey, the other day, I left the office, I was there from 8:00, I go there before 8:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Till 7:30 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a long day.  That's a very long day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was exhausted already when I got home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think your lunch break is good, and maybe you could run some errands in there, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not have it be like a solid 12, 13 hour day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I try to get to work early, but tomorrow I'm going to say hey, we don't have that many, we're not going to have no patients -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I get things ready, I'm going to ask him could I leave at 4:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I won't have to deal with extra hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because if you're going to do overtime, you need authorization.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're not going to pay me for the overtime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you deserve to be, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's probably getting -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I make -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Settled in the new job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I made 83 hours.  Okay, 83 or 85 hours, okay, but after that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's going to be saying hey, you're working too many hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm, because he tells me, you know, do this, do that, you know, because he's busy.  That office is so busy.  It's really busy.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I've seen it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's nonstop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know what you're talking about.  He's got many patients in there at once, all different rooms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a clinic and he does it all himself.  It's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and then, um, he has the DEXA  scan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He has all these x-rays to do.  He has this doctor that comes for the EKG's, the echos.  We do echos there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it's, he has a big practice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a full service.  It really is, full service practice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and then he has, he had a supervisor that was our supervisor, he quit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not too long ago, and I said what happened that he left?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was like wow, so what I'm going to do now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So then I think there's another lady there that she does the billing, I think she wants the position of the supervisor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that'd be good if it's somebody who's familiar with -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How things work and, you know, what, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s goals are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  He needs somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Yeah, you can't do all that on your own.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All on his own.  He needs somebody.  You see him, he doesn't ever stay sitting down either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm like oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sure is.  Between his diet and his energy level -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's always going to be fit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says put the flag.  He has a green and red flag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Green is when, when the patient is ready and red and green is when I'm taking care of the patient.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a clever system, clever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he has to have system.  He says [PATIENT NAME] you're forgetting the flag.  Sometimes I forget the flag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there's a lot to keep track of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to keep track, keep track these lights.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like you're doing a good job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't want, I don't want him to get on my case.  He tells me where are you going now?  What doctor, your mother's or something?  I said no, my appointment.  He says what kind of doctor are you going to, your liver doctor.  I said no.  I said like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You don't need that.  Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's up to you.  If you tell him it's me, he'll understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He'll understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wait till I tell him my doctor is [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She sends her best regards.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that's totally up to you.  You know, again it's your confidential -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he is a good soul and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so if you know him, you know how he is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have a stressful job.  It's a fulfilling, exciting job, but stressful and you need to protect your time, you know.  Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like if I, like if, you know, if I made over the time, I'm going to take off, and, you know, leave early not come, you know, not take off the day, but I'll leave early, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, exactly -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I need to rest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially since you've put in so much time already this week.  It's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the thing, I know I make over, over 84 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I know tomorrow I'm going to see the, the 8 hours that I work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let him know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let him know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because if he wants you to come in on Saturday, there needs to be an agreement, you will be paid overtime for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm going to, I'm going to talk to him tomorrow -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, you have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to say, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I always stay.  I don't want there to be no problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and then [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  Exactly and if you are willing to work some overtime opportunities -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can let him know, but that definitely needs to be arranged in advance -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because of your family responsibilities, which are huge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I work on Saturdays, but in another office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Another doctor's office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That he opened up [INAUDIBLE] and remember that's the office I used to work from -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm working on Saturdays too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I work 4 hours there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I start at 9:00.  I get out at 1:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But there mainly what I do is the blood work and the pulse and, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the history and that's it.  I don't do that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I agreed with my friend to do it because he's, he's a supervisor over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he, well I said well she gave me, when I didn't have a job, she gave me a couple of hours a day or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to be appreciative.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It keeps your skills up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, and sometimes having a couple of options is good too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like that might be a little more relaxing than 4 hours at [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I worked last week with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and it was busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh my God it was busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I said [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I see you, it's 12:26, I have to leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't usually work at his office on Saturdays, but this time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This past Saturday I work over there and I said oh, I have to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's what added to your overtime, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what added.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's got to realize, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what added to my overtime because I worked that Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly, which he asked you to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he doesn't realize that, but when you [INAUDIBLE] he's going -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're responsible to point that out.  You're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But now or tomorrow -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doing the right thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to say, I'm going to tell the girls, make me a time sheet so I could show it to him and see what he says.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  You want to be sure it's all above board, and he understands what he's getting into too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exciting developments.  Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now we're going to be at [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's a bigger space, bigger waiting room.  There's a bigger, bigger rooms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very interesting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the cafeteria, he told me oh yeah, they have organic food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says what they do?  You didn't know they had organic food.  He said oh, I'll be there every day -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's interesting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said there's 2 cafeterias right there in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he's, he's ready to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good news.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I said oh my God, some of our patients from [DEIDENTIFIED], some are going to travel.  Some of them are going to switch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and new ones will come too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And new ones, that's what he said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Word travels fast -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And around that avenue -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If somebody's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Around that avenue, there's a lot of Russian, Polish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, and Ukrainian.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, true.</p>

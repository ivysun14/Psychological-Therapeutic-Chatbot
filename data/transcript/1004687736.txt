<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I like them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're political fools. Let me know what you think about what they do. They don't really know anything about what I do. They seem so young. It seems so ridiculous for me to say about people who are three or four years younger than me. I don't know. What do you do? I spent a lot of time this weekend socializing with people that I don't know very well or at all. That's been good and bad. James was here. I'm worried about the way James and I interact. It's become so much him taking care of me and there is just something not there that I can't figure out how much of it is me and how much of it is him. I suspect most of it is me but I always suspect that most of it's me, so I kind of have to (laugh) suspect with suspicions. Basically I am just acutely aware of the ways in which I might be a burden to him, but that just increases my anxiety and makes me more somebody that he needs to take care of to get through the day. [00:02:10] I know there is a lot of him supporting me because we had to get this move done. We both had to finish packing up my stuff. We had to get it in the truck. We had to get it to the apartment and unload it and talk to my roommates and all of this. He's really comfortable being the person who takes care of other people. I think that's a role I think he really likes, but it does not leave me feeling very much a full partner in the relationship. At the same time, I don't have any alternatives to suggest. We really did only have the truck for one day. We really did have to move. I was working really, really hard to keep it together; and I did keep it together for the most part and we got it done. It's like there is something that's just off. [00:04:11] (pause) </p>

<p>And then, of course, yesterday was much better, but he wasn't there yesterday. We got up early and got on the train. He went off to the airport and I went off to my old apartment to clean it up. It bothers me that yesterday was a really good day because it was before he went out of town. Saturday I didn't take the Adderall because I'm supposed to take a day off every once in a while and I had to take it on Sunday because I had a really full day. It was like my legs weren't working. I was really tired the whole day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Saturday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On Saturday, yeah. So yesterday starting to unpack, I could do everything. I don't like it that the first time James sees me in six weeks I'm at a low; and I don't like that he doesn't get to be with me when I'm good. That isn't to say that I was completely mopey all weekend. It was more ups and downs. (pause) Really I don't like things [ ]. (inaudible at 00:06:14) To feel all these things a car-ride away is not actually directly comparable, I think, to being long-distance and a flight away. There is a difference there that we weren't prepared for. And I don't see how we could have prepared for it because you can't just get in the car. You have to plan ahead a couple of weeks and that's hard. [00:07:19] I went out for drinks and sandwiches after church last night with a combination of people who have been going to that church for years and years and years and always go out after the service, and then me who has been there almost a year and starting to be involved in the worship, and a couple of people who this is their first time at the church. It was so funny and sad. There was this girl, I mean a person my age, who came up to me after the service and she was like, "I'm pretty sure that we've met before, but I can't remember in what context." As it turns out, we're both from Texas. It's clear that I sort of recognized her, but I'm not sure whether she actually thought we had met before or if it was just her first time in church and she wanted to meet people. Regardless, we couldn't figure out what the connection was, but it doesn't really matter. It was clear that she thought I was somebody who "had it together". I was like, "Oh, honey. No. Not at all." (laughs) I guess because I'm serving as a lay minister, somebody who is basically an acolyte and then serves communion. I also thought that you had to have some training to do that, but no. No, no, no. You just have to e-mail them and say that that's what you want to do. (laughs) [00:09:07] I don't know. It was just strange to have this person who was a little socially awkward in a way that I recognize very well—like she's socially awkward in a way everybody I went to college with was— Texas A&M is the hotbed of nerdy awkwardness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You wouldn't unless you were placed in Texas. She didn't go to Texas A&M, but she was just a type that I recognize and I am sort of that type and, yes, I'm there with you. It was weird to feel myself trying to be the leader that she had wanted me to be. So that's how I was going for dinner with so many people. "You should come, too." She came along. I was introducing her to people and trying to get her to be part of the conversation. [00:10:31] It makes me kind of sad. (chuckles) Sometimes we sort of see the way other people see you very clearly for a second and you realize it's very different from what you thought was there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you are not at all the way you want to be. [00:11:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Yeah, but I'm not quite how to present myself in light of that, in that I am not at all the way I want to be. I don't think it's fair to try to put myself forward as the person that I want to be in some ways. I don't have that much control over how people see me. (laughs) I'm trying to come to grips with that. One of my roommates has met this man. I like him very much but he is so different from me. He's [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:52) so we're kind of getting a feel for each other and I said, "I was on a leave of absence," and he's like, "Why?" and I said, "Depression." He said, "Oh. Okay." The first thing he said was, "You should try exercising." (both laugh) And I think I handled it gracefully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I feel so much better for having moved around. [00:13:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Yeah, I've heard that that helps, but it doesn't really help me." He said, "Have you tried it?" I was like, "Yes, I've tried it." He was like, "Okay," and kind of moved on. He said, "Yeah my mom was depressed once. That was two years ago." "Yeah, probably." But very nice. It just didn't seem to be on his radar, per se. I guess I brought that up because I don't know how to talk about where I am gracefully. I guess part of the fact that I feel the need to talk, to be graceful in the way that I present this to people is a problem, or it could be. I always just struggle with what I say. Like how do I not overshare, but tell people what they need to know. I don't know. He says, "So, are you better?" I was like, "No. No I'm not." (chuckles) [00:15:10]</p>

<p>I've been thinking about just keeping it together a lot. Needing to not write down, and then that becomes a problem because then I can't experience the emotions that I'm having and talk to people about them at the same time, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If your goal is to not break down when you're talking to people? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because my goal is to not break down so much such a high percentage of the time, then even when I'm in a comfortable space with people—with almost everybody, like people I'm really close to—I can't talk about it and feel the emotions at the same time. I feel like if I start crying I will never be able to stop crying. It will never go away. It will feed on itself and get bigger and bigger and bigger. And I know that's not actually the case, but it usually is the case that what stops it is me saying mentally, "Okay, that's enough of that. Time to move on. Time to get on with the day." It's just awkward. I mean for other people, it's hard to see somebody in pain. It's hard. You don't know what to do. [00:17:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just awful for you all the way around. To be feeling it in the first place, to not want to burden James and the other people who you're closest to with it, to not know how to broach it with the other people who you know but aren't close to. All of it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it sucks. It's not the worst thing ever, but it sucks. [00:18:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's worse for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having a bad interaction is worse. Having a fight with James is worse. If I didn't have people who wanted to talk with me about it and who want [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:41) it would be worse. There are lots of ways it could be much worse, but I tell myself that it could be worse as a way to not actually deal with what has happened. (sniggers) (pause) [00:20:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling bad now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. I had a good morning. I talked to [ ]. (inaudible at 00:20:53) I talked to my sister on the phone. I've been so anxious about applying for jobs for a long time, but especially in the last few days. I'm less anxious right now, but that's the next thing on the list that I have to deal with. I don't quite know what I'm going to do, but I have to deal with it. Right now, at least I don't feel so anxious that I can't do it. I'm not helpless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. [00:21:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I honestly feel like I've spent so much time talking to people that I don't know very well, that it's hard for me to talk about real things. I kind of go on autopilot a little bit in terms of pretending to be the person that I was before I started being depressed again. Like flash back two years and this is what I'm interested in. This is what I study and I've got my opinions and these are the things that piss me off and so forth. I feel like it's hard to snap out of that actually so it's hard for me to be here, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sucks. (clapping/snapping sound) Yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Well, the reflexive apology is not actually snapping out of it. That's always been pretty standard. My roommate, Candace, used to postulate so much about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was like an apology?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But now, living with Kirsten, who apologizes even more than I do, has made it way worse. [00:23:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were just apologizing reflexively because it's difficult for you to be here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you've been talking to people that you don't know that well? So you're sorry to me for doing that? (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes I am—being not that focused or distant somehow or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I bought a book. It's a collection of essays by the advice columnist, Dear Sugar, and it's lovely. She talks a lot about appearance. She talks a lot about working hard emotionally. Your job is . . . I don't even know how to talk about it. It's lovely and inspiring and it's good. I spent most of yesterday just walking around because I had to go out to the apartment and clean that; and then take some public transportation, but I mostly had to walk out to the grocery store and then get back to church; then I went back to the Square, which is where I live now. I saw lots of the city and that was nice. (pause) You seem tired. (laughs) I'm sorry. That was not an apology. That was an expression of sympathy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: James slices me when I do that. He continues to say, "Why are you sorry? You didn't do anything." I say, "No, this is 'I'm sorry' in a different sense." Skip the cynicism. [00:27:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any thoughts or reactions in addition to [the "I wind up being sorry for being tired?" ] (inaudible at 00:27:23) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel a little bit irritated because I wonder whether you're actually here, too. That's less present than feeling like I am at fault somehow, if that makes sense. I said, "I noticed that you're tired," and then I think, "What am I doing wrong?" Then I think, "Me being concerned is nothing wrong." Then I think, "Probably neither of us is doing anything wrong," and stop there. (both laugh) [00:28:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's go with the one for a minute about me doing something wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (laughs) We don't talk about that very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have there been moments or ways that I've seemed kind of out of it or inattentive or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. There are days when I feel like we're both less intense and usually I feel like it's coming from both ends. There are days when you seem tired, but I don't feel like that impacts whether you're paying attention or not. I always feel like you're paying attention. Sometimes I feel like you're not picking up on things that you might have on other days, but you are obviously a person. (laughs) You're allowed to do that. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, everyone has feelings about it. (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. There's kind of this weird mix of irritation and guilt. I feel a little irritated sometimes when I feel like you're not picking up on something. It's actually very rare that I notice you not picking up on something until after the fact—like until several hours later. Things that are obvious, you always pick up on. (laughs) I think it's mostly when I feel like you are tired. There is this strange mix of being irritated with you for that and being guilty for being here, and it's more guilty. (laughs) [00:30:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Surprisingly. So not feeling guilty for being irritated, but feeling guilty for being here at all if I'm tired and might need a nap or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I'm imposing. Yeah. I was going to say that doesn't happen very often; and then I was wondering how you do the constant non-judgmental attentiveness. It seems like that's really hard. (laughs) I imagine it's like anything because just do it. [00:32:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about it appears to be difficult?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously much of this is speculation because I am not a therapist, but it seems to me that you would have to be both personally present and not personally present. I don't know. It's just very difficult to be uniformly attentive and compassionate. That's just really fucking hard for large stretches of the day. Maybe it's because I spend so much of my day by myself. (laughs) Again, going to go with one or two of the models are somewhat similar, but most priests are extroverts. They work by being present in their personality always. They kind of put that forward onto the situation. You're not doing that; or maybe you are, but it doesn't seem like it. I don't know. [00:34:04] What happens when you're tired? How do you do that? You are tired but you still have to be here and be compassionate and attentive. (pause) [00:34:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying those things aren't true or interesting. I certainly wonder what I'd do when I'm tired [and can't turn it around.] (inaudible at 00:35:07) I think it's hard for you to stay with the part about being irritated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it is. No kidding. (laughs) We can keep talking about it if you want. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's important and you moved away from it a few times now pretty quickly; but it's something that's hot to the touch. [00:35:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is interesting because it's not that I mean to, but I know what I do mentally when I find myself getting irritated with you is to acknowledge it. I say, "Is this something that I need to bring up because it's actually a problem?" If it's not, then I move on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually I think in this case it's more interesting [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:25) First of all you're feeling guilty and then you went to seeing things from my perspective and, "Wow, how do you do this when you're tired and how do you be both attentive and non-judgmental, especially if you're feeling tired." So there you are (chuckling) being empathic to my point of view and not judgmental about my being tired and telling me how hard it must be to do that. [00:37:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Do you know what that is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why you were doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have an initial thought, but I want another minute because I think this is more important. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it feels like when something is in your peripheral vision and you can't quite see it; and you turn your head and it keeps moving with you? Once you call my attention to it I can tell that I've been doing that, but that doesn't keep me from continuing to do it even after you've called my attention to it. I still can't quite . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [So it stays in your blind spot.] (inaudible at 00:38:18) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly there is an identification with me there that you're probably replacing another reaction you're having with, I think a more irritated reaction—irritated to identifying, both in terms of considering my point of view in a kind of explicit way and in terms of demonstrating it in being pathic. See what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do. It's very easy for me to say and recognize that yes, I am very uncomfortable being angry or irritated at other people, but in some ways it turns into a thing where even saying that becomes a way for me to cover that fact up for myself. (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are these things called psychological defensiveness (both laugh), which we generally employ unconsciously, which is to say we don't know—we're not talking about denial but it's one that's commonly referred to so I'll refer to it. Somebody doesn't usually know when they are in denial of something; otherwise it wouldn't work very well. That's what I mean when I say "unconscious of deploying these"; but yes, there are ways of distancing painful feelings. I think what we're talking about either by identification, which I think is a pretty important one for you, where you move from having a feeling that is more antagonistic to somebody or "selfish" in some way. I don't mean bad, but self-interested in a way. And then you're very quick to identify with them and they replace whatever you had been feeling. [00:41:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other one we're sort of talking of is me being a slightly less immediate way of having an uncomfortable feeling—sort of referring to it but also not quite coming to grips with it or sitting as close to it, which I think is something you're referring to. [00:41:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's as though referring to it is a way to bring it up for just a second and then move over it back down again and say, "Well, I've already dealt with that." (laughs) [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:14) I don't know what to do with that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine for you this is really pretty disturbing news. Not surprising in that I'm always fussing and waving my arms and things like this, but disturbing in that these are things you're not well in control of and that keep you from seeing what you feel and what's there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also that this kind of recognizing and articulating to myself anger, I have been used to thinking of that as a gain. It took me a long time to get there, so I was like, "Oh, okay. So now I've dealt with this," and I'm like, "Oh, fuck." (both laugh) I just need to keep dealing with it, don't I? I know that they're called defense mechanisms because they are things that served you well in the past and don't serve you well anymore; but not only is this another one, but it's one that's very slippery. I don't know how to get under that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop.</p>

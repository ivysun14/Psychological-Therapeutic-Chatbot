<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...therapist from a basically orthodox background make it in the real world... still listening for overview 11, client 0426002. [You remember number] (ph) 11. [In our continuing agenda of ] (ph) client 0426-002, interview 11 via (ph) 111.

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) see if I'd go or not, and I'm like, "Yes, Dad."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) see if you could go or not?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, to see if I would go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see, and here you were feeling so lousy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's my Dad.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you wouldn't pass it up?

</p><p>PATIENT: I was saying that I would stay and stay. It would be my test.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you really - are you really at that door or not?

</p><p>PATIENT: The weather, I wouldn't miss anything. (Inaudible) I think I might (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really feel rotten.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. And I took a pill my neighbor prescribed for me, she's a nurse. She's got more pills in her little cupboard. And I think it's got something in it. Because I used to take diet pills, and I feel kind of like what I felt like, real, real hungry (ph). It's supposed to dry you out. And it has dried me out so that I can hardly (inaudible at 2:17)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're walking around with that - the pill inside of you, and I guess feeling like the Sahara Desert all the way down to your toes, and you can't do anything to balance that (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I was wondering if this was - if I flunked my first test (inaudible) so very satisfied with myself. We have this neighbor dog. And it's just a terror (inaudible), it really is. And today the boy I baby-sit for, I told him to go down and get the Barbie doll, the doll it was chewing. You know, this, is a complicated... one of those. And this dog's kind of like backing into the corner. And Carol (ph) came out and we kind of chewed out Chris (ph) for being scared of the dog.

</p><p>Where Dick said I should have picked up a club and beat the dog, I at least told Carol that we just can't have this dog fiddling around with the kids (ph). I just don't have the nerve to do that. Because she is like that - like a mother would be for her child, she is with this dog. You know, it's like her baby. 

</p><p>And I think if you'd attack her baby, she'd really get - I think she'd probably quit speaking to you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She'd just cut you dead.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I don't want to argue with any more neighbors, you know. I just want to be kind of alone now. But I think that somebody's going to have to say something, you know, I'm just kind of hoping it's not me. You know, because this dog is really going to - he nipped one of our neighbor kids, and she blamed it on the neighbor kid for teasing him. I mean, whether he did or not should be beside the point. So. [4:31]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like where you are right now, or where you can see yourself being, you like very much. But on the other hand, you also heard like tears, some way on the other (crosstalk).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know whether I should say something, you know, because I already know what would happen. I know that she would get mad at me and the whole family, you know, and it's like the two buildings would start picking sides for the dog, against the dog, you know?

</p><p>And it just - it seems, it's really kind of dumb - and I don't want to get in it. But if she bites - if the dog bites, not Carol, she'd never bite. If the dog bites any of the kids around there, then I'm going to feel like maybe I should have brought it out into the - you know. Because the dog has bitten that little boy, but nobody had said anything to Carol yet. And... I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, on the one hand, you can see yourself saying something and then becoming hooked in to all this stuff that you want to just be done with it, avoid. But on the other hand, you don't want to see the dog hurting the child, perhaps your child.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's going to be my responsibility, if and when he does.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You would feel terrible if you (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would hope that I would feel terrible, maybe I'll just put my head in the sand and say, "I knew that was coming." [6:16]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what I'm going to do. But I feel very certain that he is going to attack somebody. And I hope that they have parents that'll really go down and shoot the dog. Get rid of the dog or something. There must be a leash law. Is there?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: What is it?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It is. They can't run (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: At all? Even in their own yard? Is that right? Even in their own yard, they have to be chained?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it a house?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's an apartment house.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Common.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible), yeah. But when I really should say something to her to protect her too, because she could be sued (inaudible). I won't, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean, it's not like the issue for you, whether there's a leash law or whether she can scoot the issue with something like, "Am I going to put my neck out and get pulled into the mess that I just recently felt that I could extricate myself from, or am I going to be quiet and then feel perfectly awful if something bad happens?"

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't know that I'm going to feel awful, you know? Me, I'm going to say, "Well, it was really venom (inaudible)." I mean, I'll really feel awful if it's my kid, or Christopher. Well, I guess that would carry over into the rest - I mean this - aw, I guess you'd feel awful if it was any kid.

</p><p>But I'm not - I probably won't be blaming myself... This, is just so dumb, you know. This, is such a little thing to build up. I think I would almost always rather avoid it than go into it, because I just don't like head-on clashes. Especially when I know that she's stronger than I. [9:10]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In a head-on clash you'd wind up losing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Because I can - it's just like when I was little and the kids would start teasing me. You know, I'd just kind of look like a little wet hen, you know? Going into fights and they were standing there holding me up. And, naturally, I still am. And I just know that I'd never... I wouldn't do any good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd flail around wildly and make no impact.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I just don't think I could convince her that she is wrong and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All you'd wind up doing is looking foolish. Like a little wet hen.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I just think that all I'd do is alienate a neighbor. And cut my source of pills off.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And not only wouldn't you do any good for yourself, but it sounds like you'd also do yourself harm. Not only wouldn't you be able to change her mind, you'd also drive her away. [10:29]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think this might be one of those situations where nothing would convince her until it actually happened, 'til the dog bites a child and then, then you go in and say, "Carol you've got to get rid of this dog. Or keep it in the house at all times (inaudible)." Because I know that that would not... that it's not going to do any good.

</p><p>And in that case, why should I say anything if I already know the outcome? When Dick suggested to me, he said, "If I was there, I'd have kicked that dog, or hit it." And I said, "Carol would have flew out of that house and beat you to a pulp." Now, it doesn't hardly seem like he ought to be beating the neighbor's dog. I mean, that's going just a little bit too far. You know, but he's going to teach him how to behave. 

</p><p>And he even - you know, like, he likes dogs. I could care less about them. But he thinks that dogs should come behind children. I suppose he does have a point there, but then Carol thinks that dog's her child. I guess it isn't really a simple little problem.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's a pretty difficult problem.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it wouldn't be for me, at all. I'd just - I wouldn't say anything. If I didn't have Dick there saying, "You should..."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, oh. So it's like, Dick has like, thrust you into this situation. Like, if it weren't for Dick, like you could just avoid it and sort of push it under the rug. [12:27]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wouldn't even have thought much about it. After I said, you know, "Carol's going to have trouble with that dog if she doesn't watch out." But, you know, like, that's a way I can remember my folks talking. You know, they'd sit down at the lunch table and they'd "So-and-so is going to have trouble." They never entered into anything either. 

</p><p>And, you know, like, occasionally, they'd [won in] (ph). I can remember one day, or, I don't know. Somebody got upset with my mother, who was on the phone and had done nothing. You know, she rarely came into town. She wasn't a person you could really get mad at, because she never did anything. And I went into the telephone company, and this woman who was mad at my mother just, you know, really ridiculed me in front of the man that was working there.

</p><p>And I - you know, like I've never forgiven her, like I've never forgiven [Denny's fire] either. There have been two women in the town that have gotten rid - gotten mad at my mother, and have taken it out on me. And that's part of the way I would be if I kicked the dog. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes it is. But it's not the dog you want to be kicking, it's Carol.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's Carol. It's her dog, and she should know better than that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So then, you're really pretty angry with Carol.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, not angry, I'm just a little disgusted that she really - you know, because she's really such a nice lady, and she would just do anything for you. But she's going to be the one that gets into trouble, you know. Because somebody's going to demand that she do something with that dog, and she's just going to, you know, it's going to just... she's going to get really upset, I know. [14:24]

</p><p>Because she always takes the part of the dog, which I just, you know, it's so hard for me to go along with that, never having a great love for any animal. I can't...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't make very much sense.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't see that the dog would be right and the kids would be always wrong. You know, even if they are teasing the dog. Some of the boys were teasing the dog. And they're boys.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've got to [respect to] (ph) them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and if she doesn't want her dog to eat something then maybe she'd better keep it in the house. Before he bites somebody. But she's really... kind of an interesting person, anyway. 

</p><p>I don't know, I suppose it is a good thing to get involved, but on the other hand, it's just... it just doesn't seem worth it over a dog and then, you know. Just seems like it should be something a little more important.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why?

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, I do attack people who stand and watch things, and here I am standing and watching. But it just seems that that's not really the one I want to wet my feet, you know... [16:48]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There are like, bigger things that demand being involved.

</p><p>PATIENT: Or something a little more important than a neighbor and a dog (crosstalk). Well, you don't know that that's going to be the eventual outcome.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's like just in some remote chance, or medium-remote chance that the dog is going to bite a child, so that's not a... it just isn't a very important or... Or, it's like if you could see - well I guess part of what's hanging me up is I'm not sure what is a... what is a thing where getting off the sidelines...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. It seems like I can't - or, even Dick was telling about this accident he witnessed today. And it really, was really sad. It was a stolen car, this black man, and he had a pregnant wife and two children in it. And the man who owned the car saw it coming down 60th, and he swerved over to make his stop, and the guy hit the tree and got out of the car and started running. 

</p><p>You know, and the kids all scattered and left, and Dick said this woman was really, you know, like the dashboard on her side was really bent up. And he said, you know, like, he could see this man who was, you know, rage and all of these things. And now that seems like the kind you ought to be able to help. Somebody like that, which has got a little more important problem. [18:46]

</p><p>You know, like kids that are born and raised in the ghetto and nothing's ever gone right for him. Even when he steals a car he can't get away with it, you know, and his whole life comes tumbling down. And, you know, like I feel more, more sorry for this man who felt that he had to have that car to build his ego and prove that he was a man, or worthwhile, or something.

</p><p>I don't know that he thinks [I would] (ph), but that would be my interpretation. You know, I think I - that's who I would like to help. But, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Rather than?

</p><p>PATIENT: Than Carol and her dog.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I - (inaudible) you're helping Carol and the dog some way.

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I heard you helping the kids, potentially helping the kids.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I kind of thought that Carol would agree with me, and say, yes, I think that I should probably keep that dog under veil, you know, to protect the kids. Or to protect the dog. It could be shot, or (inaudible). But I know how she'll react, and there's not - it's not going to do any good to go over and say, "Now listen, Carol, this has gone far enough. The kids can't come out in the back yard, the dog's going to bite somebody and you're going to be in trouble." She wouldn't believe that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the thing that's bothering you - or my guess, I'm not sure - but the thing that's bothering you, that's hanging you up, isn't that somehow it's less important than the man with the car, though it may be, but the thing hanging you up is basically you'd like the thought of Kathy (ph) going over there and having to (inaudible) with her.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I just - I couldn't do it. I don't think I could carry it off. And it would be to no avail. [20:54]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But not carrying it off is something other than - like those are two different things, not carrying it off and it being to no avail?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. The fact that she wouldn't believe it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No matter what you said.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean, I just know her too well to know that she would accept that. And I think she'd get her feelings hurt, and what good would it do? She still wouldn't keep the dog in, the dog would still be a potential danger.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So what's preventing you from doing it is the thought that it's conflict (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that there's no reason to do it. Other than, you know, to make an enemy. That'd be about the only thing you'd get out of it. I think, sometimes I think, well, if you don't kind of force yourself to, to go in and, you know, meet something head-on, then you're never going to. I mean, you're going to stand there and watch forever.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. There has to be a first time that you commit yourself to doing something, or there'll never be. Never be a time. So maybe what you're doing, maybe it's just a cop out. [22:52]

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I really don't know what it is. I'm sure that if it were my child - well, I'm not even sure that if it were my child I'd do it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't know if there are any circumstances that would make you...

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I don't. Because we've lived with, you know, we've lived around people who, I should have gone over and said, "Look, get your kids off the street. They're juvenile delinquents," you know. And I tried one time, and the lady was... the only thing she said to me, you know. She didn't say anything. She shrugged her shoulders. So... 

</p><p>And it was because I was - this little girl had pushed down my daughter, and I said, "Pam, you've got to stop that," and she said, "Oh, shut up." And she was about seven and I said well, her mother really needs to know. But, you know, I was so mad, and I was just shaking. And that's - I just, I can't face people like that. You know, you can't talk intelligently -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When you're (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Ooh, I was so mad at that little girl. I was so mad at her parents, you know, for allowing her to say something like that. And even though you'd like to help the kids, because you know what they're going to be like when they're in high school. Or even seventh grade, they're going to be little terrors. [24:42]

</p><p>If you can't get through to the parents because you're in such a state, what good does it do to go over? It didn't even relieve me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were still stuck feeling furious.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. There was just nothing you could do. Oh, I was so mad, I was shaking all day. That was the first time I'd had a little kid tell me to shut up.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All you could do is sort of be impotently angry.

</p><p>PATIENT: All day long.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you experienced the anger and it's crowding out anything else. Like you can't -

</p><p>PATIENT: Like your common sense.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you're aware that your judgment (inaudible). You can't be angry and also express that coherently, pay attention to the other person. Just (inaudible) why you dislike somebody, that's when you can focus on them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well... Yeah. I probably would have cried if she'd, you know, said, "Well, maybe you should have shut up," or something like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just would have dissolved in a heap of tears? [26:25]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't have that much armor, I guess, to go out into a battle. But the fact that she said nothing, you know... said to me, where do you go from there? My only alternative was to turn around and go out. 

You know, some people can go to a mother and sit down over a cup of coffee and talk to them civilized. But I always wait until something is just gone so far... that you just, you just have to say something. My children were not safe on the street. I had to take them to the doctor twice while we lived there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did you say something like you wait too long and you let it build and build and build until you can't do anything because it's too big?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Then I, you know, all of these things I've been so mad about, you know, they all trying to surface and I can't even talk.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like all of a sudden inside, you're having a crescendo of feelings.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, and you just don't scream at your neighbor. Like, say, I would have - like I would have my husband, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The kinds of things you want to do when that emotion (inaudible) throttle inside. The kinds of things you want to do are things that aren't right.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not (inaudible) acceptable. They probably would have been in that neighborhood. I could have done anything and fit right in.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In that neighborhood anything goes?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh my. They had shouting matches between the old ladies, I'd never seen that before. I just stood with my mouth open. You know, calling each other names and things, you have to run and get your kids off the street before they (ph) hurt. (Inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I'm hearing you - the reason why I asked that is, it sort of sounds like anything went with them, but not for you. [29:16]

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I didn't fit in there, because I wasn't trying to raise my kids to... You know, and they were so proud when their girls - they had three girls - could fight, you know, and beat up on the other kids. That was what they...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Cheat (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Rather than reading, writing, or arithmetic. They could protect themselves on the playground. They were rated very highly. We finally moved and I felt much better about it, but, you know, some things you just never forget. You know, like that's the way they were raising their children.

</p><p>It's probably the way they were raised. And it just keeps going and going and you just - there's nothing you could do to stop it. Why even try? [30:38]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like being (ph) that, like it's some sort of steamroller that you can't - or a juggernaut, that you can't make a dent on. All it does is like, crush you. Like all these people are angry, and you're sort of... Even if you're furious and shaking with rage, like, you're sort of powerless. You can't do anything.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I didn't think I was until after Dick had these books home, you know, where it says, very hard to break the chain. You know, you're like your parents and they did things to - made you like them. You know? And at the time, I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen, the way they were raising their children to be so (inaudible)... you know, and I didn't really understand.

</p><p>But I don't think it would have done any good if I'd have understood that they couldn't help it. You know? I mean, it's still upsetting when your kid comes in with bruises and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, regardless of what the reason, the ultimate cause, is.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just - I don't think I'm ever going to be that...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because, you know... So everybody has their own problems, but yours is like bringing up your children in one piece. [32:46]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So in the abstract it [sort of] (ph) makes some sort of sense, but when it's your child, that's (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, and they were babies. They could just barely toddle around and they'd already...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like they were tumbling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and they were so wounded out there every time they'd go out, some kid would shove them down just for sport, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think people are sort of trapped... You know, if everybody isn't trying to, to be better than they really are, or to change themselves, then what good does it do for some people to? Are they just supposed to accept the fact that other people are like they are, and isn't that a shame? [34:14]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean something like, are the people, are the conscientious people, or the moral people, or whatever, I'm not sure what to call it, are they supposed to just be shoved around by the Neanderthals of the world?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's not very just.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. But I mean, I'm wondering how it's going to be when my kids are like, attacked by the ghetto kids that live across the street.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't - you mean, like are they going to can be all understanding, and -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I'm doing better than them. The white middle class that lived next door to them when they were babies. I mean, these kids are going to attack with guns and knives.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're going to be just as vicious, or... (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Probably [going to] (ph) be. I just don't know what... you know. What's going to be expected of me, or what I'm going to have to put out. When the kids get older and they're problems are a little different than, you know. Like even getting to school (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You make it sound as if you sort of see the future for your children, like, in terms of basic survival. And, like, you're wondering - I'm not clear, exactly. Something about you in that, that you're wondering about.

</p><p>PATIENT: How. How I'm going to produce, you know. What am I going to do? [36:35]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How are you going to (inaudible)? Are you going to (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Am I going to become hysterical?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Go to pieces.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like, "Get me out of here." Because it's getting a little frightening around where we live right now. You know, I don't even feel safe out for a walk. There are times on campus when I don't feel safe when it's deserted, you know. You see a nut coming towards you. It really is hard. You want to teach your children compassion, you know, and like, to trust people. And then you're saying, "Come on, let's go. This guy's a nut. He's going to get you," you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like, how do you teach them compassion and (inaudible) need some sense of serenity (inaudible) you're really uptight and fearful yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I feel like I don't - I'm not much of a protector, you know. Maybe if you were by yourself you could run.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you have the responsibility.

</p><p>PATIENT: You've got your children with you, then you kind of have to stand ground and do battle or something. [38:08]

And I have never been personally attacked yet. And it's like I'm afraid of what's going to happen when I - you know, when it's my turn.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you can almost anticipate that happening.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm sure. Like all of my neighbors have been. It's like their number's up.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A matter of time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Depending on how long you stay around here and how cautious you are.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So, in a way, it sounds like you're just sort of... doing, waiting for it to happen.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I hadn't really thought about it until right now. One of my friends turned around and hit him with a purse, and Dick said, "Well, I hope you have the presence of mind to do that," and I'm thinking that maybe if I hadn't have heard that, that I would just, you know, be standing there shaking, wondering what to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean, if someone didn't coach you...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd be hard to self-defend.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It'd be absolutely futile. You're no good at all.

</p><p>PATIENT: But it probably depends on what they have in their hand. If they have a knife or a gun, then no amount of self defense is going to make me go up against that. I'm just petrified about these two articles.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If they have a knife or a gun, you know they're (inaudible at 40:25). It's all over.

</p><p>PATIENT: Whatever they want to do is fine with me. 

</p><p>When I first moved here, I wasn't frightened at all. And the more, the more stories you hear, the worse you get. You're just a little more suspicious of everybody that rings your doorbell.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like now - like in the beginning, it was like, it felt like an all right place. And now it's like you're always (inaudible). Put that behind you. (Inaudible) in the hall (ph). Anything like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd be even suspicious if a man rang the doorbell at my folks'. At my parents', at 9:00 one night and I thought, you know, my father was in bed asleep and my mother didn't come back, and I had to go out and check who was there and what he was about. I couldn't just sit there. It's too, too long in the city, I guess. You know, like, they don't even have that trouble.

</p><p>The things I read, you know, like I just take them too much to heart, I think. Like, In Cold Blood, Mary was on the farm wondering when those guys were coming. You know, I really, I'd lay there in bed and I was thinking, well, what am I going to do? You know, it's really... it's silly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But very, very real.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's very frightening, you know. And I used to - the longer I'd lay there, the more noises I heard. I even imagined I heard the glass breaking in the front door, and I had to go, you know, I had to go down and see. Which was kind of dumb. You know, if it had have been I could just -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's like the worst thing you could have done.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I had everything all planned out, you know, when I heard the first shot, what I was going to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like the suspicion and the fear against something like corroded you, so that even in a situation where it's not appropriate at all - pretty inappropriate - it's just the same. It's like just waiting for it to happen, and like living through each alternative, turning it over and obsessing about it. Working yourself up into a...

</p><p>PATIENT: I was just really petrified that one night that I had heard that noise. [44:15]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You must live with the certainty that the next moment you're going to be hurt, or your life's going to end.

</p><p>PATIENT: Or something's going to happen. Yeah, I really... And it's just been since I've been here in Chicago. I think they advertise their criminals way too much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why? Because if you didn't know so much about them...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I didn't read the paper, I might be a lot better off. Or I didn't read a novel.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that sort of stimulates your mind.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like it's not even imagination, you know. Because all of these things that I'm thinking are going to happen, have happened to somebody other than me. And one night - and this, is really horrible, I hate to even admit it - but I can remember we had a columnist like Ann Landers, only she was a serious person. Like Ask Beth, who was very serious.

</p><p>This girl had written that her father came to her in bed. And one night I could - I thought I heard him coming up the stair steps. I mean, that is just... you know. Like I'm off my rocker. And there I am laying in bed wondering what I'm going to do when my father comes up. And all of these things that I've read about, you know, are just - it's like Dick said, I read to many novels. I've got to cut that out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you're used to yourself as being like, crazy when that happens. Like being (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, over that particular one. And even about In Cold Blood, oh well, you know, it could happen again. (Inaudible) you need to lay awake and wonder what you're going to do about it, because you're probably not going to have time to do anything if it does happen. And I even said that to myself, "Well, why don't you just lay here and wait." And I'm all right if Dick's around.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If Dick's around it's OK, but if you're alone, then like, you're really tortured. [47:38]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, I don't want to die by myself, you know? I think that would be awfully horrible. I want to go with my friends.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why not?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I don't want to die. But I think it would be easier, you know, if you're going to - you don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it would be easier to die if you were among friends. I'm sure that my friends would rather I went alone, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's something about this dying with people who care for you...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I don't know. I might not be that particular, maybe I just, you know, die with anybody. I [don't mind] (ph). I just don't want to do it myself. I find [my times] (ph) that I'm really afraid of almost everything. And sometimes, you know, I can really work myself up to being afraid. Like, I don't like to fly. Even though that I know it's safe. And I don't like to drive... with Dick. I'd rather drive myself, I feel better about it.

</p><p>I know it's safer to fly, but I'm always, you know, like I'm going to be on the plane with a guy that's going to commit suicide, you know, and he takes the whole plane.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like some days, though, you really can feel uncomfortable (ph) doing and you're sort of lying in bed and pulling the covers over your head. That's about the safest place to be and the safest activity to be doing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then probably the place would catch on fire, and you'd be... Yes, I think I am a little afraid of living, you know? [50:21]

</p><p>I'm OK when I'm doing it, except for driving. I still don't like to drive. I've had too many accidents, and I just feel like the next one is, you know, you can only have so many. I don't know if that's a statistic or not. But I'm OK like when I finally got in the plane, and I had to put on my front so the girls could have a good time. And then I just, you know, everybody else is having a great time themselves. I forgot about planes crashing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like as long as you're, like, doing something or involved in something, it's all right. But it's like the being alone and anticipating just drives you up a wall.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I don't carry it that far, like I don't stay all - the day before I'm going to fly, and say, "I hate to fly, I hate to fly." But I think about it, like before we're getting on the plane. I hate to fly, you know. The first plane that I took off in I thought I was going to fall apart. I think you should stat with a good plane.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, it isn't that you sit and stew, it's more like, sounds like what happens is like the terror kind of tugs away at the edges of... of what you're doing. [53:04]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's kind of, well, it kind of occurs to you that this might be the last flight you ever make, or, when you get into a car, that this might be your last drive. And in the city it doesn't bother me, because you're going so slow. But to get back to Nebraska and start driving...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Seventy-five miles per hour (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And like, I won't - I don't drive without a safety belt. But I let my kids drive without a safety belt. I'm not that... frantic, I guess, about, you know, like, I must not really believe we're going to smash up or I'd have them... although that would be a horrible ride. Because they'd be hiding in every (inaudible). And then we probably would have an accident. I look around, there are a lot of things that I'm afraid of.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You [sound surprised] (ph) (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, in everyday life, you know, you don't sit and think, "What am I afraid of?" But I'm really petrified of the third floor, because I've caught the kids leaning over the banisters. You know, they could just - it shakes you for the rest of the day, because you know if they fell, or that rickety old banister broke, that they'd be dead and that would be the end of it. Or it smashed beyond help. And they're not afraid of height, which is really hard too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They don't know any fear, so that increases the...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, so they aren't careful. I caught my two year old outside the banister, hanging over (ph). And, you know, you don't want to scream at her. You don't want to faint, that would be no good either. But I would like to pound it into them somehow, without them being so fearful of heights forever, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like [what I did] (ph), where you are now is that it's like, you know, it's like having them do that and being helpless to do very much of anything to stop it. Like not being able to... get them away from the banister. [56:34]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So when they're out there, and if you're not out there, I imagine you must just start Kathy waiting for the, for the cringe, thinking of...

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the first thing I think of, when there is a scream. And then I think well, they're screaming, they're still alive, you know. But we've both [have severely] (ph) had fights over that. Amy came sauntering in one day and said, "Danielle's (ph) stuck on the banister." We just ran over her to get to Danielle, who was, indeed, stuck on the banister. But it wouldn't have killed her if she'd have fallen off, she was inside (inaudible). But they aren't afraid, which is why I'm doubly afraid, I guess. 

</p><p>Because one day the neighbor girl told Amy to jump across those banisters, you know, on the third floor. I was just shaky for all day after that. Because she's so (inaudible) she would. My neighbor lady said she had her leg up ready to jump.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's such a na�ve, unquestioning child that it would be...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, she just trusts everybody, I guess. [58:14]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you really have to watch over her, especially.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't hover over her, you know, like I just...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But then again, to hold yourself back to not hover...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but like I've seen that too. And there's the kids that are afraid of everything. Well, I wish there was just a happy medium. Like, if you want to find my daughter, you have to look in a tree. Or on a roof, or someplace. Because she's always up there [laughs].

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's always, like, tempting fate. Where it's the most dangerous place for her to be, that's where she is. [What should be done] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: I read a story about vampires when I was at my mother's house. And that even kept me awake, even though I knew that - well, I didn't know it for sure, I guess. (Inaudible) vampires.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's funny, you're saying, like, I'm hearing you come across two ways. You're kind of making fun of that, but it sounds like you really [think it's something] (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I really don't know quite for sure, I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or at least then (inaudible) worth it [ inaudible at 60:01] Like (inaudible) seems very real to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible). I mean, it's really lonely out there. You could be dead for weeks and (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Anything could happen (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: It'd be a lot more burglars out there if they knew (inaudible at 60:42).

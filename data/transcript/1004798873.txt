<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. I put a bid in, not a bid an application in for an apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I am at an hour and a half.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will look.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. But it's kind of tough to go (inaudible at 00:00:18). You know the apartment rental system here is a lot like the insurance system or like the town (ph) system, basically you are getting fucked and you can't do anything about it. And that is hard for both of us, but I think especially for James. I think he was expecting it less and I think (inaudible at 0:49). Yeah.</p>

<p>So, we'd handle it. Sometimes well, sometimes not so well. [00:01:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is one conversation where, I actually don't remember either what came before or what came after it, but like I just, but James was like upset with me because I wasn't seeing how awful this was. I just often—I think I am leaving out the part where, I understand why you are outraged and I am equally outraged. That is there. That is about as good. But we still have to do this. These are the choices we have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like part of it is that we are not going to be able to afford basically any apartment, unless we borrow money from his parents to help pay for it. Which they have offered repeatedly and James has said, you know that he thinks that they really want to be helping in a concrete way because they are really concerned about me and about us. [00:02:22]</p>

<p>They want to be doing something, but then not people who will just show up and give you things, like they need you to ask for what they need or for what you need.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he is also, really doesn't like borrowing money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like really really doesn't like it. And so my (inaudible at 02:37). He is like, "I guess I kind of have to get over it". And I was like, You need to get over it. They have, you know. (pause) It has been like, I can't, I haven't really been able to afford to be in this situation where I fall apart in the last couple of days. [00:03:02]</p>

<p>Like or any other times, where we are doing something, it's like James really needs me to be okay. And so I was kind of saying, the reason we're in this situation, where we have no money is that, I am sick and there is frustration where I can't bring in enough money. So, your parents are offering this to make things easier for us. And I need you to take them up, like I need you take us, them up on it. So I think it works out, it's a good work out but-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not the (inaudible at 03:49)</p>

<p>(pause) [00:03:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not physically fit, sorry it's still disgusting. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know, I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When will you find out about the application you put in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This morning. James was going to college after he (inaudible at 04:21). (pause) Well hopefully this morning, she said this morning but who knows. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, I really like the apartment actually. It's a studio, a big studio. Right north of the Commons, off of the Avenue on First Street, one of those great big apartment buildings. But it is better taken care of than most of the apartments that we have ever rented. [00:05:01]</p>

<p>And has really nice light and high ceilings and hardwood floors, which like makes me really happy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's pretty. You know, there is serious structural damage from the, a bathtub not being caulked right, which is going to bother James, but I was like, that is really not our problem. So (chuckles), I am okay with it. But it's like $1500. And so-yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you pay now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I pay $825 for one bedroom. Yeah, Kirsten and I were paying like $1600-1700 for our two bedroom, but James was paying, he started at $450, his apartment. And granted it was a hell hole but that wasn't an unreasonable price. [00:06:04]</p>

<p>It's just adjusting and also saying, what we could afford to pay is more like $1200-1300 and saying no that's not going to happen. It's just not, unless we want to commute an hour and we don't, we just can't do that. But, so if we got it, it would be perfect location wise because it would be between here and where I work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just sucks to be homeless. (pause) And to have help James through his feeling helpless, when I feel just as helpless and I also feel like it's all my fault. Go ahead. [00:07:02]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said last time, I don't remember if this is exactly what he said, but something like, I am asking the wrong questions. I was talking, I have been really focused on how could this have happened? Like how? Why was my childhood the way it was? Why does this happen? You know what I mean? He was like, Ohmygod, ohmygod, and he is pointing out (chuckles) that I am really focusing on the externals rather than on what it feels like for me or felt like for me. I think you're right. [00:07:58]</p>

<p>I want you to be right but I think you are right. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how (pause). My little brother's birthday was yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is 21. I talked to him on the phone at night and it sounds like it's a really boring birthday, unfortunately. He had to write a paper. </p>

<p>But Amanda, I just found this, this morning, and I didn't get a chance to check Facebook yesterday even with my cough (ph) because of art and things. She posted this very silly thing of, hey Jason Timpleton is turning 21 today, and he is a wonderful, kind, wise person who also has a deep penchant toward the ridiculous. [00:09:01]</p>

<p>So in honor of that, and to the fact that he eschews Facebook, lets all talk about what we think of when we think of Jason. It was really sweet. So all these people, that we knew when Jason was a baby, when I was really little, kind of came out of the woodwork and were like (inaudible at 9:26) about Jason. And the one that I kind of caught onto from my own purpose (ph) was a woman who, she was one of the kids in the family that was across the street and two doors up that were friends were us, their youngest kid was in Amanda's class and their two older daughters babysat us all at various times. [00:10:00]</p>

<p>Kind of awesome and totally insane family, like nuts. They had seven dogs. They had coonhounds who could climb up, were bred to be able to climb trees after raccoons. So, they would climb up on the refrigerator and eat the cat's food. (chuckles) But what she said, well what I remember most about Jason is trying to change his dirty diapers frantically at 8:05 in the morning, when your dad was frantically running around trying to get everybody dressed and fed and out the door at 7:55. I was like, yes that sounds about right. (pause) [00:10:55]</p>

<p>I don't know where I was going with that, other than that, I kind of seized on that and was like, see he was working really hard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's the truth. (pause)</p>

<p>We were late to school two out of three days a week. (chuckles) (pause) I hate being late. I really don't mind when other people are late but I hate being late. (pause) [00:11:57]</p>

<p>I don't know. I don't-(pause) I don't know how to ask the right questions or yeah I can't really get a handle on it. (pause) It's like trying to pop a balloon with a pin when you only have one hand, if that makes sense. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With a dull pin (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright (inaudible at 12:45)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what— [00:12:58] (pause)</p>

<p>So, I guess you're frustrated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) I have been thinking also, about this kind of puzzle of the subject of an object of a subjective experience or memory and objective of what actually happened and which matters why and which matters more. [00:14:13]</p>

<p>I'm not sure why I am so insistent to myself at least that it matters what actually went down. (pause) I mean, I guess it's in part because I (pause) this could change the way that my dad and I are today, are now. [00:14:59]</p>

<p>And I don't want (pause) I don't want to be unfair to him. (pause) But pretty much don't want to hurt him period. It is not a very good reason. (pause) I'm not at my best thinking today (ph). I know, I know. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, I often-it's like sometimes I feel like I have some kind of clarity of vision. I know where I am and what I am feeling and what I am. [00:16:07]</p>

<p>I feel like sometimes I am more in touch with myself than others and this is going to be (inaudible at 16:11). So when I say that I'm not doing my best thinking, it's not just thinking, I don't-(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You could be] (ph) less insightful or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. Less grounded. Cloudier. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you tell me anymore about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I have to go to work at 10. I'm tired. I haven't been getting enough sleep. [00:16:59]</p>

<p>Mostly because I'm working more, which is good, I mean that was the goal, but I'm not used to having (pause) having less downtime anymore. I have kind of gotten used to being able to take things at a certain pace and now that pace means I'm getting like six hours of sleep instead of 8 or 9.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I need to change that. (pause) The last couple of days have been really rough and or moderately to severe rough at least and (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what happened? [00:17:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just (pause) I wanted, I had yesterday off, which was the first day in seven days a week that I didn't have to go to work (inaudible at 18:06). And (pause) the day before yesterday, I don't remember what happened the day before yesterday. But the last couple of days have been working on this apartment, and as part of that James and I kind of fought and then we kind of made up and got to a place where we were standing on the same earth and were in a good place. It has been a lot of holding myself in and I have tried to say to James, look this is not, this just isn't going to happen ever, I am going to fall apart at some point. It is just a matter of when and how. [00:19:07]</p>

<p>To his credit, he has been really good about that and so the night before last, I ended up talking with him from a long time about what you and I have been talking about (pause) Just being really confused and angry and sad. (pause) And yesterday, he was just at the end of his rope, he was. So I needed to step up and I could step up in terms of making dinner and letting him take a nap and taking care of him. [00:20:05]</p>

<p>And really not falling apart. But I feel like, when I have to do that, I don't know. Maybe it-(pause) it muddies the water, but that's not a very good analogy. Or that's not a very good phrase. (pause) Have you seen a light board for a theater ever? I am just thinking of, I did lighting in high school and college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's not actually; you don't need the specific image. Basically, a whole bunch of wires plugged into one big box that has 100 different plugs and it's like you pulled all of them out and just dropped them on the ground. Then the wires go all over the theater and to all the different lights. [00:21:10]</p>

<p>At some point later one, you try to plug them back in but they are all in the wrong places and it's not-(pause) Yeah, things aren't working right. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, so it's a bunch of light in the theater and there is this box and there is wires coming from all the lights to the box. And what is it that you are plugging into the box? Like power for the lights?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just like-(crosstalk) I don't remember what it's called. Some kind of board, but whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. And so? [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was as if you unplugged all of them, 100 and then just dropped them, which you do sometimes when, I forget the reasons, usually when it's time to take the set down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but then if you wanted to just get the lights power that you need for the show, you would have to plug them into the right sockets or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if it got all unplugged say because you needed to fix something to do with the soundboard, then plugging them all back in, it's like they all-(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a fuse box in a house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I haven't seen very many fuse boxes in houses (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is a box in the basement where there is a bunch of fuses, so if you've got five hairdryers going on one circuit in the house (crosstalk) and then you go down and you sort of fix it. [00:22:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it is actually exactly the same thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just had to spend a lot more time (inaudible at 23:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you feel like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's like my emotions are kind of up and running again but like I was really upset last night. And really wanted to hurt myself most of the day and evening. And was really angry with myself but there wasn't anything, any reason for, I couldn't figure out why I was so upset and so I (inaudible at 23:45). (pause) I don't know. (pause) [00:23:56]</p>

<p>And then James a couple of times, he has said "Thank you for taking care of me today". And that made me more angry at myself. (pause) As best as I can tell, because I've felt like I haven't really done very much and so if this is what it takes for James to feel taken care of, then I'm doing a pretty shitty job of it the rest of the time. But I don't even actually think that is true. (pause) [00:24:57]</p>

<p>Like watching TV with James, he will start a conversation about the characters motivations and the dynamic, the psychological dynamics and then he will start talking and I will realize I actually really don't want to talk about this, like I really want you to be quiet now. (chuckles) I'm sorry (inaudible at 25:16). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why you don't want to have that conversation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think as soon as James answers, I realize that he and I weren't exactly on the same page, in the same ballpark but not exactly thinking the same thing. It felt like it was just going to be to exhausting to try to explain what I was thinking to him. [00:25:59]</p>

<p>(pause) I'm not sure that was actually what it was, but that was what it felt like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It was a scene in which two divorced parents are talking about the daughter. (chuckles) It's the only scene in the entire series where Buffy's parents are in the same shot or together and it was them talking about how they are concerned about Buffy because she has been acting out and being distant and whatever. [00:27:03]</p>

<p>It just felt completely wrong to me, it just felt, the scene wasn't working. And when I eventually centered in on-I just thought it was, people who divorce and amicable for the sake of kids, I feel like it is way less likely that they are going to be less tense when the kid is not in the room than when the kid is. It just seemed unrealistic to me. But then James was like, "Is that how it was with your parents?" I was like, I actually don't know. Things deteriorated over time between my parents. Definitionally, I never get to see them when I'm not around. I only see them when I'm there, when they are both very very careful not to yell at each other or disagree or bring up issues and always has been. [00:28:16]</p>

<p>It always has been very cold and stiff and clearly super uncomfortable. But really really careful not so much present a united front as not attack one another when they are together. (pause) The only thing that Papa did really well was that he never said anything bad about my mom ever. [00:28:56] Until I started to come to him with mama is doing this and it hurts me and I don't understand. (pause) Then it tended to be along the lines of, yeah I don't understand it either. She's got issues or yeah that was a problem. (chuckles) But that was as I was an older teenager and adult. But my mom would say bad things about Papa-(pause) [00:30:01]</p>

<p>(pause) The other night after I was (inaudible at 30:49). Mike was like wow, you actually have daddy issues. (laughs) This is coming as news to you? He was like yes, yes it is. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>I was-what? (chuckles) Of course I do. Come on. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I was thinking about Buffy and how-you know she is sort of really cared for in certain ways, like she is sort of out there in this war in which she is very much on her own. [00:32:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well the point of the show and I'm not sure, they don't always do it very well is to say, no one can do it alone. Is to say that she is in some sense very much alone but she has this group of friends and mentors who protect and support and are there for her. And she tries at various times tries to push them away and then almost, they are the reason that she can continue to exist. The point is that the lone hero is not actually okay (ph). [00:32:54]</p>

<p>Like the lone hero dies pretty fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think one of the real mistakes that the show makes is that, I don't know if it is a mistake, I don't know. I think that the show doesn't handle the adult characters very well, at least in the first few seasons. (pause) But generally she feels like she is alone. (pause) Most shows have like a central theme that we will do an episode without at least two or three times a season, like Bones did, emotional versus intellectual theme, which is stupid. [00:34:04]</p>

<p>(chuckles) Sorry, I think it's very stupid. I think they handle it very poorly. It drives me nuts. I think that's what it is for Buffy. Sometimes during the season, she kind of tries to push people away or feels like people are failing her and sort of withdraws and then is like nope that is not actually how it works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that is the reason or one of the major reasons it really speaks to me. He (ph) profoundly needs that message, Yeah. [00:34:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You like observe, (pause) you've (inaudible at 35:04) because that is not really actually how it works.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so why isn't she a (inaudible at 35:35), I mean she is generally fighting the demons, in part by herself, no?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In part, sometimes. She is the one who is strong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She is the one who is always kicking the ass.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. [00:35:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I hear that she is sort of like in this web of people that is close to who kind of crucially support her and often (pause) kind of like with James and his parents. Where he doesn't want to think about it and-that is the situation and there they are and so okay. This can be sort of that with Buffy certainly where she wants to help and wants to be alone and wants to do it all herself but gets the help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean it's very much a team show and they are a team of they have different things, which is important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of which, realistically, I am like why didn't Adrian (ph) and Willow take up serious martial arts training? [00:37:00]</p>

<p>Once they found they were going to have to be dealing with people trying to kill them or (inaudible at 37:05) (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But regardless-(pause) Sorry, I am both listening to you and trying to figure out how you are trying to relate this to me so (laughs). I can't turn it off. (pause) I don't know. PD James says at least once in one of her novels, she is a mystery novelist, everybody dies alone. [00:38:04]</p>

<p>No matter where it is, everybody dies their own death. Everybody dies alone. (pause) I don't know. That is to whether people are potentially alone or not. (inaudible) (pause)</p>

<p>It feels that way for me but it also feels like I have a whole lot of people who want to be with me. [00:39:05]</p>

<p>(pause) But we can't. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just (inaudible) you are dependable and I wish more people were talking about (inaudible at 39:29) how you feel about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, one of the things that is terrifying for me is that I don't know how other people are feeling so when I, or how other people feel, or what the scale is, it's so-when I feel so badly and that is really hard not to kill myself. [00:40:07]</p>

<p>I don't know. I don't know how I can even talk to anybody else knowing that most people seem to feel that way most of the time. It just puts us in different universes in some ways, but I also don't think that that is true at all in other ways. I can't get up straight (ph). (pause) [00:40:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe this is, I did not really have an agenda in mind when I asked about or something about the, somehow it's just something that struck me there that I kind of don't quite put (ph) put a handle on it. Is why I mentioned it. But one thing that I think is common to you and Buffy (ph) in that so far we are leaving out, not so much the vampire hunting (chuckles). You know there is the question of sort of how alone she feels and how alone she really is. The other side of it is that, she is totally dedicated to the world for everybody else (ph). When she is not kicking ass, so much at not keeping herself safe because she is worried about getting (crosstalk) [00:42:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She is saving the world for everybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I hadn't thought about that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I imagine might be something you also feel very complete (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's gotten easier for me to justify taking care of myself, even in very basic ways like sleeping. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 42:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well that doesn't fall into the basic category for me, but certainly (chuckles) [00:43:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're working on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That is still not easy. It has gotten easier for me to just start taking care of myself over time, taking care of myself without needing another reason for it, but certainly when I was 17 or 18 and having-hitting a real wall and having you're being really really sad. The only way I could say no, no, no I have to pull myself out of it, is to be like, I am a good (inaudible at 43:46) in my life. That is not basically true. (pause) [00:43:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stop. (inaudible at 44:05)</p>

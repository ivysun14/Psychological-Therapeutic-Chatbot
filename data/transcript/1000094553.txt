<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Josephine</p>

<p>HEATHER: Hey Josephine. It is Heather.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just you and me so far?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. Good. I am just reviewing the home work you sent in and I so so loved it. So let me check my e-mail. I checked my e-mail like a half an hour ago and I did not have anybody else's homework. Have you checked recently? </p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah, I did not see anything just right before I called.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Alright. </p>

<p>HEATHER: Anyone not going to be here today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me see. No I think everybody is. To the best of my recollection, everybody is going to be here. </p>

<p>HEATHER: Ok. I was supposed to go to the Living Jungle today but my back was too sore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: So I was not able to go but I will go another time. It is pretty fun there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is nice. I have taken my grandkids there before. It is very nice as a matter of fact. </p>

<p>JULIE: Hi it is Julie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Julie.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Hi Julie, this is Heather.</p>

<p>JULIE: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is you, me and Heather so far.</p>

<p>JULIE: Just us three.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep, just us three so far.</p>

<p>JULIE: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is your weather up where you are Julie? Are you snowed in?</p>

<p>JULIE: No, we got a really really bad snow I think it was last week. It was heavy heavy ice snow. We still have a lot of that. It is sunny today just a little overcast. I think that we are hopefully out of the winter weather. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I got your e-mail Julie about it does not work for you to continue with the group, it looks like you have too many outside commitments for the next ten weeks that you would be missing too many.</p>

<p>JULIE: Yeah, for May and June.</p>

<p>JULIAN: Jillian is here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Jillian.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You and I have a session tomorrow Julie, so you can either talk about it now and or tomorrow that would be fine.</p>

<p>JULIE: You got my message about the time for tomorrow?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did not get that message. Was that in the same e-mail?</p>

<p>JULIE: It was. Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oops. Ok. What was the message? Sorry guys.</p>

<p>JULIE: He is usually home but he has time off so he is gone tomorrow. So I did not know if you have a 9:00 between 9:00 and 12:00 tomorrow while the kids are at school? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a 10:00.</p>

<p>JULIE: Ok. That works out fine.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Hey there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi, is that Holly?</p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi we are just waiting for everybody to come on line. Lucy, I think, is going to be here Sylvia, Susan and Phyllis, although I know Sylvia may be in that really bad east coast storm that is going on. I have not heard from her. I assume that she is going to be online unless they have lost their phone. She usually leaves a message since she does not have a lot of e-mail access.</p>

<p>HOLLY: If I mute out a couple of times it is because I am doing laundry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want to compliment you guys who responded to Susan. I was just so so in awe and proud of the way you guys rallied around her and encouraged her. Just was really touching. I am hoping that she shows up too. I think that our shame, if we have a relapse, is pretty overwhelming. I am hoping that the fact that she reached out and you guys reached out back I am hoping can break that pattern. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Did she keep any of her appointments with you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. She had the appointments before group last week and we try to have them while she is at work which is really hard if she is in a meeting then. </p>

<p>She cannot make it. This week I see her in person in San Francisco and hopefully we will get squared away on it. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>LUCY: Hello it is Lucy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Lucy.</p>

<p>
LUCY: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Lucy, we are just waiting for Sylvia and Susan and Phyllis.</p>

<p>LUCY: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did talk to Phyllis on Monday. She had been out of town for a week. It sounds like it went really good and she stayed abstinent, so I am hoping that she gets checked in with you guys. Did anybody besides Heather attempt the homework? </p>

<p>HOLLY: I am almost done with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>JULIAN: This is Jillian. I am writing it out right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p> JILIAN: I did not like some of it though. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is one of the biggest ones... how to separate abstinence from nutritionally healthy eating or self care... abstinence from self care. Obviously sobriety is not simply a self care issue. Our abstinence is not simply a self care issue. In fact, they really do not give tokens in AA for spiritual growth. We give them for not picking up a drink. Who came on?</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Phyllis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Phyllis</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Hi. Sorry I am late.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is ok. We are still waiting for Sylvia and Susan. I have my concerns. The storm that has hit the east coast would probably have hit you too Phyllis.</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: No, It is ok today. We have had bad weather the last week. It has been really bad, but today, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Then I am hoping usually Sylvia checks in if the storms prohibits her from being with us so hopefully both Sylvia and Susan will show up. Phyllis I was just talking about the homework. I said this is really a biggie, separating nutritionally nourishing our body from just abstinence. Getting them in two separate camps and I was making the analogy with alcoholism is that they do not tokens in AA for self care or spiritual growth. We just give tokens for staying dry. </p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting abstinence in that category, you just eat your three meals a day and nothing in between, then the quality at the meal can really grow like that "progress not perfection" out of AA's literature. This is trying to get that into a reality and into a workable plan. I do not encourage people to much in their first year to do a lot of nutritional changes because it kicks all the dieting in. Heather has tried to make some changes and it ended up back lashing on you, but it does not mean that you quit trying. It just means that you are coming at it in a more gentle way, in a more spiritual principle way, because your body would like the help. Any of you who know my position is, I think, in the first year we get focused too much on healthy eating, it does end up feeling like the abstinence is a diet and it is a weight control issue. Holly, you read it over, and I am going to guess, Jillian, obviously you read it because you have been working on it. Julie did you have a chance to read it?</p>

<p>JULIE: Hi, yes I did. Sorry I am up here with my kids. I did have a chance to read it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Lucy, how about you? Did you have a chance to read it?</p>

<p>LUCY: Not really but I think I have done this one before, so I knew it was coming. I have been avoiding it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lucy you are already working on this issue so why would you avoid it?.</p>

<p>LUCY: I know and that's why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are already putting enough focus on it. Is that it?</p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Phyllis I know you said that you had read it. Right?</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Yeah I wrote it out in form and I just got in the midst of doing that synopsis, like we talked about, because I wrote a lot. This one was pretty difficult for me to be honest. I took a long time to even write the first word on the paper because I really do have trouble separating those two sometimes. It is a good assignment but it was difficult.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Again.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I did not have a problem with it as long as you stuck to food. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does that mean? </p>

<p>HOLLY: You started throwing liquids in. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah. </p>

<p>LUCY: What did she say?</p>

<p>HOLLY: I liked it when we were just discussing food.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She did not want me to throw in liquids.</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I do not abuse soda. I rarely drink soda and I do not do a lot of things but I drink coffee. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh do you drink it in a moderate for your body way? </p>

<p>HOLLY: Oh, most likely not. (laughter)I figure I go through a ten cup pot a day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You personally go through ten cups.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah I personally go through ten cups. I am taking about making a pot at the ten cup mark and I probably go through that through the day and maybe in the morning and then I would make another pot and go through the day. I am probably doing it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it anything you want to look at? Are you laughing saying you do not want to look or are you serious about not wanting to look.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Well I do not know how seriously I want to look. There is a word "resistance." It feels like there is so much change. I give up so much, it comes from that deprivation place, of I already do not do a lot of what other people do, I am not saying about the group, necessarily. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But again, I want to make sure that you hear and the group to hear, you have is it five years or more than five years abstinent.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Coming up on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Coming up on. Ok. You have made a lot of dietary changes for your health.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did not necessarily have to make them within the first six months.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I made many of them within the first year. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you have made them within the first few years</p>

<p>HOLLY: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would make sense to me that the resistance is average... maybe just take a look at what you have already done.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that is ok, just get aware of it. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah. That would be nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just finish </p>

<p>HOLLY: I dropped my Starbucks membership.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Literally or are you making a joke? </p>

<p>HOLLY: No. I have not had anything from Starbucks in what three weeks. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Yeah. No wonder you are cranky Holly. (laughter)</p>

<p>HOLLY: I make all my coffee at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Just to keep me out of there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were working on eliminating what goes in the coffee and that is why you skipped the Starbucks. When you have made the coffee at home, do you put in anything in particular?</p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah. I use coffee mate. It is a non-dairy creamer, if I have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any other ideas for how to get rid of the coffee mate? I would rather have you get rid of that than the coffee initially. Do you like almond milk or rice milk or soy milk? </p>

<p>HOLLY: Because it is artificial? Is that why you say the coffee mate?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. No, it is really. I think it has got trans fats as well. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Hydrogen oil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is really not a good substance. Can you maybe just start trying one of those three different things? </p>

<p>HOLLY: I have tried rice milk off and on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about the almond milk?</p>

<p>HOLLY: I have not done almond.</p>

<p>JULIE: This is Julie. Silk soy milk actually sells a coffee creamer.</p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah I think you are right. Oh, you cannot do soy. Oh never mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you tried the rice milk, did you try the vanilla flavored rice milk?</p>

<p>HOLLY: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>LUCY: You cannot do like half and half, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, she is staying away from the dairy since it causes that colon problem. Anyway I think the fact that you have given up the Starbucks membership three weeks ago is fantastic because this really is not anything more than just progress not perfection. Sometimes we have to throw that spiritual fit like, look at what all I have done, and hang out there for a little bit and maybe after you have hung out there for another week or so you might want to try the almond milk. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might want to go into the health food store and see what other options they have. I may not have every option that I can throw out to you. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I also know we can change our pallet to where we enjoy it fixed a different way. I am sure that all of you have had that experience that something you did not like as a kid that you ended up liking as an adult. Would that be pretty accurate for you guys? Who came on?</p>

<p>SUSAN: Susan, Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Susan. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Hey Susan.</p>

<p>SUSAN: Hey guys.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody but Sylvia is here and Sylvia moved to Ohio. She moved from Vermont to Ohio and we are thinking that she may have gotten snowed in and does not have phone service. Everybody else is here. We were just talking about the homework, Susan, and it was about the separating of nutritional eating from abstinence and Holly had us laughing for a few minutes saying she was ok reading it about the foods but it was the liquids that got her going. (chuckle) Three weeks ago she dropped her Starbucks membership and we were just talking about some other changes to get rid of the way she fixes coffee made at home. The options to put non-dairy milk in her coffee. Holly does that feel any better to not. Let me ask you another question. Do you do the regular or the decaf at home?</p>

<p>HOLLY: Decaf</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>HOLLY: I do decaf.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. That is a little bit better than the full force. I am going to encourage you to pray about how many cups a day would be in a moderate range. To see if you can come up what your spirit or your soul would guide you about that. God would guide you about that and then maybe e-mail us. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Ooh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say it again.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I said ooh. I will consider it. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that?</p>

<p>HOLLY: I will definitely consider it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>HOLLY: That is a start there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know when I had five years, I found a lump in my breast, and I got a lot of health practitioners involved. A lot of them were alternative and some not so alternative, and I remember having an appointment with one of the health practitioners I was using for the overall healing and changing and stuff, and he recommended something like no dairy to me. I sat up and said, "Son of a bitch" Excuse me you guys. I said, "I do not smoke anymore, I do not drink anymore and I do not do drugs anymore, I do not eat in between meals anymore, and now you do not want me to have butter on my bread?" "You do not want me to have cream in my coffee?" He said, "Oh my gosh I had no idea this was going to hit such a strong cord in you." I remember going home and my family was obviously worried about me and were waiting for me because we were going to go somewhere, so everybody was waiting for me to get home from this appointment. As I walked in I said to my husband, and the kids were like nine and eleven, they were standing in the living room, I said to him, "May I speak to you in the bedroom privately?" I am sure that I just left them shaking in the living room about what news is mom coming back with. I took him in the bedroom and told him the story and he put his arms around me and hugged me and said, "Oh, you are going have to eat bald bread." I just started laughing. That is exactly what I needed, but I needed to gripe first. I think, Holly, like my gripping did not have any humor in it; yours at least has some good humor in it. It does not mean, I know you well enough to know, it does not mean that you are not going to go forward. It means that you are trying to get that energy dealt with so you can move forward. </p>

<p>HOLLY: It just wants to shop around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah..</p>

<p>HOLLY: I am headed off to Europe and I do not particularly care for their coffee so that may take care of it for a couple of weeks. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does everybody know about the Europe trip?</p>

<p>HOLLY: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to share about it quickly?</p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah, I am heading off to Europe. Lucy and I are going to be world travelers. </p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>HOLLY: My husband has been asked if he could fly out to Paris for two weeks. They do not have any objections to my going with him and then we are going to tag on vacation on the end of it. They are paying for the flight and the hotel stay for two weeks.</p>

<p>JULIE: Wow. That is great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am going to guess that you are really going to miss the group. Right? You are just going to skip some sessions. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way that my European clients do it, they get the Skype and they call through the Internet and it is like a dollar for an hour. That is an option, just in case if you had a laptop you wanted to take along just in case or something to get line up with Skype. </p>

<p>HOLLY: The only laptop that is going is Jason's. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he will have that at work right?</p>

<p>HOLLY: He will have that at work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are not in your first year so I would not worry necessarily about you other than just miss you. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah. I am going to be heading up to Ireland to hook up with my friends from up there. He has a bunch of meetings up there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the dates you are going Holly? </p>

<p>
HOLLY: We are probably leaving the 28th of June and would be back somewhere around, somewhere in the third week of July. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>HOLLY: It has not really because we do not know if we are going to spend all the time in Ireland or go to Ireland and Paris or we do not know what the heck we are going to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Well that is another month or so, six weeks before you go. Yeah. Ok. Let me come back to the homework concept and I also want to give Susan a chance to check in. So before we go back to the homework, Susan can you jump in? I told the gals before you came on line, how proud I was of them reaching out to you and I just want you to know how proud I am of you that you even reached out and utilized the group support that was available to you. Usually the shame so cripples us for a while that I was really proud of you walking through that.</p>

<p>SUSAN: It was difficult for me. It is a hard thing for me to do. I was so inspired by the responses that I really thank you very much for responding to me and helping me through that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you been able to get abstinent again?</p>

<p>SUSAN: Yes, I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know that we are seeing each other in person tomorrow. </p>

<p>SUSAN: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I knew that I could catch up with you then. I was just so so glad that you made that connection. That was like a major hurdle because you have not been in the group real long and to really take advantage of that much have really been a giant leap. </p>

<p>SUSAN: You know I have to say it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SUSAN: It was for me. Unfortunately, just the circumstances that are going on in my life right now, when I need the help the most, like last week was the last straw. I was not able to make my appointments with you and I was not able to make the group and all of this stressful stuff going on. Oh my gosh; I did not want it to spiral out of control because I was not abstinent in the first place and then what a great excuse to just to drop it. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you did not.</p>

<p>SUSAN: And I did not want to drop out... I need help. I need help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Based on that, let me tell you even though the homework went out most of the people are still in their first year in the group so note, this is chapter 18 so it is not one of the very beginning issues, but even if you are not ready to make those changes and for most of you guys if you are going to make any of them, they are going to be a little bit more minor. Just know that this is a real high risk arena to work in... meaning making the dietary changes is not impossible, but we have to be on code orange or whatever they call that the high alert, so that we are in our first year of abstinence... always saying, "Is this feeding my disease for feeding my recovery." Right Heather? </p>

<p>HEATHER: Absolutely. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At first your decision once the doctor told you about your insulin resistant and leave the sugar alone, you really wanted to step up to the plate and be as loving as you could to your body, but I think as early in your abstinence as your are, it was just an undermining backlash kind of thing. Thank God you stayed abstinent. Thank God.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you are, I think it sounds like Heather did do the homework and there were so many things that I wanted to comment on and first I am going to jump down. Has everybody had a chance to read Heather's homework first? Was there anybody who said no? </p>

<p>LUCY: Me Lucy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lucy ok. Maybe I will just briefly go over it. She said one of the concepts that helped the most when deciding on and committing to eating to nourish and not control is, "What would I prepare for someone I love." "What would I prepare for someone who is abstinent? What would I prepare for Josephine or one of you in my group? I would undoubtedly prepare a meal that it is at least 80 percent healthy and in the four to six moderate range. The interesting thing is that over the years I have come to see food as a friend and a partner in crime. When I eat healthy the teenager in me feels like she is losing her friend and feels deprived. The plain fact is that healthy foods do not give me the high that unhealthy foods give me." I put a question mark by "high" because I think you meant it gives you a numbness as opposed to a high. Am I right? In the next sentence </p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah. Yeah. I used that word actually. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Therefore I lose the numbness and the peacefulness that I get when you get sedated. The healthy foods do not sedate you as opposed to the high is more accurate. Right?</p>

<p>HOLLY: Well, actually I get kind of high with some foods. Some of my binge foods. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then does it drop you into the numbness? Kind of shoot you up and drop you back down, it that what you meant? </p>

<p>HOLLY: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Ok. Alright. Even if it is totally short lived and filled with consequences she still struggles with letting that go. The next paragraph she says, 'To me eating to nourish and not for taste means completely changing my thinking and how easy is that to do????!! I like what Josephine says in this chapter, 'Almost everything feels like control energy when we start to focus on and change our food choices. It feels like dieting. We unconsciously use the calorie count and taste test criteria and ponder why this does not feel like recovery.'" She wrote. "Yes. I chose the spiritual principles in the chapter on love, courage, and surrender and to see about trying to write on those if you were going to make some dietary changes. It says, these spiritual concepts mean many different things to me. They mean letting go of old ways, of being, thinking and doing. They mean having faith in times of darkness and despair or total frustration. They mean holding onto hope and other's hope. They mean holding onto a belief that you will get through these moments when all you can think to do is eat. They mean treating yourself as you would treat someone whom you really admired and respected. Basically for me they mean doing the right thing even when everything inside you is telling you to take the easier,] softer way and get that quick fix; because in the end you will be true to yourself and you can look in the mirror and feel a sense of wholeness. Sometimes these concepts seem out of range for me. I just feel like I do not have it in me. Then I ask myself, what is my spiritual truth and the truth is I am love. I am courage. I am surrender. Each of these are my birthright and part of my spiritual nature. I have to only know it and believe it." I just wrote "Wow" by that. I think that were this definitely written by somebody in that first year where at one part of the day we have such commitment to the courage and surrender and self care and by the afternoon it just feels overwhelming and everything inside you is telling you to take the easier and softer way. I always talk about how in the morning when I made my plans for the meals for the day, this was in my first year, by three in the afternoon I had morphed into the addiction... at least a dozen times in my first year...  it was like, this is so dumb. This is not going to work. Who I am I kidding? I am never going to make it. But if I just keep my word and stayed abstinent, I'd go to bed sometimes mad but then I would wake up saying, "Oh, thank God." "Oh thank God." But sometimes we just morph into the addiction by late afternoon. What I am hearing you say, is that you do it anyway even if everything inside of you is telling you to take the easier softer way and get the fix, you stick with your abstinence and recovery anyway. That was so beautifully put and is the inspiration that all of us. The next paragraph she just has got one more. Here are her nutritional guidelines. "They seem to change from week to week as I struggle to find some consistency. Right now I am trying a three week honesty program where I write down what I plan to eat each day and e-mail Josephine. I get to see what and how I am really eating and what it feels like to be totally honest. Yikes. (laughter) "In general my guidelines are," and then what she lists are the things that she is going to stay away from so I put a little note here to ask you Heather if you would do one more aspect and think in terms of what you are going to put at the meal. </p>

<p>HEATHER: Ok. Yeah. That is a positive way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HEATHER: I am so used to saying "I am not going to have this. I am not going to have that." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how many of us like to be told what not to do? If we say, lots of fruit and vegetables. I am going to eat high in fruits and vegetables low in chemical laden processed foods, then you have both of them in there but not just what you are staying away from. I liked that you did not call it never eat it or ban it or whatever. You said just stay away from it. It does not mean that it is not going to come your way every now and then. </p>

<p>HEATHER: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any feedback or contributions on what it took you to get that written down because I think everybody had a struggle with it.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Well for me, I go about it where I just have to get my thoughts on paper or on e-mail and I do not critique it. I do not make the English perfect. I just want to get part of it down. The heart of it for me, and I really loved love, surrender, and courage... those spiritual principles. Those three words just really spoke to me in this writing or in the homework assignment. If I could just keep myself connected to those three principles, then I will do the right thing. I will always do the right thing because that is who I am in terms of my spiritual being. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very beautifully put. Thank you for leading the way for us. </p>

<p>SUSAN: Thank you for sharing that. I thought that was just so well put. It really helped me </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Susan is that you?</p>

<p>SUSAN: Yeah. This is Susan. After reading that, it just really meant a lot to me to read that because it put into words things that I was feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>SUSAN: The teenager part...the rebellious teenager. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep.</p>

<p>SUSAN: I thought that was so well put. </p>

<p>HEATHER: I did not come up with that one on my own but I sure do use it a lot. It is true. We all have this rebellious teenager who had to rule everything. I used to hate that teenager and I am really trying to learn to love her, but it is not always easy. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Literally pouts within you when you do not get what you want. I feel that and unfortunately respond to it more than I should. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just mention that sometimes the addiction tries to wear the mask of the teenager. Sometimes it tries to wear the mask of the little girl that just wants a lollypop, how hard life is, so just give me a lollypop, but I really really really had a rebellious adolescent... both externally and internally and the internal one, I really tried to work with her in my recovery because I did not want her to take away this path that I felt could offer me self respect and a change in my life. I asked her what she really really wanted in life and she said she wants justice, respect, seems like there were three things, justice, respect, and I think to be listened to. The justice thing. I tried to help her understand that life will not always look just but that we can trust God with it. With the respect, I told her the only way she is going to respect herself is if she stays sober and she stays abstinent. She was on board with that as soon as she got that that is the only way she can feel that respect. I promised her I would listen to her and I would honor her input. It does not mean that I would let her make all the decisions but I would honor her input probably more than I would a five year old or an eight year old because she has had more living experience. Any of you who have already started working with the inner family concept and you know you have that rebellious teenager in there, do a visualization, talk to her, find out what her needs are. For most teens though rebellion that is a very common thing. They want to be honored in a way that they are listened to. They want to be respected and they want some sense of justice. Those are pretty average. Even with gang members. </p>

<p>How those needs get expressed is a little different in each of us, but they still have those same three needs. When my inner teen got it that recovery will help her meet those needs, she was a little more on board. Anybody who has a struggle, again, sometimes the inner family work feels like "oh my god one more thing" but I can tell you I probably did it twice a week between five and ten minutes each time. It does not really require a ton of time.</p>

<p>HEATHER: I was wanting to be comfortable. I do not think it is my teenager, I think it is my little girl, but I felt so uncomfortable physically and emotionally my whole life that I just want the numb comfortable place when things happen like stress, my back is out again, or. I just want comfort and I do not know how to get that self to self sooth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Self sooth?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah. Sometimes you cannot be comfortable and that is a fact of life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a fact of life. There are ways again. Did we lose somebody or get somebody? </p>

<p>SYLVIA: This is Sylvia.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Sylvia.</p>

<p>SYLVIA: I am sorry I am so late. I had an injury and I am sick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>SYLVIA: I am going to be ok but I am basically calling to say hi to everybody. I miss you and I will be in next week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Alright. Take care and when you get a chance shoot me an e-mail but we will keep you in our prayers until we get a chance to talk to you again.</p>

<p>SYLVIA: Ok. Good. Thank you. I have managed to stay abstinent although I have thought about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SYLVIA: Ok. I will be in touch.</p>

<p>EVERYONE: Ok. Bye. (from group)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually I am glad she did that. Checked in. </p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody had really made just a wonderful point just them. Who was it?</p>

<p>HEATHER: I was talking about wanting to be comfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Comfortable. Yeah. Yeah. Little babies cannot self sooth. It almost is a developmental stage when kids learn to self sooth to where they can either start to suck their thumb or start to rub their blankey or something. It is not something that we come into life knowing how to do; we have to learn it stage by stage in our life. Obviously adult ways of self soothing need to be thought through and made compatible with our beliefs, values and life style. When it is about comfort there are a couple of different arenas. If it is a physical pain arena, we probably want to come up with some ways to address the self soothing or making ourselves comfortable around that. If it is more emotional pain, there is another set of ways to do it around that. If it is just more struggling with spiritual stuff, then having some ways to get comfortable while we grow along those spiritual lines. When, Heather, you talk about just being uncomfortable and writing it through, were you talking about physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Last night it was physical. I had the worst back pain and it went into my head and it was a headache that I have had for a long time. I was just writing that out. I actually did have thoughts, ok, just go eat and make yourself better. I did not do it though. It is funny how the thoughts are always there and I go to whatever will work. I tried a hot bath. I tried ice and heat and muscle relaxants. Sometimes it is back pain and feeling tired but a lot of times it is just feeling edgy and the stress of life... the regular stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have some tools that you use when it is more of the edgy or stressed? Because there are some more spiritual answers. </p>

<p>HEATHER: I have tools that I want to use. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give me one you want to use. </p>

<p>HEATHER: Exercise, meditation, and prayers are ones that I want to use. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Those are all a little bit isolating. Do you have any tools that you use that involve other humans?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Gosh. I always do not want to call people when I feel bad because I feel like I am a burden. That is really a hard one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you got beeped out a little bit on my end but you said when I am already feeling bad, I feel like I should not call and something like that. </p>

<p>HEATHER: I feel like a burden. I am working on that. I have a couple of people. My mom is like a good friend and I have another friend that I call but usually it is when I am in a crisis. If I just feel bad I do not tend to reach out, but it is why I am part of the group. One of the reasons why I really wanted to be part of this was to reach out more. I am doing it more and more so we are making some progress. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. I think sometimes a couple of you, and we have talked privately about how to reach out without the old words that would make us feel like a burden. That was really important to me for learning how to reach out and part of the reaching out is saying, "I'm not having the best day. I think I just need somebody to tell me some wonderful spiritual truths." </p>

<p>HEATHER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most of us are willing to step up to the plate and do that. Ask them, "Let's make one up. Here is some of mine. What are some of yours?" I even did that often enough to where sometimes I could call people and say, "You know those spiritual things I want to hear, can you tell them to me?" They already knew what to say to me because that was a way that I did not feel like this wimpy, vulnerable, mess. I could feel like here I am having a bad day and I am trying to do something about it. It shifted how I saw myself. When I had a different way to ask for support or help, it became easier. I do not know if that helps any of you guys walk into the reaching out field a little better but it sure helped me to learn a slightly different style on how to get help. </p>

<p>HEATHER: That does help. It gives it some structure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You have one or two opening lines and I also think it is important that if what you need to do is bring a bunch of angry, judgmental energy to just tell the person, "Do you have a couple of minutes to listen to me just really gripe and throw a spiritual fit?" "It probably will not take more than just a few minutes and then I will be able to move past it and make some better decisions, but I have got to get rid of this energy." If you tell somebody in advance, most of the time they are like, "Yeah, go for it." Sometimes when people call me, whether it is a client or a friend or whatever, and they start in on the gripy version, I will usually ask, "Does it feel like you just need to gripe and get it all out?" They will go, "Yeah." I'll say, "Ok, go for it." If they sometimes do not label it, then sometimes I label it for them. With myself I call it "throwing a spiritual fit" where I just want to be gripy and bitchy, but I need you to know on the listening end, that that is exactly what I am doing. Until I get through this and past this, I cannot get to my more spiritual foundation. Those are two techniques of how to reach out without feeling like you are a burden. The other thing about reaching out through the phone, not just through the e-mail because with the e-mail you do not have to ask, "Do you have a minute?" If you do it by phone, and don't you guys have each other's phone numbers by now?</p>

<p>HEATHER: Yes we do. </p>

<p>JILIAN: You know what, Josephine this is Jillian. I cannot seem to find it. Do you remember the date that you sent it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do not off the top of my head.</p>

<p>JILIAN: That is ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I will be doing a new one because this is session number nine and next week will be number ten and then we will be getting a new gal in because Lucy is going to be out for a while and as is Julie I think. I will make up a new list for everybody so the European gal has your phone number. You probably will not be able to call her unless you have a Skype system but she can call land lines. When you do use the phone, you can say, "Hi, it is Josephine do you have a minute?" "I just need to talk for a couple of minutes." If they are saying, "Oh my god I am rushing out the door, let me call you back from my cell phone in the car" or they say "Oh my god I have company," then you just call somebody else on the list. At least you have put it out there right at the beginning so you do not have to be interrupted or feel rejected. Learning how to get off the phone gracefully too is hard... learning how to say, "I need to tell you I need to go". You know what I am saying? Letting someone know I have to go is always very hard on me. 
Again, Phyllis do you want to jump in? I know you said, back to the homework, you said that it you starring at the paper a little while before you got some words written. </p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Yeah. I just needed some quite reflection and listening... just taking a lot of information in. This one was difficult because I guess I need to stop and think about how I have trouble separating the nutritional part from the actual abstinence part. As I was telling you in our individual, I do have a habit of trying to do it all at once and concentrating on eating three meals a day and concentrating on eating healthy. I think instead of it being about my abstinence and surrendering, I think if I was really being honest, I was controlling a bit. So this assignment, as far as surrendering goes, I really just have to concentrate on eating three times a day and that being my first goal and my only goal. You know what I mean. Obviously the nutrition part is good, but in order to have long term recovery, the surrendering part is the part I think I struggle with the most. The love and the courage, I think I am doing pretty well with that. I am really good with self care and things like that. I am very stubborn and I think that I deny the fact that sometimes I am controlling a little bit more than I am surrendering. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does put us in a category of more high risk or relapse prone, because if that kind of controlling effects our weight then we do not know if this is the weight that God and nature is giving us or if this is the weight that our diet is giving us. It can be an under current that might make you not trust God. No. No. I did this. I did this instead of just surrendering and saying, "Yeah. I just want to do the 80/20 rule as best as I can and abstinence 100 percent of the time and let God handle the results of my weight." </p>

<p>HOLLY: I have a question or two regarding way back when we were talking about the coffee mate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I am thinking I kind of understand the same point of view. You do everything and some people surrender and they are an alcoholic and they go to recovery and now we are down to abstinence. For me sometimes I wonder if I say I really wanted the coffee mate and I did not have it and I had the almond milk instead, I would worry that I would be more likely to have chatter instead of actually letting myself have that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it were two to four cups of coffee a day, I probably would not worry so much. But the fact that it is over ten or close to ten it does worry me for you, Holly. </p>

<p>PHYLLIS: It is ten?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Oh, ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is her laughing.</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: Sorry I did not hear ten. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Oh, come on get on my side Phyllis. (laughter)</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: I thought if she is just having one a day or one a week, why not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. we are talking about polishing off the ten coffee pot and maybe making another every now and then. </p>

<p>HOLLY: No. I do not go over ten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: High five Holly. (laughter)</p>

<p>HOLLY: I do not always finish it so I will reheat whatever I did not finish the day before in the morning and then I will make another pot which I do not finish and I leave for the morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Alright.</p>

<p>HOLLY: It averages out to be ten, but I have a twelve cup coffee maker.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that is progress. You are not doing the whole twelve cup.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I always stop it at ten. I do not go all the way to twelve. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there you go. Ok. Pray about making it eight next week. I do not know. Also to Phyllis I think you might have come on after I made sure everybody really got that Holly is coming up to five years of abstinence and she is not in her first year so I would not be nagging one of you who were in your first year about any of this that I am nagging Holly about. </p>

<p>HOLLY: I should be sainted at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You what? Say it again.</p>

<p>HOLLY: I should be sainted at this point.</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: You should be sainted. Yeah. You are sainted. </p>

<p>HOLLY: I am insane that is what I am. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thanks for trying to save her butt Phyllis. </p>

<p>PHYLLIS: I was more just thinking about there are times where once in a while I will have a latte once a week or something and that is a treat for me. I did not hear the part about the ten cups. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PHYLLIS: It is like the diet pop. We do not buy the containers anymore of it, not the containers but like the 24 pack. I was drinking six a day without even knowing it. It was quenching my thirst and I looked down and it was too much. I have purchased diet pop but I will go and get one but I am slowly going down like to one a week now instead of four or five a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is all that I am pushing Holly to take a look at. It is that look at what I already have done is a normal reaction in my opinion and that hanging out at the resistance level. You know what, I admire and trust you Holly, so I do not have any sense that you are not going to move forward at it whatever rate or speed feels right to your heart. I hope everybody knows that I feel that way. </p>

<p>HOLLY: Yeah. (laugher) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well Julie you have been quiet. How is everything going over at your house?</p>

<p>JULIE: I am just quiet because my kids are absolutely crazy off the walls. </p>

<p>They are extremely demanding but they are ok. I kind of locked them in their room upstairs. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it even with this kind of crazy four year old twins, are you feeling like it is just kind of a nice relief to know that your mom is in a good place and she is doing ok and you are getting your family and your own routine?</p>

<p>JULIE: Yes. I think it just cabin fever for these guys because of all the crazy weather because they are just ready for spring. We have gone down to visit her and now that she is getting healthier. We have a nice sense of normalcy about the household. I just wake up and I do not feel daunted by the day ahead like I have. The kids are crazy but it is just normal kid stuff trying to figure out where I am going to go or what I am going to do or be able to make plans to go see friends and not have to worry about what I am going to do with my mom. It has been really nice because I am able to do that. She is doing well. She is content and peaceful and that is all we can really ask for at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is your abstinence going because you are at your critical spot that you have had a relapse at?</p>

<p>JULIE: The critical spot that I hit is at six months. And next week I have is six months. Usually five to six months is crazy for me. It has been good. What I did not do last time is I really focused on healthy nourishing and completely forgot about my recovery bottom line. I just thought I am going to go for that 80/20 all the time but yet I did not look at any of my recovery bottom lines. I have really just been daily recommitting to all my recovery bottom lines and just getting through the one day at a time with those. That has made a huge difference. They are starting to feel more like a habit if that makes sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well give me a sense because we know your abstinence bottom line is the same as the rest of us. Give me an example of some of your recovery bottom lines that you feel is really helping you to focus on. </p>

<p>JULIE: Well for me, my main one is not eating in front of the TV. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JULIE: Not changing a planned meal unless it is out of my control. So I am not on a emotional up and down like I am going to plan a meal and the next day I say, "Oh I do not really want that." Not doing that... also no random add-ons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good.</p>

<p>JULIE: It has been really hard. I have gone to bed mad a couple of nights because I really wanted to change that meal even though the meal was perfectly fine. Just the fact that I just did not do it made me mad. My husband has been all nice and easy but each time it does get easier. It does. It becomes more of a habit. It is such a huge one. I never did that before. I used to just looked at it from this dieting mentality... I just wanted to always look at how healthy everything was. It really almost feels like that first 30 days of just really trying to get the recovery bottom line. If I can just stick to that then I know down the road the rest will come in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very good. Very good. I think that is an excellent plan. </p>

<p>JULIE: I feel like a shift. I feel like this is different than before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>JULIE: But hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Lucy I know that we will get to you today. Do you want to jump in and make sure that you talk about anything that you want to check in about. Any concerns you have about not being able to meet regularly with us for a little bit. </p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah. I definitely have my concerns about that. The disease chatter comes in. It says, "Oh you are not going to be checking in with the group every Wednesday" so you know there is that reaction and then I know what I am getting very good at is really recognizing my disease chatter which is a major tool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good.</p>

<p>LUCY: The chatter is loud. I am a little bit afraid to go to the "land of eating" and stay abstinent, but I also feel like I can do this and I want to do this. More importantly, I want to do this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>HEATHER: Are you going to France?</p>

<p>LUCY: The land of eating. Because all my favorite foods are there. It is just going to be hard...I  have to plan if I want cheese... it has to be with dinner, not after dinner. It is just going to take more planning than I usually would want to do but that is ok. </p>

<p>HOLLY: The portions in France are much more moderate than here in America.</p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah. </p>

<p>HEATHER: I am actually going to France too this year. I did not realize you were going.</p>

<p>LUCY: Oh cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When are you going? When are you going Heather?</p>

<p>HEATHER: I am tentatively planning on going in the fall so not for a while, thank God. I could not deal with that right now. When I was there before, it struck me how moderate they eat. It is not the kind of serving that we get served here... which is just tons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That is what I found in France. I have been there a couple of times... to Paris. Any restaurant is going to serve you moderate.</p>

<p>I did not go to any restaurant that did not serve moderate meals. Where in the United States it is like leave half or take half home half the time. </p>

<p>LUCY: I know I will get a lot of exercise too because I know that we will be walking a lot and doing all that and somehow it is easier when you are on vacation to walk every day for long periods. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right it is. </p>

<p>LUCY: I will definitely have disease chatter kick in and tempt me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think saying back to it, just like you said to us which is, "I want to protect my abstinence. I want to make this my foundation for living that freedom that Josephine talks about. I have got enough right now to prove to me that this is the path that I want." You just keep saying your truths to the addiction and I think you will have a year in when you return... July right?</p>

<p>LUCY: I just counted. I will have eight months. I will have a year August 23rd. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: August, ok.</p>

<p>LUCY: I am not at a year yet and it always comforts me to hear you say the quality does not have to be the hugest issue right now because my eating daily is not as perfect as I would like it to be. It probably is not as bad as I judge it to be either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I have talked to you enough through this past eight months that it has gotten better.</p>

<p>LUCY: Yeah. I also think that is a component of this disease. It is all or nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>LUCY: I think the perfectionism thing has to look like the vegan diet every day which I do not do. It is progress not perfection. I think it is going to be fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good.</p>

<p>LUCY: Still the disease chatter is there and I think that is always something that is going to be there it just gets less and less the more recovery you have but I also think if you have this disease you have this disease. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>LUCY: It is always a progressive disease as they say. It is always trying to knock on the door and get in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well are you going to have Internet access at all? </p>

<p>LUCY: I am not sure because I am not taking my laptop. I do not know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So no. We are going to keep you on the e-mail list so that you could catch up if you get a chance to go to an Internet caf�.</p>

<p>LUCY: Ok. I really appreciate that; you keeping me on the list.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Do not let the fact that you are going to have all kinds of homework waiting for you, you know you do not have to worry about that, I just want to keep you on the whole list so that everything that goes out or comes in your computer.</p>

<p>LUCY: I appreciate that.</p>

<p>JULIE: Real quick. One thing I heard when somebody was saying when they were gone on vacation was just to get a bunch of post cards and just to write them out even if you just have a few people's addresses or whatever just to feel like you could vent or get something out like you were sending it out in the mail.</p>

<p>LUCY: That is such a good idea. If anybody is open to that, please send your address and I love that because that will be a way for me to be honest and challenge my disease chatter</p>

<p>JULIE: Write it in a little journal</p>

<p>LUCY: That would be awesome. So if anyone of you guys is open to it, please send me your address.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great. Great idea Julie. </p>

<p>LUCY: Thank you Julie.</p>

<p>JULIE: Sure </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Same thing for you Holly. Yours is a little later than hers, yours is quite a few weeks away but I think it is a great idea. Same thing for you, Heather, in the fall. Well Jillian and Susan have not jumped in too much and I would like to take the last two minutes and give each of you a chance to talk a little bit more. Susan is there anything that you need to keep you going this week?</p>

<p>SUSAN: Anything that I need?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to make a commitment to send out and e-mail twice a week to the group to check in and let us know what is going on? Do you want to make sure that I know that we are talking tomorrow and I know that we can brain storm some more on that but if there is anyway that we can be your cheerleader for this coming week to have you continue with the abstinence, I just wanted to give you the chance to throw it out.</p>

<p>SUSAN: Well thank you. Thank you so much. That is probably a very good idea. I think that is something I need to exercise certainly is to be reaching out so maybe I will commit to the group to check in by e-mail or phone twice during this next week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Alright. Jillian. Go ahead.</p>

<p>JILIAN: My mother is having surgery on Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>JILIAN: I will be in Las Vegas so instead I will be calling in from there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good.</p>

<p>JILIAN: It will be difficult.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>JILIAN: To be there but I am committed to being abstinent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>HOLLY: Get the phone numbers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There you go. You are going to be in Vegas is that right? Yeah. Holly is very close to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>JILIAN: Oh really</p>

<p>HOLLY: I am about 40 minutes away.</p>

<p>JILIAN: Oh great. Oh great</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you cannot find that phone list, shoot me and e-mail and I will send you guys out a new one. I will just locate it and send it back out. </p>

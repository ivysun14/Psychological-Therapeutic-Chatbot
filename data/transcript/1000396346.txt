<p>PATIENT: (5-minute silence) Mm, when I first came in I was thinking about the fact that today I (Clears throat) when I not only wore this dress, which I don't know if I think I look as nice in it as I used to, or if it, I feel the way it used to make me feel.  But I st—, I think, I still was aware of uh, wanting to appear nice to you and, or, or aware of the fact you might be noticing how I look, or something like that.  And, and I know I was feeling very much I didn't want to be late today, although I guess I was little bit.  But uhm, before I left I was thinking, (Sniff) I was making every attempt to be ready on time when FN came.  And uhm, (Sniff) I don't know, then I, I was thinking about yesterday and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why this special effort?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, th, this is when I started thinking about yesterday, and it seemed like it was almost (Sniff), well either, either that I was going back on an attitude I had yesterday, and, or I was trying to make up, sort of be nice to you after not being nice, or, er, for being late yesterday, or I don't know.  But (Sniff, Sigh) I think somehow I felt very rebellious yesterday, and uhm, defiant, I think.  I mean it seems like today I'm, I either got scared and I'm now saying that I'm really nice, or I'm denying something that I was feeling yesterday, or —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What would you have gotten scared of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Clears throat, Pause) Well I guess that you would disapprove, and uh show your disapproval by sort of withdrawing from me and being cold.  And uh — because I know when I got home I was thinking that, well, whether or not I was feeling rebellious,some of the attitudes I have, for instance, about being late and about, thinking about things are not as I wanted here.  Well that part I suppose, is more personal do—, th—, but about being late, it was uhm, to some, to some degree anyway, sort of very egocentric, and not very responsible.  Well both cases, both things, I wasn't being very responsible, and I think then I began, I suppose, thinking y—, I didn't remember thinking you must be disapproving of me.  But I remember sort of thinking of how you must be seeing u—, u—, what I was saying, some of the things I said yesterday.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Which was how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that I'm sort of acting like a little child.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   This has a very familiar ring to it, I think, you know?  It sounds to me like what you used to go through, or the way you at least talked about the way you went through things with your father.  You'd show how angry you felt, and rebellious, and then ah, you must have done something very much like this, sort of back off and then feel contrite and want to sort of make amends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause, Sniff) Yeah, what it makes me think of is just 2 incidences, but it was in the area where I either was most rebellious, or most obedient.  Uhm, but both the time, I guess, my sophomore year in high school when I was not getting good grades, and particularly not in subjects that I could easily get fairly good grades.  And, and then, and uh, college my freshman year, when I, I was doing all right I think, in the other subjects, but in physics I wasn't doing well.  And I took physics because my father wanted me to.  And that caused my parents to call FYC, and worry about what was happening to me, and so forth.  And they were, I think they were even afraid I'd flunk out of college, just on 1 course, I don't know.  I never failed it, but uhm, it caused them a lot of concern. </p>

<p>And then, both, bo—, well in both cases that, well, I suppose in my freshman year it was more the second semester, and then it was all of my sophomore year, I was doing poorly.  And then my junior year I did extremely well.  And, I don't know, in both cases, I, it was, I guess a way of rebelling, and then I'd j—, all I know is I'd get sort of scared.  And I, I, well I don't know, in, in this area uhm, especially when I was in high school, I think, I knew when my parents were disapproving.  They didn't say anything to me then, but it was clear, since they cared so much that we do well.  And uhm, but I think I got scared not only for their attitude, but I, I suppose I thought, well what if their reasons for their attitude are right, which had to do with your whole future?  And uhm, that your whole future was based on doing well now.  And uhm, so it was sort of a combination, then.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Cough) It's still sort of left up in the air.  You say they're sort of, seems to me, one thing you might accomplish by making amends with me now, or feeling that's what you wanted to do, is to sort of cover over, hide what you're angry with me about.  Because it seems quite clear that you are angry with me, because I was calling your attention some attitudes toward MSCZ that you want to disown.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence, Sniff) Well, I, all I think of, and that is that (Clears throat) I had, I had sort of mixed feelings about it, and I can't see it quite that way, because I, I know I was feeling, on the one hand glad, or I don't know if glad's quite the word, but I don't know, I've known all along I'm leaving out a whole thing by not talking about feelings I have toward MSCZ.  And uhm, and there are times when I want to be able to get to that, and so I, I suppose in that sense, I was glad when it started coming up.  But, but then when I couldn't stay on it, when I clearly in a way, didn't want to talk about it, I think, w—, th, the way I saw it, I was feeling angry, I think, was, I don't know, sort of more thinking, now you'll be disapproving, because I'm not staying on the subject, I'm leaving it.  Which, I suppose, is another side of what you said. </p>

<p>But uhm, (Pause) yeah, I guess, really what I'm saying, is what you said, only I, I'm putting emphasis on your keeping me on it, or wanting to keep me on it, my assuming you wanted to keep me on it.  And not just in bringing up, or pointing out things.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because I'm also thinking that I know (Sigh), well I'm not sure I recall the significance of some of the things you pointed out er, all of them.  But I have the feeling that I don't even know what you pointed out, now.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, if you couldn't abolish me, you could abolish what I said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well it's no—, well yeah — I was thinking also, this reminds me of uhm, well, just I mean, people do this all the time, I'm sure this is part of what I'm doing too, of sort of — I vaguely remember things you were pointing out, or even if I remember them specifically, I don't have any of the feeling I had when you were, in remembering them.  And s, so then it's as if, well that couldn't be what would have made me angry, and it's a way to deny feeling angry, I guess.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, I was just thinking again, of this mixed feeling I have about wanting to think about different feelings I have toward MSCZ.  And then, clearly not wanting to think about it.  And I was thinking about, well, I guess yesterday I was talking about our bedroom, and how I know it drives him crazy, and whether or not I'm being, I'm doing it on purpose, keeping it in a way that I know bothers him.  And it, and I was just thinking that that's an aspect of whatever it is that's really at the basis of all this, that I don't mind talking about that, but this is something about, I know you've said some things concerning the basic problem between us.  And, or that's basic to my attitude toward him, and that's where I start forgetting, or where I, I feel as if I keep leaving the subject as soon as it comes out. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you think the basic problem is that you feel with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well I want to deny this, but uhm, w—, I've just been thinking of all sorts of ways that I can change it, but when you first asked that, I immediately thought of how I'm always feeling so cold toward MSCZ, and I don't know, sort of pushing him away into certain compartments in my life, and being bossy.  And then, I just started thinking, well, I hate him.  (Sigh, 4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I, when I think of things I don't hate in him, and uhm, and, and then I was thinking well, I suppose it could be that he's that, because he's a man, I hate him.  But (Sniff, Sigh) well all I can think of now, is just feeling driven by something to, to beat him down and be superior to him, and b, be in control of him.  (2-minute silence)  Well I think again, of that dance that I remember talking about before, but I was talking about it more when I was feeling, I suppose, hateful toward you, but where the female of the species treats the male as prey.  And —  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why do you think it's so hard for you to say these things?  You say you want to deny all of what you've just been thinking.  Why is it, what do you feel keeps you from talking about it?  Why do you want to deny it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause, Sniff) Well, when I said that, I was thinking more, I guess, that it just seemed like an awful thing to say about my husband.  But now I think of it more just that, I actually feel in a weaker position and I'm never going to be the way I w—, seem to want to be, being in control, being stronger.  So I, I don't dare express that I have these feelings.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I've really gotten off thinking about it, I think because I was thinking just about that dance again, and how at the time we saw it, I, I'd sort of forgotten this, but I think MSCZ's reaction was just well, thinking it was well done, but not, he wasn't feeling any terrific feeling about it.  And I was feeling very strongly about it then, and I can see now why I would have been.  But uhm, I don't know, I just thought it was so well done, and now when I think of it, of actually what the dance consisted of as dance, it probably wasn't nearly as good as, I mean it was well done, but it wasn't so superior.  And, yet I think that probably was the thing I liked best about that evening. </p>

<p>And then I just began thinking about I guess, FMX, who knows some people, not in that particular company, but in some of the dance companies, and when we came home that evening, we were just talking about different people who had danced in the uhm, most important positions.  And she was telling us things she'd heard about them through her friends, that are in the same type of thing.  And uhm, and then I ended up, I guess, thinking about FMX baby-sitting this weekend and one of the things we're doing the night she — we have a party to go to first.  And then we're going to the BFM, and then I ended up thinking about FNI.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because one thing that comes to my mind now, because it has a connection with what I was saying, and maybe this was something I w—, a—, was actually part of my thoughts, though I didn't realize it.  But uhm, there was something that came up one time, when MSCZ and I were talking about whether or not MW really wanted FNI to do it, or not to do it.  I don't, I don't remember now, exactly what it was.  But I re—, I just remember that my attitude, or my idea was that FNI does exactly what she wants, and MW is powerless in connection with her.  And MSCZ was saying, I think she's much more considerate of his wishes than might seem apparent, and uhm, than obviously I thought. </p>

<p>And I think when I was, I, I was also thinking of uhm, she's asked if I can come over sometime Friday, and I was thinking of, I don't know when I can.  And I don't know, it's just the feeling of she's really in a central position.  She's in control of her husband, and I was thinking of her taking MYDN to the doctor, but — which she has to do on Friday — but it's sort of she arranges things for him, and does what she wants with him. </p>

<p>And uhm, well, I also think of this idea I had when she had to stay in bed, especially this last time, because she called over several things that I don't think she would have, if she had not had to stay in bed, and she just had more time.  And uhm, th, the image I got, which is not completely fair to her, was very much of FNI lying in bed, and almost as if the bed's in the center of the whole apartment, and everything is revolving around it. </p>

<p>And that, that almost that she loves that part of being bedridden, because then she can just lie in bed and think of, think of all sort of orders, and uh, and just make plans.  And I kn—, she does like making plans, but that it, I don't know, went beyond — much of her joy of making plans is just making them.  And it doesn't always bother her if they don't get carried through.  But in my concept of it, it was that she'd be making plans, and they would be carried through, and that uhm, (Sniff) I don't know, just by lying there in bed, she had full power over everyone.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And that makes me think of, well I suppose I started wondering if I'd had some feeling connected with my mother, especially during the time she had to stay in bed for about a month.  But it made me think that, the other night my father called, because he was in PKW, and uhm, the thing that was most on his mind was that my mother had just, she was just beginning to get better from having I guess had the flu.  It sounded like that.  And then, she'd apparently been quite sick with it. </p>

<p>And uh, my father said at one point that it really scared him.  And he would take things up to her, and then set things out so she'd have whatever she needed during the day while he was gone.  And the image I got, was very much my father running around really feeling scared, and uh doing a—, doing anything for my mother.  And, almost as if she were giving the commands, although I know, she was probably, he was deciding what she needed, I'm sure, in this case. </p>

<p>But, uhm, I also had the thought — which again, I guess, I don't like saying — but that uhm, when he said he was scared, I, I think my immediate reaction was, well why would you be scared, she's going to outlive you for years?  (Pause) In fact, I, I don't know whether it was yesterday, or when.  But recently — and it didn't seem connected with that, then, but perhaps it was — I was thinking just about this attitude I have, of uhm, women outliving their husbands, and how sometimes I've really dwelled on it, just connected with MSCZ and me.  And it, I mean it's such a silly thing to be thinking of.  But I'm thinking of it as, almost as if I have to plan things now, or uhm, (Sniff) I suppose that might just be another way of sort of thinking something destructive of MSCZ, though.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

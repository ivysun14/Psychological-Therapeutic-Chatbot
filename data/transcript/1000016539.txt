<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client number 1429/110, therapist Dayton, interview number four, November 24th, 1970. Hi Johnny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Keeping cool in here, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it was hot as hell so I opened the window and when the door is closed it won't be quite so drizzly. Is it too cold? Shall I close the window?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can keep my jacket on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We are supposed to have an absolutely perfect heating, air conditioning and ventilating system. We don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't really function that way anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, the radiator is on and the windows are closed so it gets hot as hell and you open the windows and it sometimes gets too cold. When actually, legally, that is administratively - clerically - we are never supposed to open the window.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For a fire or something else?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, because it throws the heating and air conditioning system off but it doesn't work well anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then in the summertime, the offices on the other side of the hall are frigid and these offices on this side of the hall are stuffy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My apartment is like that too. I can't control it - it is an old steam. I didn't know if that was steam.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is steam. This building was originally steam heated and it did not have air conditioning. They installed air conditioning during the renovation but I don't think they changed the heating system.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. It was really kind of weird coming here today because I have been reading some Hermann Hesse: I don't know if it is Hermann Hesse or some similar stuff. I just finished this one book by him an it seems like when I read him, it puts you in a more reflective frame of mind. I don't know if it is that so much. Maybe I maybe say this: when I left last week...I still can't figure out...it wasn't a sharp sensation but when I left... I felt I got on my Ma pretty big - at least more than I probably would do. I don't know if I was projecting it myself or if I picked it up from you but when I left, I had an uneasy feeling, like I wasn't seeing something. 0:03:31.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there was something missing from what we were talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I wanted to say I was getting it from you. When I left I...It was the way you set up the next appointment. I don't know if it was you; maybe it was me because I looked kind of funny going after my Ma because I had said a lot of things about her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean about funny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, like disappointed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you mean by funny what I had meant about...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you said you felt a little bit funny about what you had said about your Ma.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, alright. I see. No, more like the kinds of things which I had never...like, there were a couple of times when I said things in a way that it didn't strike me. For instance, like today now: maybe this is part of why I feel kind of weird- I feel kind of weird. Like I am going home for Thanksgiving - I leave tomorrow noon - and I really have no urge to go home. I would much rather just spend four days reading or playing ball or doing something around here. I don't really have any great urge to go home. I would like to go home for a little while but not for a whole four days. I may ask my Ma some questions which I don't normally ask her: questions like...and my sister too. 0:06:03.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of questions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking about my sister and one of the questions I would like to ask her was if she ever felt that she is emotionally cheated?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By your Ma?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or by herself: whichever one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you are saying that you would rather be her than go home but if you are going to go home, make sure that you are going to have some positive outlook toward them and not upset the applecart?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah because I have a whole lot...on the one hand, I am starting to think that I got emotionally cheated. That it is not only my own fault but that there is something else involved and I would primarily associate that with my Ma. On the other hand, she did as good as could be expected with the stuff she had to do. I cannot really knock her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 7:09)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, why go back...If I start nosing around...like I have done this before, where I might ask a few questions, she always takes it to me that I do a shitty job brining up that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She will feel guilty?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you feel guilty because you make her feel guilty? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I figure it is two ways. I think emotionally, I must feel more than I let off, you know. I must fell more toward her one way or the other. But on the other hand, I guess it has been that way right along. I still remember when I was a (inaudible 7:49), I only got one spanking in my whole life when it was a thing of punishment but her method of punishing was to say: "I will do it." In other words, she is going to do it. So if would be doing something, she would figure that I would come running and I would try to help up. I wouldn't always do it but I would do it sometimes. Now if I go home, I can get along easy enough but I don't know if want to ask questions like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you are not ready to? Or you don't know if she is ready? Or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just not sure what kind of questions I would ask. I would like to ask my sister some questions. Again, I have no great urge to want to go home. I would rather stay here. There are other things too: I hate the damn drive and all that. I have always gone home for Christmas: I always go home, usually, for Thanksgiving. It is like your routine. That is one of the things that is kind of bugging me about it. It has been strange at work too for about the last two weeks now. I have not done really a speck of work. I cannot really get fired up about something. I will get by minimally, you know, like today. 0:09:40.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Without any real involvement?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, right. Nothing. Today...what time did I get there? I got there on time but I spent...what did I do this morning? Oh, I think I typed one letter all morning long and in the afternoon, I just fooled around - I have an insurance problem - I fooled around with, which was not involved with work. And that was it. It has been that way for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like you are cheating the agency?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am just getting by. I am getting by.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are cheating yourself also?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, one thing kind of happened today. I was looking through this notebook of all the numbers and there was this one guy - Alfie Davis - who was one of the guys that was involved with one of the girls that I was involved with at the same time in times past. Like, he is the director of one of these things and I felt kind of funny about that because here I am - 27 - and here I am just stumbling around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he is a director.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he is a director of one of the facilities. That raised a few things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like: "What is wrong with me that I am not in the same position that Alfie is in?" We stopped around together and here he is, a director, and I am one of the group workers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also part of that: I am not really doing anything to pull off of it. I usually go on levels, you know. I will work really hard for a week or if there are emergencies - that is usually in processing - and then I will go into a skid thing where I just don't do anything, except the skid thing has been around for a long time now. I don't know what is causing it. When I was driving over here too, I thought about it here and there. A lack of confidence: a couple of people have told me that I really lack a lot of confidence. Like in my job right now, I don't know if that is a part of it. Afraid really to try anything because of that. I say to myself: "Okay, it is no big deal I lack confidence." That doesn't help any, you know. 0:12:57.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't help give you confidence?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said that so I can say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I lack confidence. Big deal."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You are not going to tell me, are you (chuckles)? What did I link it up today with? Oh, I thought back to an incident of...well, I guess it was because I read about Davis' name and I thought back to this girl and I thought back to one of the incidents that happened there. It all came back to me. One time, this is when I had been to Uni for about two years...we were walking to a rally - we had a rally in the park - that was a dumb thing like. I wanted to...I knew of a parking lot where we could park and I thought it was reasonably close, maybe about five or six blocks from the rail. so I went to park the car there. She said: "This is miles away." She said: "The rally is down the town." She read it in the paper. I remember quite distinctly that I had read where the damn thing was and I knew it was close and that it was the best place that we could have parked. But I didn't put enough stock in what I said to really...in fact, I was extremely tense about it. At the time, I didn't quite notice it. I figured that if that damn rally wasn't going to be there, I don't know what I would have done. As it happened, it was. I felt like I had been rescued. If it wouldn't have been, I don't know what I would have done. It was really that kind of thing and it was just a simple matter of why couldn't I use my own judgment to be correct. I get to that point and then I don't know. I can cite other things from recent times especially. I met my...the guy that is the director of this club I sing in - The Downtown Club. I met him in a shop about a week ago and it was another one of these things where I felt uneasy just talking to him because this guy was, you know, he is a professional. I am not sure I feel uneasy with you because if you are a professional, once again, I am not that professional, you see? 0:16:16.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel in an inferior position?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I can always recognize when that happens. It is a kind of an uneasiness and it is real...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like you don't feel as good as the other person or you feel as though the other person will not converse with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't notice it so much with you: sometimes, but not all that much. I am likely to get with our choral director. It is a feeling of not being relaxed. With him, it is because I think I have sung a number of bad notes. I don't think I am that good a singer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did they take you in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I passed the audition but I passed it in a devious manner. I can sing something if I know something but to sing something and distinguish sharps and flats, sometimes I would be off. My whole background voice is really shaky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can keep C, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That is another stupid thing, you know. Singing is really maybe the most marked...the place where it is the most marked; the thing I worry about with the confidence element. I never sang anything in my whole life until I was 21 and I always said it was because they told me in my house that I couldn't sing - I sang like a frog. Except when I was 21, I was forced to sing in an old folks' home: I was in the ministry and we had all these old people. If you didn't sing - there were only five of us - it was horrible. So I found out I could sing and then it was like the whole world, you know. I got involved in a choral group where we could get in without auditioning. So I got in and I got "The Messiah" down and the other stuff was easy. Then I came to this place. I flunked an audition in St Louis at a place called Bach's Society because I couldn't sing that well, then I came here and this place had an audition. There was no way out so I came early and there were 12 one line things that I kind of memorized. 0:18:57.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew what they ere going to be beforehand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. One I just took a guess at but I guessed correctly up until the last line - that was a little off. But I got in on it - they needed men badly. So like, all I am saying is that really I guess I don't feel like I am a good singer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand: you started this off by saying that you somehow cheated at your audition or something like that</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I was number 12. There were 12 people in there: I knew there were going to be 12 people auditioning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you heard...there was sight reading but you were the 12th person so you heard everybody else sing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, so by the 12th time around, I had memorized each one of the things except for a couple and on a couple I can get by well enough to hit notes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand why you feel as though that wasn't fair. Whenever the group is going to sing, they are surely going to rehearse beforehand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is no sight reading for a concert.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but one of the requirements to be in there is the ability to sight read and I don't really believe I am good...like I don't have a trained voice. I think it is a need I have because I have always wanted to sing. Once I found out at least I could carry a tune, then it was like an unquenchable sort of thing. The same thing with like, I never dated then all of a sudden I am dating women too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I am getting the feeling that everything you do, you feel as though you slipped in through the back door to get there: the choral group; as a social worker.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't have training as a teacher; you didn't get laid until you were 25 - everything you have done has happened late or accidentally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I didn't link it up all those ways but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You even had accidental fathers. Your father wasn't there. Who is there? 0:21:26.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is like a whole passive approach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you haven't done anything that you studied for or worked for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Nothing that I have really thrown myself in over a long-term or that I have really decided this is what I am going to do, except maybe losing weight - that is one thing that I have done in the last year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is something that you have worked at and have achieved.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is kind of strange too because one of the things that I usually think I have is if I make a decision, I have some sort of courage to carry it out or to go through with it. Now this brings back...people who know me superficially would think - like on conferences and stuff like this or in groups that I have been in - their impression is that I am like a fighter or that i.e. in one group where there was a clinical psychologist, he said what I do is hit and run, where I will make a comment about somebody or attack someone or say something and then not follow through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Run away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not sustain it. That is what I do many, many times. When it comes to the point of working it through, then it is difficult for me. The passive thing: I never thought of it across the board like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something concerns me about the word passive. It just doesn't sit right with me. I don't know why that is: maybe it is just me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Passive: unplanned, slipshod, those kind of things. 0:24:19.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess...okay, I guess there is some kind of hidden value judgment about that. Like you might know what to do but choose not to do it. Even slipshod has that same feeling to me. It is not that you knew what to do and didn't do it but it is more like you didn't know what to do. And things have kind of happened to you: you allowed them to happen. Those are the most expedient things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My job as a teacher?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What else were you going to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was absolutely: I mean, I tired for two months. I tried claims adjusting; I tried hospital ordinance; I tried literally everything available. Business: I went down to this damn employment agency; teaching, I did a teaching test. Everything, and that was the only thing available.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See that doesn't feel very passive to me. It was the availability you took advantage of when it came along. Am I wrong? Maybe passive means something different for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, yeah. It is like...in the instance of getting into teaching: after I was in, then I could find a lot of reasons for saying that is what I chose but the main point is that it was the only thing that was there and I needed a job. I needed to pay for a car and I was chicken when I started it because I had heard that you get shot at down there. And I didn't want to get shot at. I don't know, the word passive...maybe it is because I have used it before. To me, it means kind of a...okay, there is another way that I can explain it. 0:27:06.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Many times when I am with people, I will go along with what they want to do and I will be very happy doing it. I am just as happy as if it is something that I want to do. Or if it is like going on a date, I imagine I decide, "let us go to a show," or something like that but I will usually check with them. I will ask a question like...or if I am doing something I will say: "Is that okay?" Or: "How about this?" I will never...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never say: "This is what we are going to do."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, unless it is one of these things were: "Well, we are going to do this." Or it is something else: the teachers do that. If it is a decision on where we are going to go after we have played ball, it is unbelievable: nobody - nobody - says a thing and then somebody finally gets so frustrated they will say: "Okay, let us go here." Then everybody will go. Personally though...I am trying to think of times when I wouldn't do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you are saying is that you like to be able to take stands and stick by them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, another one of my friends that knows me well says that. I am very content the way I am now, he says, and it is like no commitment. I refuse to commit myself to any particular thing because if I do, then immediately I have got to defend it; I have got to explain it; I have got to ground myself somewhat. the whole thing with the...it struck a chord with me that the word passive...you said that it was available probably comes closer because I think I am looking too quickly for something; to try and find a whole bunch of things that all correspond so I can find a pattern. So I can identify a pattern and find out what is behind that. Maybe that pattern is not that simple.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you are making it too simplistic, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am trying...I do that a lot too also. It is kind of all or nothing. Grab something and then...it is like I said before though, like I never really felt, outside a rare number of instances, that I have really done something well; really thorough; really completed; that I have really thrown myself into; really put myself on the line. All of which I keep thinking that is at one level and it is not the level where it is going to really get answered. Like if I say I am pretty much passive, let us say, in many relationships...I am not passive in games though. 0:30:55.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are a hard player, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't in high school: that is the only place where I cannot figure it out. In games: I was one of those really loose cannons when I was playing football. I couldn't understand it. I should have known then...I played for the freshman; we were playing the seniors. This one guy gave me a kick in the balls so the next time...when he gave the kick in the balls - well, he gave me a knee - without thinking, I let him have it as hard as I could in the stomach. I was his counselor (ph). You don't go hitting your guys. I couldn't figure it out and he called me every name in the book. But in other games - like in card games - card games I take great delight in and usually people will be out to get me in a card game. I can play this game called "Hearts" which is a simple game but it is a game where you can really antagonize; there is a way in which you can do it. It is a kind of comrading kind of thing but it is still an antagonistic game. I have a way of irritating the other people so usually everybody will be trying to bomb me. In any game I am in - as long as it is a game - I am very competitive but if it is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In real life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not so sure. There is even a distinction in the games because the games as long as they are at - what I call intra-mural level - are very competitive. As long as you with, let us say, the general populace, then I am really competitive. But if I come against - say it is varsity stuff - like in a tennis match. Tennis is the only sport that I played varsity; I played basketball but when I played the varsity, I could maybe get a couple of games. In tennis, I played varsity. If I was playing a really good guy I would have to really talk to myself - all the time talk to myself - to try to even talk myself into thinking I could win. The same thing is true...if it is a pick-up basketball game I will score 40 out of 50 points - I would shoot like that - but if it was a game where it is at any level above a barn game, something happens - a real game - something happens. 0:33:46.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The you are down to two points.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, once in a while - once in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I exaggerated but there is a discrepancy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. If it is with the people that I really know - I don't know if I could confer all these things - but if I was with the people that I really know, then I have a harder time - much more difficult. Maybe, I don't know, maybe it is like I constantly assess people because if I think they are superior in something, it does something to me. It changes my whole way of being with them. I am usually more relaxed with people who aren't...I was going to say with people who aren't threatening; people who are incompetent but that is not so either because it doesn't hold across the board. Nothing really holds across the board. This whole thing with games: this one friend that I keep referring to that I worked with in public admin, he has been in psychiatric groups and stuff like that and so sometimes we would just sit down and say: "Why did we do such and such and such?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to figure out - analyze what is going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So if I usually mentioned it to anyone it would be him. He says that: he said that he has noticed that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you have confidence in his opinions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, see this is one of these things too that if I am with him, it is like I am the student listening and he is doing the talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are in the inferior position again, huh? 0:36:03.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean I will go along and he will talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You believe him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. He gets really far out with some stuff that I don't have the guts to accept really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But does that mean that sometimes you feel like telling him to f*** off or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I have never done that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not asking if you have done it: do you feel that way sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think sometimes he doesn't listen. My gripe against him would be that he shoots off his mouth right away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Letting off fantasies of his own rather than what you are saying - talking about what you are saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he is the kind of guy that I could say that to and would hear that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you said it to him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Indirectly, I have never said it, no, but he is in a pastoral site program now. He has been working on the death warrant and he recently told me that one of the guys called him the Baptist of the counseling program which meant that he just crashes in when he has got an answer and he doesn't stop to listen to what the people are saying. Now, I cannot remember if I have ever said that to him. I don't think I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you are saying that even if you did, he wouldn't pay attention to it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think he would: I think he would. He would probably react and say something like: " I know it." But he forgets. I think that is the way he might say it but, you know, I am not sure. That is another thing: either I am covering for him a little too or I am wondering if I have been irritated why I haven't said something. Because sometimes I have. In some groups, he goes on and on and on. He doesn't stop: he doesn't cease.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you, somehow or another, cannot say anything to him anyhow? 0:39:00.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if it would be a point of irritation that I would be aware of, I would. I think that much I can say: if it is a point of irritation, if I am consciously aware of anything, I will say it. My trouble is I wouldn't say it at that point - at the point that it happened - because I wouldn't know it was there. It is not until later</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you saying: that it would be inappropriate to bring it up in a different context or a different time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that is when I would bring it up. I would bring it up at that point because it is often so rare that I can clearly know what I am thinking at that immediate moment. Her, I can kind of stop and think a little bit and realize more what I am thinking; what I am saying; what I am feeling. But in any other context, I am never really all that sure. Like last night, I made some donkey assed comment about...I was at a party on Saturday. This good friend of mine might be pregnant; she doesn't want to be pregnant because her husband can't afford to change jobs and doesn't want to change jobs. She was at work yesterday and my other dumb ass partner...I should have said, you know: "Knock it off." That was my emotional feeling. This other woman in our office said something like: "Johnny is going to christen the baby." Or something like that. Which this friend of mine, the girl that might be pregnant...oh, she had a really bad day; just horrible things had happened on her caseload, and I knew she was worried about that anyhow. Then I went and made some dumb ass comment in another context about putting on weight because I was on this damn diet. I said: "You have been putting on a little weight which I am thinking, you know..." But I couldn't react like I felt I really hurt her. I couldn't go up to her and say: "Julie, I am really sorry."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it would just rub it in more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No...oh yeah, maybe. I thought about it later. I finally called up their house last night because I wanted to say that if that had hurt her I was sorry that happened; that I had said that. There were two things there : I didn't tell this other woman to knock it off because it is not the right time for that sort of thing, which I should have. And number two: I didn't tell Julie that I was sorry and I will try not to irritate her in that manner anymore. But I didn't: I didn't react spontaneously. It wasn't until later that I knew it. I think that is still in the back of my head now: what is this word passive? It is almost like now I have the feeling that that doesn't catch at all but it catches a lot of things. And the thing I want to know is why is that so? I don't think I am satisfied with that. I don't think that is a thing that I like about myself if that is what is really there. 0:42:48.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are not sure that the word passive really catches the flavor you don't want it anyhow: is that what you are saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that over (inaudible 43:08)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should you have to be expected to respond immediately? Why not (inaudible 43:14)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The second part holds.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If that is a part of me. I know I want the opposite but I don't want that completely. I don't want to be, like, extremely aggressive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to have some balance between being aggressive and passive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I didn't think that really characterizes me. People that know me have said that characterizes me. That along with...what they call lack of confidence - I am not sure what that means. In any case, both of those things...there are other things that go on with that too. I don't know, maybe they form a pattern, like avoiding a tense scene; avoiding confrontation - not argumentative confrontation but emotional confrontation, where somebody is extremely angry with me. An argument I don't mind, as long as it is at a verbal level. Or anger - that doesn't bother me, to some extent. If it is an emotional sort of thing; that I would rather avoid. It is like when we used to sing Christmas carols: one of the reasons that I didn't want to sing Christmas carols is because it was sentimental, soft, slushy. I would get embarrassed and I couldn't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sissy stuff? 0:46:43.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would get red in the face. I just couldn't feel part of it: I couldn't feel part of that sort of thing. That was when I was really young. In fact, I almost feared it: maybe it was part of the singing, you know; I cannot sing. I am starting to thinking there are other things to it; wanting to have fun. That was one of the things I was thinking about last week too - avoiding responsibility. I am starting to think there is a reason why I am 27 and not married. There is a reason why I am 27 and I am not in a thing where I am in something; where I am really throwing my life, myself...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you feel a part of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. There are other things too: not be committed to anything. I cannot pinpoint it and I am not so sure if I pinpoint it whether would help that much. I think, once again, to me the understanding has still got to be somehow from my history, somehow from my...from my home really. If something was to be done there, either my Ma would do it or I would be told to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you didn't volunteer or choose to do it; or do it spontaneously?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not usually. I would do some things for my Ma but it was always with the idea of pleasing. Once in a while, I would get a sense of just...that this was...well, she would use the tactic: "I will do it." I, for some reason, would think I better do it. Somehow, I think it must have something to do with my Ma being a headstrong woman. She really ran the house. But, on the other hand, I feel like I maybe ran her too because rarely did I get my will stunted. I can't remember any time where, if I wanted to do something, I couldn't do it. They were usually things I wanted to do. They weren't things that required great amounts of work; great amounts of effort.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sitting on my ass for the easy things, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nobody had put himself or herself out very much for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nobody what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nobody had put himself or herself out very much for you - to do what you wanted to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't follow that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said you were asking for things that people didn't have to do very much about; that didn't fit in very much with what they were doing - is not that what you were saying? You didn't make many demands on people. You might ask to do something but it wouldn't interfere very much with what your Ma was doing? 0:51:39.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see - I see. What I was saying was that I could get my way any damn time I felt like it. It is weird because I could get my way and usually I wouldn't have to put out a whole lot. But on the other hand, I never really had responsibilities. If it was important stuff, my Ma did it. I mean, you know, like dishes and stuff like that, I would do but I don't think I ever had to handle responsibility. I had a paper round but I didn't get a paper round until I was in ninth grade - or some dumb thing like that - when most guys were quitting paper rounds. I never had a gun; I never had an electric train until I was beyond the electric train stage. It was always things either came too late - I was beyond nine. It is even now: I always figured out I am four years behind everything. The gun again: I only shot the gun once: I have an aversion to guns. It was always I had to be told. I have to be told not to do something and what time to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't make that choice yourself is what you are saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I always reacted. I always reacted. I still do that: I react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't act first?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Most times. I would do things like questionnaires and stuff like that in the office. Emotionally, it is always reactive. In other ways, it might be something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eh, a week from Thursday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Let us see if I can come up with another way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks, enjoy your turkey. Are you going to stick around?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today: is it quarter break here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, not until December 18th I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, see you on Thursday week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye now - bye bye. 0:54:50.2</p>

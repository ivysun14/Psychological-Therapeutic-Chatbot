<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, how have you been doing [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, okay, about 3 weeks ago, I decided to go into Marshall Treatment because I'm just sick of everything basically.  I wasn't doing what I needed to do so I went in there and I just went to kind of get a grip on things and I started, I've decided I want to do the Paxil instead of the Wellbutrin.  The Wellbutrin was making me anxious and irritable and in the past I had taken Paxil and it had seemed to work, the only thing is, um, it seemed like at times with the Paxil I couldn't focus too well, that's why I had quit it in the past but, anyway, but I haven't used since I've been in there so I've been, tomorrow will be about 21 days that I haven't used.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Used what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Crack.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you relapsed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I did relapse, uh-huh.  Before my relapse, I was clean about two and a half months and it's just been up and down, up and down, and now I'm participating in the Addict Treatment program at Marshall Treatment, basically Monday through Friday, it's like group therapy from 10 to 12 o'clock and there's people, addicts, alcoholics come in and we just sit there and talk, whatever is on our mind and also I've started to go to meetings.  I choose to go to AA meetings because in NA meetings, listening to them talk about drugs or whatever, it really starts a craving with me, it makes me crave, so I don't go to NA meetings, I do AA, it's the same concept.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, so your depression is now, the Paxil seems to have it under control?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's going to take some time for me to really, I mean I'm better because I'm not doing any cocaine right now, you know, I'm not having those real deep depression days, you know, I am more even because I'm not using for one thing but I believe the Paxil is helping but it's just too early for me to say, it's only been 3 weeks since I've been on it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I remember back in what 1990 you came, I was giving you Paxil.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I did well with that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I gave you, as late as like November of last year you were on Paxil. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Forty mg in my records.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't remember exactly why I had stopped taking it them, probably because I was using or something and I just basically gave up I think, just gave up using any type of medication. I can't remember if I was using then or not.  I don't think I was using in November, I'm trying to remember.  I think actually, I think I had just had been using then stopped and I can't remember to be honest with you. November, December, I remember I was clean - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> December I gave you 40mg last year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, November and December, I believe I was clean then, November, December, and January, I believe I relapsed in February, I think, I can't remember. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, then when we saw you in March, you said that you had not taken medication.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I think that's when I relapsed, probably the end of February, I'm thinking because I was clean about 3 or 4 months around that time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that's when we gave you Paxil again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In March when you came back to us.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But anyhow, so right now what mg Paxil are you on?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just on 10 for now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On 10</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They just started me out with 10.  I had told them that the 20 starting out made me a little sleepy during the day and that's why I didn't want to start out with 20.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So that's all you are taking right now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is just 10.  A lot of it has to do with how serious I am about my own program, whether I want to stay clean or not, you know, so it's hard to tell right now, you know, how well it's working.  If I go out here and use, nothing is going to work, so like I said, it's going to take time to tell whether or not the Paxil is really helping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How is your depression so far?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Actually, the depression is, I feel okay, I really do, um, not like I was because I'm changing my environment.  I made that decision to change my environment.  It wasn't as bad as it was, I mean it got really bad because like I said, I was up and down with my use of cocaine.  I just feel a lot better now, my outlook is really better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Changing environment means you - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm moving to a new town, well, the town that I grew up in, but I'm moving there.  I haven't lived there in 20 years and I'm just really serious about wanting to stay clean, I've just put myself through a lot and my daughter and I'm just tired of going through it and also I'm not dealing with my ex boyfriend like I was because he was really keeping me upset all the time.  We were just back and forth.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, I've become stronger about staying away from him.  Part of, I think, I realize my addiction was him, I was addicted to him it seemed like, if he had a bad day, I had a bad day - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Co dependent.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and he's very controlling and has a lot of manipulation and it took a lot for me to see that so he and I now talk occasionally on the phone.  I haven't seen him in a month which is fine by me.  When I was at Marshall Treatment I didn't ask him to come see me, you know, if it was like the old days, oh you know, blah, blah, blah, all this crap, I don't know, I want to be totally away from him because I think that is what has caused, my excuse for relapsing is him because I'd be clean like 2, 3, 4 months and then we'd get into a huge argument or something and then boom, you know, that's my excuse for going to use so I realize that he's very controlling, um, probably made my self esteem low which he, he's just, oh he's real cleaver, so I just decided I'm going to stay away from him, I just can't, I can't deal with the manipulation. I need to focus on me and my child, you know, I can't repair what's been done with him and all I can do is go on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is he a drug user too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's very square, doesn't even cuss, doesn't drink, doesn't do anything.  He works a whole lot.  He's a neat freak, almost a neat freak.  He's just very controlling.  Um, he has an anger problem, I know he does, I can see that now and that's one reason too that I'm going to stay away from him because in the past, it's been almost 2 years ago, but he, we was together since, we had met in 2002 and I started, my relapse was in January of 2005</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, at that point, my usage, I had been clean almost 9 years before I relapsed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But the past 21/2 years, he has not been supportive at all.  He's been very hurtful in the way that he would retaliate by going out with some woman or something to hurt me for using drugs, for me having a relapse instead of going, taking me to a meeting or saying hey go get some help, so I said you know what, I'm tired of putting myself through this, I'm tired of this pain, I'd rather just cut him off completely, he's not completely cut off but 90% cut off, you know.  I just, um, feel that I've got to be independent and focus, like I said, focus on me and my child instead of worrying about what he's doing because I don't even think he knows who he is.  If you feel like you've got to go out here and talk to different women and do stuff like that to feel like you're somebody, then you've got a problem, you know, so I don't need that.  I'm trying to deal with the very moment, what I felt like at the very moment I went into relapse, I mean I was almost 9 years clean and that moment I felt, you know, before I actually picked up, I just felt a lot of pain, I just fell into a point where I felt like I only had 3 choices, like you know hurt myself or put him out of my life or smoke crack just for 1 day, yeah right.  Well, you know, that didn't happen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How many days did you do it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I did it for probably 3 weeks or a month before I could even put it down for even a week and then about 2 months later I went into a rehab, that was like in March</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, this time, this time</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Was my relapse this time, I think my relapse was about 3 weeks I think before I went into Marshall Treatment.  I was clean from I think part of June, July, and August and I relapsed at the end of August for a month, yeah, yeah, I remember now.  Actually, I relapsed, yeah, like September the 29th, around that time I think until, no I mean, August the 29th until about the 26th of September, that's when I went into Marshall Treatment and at the same time, here I am attending [INAUDIBLE] Tech, you know, I had took on a lot, I was trying to</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What courses were you doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Health information management which is a completely full load, it's the exact same classes you have to take for RN, so it's kind of difficult and, um, after a week I go and pick up like an idiot and, um, I'm thinking, you know, just for, you know, 1 night or whatever, of course that didn't happen so I still went to classes and here I am still trying to say [PATIENT NAME], you need to stop before you ruin everything and I'm still studying and taking tests and stuff and then the week of, um, the 26th, around that time, that week I stopped going to classes, I was just like full blown, you know, to my addiction.  I couldn't even think straight, you know, I just knew it was crazy, it was nuts. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you had used for what, three days or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I had used, what do you mean?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Continuously before you went or how</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh I was, yeah, I was using days before I went into Marshall Treatment, yeah, but it just got to the point where I was getting so carried away with my actions and I just, I couldn't deal with things anymore.  I said this has got to stop before something really bad happens.  I mean I even had money in my hand when I made that decision.  It wasn't because I was out of money, it was because this is crazy, this has got to stop and I was high as a kite when I made that decision.  I said I can't do this anymore, you know, so I just decided, I called an ambulance and told them to come get me, you know, I was just sick of it.  I just can't do it, I don't want to do it anymore.  If something painful happens in my life or I feel something painful, I want to have support around me, people.  I have isolated myself so much and I know it's from the depression too.  Um, I wouldn't go out and try to work.  There was days I couldn't get up out of bed and at this point, I wasn't taking anything.  There for a little while I was taking the Wellbutrin on and off but I'd, I'd sleep for 15 to 20 hours a day, just stay in bed, I couldn't function with my depression.  The only time, this was whenever I was, actually when I was clean for about, before the relapse I was sleeping a lot, I was depressed, even though I wasn't using I was still depressed.  What is was, I isolated myself, I wasn't talking to anybody except for my daughter and my aunt and my ex boyfriend, fiance, whatever you want to call him but now I'm reaching out to people.  I want to go to meetings, I'm trying to get support.  If I feel like I need something to use or whatever, I just, I want to call somebody, you know. I know I can't do it on my own anymore and that's what I was doing, shutting myself behind four walls trying to sleep the day away or watch TV thinking I can hide from this addiction but that didn't work, you know, there's no such thing really as willpower when it comes to that.  Now I do believe you can have a plan for yourself and you can follow that plan, you know, that's something that you have to do with everything, you have to have a goal, you know, so that's what I have now is a plan.  I'm just trying to humble down, you know, but I'm also dealing with the aftermath, you know, worrying about, you know, is there some things maybe I've done that I'm going to regret and possibly get in trouble for and stuff like that, you know, then there's guilt and remorse for what I've done of course and I feel bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For writing bad checks or something?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, actually the situation with school I'm afraid because I did receive some, you know, money, financial aid money and stuff like that but it wasn't my plans just to go and quit, you know, I wanted to go to school, it's just I relapsed while I was at school, the money comes around or whatever but I've got to get that straightened out with them and make sure I don't get in trouble.  I'm going to have to get them paid back somehow and I haven't even talked to them yet so I've got that worry on me, you know, I'm hoping they're going to say, you know, we'll give you time to pay back this money, you know, I don't know what they would do to me, I've never been in trouble or a situation like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have a plan of going back to school though?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, not anytime soon right now because I need some clean time.  If I try to take on that kind of pressure again, I'm going to crumble. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But in the future you are thinking</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I can't make it on 10 bucks an hour, it's ridiculous, I can't do that, I've tried it.  I mean all those years I was clean, all I was making was $9.50 an hour and I'm struggling, I can even hardly buy clothes for myself but my child had the necessities and I'm just sick of it. I know I have the intelligence, I need to be consistent, that's my problem, I'll start something and won't finish and I'm just sick of it.  I've got to do it, you know, I've got in almost a year of college and I do have credits but I just can't do it right now, you know, I try to convince myself of that, so what my plan is, is to right now just kind of ease back into things and just get me a part time job that's not too stressful and try to deal with people every day till I get stronger but I don't know what's going to happen with this school thing, I just can't go back any time soon and that really bugs me too, I really let myself down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine, I mean you plans, maybe [INAUDIBLE], you went in the hospital, they may look at that, you know</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe so, I've got to talk to them</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If there's anything we can do, we would be glad to</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I don't want to get in trouble, this is federal government; I do not want to get in trouble with anybody.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The loan money?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I sill have actually some of the money but I'm having to use it now just to get moved, you know, and they have given me 45 days to talk to them, to get in contact with them and right now I'm trying to get my move done and then talk to them.  I should be moved by next week.  They sent me a letter, so it's only been about 20 days, 15 days since they sent me that letter, but I'm afraid that I'm not going to like what they're going to tell me and I might just freak out but I just want to go ahead and get moved first and have my life settled.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Trying to avoid them is not going to solve the problem.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know but right now </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Talk to them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I am, it's just I've got so much on my plate right now and I'm dealing with my aunt who is psychotic, God help me, something is wrong with that woman.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who, your mom's</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My aunt.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're mom's sister?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, my father's sister and see my aunt is the only person in my entire family that I deal with and God knows I probably wouldn't fool with her if I wasn't so desperate.  She's so negative and there's something wrong with her, I think she has OCD, it's like, she's narcissistic, she actually, we had a disagreement 2 days ago, we were sitting at the table, I said [NAME OTHER] you're just perfect aren't you, you don't make mistakes, she said yes I am perfect, just like that and she meant it.  She meant it very well, she was not being sarcastic whatsoever.  I mean she walks around, I'm at her house right now even though my apartment is there and everything is fine but I just don't want to go back into that comfort zone because I know I'll probably start using again so temporarily I'm at her house, my daughter and me, and I'll go into the bathroom to put on makeup or something and I'll walk out for one second, she'll run right behind me and turn the light off or she'll just like always follow us around the house, it's just crazy, it's like you have to have something here, here, and here, well it's not normal and I tell my child, I say this is not normal and if she does something for you, she'll throw it back up in your face or whatever.  I mean when I was clean all them years, I stayed in contact with her and she did help me a little bit financially.  She paid for my daycare but the whole time, it's like she'd throw it up in my face.  So what I'm going to try to do is just stay away from her.  After I get moved into my apartment, I want to be totally free of her because see all I'm doing is kind of like using it as a crutch in a way.  I don't need that, I need to be totally independent.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That makes sense.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And plus I don't have to take her abuse, that's abuse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She has a hold on you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but you know what she'll do if I don't ask her for the least little bit of help, I'm not talking about just financial help, I'm just like, maybe give me a ride or something, she'll come around and say hey, you know, do you need something, can I do something for you, it's like she wants to keep that hold on me and I'm sorry, I can't do that, it's making me very sick with stress, I can't do it and it's sad that I can't have a relationship with this person, it's real sad, she has no compassion whatsoever.  She's just a very bitter person.  She's never had children so she doesn't know what it is to try to raise a child.  My child started her period yesterday, she's 13, she's female and she's got these hormones right now, so she's snapping at everybody and my aunt thinks she's supposed to be a robot walking around, you know, perfect and it doesn't work that way.  I'm trying my best.  She's my only child so, yeah, I might be making some mistakes but I'm trying my best. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's do this  [PATIENT NAME], 10mg, I have known you long enough, I think we need to up your Paxil.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it wouldn't hurt just to go to 20mg.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe next week.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And them bump it up to 40.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I just want you to quickly jump up on 2 weeks to 40mg.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay because you've done well on 40mg.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean with all this happening, I think</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I probably need it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so we can bring your depression under control.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or at least you can, because lots of changes are happening in your life and you need something to control your depression.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because I feel like, even when I get back into my apartment, I'm not going to have as much going on, so it will be easy to slip back into wanting to sleep all day and being depressed, so yeah I do feel like I need that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And go see the [INAUDIBLE] people as soon as you could.</p>

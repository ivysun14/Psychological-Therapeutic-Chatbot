<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p> (starts at 00:04:00)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. I'm actually going to just go grab a little water.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>(long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hot and cold. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:04:53) (sigh) (pause) (sigh) I was thinking about what you said last time about having weird categories. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think it makes sense. I should think about that more. Yes, even specifically, you know, people who I said, you know last time I said, you know, oppress me. (laughs) Because they seem to have everything or, you know, they have their act together, or they seem more purposeful or more intelligent. [00:06:06]</p>

<p>Are you implying that I should see them more as just people instead of all these, you know, things that I have or don't have? That's my perception, I think, of them. They have x, y, z. Or they don't have x, y, z. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>
<p>CLIENT: So instead of that should I see them as people?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wasn't prescriptive. I wasn't saying you see them this way and you should see them this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was really just sort of wanting to draw your attention to how you see them and have us think about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was less about how you should be seeing them differently. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I found something, you're right, that I bring like my Dad's judgment - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - along. Why is this? It's so weird to me because, you know, I really know, like I know he, all of his, you know, bad qualities. You know, I have like, you know, I hate him and I know he's messed up. (laughs) So why, despite knowing that and feeling that, why do I still carry stuff that he said with me. (laughs) [00:07:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Shouldn't my hatred just filter everything from him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I don't think hatred has that ability. And also that assumes that the only thing you feel toward him is hatred. Which is not true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. Yeah. (sigh) (pause) I guess I'm trying to understand this piece. And it is, I mean it is confusing and I'm sure it's confusing for everyone. Maybe not for everyone, maybe for everyone. (laughs) I don't know. I just think I straddle a lot of different circles and societies and cultures. And, you know. [00:08:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel that I do. But maybe you do too. Maybe everyone does every day. I guess they do. But for my undergrad I went to a state college. And then after that, you know, in [January I was at] (ph) MBU. And now, again, back to the state university. So I feel like I've seen people from very different economic backgrounds. And I feel like that has confused me as to not simply how to, what to think about them, but who I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I get so easily influenced because I think, you know, "I'm under construction," or whatever. "I could be like this person. I could be like that person." You know? Instead of thinking, "I'm me and this is who I am and I'm quite comfortable in my own skin." I feel like, you know, that is the normal way of being. (laughs) And I want to get there. [00:09:42]</p>

<p>But I feel like, yeah, I definitely have looked at other people I admire and have thought, "I want to be like them." You know? (laughs) (pause) I don't know why I do that. (laughs) And I feel like no one else does that or people don't need to do that. They are quite steady in who they are. You know, they don't get swayed or swept off their feet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) But yeah, like at BC there is such a diverse set of people and some of the people, really, they just baffle me. Like the way that they, their struggles and stuff. Like there are people who have like two hour commutes and God knows where (inaudible at 00:10:53) how they get there. I guess they drive and, you know. </p>

<p>And one of my classmates she has MS and she, you know, she can't drive. So she rides some commuter train and, you know, it takes her two hours, you know, each way. And this other person I was talking to, she works at a coffee shop. And she said she had woken up at four in the morning. And we were going back on the bus and it was like, you know, ten. (laughs) And I was like, "Oh, I'm so tired. You know, it's been a long day." (laughs) She says, "I got up at four." And I was like, "Okay." I don't even have the right to complain anymore. (laughs) You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I know it's all relative and all, but it's just like I feel, you know, humbled by it. But then, you know, I get off the train and I'm in the Square. (laughs) And them I'm like, "This is so confusing." (laughs) You know? [00:12:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me it is. (long pause) Yeah, I feel like there's a core and that shouldn't change no matter what. But I don't know what to put inside the core. (sniffing sounds) [00:13:16]</p>

<p>(long pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So if I look at people differently, how would that help me? What would be a scenario? What would it look like? (pause) [00:14:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess, for starters you'd feel less oppressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) Nah. I don't think so. (laughs) I can see, you know, picture their faces and I come walking into their home and then walk right out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure - Can you describe that again for me? That image?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you say I may feel less oppressed. So I was like, "Okay, I'm going to walk into these people houses." And then, you know, they're sitting there and all this stuff in my head, you know, judgments and like, you know, "Yeah, no I feel oppressed." And I would just say, "No, thank you," and then just walk away. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. What do you think the connection to an oppression and walking into their homes? That's so interesting. [00:15:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you'd walk into the home of someone whom you might feel oppressed by.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know if there is a connection. I just -  You know, because I was saying, you know, what would that look like. So, you know, I was already imagining going to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So I guess when I think about oppressing I think about someone coming to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahhh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not you going to them. So that's - </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't have a place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's Chris's place that I've done up and that I cook in. They have come, actually it's been they who have come. But I just kind of sit awkwardly and, you know, they ask questions and I either don't reply or change the subject or ask them if they would like more food. (laughs) And then just kind of flutter away. (laughs) (sigh) (pause) [00:16:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that is so interesting. Like, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually people don't walk toward people they feel oppressed by. They try to run away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, but they're my friends and I like them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's -  (laughs) That's so - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which isn't to say that they don't oppress me. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I completely respect them and I like them and, you know, objectively I like spending time with them. (laughs) But because we were hanging out together, you know, Chris and I with them and, you know, I'm invited. But then it's, yeah, after a while I feel, depending on, I guess, other things, depending on how secure or insecure I feel that week or that day. (laughs) You know, that will determine the number of minutes I spend engaging with them. (laughs) [00:18:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -  (pause) And I know a lot people don't have the issues I have. And I see that and I see that their interaction is so much more calm and maybe even fruitful and meaningful. Definitely fruitful and meaningful. I mean people who are successful right now, I mean from my batch from [my new school or] (ph) whatever, they don't have the psychological issues I have. [00:19:18]</p>

<p>So it seems like they have smoother interactions and they get to where they want to go. I just feel like I have so many hang ups. (laughs) It's just like I just get hung up. But, unfortunately, I've been hung up for years, and so that is not at all good. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it just prolongs my misery and uselessness. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially, you know, I feel like in the US I feel like I should take advantage since there is slightly less hierarchy, at least in social terms, you know? You don't go up and call your professor "professor" but you refer to them as, you know, with his first name. But I've always only called professors "professor." And, you know, there's the hierarchy that's set in my head. (laughs) [00:20:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been like level ground has not been, yeah, it's not there. (pause) I don't know. Like will I just automatically feel less insecure? Just one day later just snap and I'm sitting all by myself and suddenly I'll feel less insecure? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. Hopefully that's something we're working towards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it hard to imagine feeling that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel like maybe if it's people that oppress me, it's going to have to be, you know, repeated interactions where I've trained myself not to feel oppressed. (laughs) [00:21:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) I guess that's one way to look at it. I think about it as understanding the meaning of your oppression.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don't know what it means. (laughs) (pause) [00:22:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And both your parents, in their own ways, felt very oppressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I sense that was, it was almost the air you breathed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably. I mean, there were moments, but I guess they were really the exceptions. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) (pause) I'm just afraid. Everything has to be this big thing, that I make it out to be such a big thing, there's like all this baggage. (laughs) It's tiring to carry that around. You know? [00:23:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But Chris is going to Cambridge this weekend to work on a paper with his colleague. And he knows me and his wife knows me and, you know, we've hung out a couple, a few times. So they bought a house and they were like, "Yeah, you should come too." And I'm like, "Yeah, sure." (laughs) (sniffs) But I'm not going to go. And I'm just thinking that's what I had in mind, like walking into their house.</p>

<p>And it's like - I mean I get it objectively. I see that they have struggled too, and they were also poor students once and, you know. So like when I was in Nepal the wife was there too. (sniffs) And I was all in India when that thing happened with that old guy. And I was all alone and sitting in that room and I e-mailed a couple of people and his wife was one of them. She was far away in Istanbul. [00:25:08]</p>

<p>But she replied and she's not really warm. She's, you know, an academic. She's a historian so she is very, she's a little cerebral. But she's, you know, she's okay. She's, you know, congenial. So she wrote back and said, "Yeah, this is how it is Nepal. And I'm also doing my own research." You know, "I'm walking around the city and, you know, for the past week this man has just following me everywhere. And he thinks I'm a hooker so, you know, he just approached me and solicited me. And I was so disgusted by that." And this and that.</p>

<p>And you know, "Yeah, but if you feel unsafe let me know. I have family in India," and this and that. "You can stay with them." It just felt weird. I have her e-mail because, I mean, I can see that response. Like I can understand it, you know, that when someone says, "Oh, something, something happened to me." My response is to say, "Yeah, you know, the same thing happened to me, so you're not alone," and, you know. [00:26:13]</p>

<p>But sometimes you want them to (laughs), you know. Another response could be, "Oh, how horrible." You know? "I'm so sorry." You know? "Are you okay?" And, you know, "I feel bad for you." (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? Like those two are different responses).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I don't know, I just felt so alone at that time. I just was like, "What do you know? You have family all over," and like you just said. I have no - I just had that acute sense of loneliness there because I was just, I was by myself. You know? People downstairs were, you know, acting weird and all that. But I just felt like, "Why don't I have any family? Why don't have a place? I have nothing." You know, and all that. All those negative thoughts. (sigh) (pause) So. (pause) [00:27:20]</p>

<p>That's what I feel like when I think of security and not feeling oppressed, and feeling everyone is equal. I feel like I want to have a place in my head, in my mind, where I can go and feel secure or feel like it's a bastion or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like I don't have that. (laughs) Like I go back in my head and I see my Mom and I'm like, "Oh, there's my bastion." (laughs) You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. What is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like when I see her, you know, walking about and confused and, you know, there's like a pile of, you know, stuff around that she hasn't cleaned up and she hasn't organized. (laughs) I mean, she takes care of herself and all, but I just see it as someone I shouldn't, I can't lean on. You know? Maybe I can but I just don't think of her that way. (sniffs) [00:28:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of pathetic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not pathetic, just a little crazy. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. (pause) A can of worms. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (pause) I don't know if people have a bastion in their head when they feel insecure, if they're walking into a situation that frightens them or, you know, just makes them feel a little like, "Okay, you know, I better be careful," or, you know, like -  You know. [00:29:30]</p>

<p>(pause) (sigh) (sniffs) (pause) [00:30:29]</p>

<p>I mean, I feel like I'm the one that gets hurts the most when I push people away or, you know, judge them or categorize them. So it's not they who are like, "Oh no, we're so sorry you're not visiting us." You know? (laughs) They're not going to do that. It's me who will miss out on having friends. I do (laughs) miss out because I push people away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like an example of Chris's friends in India that you could in some sense feel comforted that this is a shared experience. That it is difficult for women in Nepal, and there is kind of an allowance for a particular kind of behavior toward women.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't feel what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that when she -  You know, you didn't like her response. And I understand what you were saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Knowing how you feel, that I could see how you would, there are ways in which you could like that response because she was saying, "I too deal with this every day." And that you could feel like it would be validation - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - of, you know, poor treatment of women. [00:31:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it didn't sound like it had that effect on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't know. My categories came into play and I saw her as having everything and me not having anything. (laughs) Because I just so many times I just feel like -  (sneezes)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bless you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. I should stop already. (laughs) I'm so tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffs) I think really one part of my head is just saying to the other part, "You know, just stop it with that thing." (laughs) It's not even convincing anymore. I don't know why. (sniffs) Because, you know, some part is saying, "You know, you have stuff. You have - " Well, right now, I feel like I have my routine. (pause) [00:32:48]</p>

<p>Like in some, I do have confidence that no matter where I go I can make the place look nice or, you know. (laughs) Like organize space and hopefully find some kind of employment. And take care of myself, cook for myself. So those abilities and my routine and my, you know, whatever, a first draft (laughs) of something. Yeah, a first draft. (pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>Like crazy Fridays. And then the stable weekdays. So. (pause) (sniffs) Isn't that sufficient? You know? To make a person -  (blows nose)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To make a person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, make one valid, whole person. [00:34:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What else do people have? You know? Nice childhood memories? Well, I have a few of those. You know? (pause) (sniffs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to feel good about what you have when you think about what you don't have and what other people have that you don't have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When that's in the foreground it's hard to feel that what you do have and what you have accomplished.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) How do I change that though? (laughs) It's my perception. (pause) It wasn't just that she had family and I didn't. It was also like, "Oh God, more strangers to take favors from." Because I think she said, "I have a brother here, a brother there, so you can call them." And I was like, "Yeah, more strange men." (laughs) [00:35:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I guess, that is valid. You know? Because I was, I had just taken a favor from a friend, a friend, whatever. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her Dad was acting weirdly so a valid feminine reaction to offers of more help from more strange men. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, obviously the (inaudible at 00:36:04) that was also because she has a family and I don't. But then, you know, I feel like maybe I can battle this or counter this with just objective truth that the reason why I don't have family is because A, you know, my Mom has cut off all ties with my Dad's family. B, you know, they're all scattered and they're either in the US or they're scattered and we're not in touch with them. So. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is a result of certain things that have happened that I had absolutely no say in. So, hence - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I find myself not having much family in Nepal. And that I should appreciate (laughs) that it isn't too indulgent or that I still want to go to the country. And I take such interest in it and I want to write about it, despite the fact that it's hard for me. You know, it's harder for me than it is for, you know, people like her who can just, you know, buy a ticket and don't have to worry about where to stay. [00:37:35]</p>

<p>Although, she did too because she wanted to do research in Istanbul and she didn't have family in Istanbul. (laughs) So she was staying at a hostel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's funny. Like she was in a hostel and she, you know, had this experience. And I was in a nice comfortable home (laughs) and I also had a weird experience. (pause) So. (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean there's certainly truth to what you think that, I guess if you're in a comparison mode, there are a lot of things you didn't get that other people get. That's absolutely true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there are ways, there's treatment that you suffered that other people didn't have to suffer. And your parents had grave limitation. And so that's all true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not making that up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this should make me feel what? It should liberate me. [00:38:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. It's interesting. This is something that you do. So wanting something prescriptive in what I say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not that. Because I already said this, right? That, you know, there are some objective truths that I should look at and say, "Well, I cannot change this." You know? "I had no say in it and I'm never going to have," whatever. Because, you know, it's in the past and I cannot change it, for example. </p>

<p>So this should liberate me in the sense that, "Okay, you know, that's taken care of. I can't take care of it, but that's all taken care of. So let's worry about something that I actually can change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that is a liberating thought. The complexity to it, as you've pointed out just at the beginning of the session with the association with your Dad, is that it's not only the past, it lives inside you in the present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The events happened in the past, but they've been internalize in a particular way in that they are sort of still living and breathing inside of you. And that's the complicated part. [00:39:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are we done?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, we still have like five minutes or so. Did you think I was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I just didn't want to get into something big, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like, you know, I do this subconsciously. And it doesn't even have to be academics. Like it was actually happening with this, you know, this Friday guy. (laughs) Like he took me to his friend's place and we were just hanging out. And, you know, that's when I was, I think in that previous session, I was like, "Yeah, these guys are not intellectuals." And you're like, "Wait a second. Your categories are weird."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did not use the word "weird."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just summarizing. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, but that's not -  Actually, you're not summarizing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm giving it my own flavor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're giving the flavor - </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not criticizing you. I'm not saying that - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm just trying to point that already a process takes place where you're taking in what I'm saying in a particular way. [00:40:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But this is helpful though, because in the sense that I very much appreciate and I find it useful that you said, "Your categories are - " You know, you pointed out that I should think about them. So that's my idea that I'm feeling, not quite right, but they're problematic. But so, you know, I was just there and, you know, sensing that, you know, yeah, I'm a poor struggling artist. And, you know, these guys are corporate and they have, I don't even know how much them make. (laughs)</p>

<p>But apparently they have -  What do they call it? Trainers or -  At the gym. Like you have - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Personal trainer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like they pay them three hundred dollars a month. And, you know, that's like, yeah, that's half my rent. (laughs) So, you know, I have that and there are all these stimuli coming at me where, you know, there's like, you know, learning that their parents fly first class or whatever. All these are coming at me and I'm like, "Oh my gosh." And I feel completely bombarded.</p>

<p>And what is my defense? My defense is to say, "Okay, they're not intellectual." I look at them and they're watching and they're watching some really silly movie. [00:42:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, people their age who are intellectuals would be watching, you know, Godard. Or, you know, they would know so much more about the history of cinema and, you know, like genres and directors and, you know. (laughs) So that's my defense. And then, you know, another defense is to say, "You know, I cannot measure up." And, you know, and then my baggage comes in. And, you know, like, "I didn't have this. I didn't have that. My Dad was this." </p>

<p>But I use that as a defense. Does that make sense? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And why is that? You know? And it's not even a good defense. It, in fact, weakens me. It's actually the sort of defense, it's putting on a jacket, which is the opposite of a bulletproof jacket. It says, "Okay, soft spot here. Hit me here. Soft spot here. Hit me here." You know? (laughs) Or, you know, it's giving them ammunition to make me, injure me even more. [00:43:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well, when you describe that particular sequence, it started by your feeling like an outsider.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then it sort of goes to your feeling now even more like an outsider.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you start by feeling like an outsider to sort of this, you know, rich world of riches.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then your mind goes to ways in which they're an outsider. They're an outsider to an intellectual culture.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're on the fringes of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then it kind of goes from there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's really like a power play and, you know, it's happening obviously very quickly. And what are we doing? We're drinking together and I'm playing their music and their playing a silly movie. And they're not even thinking any of this (laughs) obviously. You know. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what's especially interesting is that these are not people that you're seeing from across a restaurant. This is you're with them because of someone that you're dating. [00:44:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're already being brought in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not like you're -  You're far from an outsider from that vantage point because he wants you and he's bringing you into his world. It's not someone that you're observing, you know, across a room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or in a movie. But that doesn't give you comfort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it supposed to give me comfort?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Coulda, woulda, shoulda. (laughs) I don't know if it's supposed to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you see what I'm saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're already, at the onset of this, by definition, not an outsider in important ways, because you're being brought in by someone who wants you and is interested in you. You're not there because some friend tells you to come along somewhere, that you're tagging along with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? That's what I thought I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's interesting. Right? Even as I said that I was thinking, "You probably think that way."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what is your theory as to why this guy - who still has no name, by the way  - </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you a tagalong to him? Why is he bringing you in? [00:45:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's invited me to his friend's parties. This is the first time I had gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then what are you to him? You're not sort of - You didn't bump into him randomly. You have a relationship with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm saying, by definition, that's not being an outsider because the two of you are connected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not someone who just wandered off the street and he's like, "Oh, come to this party with me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I feel that way. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel that way with Chris too, actually. So, I guess, that is a big can of worms.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But these men want you and they want to be with you. And that's not being an outsider.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why? I have no idea why they want to be with me. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that because it's hard for you wrap your mind around it, you just push away that knowledge that they do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's very scary. Yeah. [00:46:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scary to feel that they want you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, we've run out of time. Would you like to come back again this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's up to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be the, was it fifty dollars?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, in terms of the cost.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're worried about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can talk about. I mean - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand that you - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really appreciate the offering another session. And I know it would be beneficial.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, come back, we'll figure it out. I can always just bill that session to insurance. Let's put that aside. If you want to come - Would you like to come back? [00:47:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll just ask that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean like Friday morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I do have something. I'll have something Friday morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will probably be around, I need to check, I think it would be nine thirty if we did a Friday morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me e-mail you the exact time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Very good. So I'll see you then. I'll e-mail you before. You know, sometime later today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a good day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Thank you. You too.</p>

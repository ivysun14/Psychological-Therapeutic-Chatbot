<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There we go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still really angry at my priest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Um, [raise that] (ph) and so [pauses] on the recommendation of an Internet advice column that I read regularly, one of the letter-writers this week had issues with parents gas-lighting her and blah, blah. Um, so the advice columnist said, "You should check out this book House Rules by Rachel Sontag. Are you familiar with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I think I've heard that name, but that — even if that, that's all I would know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is a memoir of growing up kind of like upper-middle class suburbia with a family that looked fine to [shifts in seat] all outside purposes - you know, well-off, family vacations, that sort of thing. Um, but her parents were extraordinarily psychologically and emotionally abusive to her her whole childhood. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and there were no signs because they weren't physically abusive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's — social workers didn't believe her, essentially. Um, so I got that book yesterday, and I read it straight through last night when I got home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I stayed up until three finishing it, and it was just [clucks] so cathartic to realize that it is [chuckles] not just me, that there are other people whose parents were just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...As crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I was thinking as you said that, I've not read that particular story, but it is certainly a story I've covered (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I just [exhales] — I don't know — it felt really validating...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...To realize that someone else — like, not just with their parents were the same kind of crazy as my parents, but they had the same kind of [shifts in seat] emotional journey and mental thought processes. Like, it was — it was really eerie, really, how close her story matched mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:01:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, you know, the realization that her mother was not able to stand up to her father and was therefore not trustworthy, um, kind of treating her mother as a collaborator in the abuse, and, you know, realizing that she had to, like, cut off emotional ties to have any kind of sanity. It was just really — I don't know — [chuckles] it was really upsetting to read, but I'm glad I read it, if that means anything. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's been on my mind today. Um, [pauses] I'm also mad at my priest. I got absolutely nothing done at work today. I could not focus worth shit, at all, [chuckles in exasperation] um, between these two things that just kept sucking up all of my attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which would you like to talk about? [00:02:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] I don't know. [Pauses] [sighs] I feel like, in the long run, probably sorting out my stuff with my parents is most likely to be helpful to me. But, like, the situation at church — I kind of feel pressured to make a decision sooner rather than later about... [shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there are three questions: will I rescind my position as chaplain of the working group; will I leave the working group entirely; and will I leave the church entirely?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know the answer to any of those questions yet. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, is there one of these that you feel like talking about, particularly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] I don't know. [Pauses 23 seconds] Yeah, I don't want to talk about my parents today. [00:04:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're coming to visit next weekend, and [pauses] I'd rather leave parental stuff kind of locked in a box until after they leave...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So as to not risk [exhales anxiously]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Having a showdown or something [chuckles helplessly] while they're in town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Julia (ph) - at one point this afternoon, right after lunch, I just really could not focus at all. Like, I was just so angry at her. Um, so I got out some paper and wrote a letter in longhand that was [chuckles] — well, I kind of almost went into a fugue state while writing it. I don't remember what I was thinking while I was writing it, but when I was done, I reread it, and it was just remarkably mean and petulant, and [chuckles] deliberately cruel. [Chuckles] [00:05:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt so much better having gotten it all down. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I won't send it, in part because it is mean and deliberately cruel, but in part because I'm kind of embarrassed that I used yellow legal paper [in writing it out, being Catholic] (ph), and so the color switched and... [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Do you want to read it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could. [Unzips a bag] It is long. It is two pages; although, that's longhand and not computer typewritten pages. [Shifts in seat] [Sounds as if scooting chair] Well, you can read it if I can find it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sound of zipping] Aha! [Riffles through papers] You're not interested in me reading circuit diagrams aloud. [Straightens paper] [00:06:00]</p>

<p>Julia,</p>

<p>I am baffled by your letter. I wrote to you about a personal and pastoral matter, and you somehow thought it was appropriate to bring in a professional anti-racism consultant and tell another unrelated parishioner about my business. In case it isn't clear, I do not at all agree that this was an appropriate response.</p>

<p>This matter has absolutely nothing at all to do with the Anti-Oppression Team or my work with it. Not everything in life is a privilege dynamic. You wrote something well-intentioned but tone-deaf, insensitive, and hurtful to one of your parishioners, a survivor of child abuse and a grieving mother. How this has anything at all to do with anti-racism or anti-sexism, or anti-classism is beyond my weaker intellectual abilities.</p>

<p>Julia makes a big deal about how her father was the President of Princeton University, and she went to an Ivy League school, and she went to Harvard, and she went to Temple for graduate school, and this is a huge deal that she brings up at every possible opportunity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Opportunity? [00:07:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hence, the dig about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Resumes reading] I also find it curious that you want to discuss the impact of my letter on you without ever saying what that impact was. I can't say whether or not I'm willing to engage further unless you use your words and tell me what the impact on you was. As it stands, I can only guess. My guess is it stirred feelings of defensiveness; this I can understand because I, too, would feel defensive if someone told me I had been utterly insensitive and cruel to them. However, I never attacked you in my letter. Why would I write anything except how the words on the screen made me feel?</p>

<p>I suppose I made the mistaken assumption that you cared about my feelings towards Mother's Day. [Turns page] And it has become clear to me over the last few years that you are either unable or unwilling to behave towards me as to any other child of God, who has fears, hurts, and loves. However, you appear to be unable or unwilling to function as my pastor and shepherd because of my work with the Anti-Oppression Team. I honestly don't know what it is about me that has inspired you to such hatred. [00:08:08]</p>

<p>Jessica has written to me that you believe I would be unable to work side by side with you on the Anti-Oppression Team. I told Jessica, before I read your letter, that I am able and willing to put aside my hurt feelings for the sake of the greater good. However, after reading your letter, I do not believe that you are capable of separating your personal feelings towards me from the Anti-Oppression Team work. I would hate to be the excuse given for the Anti-Oppression Team falling apart; therefore, I am resigning both my position as lay chaplain and as a member of the Team.</p>

<p>Finally, let this letter serve as a formal request to have my name removed from the rolls as a member of the Parish.</p>

<p>So I'm awfully snide.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Barely chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is awfully honest, too. [00:08:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. [Pauses] [Fidgets with papers] And I'm not sure if quitting the Anti-Oppression Team and/or leaving the parish would be kind of a — a justified way to protect myself from further hurt, or if it would just be cutting off my nose to spite my face. Um, you know, I can't — I'm really having a hard time to be going out of my desire to say I'm leaving the parish because I just want to twist the knife in a look-what-you-did-you-drove-me-out, or if it is because I actually think it would be more damaging to me to stay than to — to stay than to leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [About like] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, my motivations are unclear to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] [sound of popping something]</p>

<p>[Silence for 20 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:10:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's going through your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] [pauses] Just tired of the drama. [Pauses] My — I'm looking forward to going to church this [[slaps surface] Sunday because I know Julia is out of town, so I won't have to deal with her. [Fidgets] Um, [pauses] no, I haven't been since May and didn't miss it, but [chuckles] every Sunday morning, I wake up and I think, "Time to go to church. I really don't want to see Julia." Just the thought — like, I'll be wide awake and [claps hand] making my coffee or taking a shower, or whatever, and I'll think about how Julia will be there, and I'll have to say something, and just this huge wave of lethargy sweeps over me, and I just want to go back to bed. [Shifts in seat] It is just — it is as if my brain just can't even handle thinking about it, so it shuts down. [Shifts in seat] [00:11:05]</p>

<p>[Silence for 49 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my impression is that it is something about the intensity of your anger that becomes overwhelming... [00:12:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And that sort of becomes hard to bear...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And causes a shutdown. [Pauses] [I can sort of] (ph) [inaudible at 12:17]</p>

<p>[Silence for 45 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] I also [pauses] am desperately worried about ending up like my dad, not just in this situation — although, this flows (ph) into it, but just in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, my dad is completely unable to handle any kind of conflict. He'd lose his temper and quit his jobs, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That's why we moved every year or two. Like, we didn't stay in the same place for more than two years my entire childhood. [Door slams in distance] Um, [pauses] and I don't want to be like that, that at the first sign of conflict, I'm like, "All right, I quit. I'm walking away. Done now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [slaps surface] I mean, that terrifies me. I don't want to [pauses] be like that, and [sighs] — I don't know — I don't have a good idea of what is out-of-line behavior on the part of other people versus what's just normal, everyday you-have-conflict-with-the-people-that-you-work-with, and you just deal with it because [slaps surface] that was never modeled for me growing up. [00:14:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because we didn't get to stay in one place, I didn't learn how to cope with conflict in my peer group...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because if there was conflict, who cared? We'd be moving that summer anyway, so I never learned how to resolve conflict, and I don't know how to deal with this. I've been a member of this parish for close to ten years, which is a pretty long time, um, in my history to stay with any one group. Uh, and it is just [sighs in exasperation] I don't want to lose that, that this is really, really hard. [Chuckles in exasperation]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um...</p>

<p>[00:15:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 30 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess an arcane (ph) ingredient in this seems, to me, to be the way that, um, [pauses for eight seconds] I think maybe the main thing that [pauses] enrages you is, uh [pauses] — is simply the way she, [door closes in the distance] uh, ignores or completely fails to get where you're coming from. [00:16:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then, maybe relatedly, kind of [pauses] mischaracterizes it, [pauses] um, [pauses] rather than really being able to kind of hear what you're telling her. [Clicking sound] I mean, for example, I [guess the products but] (ph) I imagine it would make all the difference in the world if she, you know, said something saying, "Look, sorry I think I may have misunderstood."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I actually, on reflection, can understand why you're so upset about da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, "I didn't get it at first, but now it is clear the way that you've been kind of — may feel or think like sort of marginalized, left out, devalued, ignored, any one" — [slaps surface] There were things that both she's done in your exchange with her and was going over the way Mother's Day was being advertised and celebrated... [00:17:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That [pauses] you'd feel vastly differently about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, as upset as you are at this moment about what's happened...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...If she were even to actually show you she was starting to listen now...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It would kind of change a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I even would've accepted a fauxpology of the, "I can see why you would feel that way. I meant well. I certainly didn't intend to be hurtful."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that — I would've been willing to accept even that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's funny — I'd just never heard the term "fauxpology." [Chuckles] [00:18:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is like a faux pas and a faux apology altogether.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, [pauses] instead of what was basically a repetition or a rehashing (ph) of the problem itself, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just [intonates] still completely confused about — well, I mean, in addition to hurt and angry, I'm also confused about why on Earth she thought that the impact of my letter on her was something appropriate to bring up in this context, or why she thought bringing in a professional anti-racism consultant had anything to do with this. I'm just [sighs] — I don't understand and, as we've discussed before, I really hate it when I don't understand what's going on. [Shifts in seat] [nervous chuckle]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what...? [00:18:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, [breathlessly] I just keep struggling to come up with some explanation that makes this makes sense, and no matter how I twist it around, it doesn't make any sense to me, and that's really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That is especially helpful because...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Um, I heard it at first a bit differently...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...When you were talking about not understanding and then laying out the reasons.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I heard it as more an accusation of how ridic — incomprehensively ridiculous she's being, which...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I think maybe there are two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is both, yeah. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] But — but I didn't — I can see that there's another part of it, as well, which is your sort of genuine confusion about what the hell would make her think of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, I don't understand what's going on, and it is just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And where does that leave you? I mean, do you have sort of thoughts or fantasies about where she could be coming from? Does it make you feel really helpless or in the dark to have no idea, to not know whom you're dealing with anymore? Is there something else? [00:20:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Becomes emotional, possibly begins to cry] [inhales] I think it is [pauses for six seconds] not so much a feeling of helpless but definitely a feeling of being in the gutter, like [pauses for six seconds] — in my first letter to her, I tried to use language that she's used before in her communications for the vestry and her sermons, because [shifts in seat] [sighs] I thought maybe, if I made an attempt to speak her language, I would get through to her, and I just really wanted to make her understand. And I clearly failed at [chuckles] making her understand, and it might be something that's just beyond — that's just not humanly possible, to make her understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:20:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, [pauses] I don't know — at least in other conflicts I've been in, like interpersonal conflicts, I've had some semblance of an idea of what was driving and motivating the other person. But in this case, it is just [slaps surface] [pauses] confusion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 68 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:22:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 23 seconds] it seems like it is [pauses for six seconds] very hard to, like, uh [pauses] [turns paper] maintain confidence in your point of view when you get really angry about something that you — [wherever you want, your dad] (ph), you [pauses] lose a sense of whether you're being appropriate. [00:23:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You [pauses] — uh, I wonder if that's contributing it all to how — making it less clear where the other — like, where she's coming from or the other person's coming from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, she might just be opaque, totally irrespective of [chuckles] what's going on with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess I wonder if...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not the only person who's had problems with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not the only person who's said, "I don't understand what the hell is going on in her head." [Chuckles] It is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is not just me that she's opaque to. [00:23:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Um, yes, I — I don't know how much [pauses] is simply that, but I'm wondering if [pauses], also, when you get angry, it can — you can [pauses] [clucks] lose a sense of connection to the other person or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or as clear idea of, like, where they're coming from. Again, maybe that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...True [slaps surface] but 2 percent in this instance, but I — I don't know. But I guess I'm wondering about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... [Pauses] [sighs] [pauses for 19 seconds] — I guess what I'm trying to do is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:25:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Like [pauses] think through what happens for you and what gets set up...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ....When something [slaps surface] makes you so angry because, um, it is probably [slaps surface] very hard to tell at the time, [pauses] and [slaps surface], um, [pauses] hopefully, that would shed some light on what can make it so hard to deal with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Lightly sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And how to handle it. [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think, in some ways, my behavior with anger is kind of an all-or-nothing thing, that there aren't degrees of anger?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, this has been a huge source of conflict for me and Dave our entire relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, if he's annoyed at me or frustrated, or irritated, or even a little bit angry, it is — it feels to me like it is the end of the world, like he hates me and he's going to leave me now. [00:26:05]</p>

<p>Um, you know, just like three days ago, um — you know, our — our apartment has — doesn't have central air; we have a window unit in the bedroom and nowhere else. So we were both sitting in the bedroom and doing stuff on our computers, and, um, I can't even remember what I did. Dave was like, "That's really annoying. Can you please stop it?" And I was like [shifts in seat], "Fine! I'll leave," and I stormed out and went into the living room. Well, there's no air conditioning, and I was miserable, and Dave was just [intonates] really confused! He didn't tell me to leave; he asked me to stop doing whatever it was I was doing that was irritating him, and I just — kind of in my mind, "Dave's annoyed at me" meant, "He doesn't want me anywhere near him, and I have to get out of his face or everything is going to explode and be dire, and..." [sighs] [chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Wow. [00:26:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I meant I'm not angry because, "Nahh, he threw me out of the living room, and it is really odd in the bedroom, and it is really hot, and he knows that's the only place with the air conditioning, and how dare he throw me out of my own bedroom," when that wasn't even what happened. And it was just like, in hindsight, I realized, "That was really ridiculous of me." But, at the time, it really felt like he wanted nothing to do with me and wanted me not even in the same room with him, and, "Get the fuck out," and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It was horrible and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Fidgets] [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 42 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long did it take for you to kind of settle down and see it that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A couple of hours.</p>

<p>[Door closes in the distance]</p>

<p>[Silence for 18 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what else goes through your head, like, when you're in the living room, really uncomfortable and really mad? [00:28:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It turns into a — an ego thing. [Door closes in background] You know, I'm not going to go back in there 'cause I don't want Dave to think I've given in, and I don't want to beg for his forgiveness. If he wants me in there, he should come out here and tell me so, and [shifts in seat] like — it was totally shaved of my father's behavior, like just [pauses] the way he deals with his siblings; the way he deals with his kids, [slaps surface] with his colleagues. It is always everything is an affront to his pride and to his sense of self, and he's never the one to extend the olive branch...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Never, ever, ever in my entire life have I known my dad to say, "I'm sorry. I was wrong," or even, "I miss you. Please come back." Um, and it is really scary, but whenever there's conflict, even with someone I trust as much as I trust Dave, the first place I go to is that, you know, wounded pride...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."I'll show you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."I'm not going to be the first one to cave because —" — I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're like in a cage match....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...All of the sudden. And it is like entirely sadomasochistic, by which I mean [slaps surface] all about somebody submitting to somebody else...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...In, like, the most humiliating, deprecating sort of way, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doing exactly sort of — you know what I mean, same ballpark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 50 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:31:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, this is really, um — uh, a terrible vulnerability to be walking around with. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Vulnerability?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes. [Pauses] This is how you react...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...When something makes you angry, in this kind of uncalibrated way. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] "Uncalibrated" — that's a good way to describe it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Oh, thank you. And, uh, [pauses] — and in a way where [pauses for five seconds] your perspective, in a lot of ways, goes out the window...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...In place of something, you know, much more extreme, much more either/or, um, for which [pauses] it can take a few hours to settle down...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Even when it is a relatively minor [pauses] incident. [Pauses] Um, [pauses] that puts you in a very vulnerable position. [00:33:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it — uh, [pauses for eight seconds] — you know? Like, [pauses] you were really upset.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had to go somewhere where you were physically [chuckles] uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, you were totally disconnected from Dave.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure you just, emotionally, felt awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel bad about having reacted that way afterwards, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Both in yourself and, I imagine, a bit in relation to Dave.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] that sucks. I mean, like, I do think that's a — a vulnerability. Um, [pauses for ten seconds] — I mean, it really makes you [pauses] subject to... [00:34:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ....Things like this that can happen, like, um, not able to kind of protect yourself and navigate them easily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] I want to be clear that [pauses] — well, that's complicated. You know, like in the situation with Julia...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It seems it is a mixed bag. Obviously, that's wayyy huger that what [lightly chuckles] happened with Dave, and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And so, you know, it feels much better to be vastly more justified in how angry you are and how critical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'm also — I feel like, when Dave and I fight, like we're both equally in the wrong sometimes. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like, in this case with Julia, she is clearly in the wrong and I am clearly not. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, maybe there are some places on the margin where I could have handled things a little bit better, but....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, basically, she's wrong and you're [chuckles] right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like, I don't know, but I feel a little bit belligerent in saying [chuckles] so, but [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's your judgment...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...After thinking about it a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even so, I guess [pauses] — I think this issue with anger is still a big problem in that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You're much more worried about your judgment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] yeah, it was going to plague you, but it probably plagues you a lot more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Even than it would have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, it evokes worries about, you know, whether you're going to do this serially.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:35:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] [outside conversation ongoing in the distance] it makes you much more vulnerable to things like this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't mean like you being less pissed off if you didn't have this. I mean the way that would also be making you anxious and self-doubting, and, you know, maybe at times unable to kind of put it aside for the moment or something. That's what I'm speaking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah. [Pauses for five seconds] It sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [weakly] I can't put the anger aside enough to just enjoy Sunday services, which...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I know a lot of people think of going to church as a chore, but it is something that I really, really enjoy, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Most of the time look forward to, but I just [pauses] — she stands up to preach, and, like, even before our first conflict, she was a terrible preacher, and I always kind of rolled eyes at her sermons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, a sermon is 15 minutes long out of an hour and a half service breaks (ph), so they can just — you know, you can grit your teeth and get through the sermon. But now, it is to the point where, even apart from the sermon [slaps surface] when she's just reading lines out of the Book — out of The Book of Common Prayer, I just — I — like everything about it just sets my teeth on edge, and I'm just sitting there, thinking, "Why is she up there? She has no business being at the altar. This is completely inappropriate." And it is just — I can't just let go and experience the service because it is just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Her very presence fills me with rage. I wish I [chuckles] had a [breathlessly] better handle on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're working on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I know there's the official doctrine of the Church, which, you know, in the abstract, I agree with — is that the — what's the word that's used? — [sighs] I'm trying to remember. The — the — I can't remember the actual word — the goodness of the priest has no impact on the validity of the sacraments...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So, you know, your priest could be [pauses] Hitler and the sacrament would still be valid in the eyes of God...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because what matters is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the eyes of [inaudible at 38:49]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, what matters is what's in your heart and your spirit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, if the priest is horrible and not good — I can't remember the word that's used — but it might mean that whatever benefit they get out of it is invalid, but you and someone else — they can't impact its validity for you. [00:39:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and in principle, I agree with that; I think that's a perfectly reasonable, both practically in terms of caring for people where they're at and also, you know, theologically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, if you have a mean librarian, it wouldn't mean you can't get a lot out of the books.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I sort of feel like, when I'm spending the entirety of the Eucharist in being angry at Julia instead of experiencing the ritual that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It kind of degrades what I'm getting out of it.</p>

<p>[Silence for eight seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, and I would imagine makes it much less pleasant than it would be. [00:40:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[Silence for 48 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I would think of this thing [pauses for five seconds] as sort of a bit, uh, [in line] (ph) with this sort of thing in that [pauses] when you get the impulse — again, I'm not at all saying you did anything out of turn what you said about — to Julia... [00:41:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But just purely of a psychological thing...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It is like the impulse is to blast the other person to smithereens...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Which I think [pauses] probably, in part, a way you restore offense of safety, control, activity...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Um, sort of power...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Dignity in the face of [pauses] an insult. I mean, however much real as with Julia... [00:42:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or just felt, as with Dave, that I think probably makes you feel wronged of all those things. [Pauses for 23 seconds] And, clearly, this is a case where [pauses] the feelings are so intense they just kind of take over. [We might go over it] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...By kind of working on it, if that will be much less so. [00:43:05]</p>

<p>Also, [pauses for six seconds] this is making me imagine that — there are a few things, but I, I mean, I imagine that a lot of your difficulty getting work done relates to this. I mean, you know, January, you obviously were so mad you didn't come to work 'til after the holidays (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even at other times, I think your frustration — either at yourself and who you're working for, or at talking about the work itself...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or having an easier time or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Coughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It is possible that it is frustration or one of those things that kind of shuts you down and just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you remember me telling you that? I'm not sure. [inaudible at 43:53] [Pauses for eight seconds] What are your thoughts? [00:44:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was just thinking. You talked about frustration. I remember, um, a couple of weeks ago, I was trying to master a really difficult origami fold.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I had gone through, like, 15 pages by that point, trying to get it right, and it still wasn't coming out, and I just got so frustrated and so mad, and I just couldn't deal with it that I grabbed all of my models — and some of them were better than others, and it looked pretty close, too — but I just grabbed them all and crumpled them into a ball, and flung it across the room. [Faintly chuckles] And Dave was like, "Whoa. Are you OK?" And I was like, "Of course I'm not OK! Do I look OK?" It was just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it is the sort of thing you expect a four year-old to do, like break the toys and throw them across the room in a fit of frustration, and ruin it. Like, it seems horribly inappropriate to do as an adult, and I was pretty embarrassed after the fact. [00:45:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's what I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, [it could be you felt very strongly] (ph). We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [sound of papers rustling] we still will talk more in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, 'cause you're gone next week, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm gone next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [Gathering things] And Thursday is at 5:15?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Five.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Fifteen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Five-fifteen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>[Sound of zipper zipping, papers being gathered]</p>

<p>[Door opens]</p>

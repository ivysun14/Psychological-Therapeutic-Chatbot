<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: That trip was flawless in terms of things happening, expected. Just exhausting, and exhausting to see people under duress. You don't want to see people in those circumstances [inaudible at 00:00:32]. I don't know. The whole idea just felt like a lot of forced socializing just because we're leaving the country.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Is that the duress part? Or was there something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No because there's - because, I don't know. Whenever we go home we try to tell as few people as possible. Please don't post any facial pictures on Facebook. Just don't let people know we're back because we don't possibly have enough time to see everybody who feels like they should be seen. So given that we're back for a week, and given that we are not coming back for at least a year, that's the - the point wasn't to see people, for me, while I was there, it was just to hang out with my brothers. And so, yes, that is soon to become a subligatory and a barrage of social requirements. And, you know, whatever, it's done. It was just exhausting and now I'm trying to just get rid of everything I own except for that which I'm going to keep. That is also exhausting. I'm sleeping on my air mattress and stuff - very fun - and I'm just hoping I can get to a coffee place before I come here. [00:02:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are several in the area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I wanted - I was running late; I run into Starbucks. I'm like the line's going to be out the door. Lines going to be out the door, out the door. The line's out the door and it's like - anyway so, I'm not as perky as you might remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if it makes you feel better, that's half decaf.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Flaunt it all you like. So yes...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Only it's my second cup today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Second? Oh, it's half decaf?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. The half decaf the first time didn't really do it for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. How's your move going? You done?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm done, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. I suppose it's been a while. Unpacked?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mostly. The things that need to be used are unpacked. The china? Still in the box. I mean really, what's the point of china when you have two kids under six?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's funny because the whole idea of china - my dad asked me if any of us kids wanted his china. And I'm like, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just another box to move to a new space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well we never use it. But we bought Wedgewood dishes when we moved, as our dish set, something we use for everyday. Once it's a special occasion let's bring out the nice stuff. This is nice. I don't know. The china thing is most of it's handed down through your family when no one's - I just don't get it any more, but whatever. Anyway, so yes, china. Little by little things are moving out of the cupboards. I sold all our glasses this morning at 8:30. Just won't shut up. It's like, yes, okay. Anyway it's... [00:04:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you choosing to keep? What has enough emotional value or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not much. I mean, not that - there's nothing, I thought about this several times, there's nothing that I have that I can't replace. Some things that my mother gave me, like a card, it's a silly little card that I keep that reminds me of her. But clothes, musical instruments? They're all replaceable. It's all - there's nothing I really care about. And I, in some ways I feel kind of, I don't know, I don't know what the word would be but just unaffected. But at the same time I don't know. I don't know. I just don't care if stuff gets lost. It's a level of anxiety that I don't need. I have this Gibson guitar. The same one that George Harrison played and it was $2400 and I just didn't want to touch the thing because it's - so what do I do? I sold it and I went and bought a $150 guitar and if I break it... [00:06:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not afraid to play.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It can fall on the floor and I'm anyway. I don't know how useful this is but so right now it's a really stressful time. I'm thinking about taking the rest of the day off in terms of posting things to Craigslist and organizing for this imminent garage sale that I'm just dreading. I've had a lot of garage sales so it's. Yes, so I sold the car. I'm carless now, which is great. I had my first Zipcar experience last night. Anyway, so I'm just kind of beat. I see you Monday, too, right? Yes, and then the following week and the following week. Okay. It's four left?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Four left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yes. I suppose I should mention my letter to my dad is not entirely complete. I guess I thought I'd have more time over the past two or three weeks than I actually did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It will be ready when you're ready for it to be. [00:08:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. I know, I just - right now I just feel like, I don't know, any spare moment is just used to just catch my breath. Just - yes. I promise to be more with it on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is where you are right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. Sadly, it is. So yes...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling at the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My neck hurts, my head hurts. My head is just kind of - I had a headache and now it's just kind of thick and there's a certain layer of anxiety just because the details around property we're trying to rent. What our income is, is in question as is it enough to qualify for this? I know it's less than what we pay here now. So I filled out mine; my wife just filled out hers. Hopefully this will get us in. If not I don't know where we're going to go. And the other thing is the Visa issue, which circumstances around it are just a mess and anyway... [00:10:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of complicated logistics to move to another country.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really is and putting the dog - the dog is finally set though. I understand why people don't do it. Or willy nilly, I should say. So that's what I'm feeling at the moment. Just weary and sore; I just can't sleep on an air mattress any more. I just have a space heater at home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm wondering how you and your wife are doing because it is a really tense time and it sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of complicated logistics. And I wonder how that affects you guys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we've been doing fine. There have been some tense moments but bottom line I get a little frustrated when she's on Facebook and we need to set up some sort of medical insurance as of August 1st and so. But it's - in some ways I'm just kind of letting things, as if I have control to let them do otherwise, but just let things evolve as they need to. I get frustrated just because she's not really thinking ahead. I set up my prescriptions to get three months in advance at the end of July back in June and she thought about it a week ago. And now they can't do it and it's just - it's exhausting to think about everything for yourself, much less think of everything for the two of you.</p>

<p>So I don't know. I just - I kind of feel like we're in go, go, go mode and we can be up until 2:00 in the morning without even realizing it. Especially when we said let's watch a movie tonight at 7:00 and it's like 2:00 in the morning and we're like I guess we didn't watch a movie tonight. So that's why I'm thinking of just taking today off and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to recoup a little bit. [00:13:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. That's why I can't put the words together but yes, that's true. Yes. Sorry I don't have a lot forthcoming right now. I'm starting to feel [inaudible at 00:14:26].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, like I said before, this is where you are. And part of therapy is being in the moment. When you're tired and exhausted, this is a chance for me to get what - really understand what the process is like for you right now. [00:14:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's just, some of it involves just plugged favors that I just don't like to ask because the director of the Prince [inaudible at 00:15:46] here is a friend from a professor of mine he's liaising with the director of the Holiday Center. And so they invited me to be a visiting researcher, which sounds good but it's not paid. I actually have to pay 150 a month for library privileges and that kind of thing. But it's waiting a Visa in theory. But it's just, I'm trying to be as responsive as I can and not act like onto another favor. And with that you have these things mounting on this end and you've got to respond to things timely on a different time schedule. It's just... [00:16:46]</p>

<p>I mean I guess - I think I realized that I should've talked when I was there for that week and so many, I should say so much of the world evolves around connections, networks and I hate that. I really do. Because if you're not a good networker, you can get by by those around you who are good networkers, but basing something on who you know is just seems to be so arbitrary. And so that's what I'm drawing on to try to make this move. And I don't know if I'm just learning to accept it or realize its importance and try to embrace it. But it is - I set my C.V. last night and I was going through it, updating it and reformatting it and I was thinking this is a really impressive C.V. Fine, and yet here I am thinking God, why would they want to take me? I'm just going to be a burden to them, they don't have to take me, there are actually people with Ph.D's who are actually... [00:18:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did those thoughts come from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think they must be in my wallet because they're with me all the time. But I don't know I just think it's probably the stress and fatigue that's causing that. I've been able to, to some extent, have some self awareness about how effective I can be under certain circumstances, allowing myself to realize that you're exhausted or you're going to be exhausted so don't do these things. I'd like to say that even though I am just incredibly tired that I have been actually doing some of those things, thinking ahead about my own state of mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if maybe a better question than where the thoughts come from since they feel so automatic is how much did you let yourself believe them? [00:20:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not enough to not ask.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I do acknowledge that these are fears that are based on not much. Fears that are based on what I'm assuming those people are doing in Europe, are thinking, but I don't - I can't actually corroborate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and if you read the C.V. that's actually evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's just a different kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I assume the stuff on the C.V. is stuff you've actually done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's a different kind of field than what they're in but at the same time, it's not like I'm a complete stranger to what they're doing. I have no reason to do it. And so part of what I want to do in this is to try to measure expectations and - not even measure them but just be aware of them and not inflate them to something that's undue pressure on me but doesn't really exist. And so - because that's a hard life to live with phantom expectations that are just around every corner and you can't possibly live up to. And so I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it's really unfair. [00:22:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unfair and - yes, unfair. And yet it's not like you can put any positive spin on it. It's not like it's oh yes it propels me to do this. It propels me into madness. It doesn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't work. And that's, and we've talked about this, is it adaptive is what you're thinking useful in any way. And if not, then who cares if it's true or not? It's not getting you anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. I mean I think that is going to be one of my biggest challenges going into this foreign environment and trying to make explicitly clear of myself what the expectations are of myself. And to know exactly what the expectations are from others, even if I have to beat it over the heard. I don't know what it looks like right now but it's - I know those things can get out of hand rather quickly with me and if [inaudible at 00:23:55] so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So sort of checking in with yourself and it being - and trying to catch yourself when you start to kind of magically change the expectations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oftentimes people will set a goal in their mind and then almost without realizing it sort of magically changes the goal to something a little bit different or harder or higher. And I think you've got to check it and know what actually was my goal. Is the way that I'm thinking about it useful in helping me to actually move forward towards it? [00:24:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or is it even a goal that I signed up for? I think I have a tendency to inflate things to the point where they're just only stressed into a single thing that's probably not feasible. I haven't done this kind of talking in a while so, I need a little break.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Out of practice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know. Didn't take long. But I need to remember that there are decent people in this world. It's not all a masquerade.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you counting yourself as one of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am. In part because just as there can be decent people at the University, I can be a decent person too. And just as I can be a decent person, there can be decent people. It sounds simple but it's different to me. [00:26:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad to hear you count yourself in that group because I think there are times where you wouldn't necessary have done that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, no I think you're right. It is a change; I know that. I mean it is progress. But it's not something that I can always count on, me thinking and that's just where those DBT materials, which I'm taking with me now or going to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Haven't sold those?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Can't imagine who'd buy them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably lots of people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they're all photocopies with that low toner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably with an illegal copyright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. So, yes I mean I just - well I think also part of what has helped me in the past four or five weeks have been I'm taking care of myself more. And it seems to do wonders, so. The letters to these people who I don't know seem a lot less daunting. I don't know. But since I haven't been doing that physical therapy or my exercise for about a week I'm feeling pretty beaten down. That's another reason why I want to take today off is to go to the gym but... [00:28:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes I mean doing those self-care type things absolutely changes what you can cope with. It builds up your resources. So I think it makes sense also to kind of cut yourself some slack when you are traveling, sleeping on an air mattress, getting rid of some of your comforts. You have to lower the expectations of what you're going to be able to do and to cope with because you're taking away some of what refuels you. And that's - in an ideal world you never have to go without like that but it's not an ideal world and there are going to be times when you can't get all the sleep that you need, get the exercise that you need, get great food. Sometimes you may do with what there is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean I think I have acknowledged that traveling you really don't have all the - especially it's just the time. Not being in your element, not having a routine available to you, not having just resources is definitely something that I acknowledge and I know that this is an extreme time. More extreme than I think I have dealt with in a long time if ever. And so yes, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You and Lucky (ph) will have to set up your routines. Not having that control is hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and not having a car any more, it's just - the more I think about it, I went to the Good Will the other day to buy some plates.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you had sold your plates.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, no, we had packed them away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you had packed them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But still it's like, I'm buying these plates? I'm basically renting these plates because I'm going to take them back to the Good Will when I'm done with them in two weeks. And so, I sold my toaster yesterday under pressure by somebody who wanted a deal and I'm thinking my wife's going to kill me. She uses that toaster every day. So last night we get in the Zipcar to go to the grocery store, no let's go to Good Will. Why? We don't have anything - well we don't have stuff to buy. No I want to get a toaster and a saucepan. I don't have either but... [00:30:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yes. In some ways I thought these last three weeks here would be kind of coasting, you know. Oh let's rent a car and go to the beach, we haven't been there in a while. And right now we're lucky if we could have a meal at a table together. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possible to reclaim a little bit of that vision and - I mean I know that you kind of said that you've taken today off but can you plan a day when you're really going to take off and get out of here and do that? Have your meals in restaurants and not worry about what you have left at home and give yourself a little bit of that? [00:32:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I think one of the things I did a couple of days ago was an entire kitchen's worth of stuff, right, for sale. And I'm thinking it's so much pressure because some of the stuff is worth some money, the crusade pots and pans and bread baking stoneware, whatever. And so my thought was okay, this stuff is high dollar; I'm going to put it on Craigslist. And once that goes the rest of it as I now see could just go to Good Will. If you can get something for it, fine; if you can't, so be it. And so I think that's kind of what I'm getting to the point where my needs are starting to become able to be at least acknowledged if not met. So, yes, I'm starting to care less about the $4 on my rice cooker. Do you want this cooker? I can bring it on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No thank you. I think I have one packed in a box somewhere. It's packed in a box because I didn't use it the last time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know it's like maybe I didn't need this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The great thing, we were moving we found this box, stuff from a previous bathroom from our apartment before that had never been taken out of the box. I'm pretty sure this can be left off the truck if I hadn't seen it in 10 years.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Well that's just exactly it. It's so funny because we had this rice cooker. It sat on the shelf. And I go into the pantry cupboard and there's container after container of rice, Baswani rice, Angoria rice, Sushi rice. I don't think we eat enough brown rice. And so, it's just - and I think the most exciting thing for me is purging myself of all these things necessary to my life or not and realizing on the other hand okay now what do I actually need? [00:34:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It is a nice way to assess what is it that you actually - what are the things that are actually important to you and what are the things that actually make up your life now and seeing how you've changed. I think now it's not the actual rice cooker that's important but figuring - kind of seeing oh, this is not part of our habit but here's this other thing that really is an important piece of our daily lives or something that means something to us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, there's not much but yes, it's drastic and moving overseas is a means of enforcing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the piece you said about saving this card from your mom, the stuff that really means something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have the tendency to second-guess myself or just to say well maybe there are those things that I care about. There is that crusade saucepan that I'm taking with me. But by and large I know when I look at something whether it's important to me or not. And I think the only thing I tend to think about is what are the things that will be important to me later? That I'm not going to throw them out but in my life right now those don't strike me as automatic responses. So and I don't mean anything like a certain kitchen strainer or anything like that but I mean pictures of family that I want to see. But what is true right now is that those things that I don't think are important to me aren't important to me right now and doesn't mean that they won't be and doesn't mean that I won't have access to them later. [00:36:50]</p>

<p>But I think what is clear is I can trust my instinct on what is important to me now so it's - I don't know. I mean I struggle with really believing if I am not some sort of horder because to accumulate things, I've had a lot of things. It's not nearly as much as I had in Portland, but it was a lot of things and, you know, when an alcoholic gives up drinking and takes up smoking. If I'm not hording material possessions what am I hording? You wash all perceptions. I don't know what that means and maybe there's nothing to this but it just seems odd that I would be so willing to give everything up that supposedly I want to live on time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're also giving things up with the idea that the things that need replacing can be replaced. And it's not that you're never going to have glasses again, but those particular ones aren't holding a lot for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, well that's very true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was stuck by the comment you made about the guitar, that what's important to you is the ability to play. And what you figured out for yourself is that having a really high-end guitar took away actually your ability to play because you didn't want to mess up that thing. And so you realized the value of music and being able to feel comfortable picking up a guitar and playing. And you can buy another guitar. You're not giving up music and selling your guitar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's true, that's true. But I, I don't know. I just - I shouldn't second-guess myself so much; I know that. And yet...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your gut. This works for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is my gut but when people say well I've had this vase that we got at our wedding and it means so much I'm just it's nothing like that for us. The things that we got at our wedding some of that stuff we're selling at our garage sale. I know that's not unusual but at the same time there's very little that really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you've detached the item from the meaning of the item. So you don't need the vase to remember that you're married.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some people connect a physical reminder of something more to the emotional meaning behind it. But that doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you for keeping those things separate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes I suppose. I think the problem is we didn't ask for any of these things when we registered. We registered for charities and people brought crap anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Try as you might.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. So anyway... [00:40:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it doesn't - I mean if maybe if it was something that you really, really wanted it would be different. But what you wanted was for people to donate money to a charity, which is good for them. The thing is not symbolic of your marriage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I guess you're right. I never thought about that. So any of this stuff, it's just like pfft. It's nice stuff, it's whatever, it's expensive crystal that we never use, will never use. Anyway, yes that's - I don't know. And I think part of this process for me also is to be aware of what things are important to me as I go across, as we set up a household in a foreign land where we don't know a lot of people. The most familiar item is going to be something from IKEA. That's what they have set.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's the same everywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what we have and that's what they have over there. And so how I live life differently now without access and how will I determine need versus want because a lot of this stuff that I'm selling now was not a need; it was a want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it okay to have some wants?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure but I think the issue is there's want and then there's think-you-need. And the think-you-need part I think is the issue for me. I only have two restaurant grade jelly bowl pads; I need four. I think I need four. Now it's only four jelly bowl pads. And I guess what I'm getting to the point of scrutinizing my own thinking more about things than I have in the past. You know, the drinking was one where thinking need versus - I want to say need but - versus want. Sometimes you just want to drink; sometimes you think you need to drink. [00:42:55]</p>

<p>So I think this is something that is relevant to a lot of parts to my life including aspirations. Do I need to do something? Do I want to do something? And going into this degree that I just finished, I think there was a time when I thought I needed it and other times that I thought I wanted it. And I did. But I think part of that scrutiny has to be balanced with not second-guessing myself and trusting myself, which is the ongoing issue for me sometimes, a lot of times. So, anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Asking yourself what is it - if you feel like you need it, asking yourself what is it that I need it for might help you kind of distinguish between what is it really doing for you? Is getting that degree or getting that thing, does it make you feel more validated in some way or it makes you feel justified in something or it makes you feel adequate? What is it that you think doing that or getting that is going to make you feel or going to change? [00:44:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think - what I think about a certain kitchen strainer, it's easier to think like that but - whatever the word is - the discernment, sorry - when it comes to a degree, or I should say when it comes to that degree I just finished, it's a little bit harder I think just because had I not done it I don't think I would've put myself on a path to where I'm headed next. I don't think I would've imagined that I could move to France on some Fellowship, which Fellowship which would require me to go to Europe. And so I trust cautiously that I wanted to do this degree. But I think it is that other rule about second-guessing those decisions and self-doubt. [00:46:07]</p>

<p>And so I think that process of evaluation is occurring to me as something that is going to remain important. I think my headache's coming back. Let me try to get this off. It's clear to see when you get rid of stuff why. There's no second thought, it's like no, I haven't used this ever. And just as there is that for physical objects I'm just wondering is that some sort of process I can use on more abstract things and what would be a analogous process of shutting things unurged (ph) and what you need, what you want in terms of abstract things?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's definitely less clear for those types of things and I imagine being able to use that kind of question with setting up expectations for yourself. Do you need to have this particular expectation to get where you think you want to go or is that too much - is that fourth jelly roll pan an expectation where you really need to have a lowered expectation. In order to feel like I'm taking care of myself do I really need to go to the gym seven days a week and do blah, blah, blah or does it - is the need more three times a week, twenty minutes and I feel good about myself? It's definitely not as clear cut with a physical object that you can look and say nope, that's been gathering dust for six months; probably don't need it. [00:48:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, there are expectations that I can look at and say or things you haven't done yet. And that's been not done for six months? No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's not that much a priority. So I think with ideas and less tangible things it's not going to be as clear-cut but it's kind of the idea. Just using that same kind of matter of weighing it that might just help you clarify what it - your priorities I guess. How important is it to you? What level of need or want is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we stop there and you can go get your coffee. You made it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know what I was going to talk about for 50 minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know. I appreciate it. So I'll see you on...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday. [00:49:24]</p>

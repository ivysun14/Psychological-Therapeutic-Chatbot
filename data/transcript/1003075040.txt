<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you want to wait outside [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know the place right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Stay right there until we come get you, okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How is she?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well we started the Lamictal —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't really notice any difference, do you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't see any difference.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The only difference is that she's not going to bed as easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But she's still having the angry outbursts and, you want to tell him how happy [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean, it, it's an everyday thing when she comes from home from the center here she's pretty mild for the first hour or so and then she starts getting agitated, uh, she won't do what you ask her to do, um, this past weekend, uh, on Friday she was outside and she ran off, I went to try to get her, she wouldn't come, she was outside cussing and screaming and talking to herself.  Um, [NAME OTHER] went out to try to get her in because I couldn't get her in and [NAME OTHER] tried to grab hold of her hand and she smacked at you.  And then she had bottles, she found some bottles and she was throwing them at trees and went to the neighbors house in the sand, you know, he, I had to go up and apologize to him for doing this, leave me alone type of stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She had to go apologize?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah because she was out there, she was throwing bottles at this guy's trees and then she'd look at us and say, now see what I did, see what I did, I got to go up and apologize, I got to go see this guy and it's 11:00, 10:00, 11:00 at night, we couldn't get her in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So then I had —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of head strong?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah I bet —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, it's just —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Similar incidences, but I don't think anything like this.  It doesn't happen as often.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Then Saturday night she wanted to ride her bike, I said that's fine so she's riding her bike at, went up and aired her tires up that day and so she rode her bike until about 9:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And right when the sun went down, I said it's time to come in and she didn't want to come in.  I had to chase her down the street, I told her to come back to the driveway, she came back but then she was standing out in our little circle cul—de—sac and looking at a guy's window and he was sitting at his computer typing and he started, she started flipping him off and saying, you know, how do you like that, how do you like that type of thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It becomes a game of coming in the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Looks like she's kind of figured out what works for that and makes everyone else riled up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh she definitely gets us riled up and I, the only thing that I can do to get her anywhere was to say I'm taking you to your mom's house.  Get in the car, I drove down, because she literally ran from [NAME OTHER] and myself, but she ran herself in between a couple houses where they had fencing so she had trapped and she's like don't come near me, leave me alone, um, she was taking branches of trees and ripping off the leaves and, um, there was a couple frogs in the driveway of the neighbors house and she ran over and stomped on one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And she just stands out there and talks to herself, I mean it's just a lot of —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Talking to herself like talking to herself or do you think talking to or someone who's not there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's talking to somebody that's not there.  Now [NAME OTHER] says —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well if you read the teacher's notes she wrote a lot about that in her note because she witnessed a lot at school like she rehashes something with a kid and she imagines the kid there, has a conversation and she hears an answer and replies.  But she's rehashing events or something that could be upsetting, she goes over it in her head and says it out loud.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The other thing that she does that worries me is she always says she hates her life, she's always saying that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But see I don't, I don't hear some of this, it seems to be worse at your house.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And then she has an older sister that she doesn't get along with, I mean —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> At your house, but at my house it's pretty much, I don't know what's causing the difference in behavior.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the day summer program, does it seem to help a little [INAUDIBLE] for a short time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> My opinion I think she does fine during the mornings, even at my house, she's very pleasant when she gets up, she does things that you ask her to do and by the middle of the afternoon is when she starts getting agitated, tired, whatever you want to call it.  And then by the evenings, you know, you can draw her out like [NAME OTHER]'s saying, you can draw her back to doing things that you want her to do but it's a lot more difficult and then in the evenings, I mean here recently, it's been a struggle.  Now Saturday after our incident Saturday night, I took her for a drive, I told her I was taking her to the hospital and I thought maybe that would scare her like a little kid, I don't really want to go to the hospital and I drove her to the hospital, said now, you're going to either calm down and not get upset with me when I'm asking you to do something or get upset with [NAME OTHER] when she's asking you to do something or you might need to see a doctor and go back to the hospital.  The next day she was fine the whole day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She can control it, I know she can control it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what, you know, comes across that she really kind of has figured out —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She's playing off of whatever something —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But the things that I see that worry me and [NAME OTHER] and I have talked about it is that she talks a lot and I don't know if it's actually talking herself out of a situation or what but you can actually hear her talking about something or, you know, [NAME OTHER] or I don't know, it's just like she's talking to another person that's not there.  And it's, it, it's kind of odd.  And then the fact that she's, you know, she tells you that she hates her life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I've heard her say that.  I think she feels very bad about the things she says.  She has a lot of remorse after.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She doesn't like how she feels.  It, it seems like we go through those really bad days, then she'll be very compliant and then it happens again because she'll probably be very good now for the next week or so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> One thing that I have noticed is that she hasn't, in the last week or so, complained of having seizures.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah the Lamictal may have nipped that part.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Have you heard her say anything about seizures?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No but I haven't been around it, I've been at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the, the problem is, and it's hard to know, with, it's kind of early in the treatment of Lamictal anyway.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Does it take a while, has to be in the system for a while?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not only that, you're not at the right dosage yet.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the dosage could be anywhere from 100, 150 mg on the downside all the way up to 300 mg pill and that's every time.  Having said that, sometimes we see that helping even at this low dosage but that's just the icing, I mean that's just —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do you think it could help some of these things that he's talking about or this just her, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, no, I don't think that this is all or none.  This is not, this is all that there is of —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is all that there's, it's a combination but certainly from what you're saying some of this is [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, she pretty much knows and is using it but some of this could well be made worse by the mood swings as well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's what we see, I mean, the pro, the problem is one second she's happy —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She's smiling, she's seems like she's enjoying life and the next, next minute she's like a raging bull and she will run from you.  It scares me because when she runs from me, she's quick and she will just keep running and running and running and there's cars, there's things that she can get hurt by and, you know, it, it's scary that she gets, and then when she's angry like that, she's hit me, she's hit [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But when is the last time it happened before this past weekend?  Since that one time, a couple months ago?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh, yeah but it's been escalating, I mean she's been —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I can usually talk her down.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's been building.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's been, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It always builds and then it blows up and —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean it, since the last time that she really, I mean got violent and, uh, you know, was kicking at me, kicking at my son, um, damaging things, she's been pretty, she's been pretty compliant, um, I'd say probably within the last two weeks she's, the last two times, weekends that I've had her, she's started to get more aggressive, more of an attitude, uh, more peaks and valleys.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I have actually thought she's been better with me so it's like [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Except the night that you called me, I mean, that was within that two, three week period, she called me, couldn't get her home either and I was like —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That was before the Lamictal, so that was over a month ago.  But in the last couple weeks, for me, she's been better.  It's like she's picking one place she's going to blow, either it's going to be my house or your house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we usually, the only way we know is once we get the Lamictal where it needs to be and then get some sense of consistency.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Let me ask you this.  We seem to only be able to talk to you on a Tuesday.  If we have a blow up like this and we couldn't get her, what do we do with her?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do we take her to the hospital?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you know —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I, I'll, we almost called the police because she was —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean, we don't know what to do with her.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She was totally out of control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean that's always an option.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But if we call them, what are they going to do?  Put her in a police car and take her into here or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it depends, uh, but they probably take her to a psychiatric facility, they'll take her to an emergency room, they access her there with you and then make a decision.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And then they'll take her to [DEIDENTIFIED] or someplace like that or —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well there's [DEIDENTIFIED], there's [DEIDENTIFIED] out on the Missouri side, there's [DEIDENTIFIED], uh, there's [DEIDENTIFIED] which is very good that all they do is children.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I've heard of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's down, way down South on the Missouri side, [DEIDENTIFIED], right next to that [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All they do is kids and adolescents, they have no adults there so —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have a feeling if we call the police and they showed up she would instantly be compliant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So I mean and the main reason you do that is if you've felt, you know, she was dangerous and you really couldn't control her and —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Saturday it was getting that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  And [DEIDENTIFIED] might have an advantage, usually the stay in the hospital is just a few short days, two, three, four, five, six days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And she would be very compliant for them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But [DEIDENTIFIED] has a distinctive advantage, the have a residential program that, which is —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where they can keep kids for weeks and months and longer —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, to do what needs to be done whether it's counseling, whether it's medications or whether it's combination of two so —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well this Fall will be two years since we had her in [DEIDENTIFIED] and that, after that she seemed fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well they put her on a high dose of Abilify and she could hardly walk, she was drooling so of course she was compliant but it wasn't a very good experience.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right now just looking at the meds, we are on 75 Lamictal right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what else?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, Topamax for seizures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, how much of that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> For those, uh, she gets 200 in the morning and 250 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Abilify is 2.5 in the morning and 5 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The levothyroxine —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She takes half of 0.125 [INAUDIBLE].  And then she's on Nortrel birth control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Plus the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  And let's keep, you know, just from a med standpoint, let's keep working up on the Lamictal until we get it where it needs to be.  My main focus is the medication side of things, not the counseling of the behavior modification which of course is done by the counselors separately.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't think she's getting a lot of counseling.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How, how often does she see counselors there when she's in the program?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She's only in the group when they do during the day and in the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The summer program is every day they see counselors, one or the other.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But when she's here in that setting noting is happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She's not exhibiting any of those behaviors, so she's not only getting any help [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And like I said I think she's a lot calmer in the mornings and toward the mid afternoon but it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like once she gets either tired or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She's done doing something, that's all she wants, she doesn't want anything else then she starts me acting out or becoming more aggressive.  I mean, Sunday —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you met with the counselors of the summer program?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean I've talked to the Director but no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean just to make sure they know all of this is happening so that they can target that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'll give you an example.  Sunday she was fine all day and then Sunday afternoon she wanted to ride her bike, so I let her ride her bike.  She rode her bike, rode her bike and we live in a cul—de—sac.  Well she rode probably 10, 15 times.  The very last time she got down to the end of the street and there's was a guy washing his car and I could see, tell that she was talking to him, she came back up to the house and she was angry from that point on.  So I brought her inside, I said you need to come inside, cool down, you've been riding your bike, it's hot out and at that time my oldest daughter was there, she took her home.  Well she told me all the way home she sit there and she talked to herself, the whole time going home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now she didn't get to the point where she was blowing up but she could have very easily done that.  I tried to talk, I tried to get her out of this situation but, you know, it's things like that —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's the transition going in from outside, going from dad's to mom's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Leaving summer program, getting dropped at your house, all these transition times just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus the MR, you know —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She can not handle it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the mental retardation diagnosis, we see a lot of just that kind of,you know, behaviors like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.  She knows you're going to expect her to come in so she, she's set to blow because she knows you're going to make her come in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But either way on, you know, as far as the meds are concerned before we say anything about the Lamictal, we really need to get it where it needs to be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Now what is the purpose of the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a mood stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, so it should stabilize her ups and downs?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's why we have her on it and we [INAUDIBLE] seizures and hopefully she's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean none of these are magic pills, you know —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, that would be great that this would fix everything.  But what we generally see if this, you know, if the mood is [INAUDIBLE] that's the way she goes, that if we could settle the mood down, then we see that defiance kind of being more contained as well.  We often find that, you know, even the behaviors are still there because of the MR part and because of the way she is, just the way she is, that they're not as intense and as sticky, means they kind of stick to that deal of time, she's able to pull it back together.  So it's all, you know, little incremental hopefully trying to get that all down a notch or two with each of these things.  But the main reason for the Lamictal is mood stabilization.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know, you were saying that the lower level is 125 to 150?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well yeah, for the psychiatric part.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And she's at 75 now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do you think it needs to be morning and night or is it one that stays —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No it goes 24 hours a day so that's not the issue.  Just the dosage and, you know, we can't —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do you want to keep going up on that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think we should, um, I don't know what the neurologist had said about that because I know when I brought up the other two options of Depakote and Tegretol you told me that they felt really from their standpoint —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They prefer the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Just because it has fewer side effects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.  So I don't know, you know, I'd like to have that, the seizure part is better even on this dosage but from a psychiatric standpoint, you know, those are the dosages we aim for unless, you know, they had anything going against getting up to the dosage we use.  So I'd call them and let them know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] plan is to go up on it 50 or even 200 of Lamictal.  And do you see any problem with that from a neurological standpoint?  So long as they don't have a problem that's really where we need to get to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And how soon can we get her up to that level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh it has to be done very slowly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Incrementally.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because the side effect of skin rash, mucus membrane rash, something called the Steven Johnson Syndrome, that's a pretty serious one, I've never had one in the past, you know, all my 25 years but —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She's taking it before and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You really don't want to have that, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She didn't have that the first time she took it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  So I'd go up to 100, I'd go up a week later to 125, a week later after that I'd go up to 150 —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'd stay at 150 until we meet back and see where it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Can I get a new prescription?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Do we need to change the pill size?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it comes in 100 so I'll give you —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We've got 25s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'll give you 100 and the prescription would, I'll write is, would be one and a half of the 100s.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you'll, to start off you'll start with 100 for a week and then you'll add one of the 25s to that and then we can add two of the 25s and take one and a half of the 100 to go up to 150, keep the Abilify the same [INAUDIBLE].  We might have to go up on the Abilify too but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah and tends to increase her appetite more too.  Which I think her appetite was down but I don't notice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She still comes home from the center here and is hungry and I usually give her a snack or something and she's, I think she's always hungry do you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think it will be good for you to go in and meet with the day program.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> From what I understand they just had like helpers around the group, I don't think it was really an actual counselor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sit down with them, they have professional person who, it's not just high school kids.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not daycare.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how are you [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doing good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I've been hearing you've been having a hard time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes.  How come?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looks like a lot of the time you know what you're doing right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How come you do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Like when you get mad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I get mad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's what he's asking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah when you run away, when you're running in between houses and you kind of throwing stuff and then wanted to go and apologize to them in the middle of the night or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, giving the finger to the person in the car who is working on his computer, any of that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think you need to change that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you going to do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, change my medication somehow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, last night, what did we practice last night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We wish all that could be done with the pill but the pill is just to help you do what needs to be done.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Tell him what you did last night when you were getting upset.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She stopped herself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stopped myself.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She got up and did what she's supposed to do, so she can do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I was very proud of her for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum, that's what you need to keep doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well when these things come up if you have some direct communication with the staff at the summer program, I think that will really help them help [PATIENT NAME].  If they don't know what's happening —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If they can really focus on that and target that so I would —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What time does the program end?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't have any details of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> 2:30.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> 2:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So I get off work at 2:00, if I came up here and wanted to meet —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well they have field trips all afternoon so they don't really —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would, I would meet with them, I mean —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm going to call [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I'd, I'd like to tell them what I'm seeing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even now before you leave, see up front if they can get you in touch with them and then ask them what time and, you know, you don't even have to come here, use the telephone.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So this will only [INAUDIBLE] one time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'd like to see if they are seeing any kind of anger problems.  I mean I haven't heard from any of them when they drop her off at my house every day they never say, you know, anything.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because those are not the people that work with them, it's just the transportation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah have a direct communication with the actual counselors there.  Do need the Abilify as well?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No just the [INAUDIBLE].  You know what you need to do at dad's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What you did at my house —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Go outside and practice coming in and do it again —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She goes outside and you stand inside and then when you say okay, [PATIENT NAME] it's time to come in, she comes right in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Practice, that helps.  And if she does it good three times, she can go out for an hour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> If not then she has to stay in right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And you can turn it up over there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME] I hope next time we meet I hear that things are a little better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I hope the next time we meet I hear that things are a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But I'm going to ask [INAUDIBLE] in front of [PATIENT NAME], if she did need to go to the hospital where would we take her?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we just talked about that [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If these behaviors continue —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wasn't listening.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Listen to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might have to go to the hospital and I told your mom and dad about a hospital down south in [DEIDENTIFIED], it's called the [DEIDENTIFIED], that's probably —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to go there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right, then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's up to you to make sure that doesn't happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not dad's decision, it's not mom's, it's not anyone's, it's your decision and your behavior is what makes that decision.  So if you don't want to go make sure anything that could get you there doesn't happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well today I heard several things that could so that's why I'm saying I hope you're able to stop that, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So we [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello. So, I think stuff (ph) next week will be really good actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, better than [I expected it to be though] (ph). Yea, I think (inaudible at 00:00:11) I think in that, well, the nice thing about kind of corporation (ph) is that it just makes me feel very secure, like—(pause) the training has been very step-by-step. They don't expect me to know things that I haven't been trained in, that sort of thing. It's nice. I know what my job is; it's really nice. And people are surprisingly nice which is good. Yea, yea, I'm sure some of them are disgruntled but none of them have kind of like unleashed that on me yet so, yea. [00:01:00] Yea, so I've been going—kind of like running around in circles, thought process—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —a lot. And what I think is—and I've been a bear to my father too, particularly. If things were actually as bad as I am describing them as, it does not make sense to me. That it doesn't make sense to me for things were really that bad, like the external things. Or because somebody would have noticed, somebody would have said something. There would have been an uproar. It doesn't fit. [00:02:01] </p>

<p>And so then I think, "Am I just exaggerating?" because when you're little—because I certainly remember instances from when I was young that felt like this huge, horrible injustice and where they were immensely, emotionally charged for me. That, in retrospect, I'm like, "Oh yea, that actually makes sense. That was a good boundary for that person to draw." </p>

<p>I think it may be my ninth birthday—or maybe eighth, but I think ninth—Amanda was giving Jason (sp?) a bath to cool his—I was nine so he would be two at the time—she was giving Jason a bath and she asked for my help. And this was at the apex of us fighting all the time. [00:03:06] And I think my dad was working. He wasn't there but it was at that time she was giving a bath. And she asked for my help, and I was like, "I don't want to" because it was my birthday and they hadn't really made a big deal out of it. And so I was kind of like, "No, I shouldn't have to do this on my birthday because birthdays are super special." And she called me a bitch and that was like the first time anybody had called me a bitch. And it was so horrifying and I was just furious with her. </p>

<p>I mainly remember this because I wrote a journal entry which I read years later. And I was like, "Wow, that was fairly bright of me actually." (laughing) She's 11 and having to put her little brother to bed because our dad wasn't there and there was no one in the house other than us. [00:04:05] And like, wow that wasn't OK. It was reasonable of her to be angry with me in that situation where at the time I thought it was totally unreasonable. </p>

<p>So I think, "Well am I just making this shit up?" And then I think, "Well, and since (ph) this didn't matter whether I'm making it up because the fact remains that the emotional memories are there. And so it doesn't matter what actually happened when I just felt so alone." And I think that that—I don't really want to go there. (laughter) I don't—I want to say that—I don't mean—in some sense, clearly the emotional memory, like the emotions are important regardless of where they come from. [00:05:08] But I also want to say I don't want to go too far down that road because then it doesn't—(pause) because I feel like it's just unmoored from reality entirely. And I don't know. </p>

<p>But, does this make sense? And then I started over again somehow but I forgot the length because of the starting point. (laughing) (pause) </p>

<p>Well, I think that I'm like, "No, I don't need to do that. There must be some concrete reality behind these emotions." [00:05:58] And then I just get pissed off at my dad again and then I think, "But am I really being fair?" And then, there we go. That's what it is. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're right. That's right. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) I really try not to fret too much about terminology, in that—all right, I try to be precise but also not. I try not to fret too much about diagnoses and things. I mean, that's something that's like—diagnosing me has seemed to be very difficult and etcetera. [00:06:57] But one of the things that I find myself preoccupied with and have on and off a lot is like, "Can I say that my father abused me? Should I say that? Is that fair?" because that's the kind of statement that has ruined us and heartbreaking and huge. (pause) Like, does that count? (pause) </p>

<p>And then I go back to my first boyfriend, Bryan, who that—I don't remember which national—which organization it is that has a nice pamphlet about domestic violence. And like, "These are 'this criteria' and if you meet five or more of these (inaudible at 00:08:01)." I'm like, "Yep. That counted, that was there." [00:08:05] And recognizing like, "oh this." </p>

<p>For me, shortly after I broke up with Bryan—it'd been like a year—to following, being that "oh this is abuse." And the part where we got along really well and were really happy is also a part of the cycle, like as much a part of the cycle as the parts that were really bad. And just because he doesn't hit me, doesn't mean it wasn't abuse. And being able to kind of own that in some ways was—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know the things that had, sort of, had kind of contrary evidence of it being abuse, such as having (inaudible at 00:08:50) get along or he's not beating you seemed actually to fit into the story of abuse once you learned more about it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —rather than sort of weighing against it. [00:09:00] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, it's you're like, "Oh, there's a cycle here." Well, and more like it didn't occurred to me that it was abuse until either very late in our relationship or after I had broken up with him. And it's just like, "Oh, all those times when he was so angry at me. That wasn't my fault." I didn't make that happened. Well, or I made part of it happen but it takes two people to make that happen. I made it happen by sticking around basically. And telling him it was OK when it wasn't OK. That was important to me and made me feel stronger. But when I started talking about it, mutual friends of ours, a couple of them—there were only a couple people who were mutual friends who were better friends with Bryan than with me—but a couple of them got pretty upset with me about it. [00:10:10] I think they—that's a big thing to call (inaudible at 00:10:16) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So that's what I mean. I don't—(pause) And—(pause) then it feels like a nightmare (ph). (crying) It feels like the semantics of where fighting over these semantics is part of me trying very, very hard to protect my dad. [00:11:00] But then I think, "Protecting from what?" Like, am I trying to protect him from the consequence (ph) from like his own actions? Or am I trying to protect him from things that are really not actually his fault? And I should try to protect him from them? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Maybe one thing that's going on with this is your wanting me to help you delineate the kind of inner and more objective realties here. [00:12:03] Like today -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I guess so but I don't feel like it's fair for me to ask that of you? But that's certainly a fantasy I have of like, "Oh well, Ethan will tell me what's what." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What isn't—it isn't fair that we can just table (ph) it (crosstalk) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, yea. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, right. Then I guess it comes up in here. (chuckling) Right, like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—(pause) I guess in that case you quickly delineate that you may want this from me or I'm the fantasy that I will provide it. But that's not fair and, in a way, therefore you should kind of back off of—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —that. [00:13:05] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Sorry I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, so what—</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I'm feeling like we've had this discussion before. It seems self-evident to you that that is a problematic way of approaching things? But it's not self-evident to me. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of the things that you kind of point out, I'm like, "Oh, yea, that is silly" but not here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. No, I don't think—it just doesn't seem to me self-evident nor am I trying to consent (ph) either with your wanting that from me in the present. [00:13:59] Or—(pause) I think the way you're maybe wanting to—sort of anxiously wanting to lean on me to clarify sort of what's what or what some of this inner reality is. Well OK, here's what you found. Here's why. Here's why it's OK. Why it would make sense for you to feel that way, given what happened on one side. And if we look at it effectively, here's where, yes, you felt this way, but that was because of this, that, and the other thing. And here's where you felt that way because that was really abusive and like—(pause) [00:15:01] </p>

<p>Where I am vaguely and confusingly headed is—(pause) (chuckling) I think that this is really something that resulting from the sort of neglect that you experienced, right? Where you were having to, sort of lean on or shape your views. I think you're often confused about: what was reasonable for you to feel, what you did feel in the first place, what was reasonable to feel, where was it fair or reasonable to somebody else to be coming from, what was them overstepping, when was it their problem, when was it yours, when did they need to back off, when you need to be quiet. [00:16:04] This seems to me a lot like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the confusion—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —in the present about how to describe/recall what happened. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're sort of worries about the way to—yea, I'm really muddling it, considering what—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I understand. So, I mean the thing that I got kind of snapped at a lot for was whining. Like, (inaudible at 00:16:42) "stop whining." (pause) Yea and so there was—it took me a long time: a) to work out the difference between what would be perceived as whining and what would be perceived as like asking for things that I needed, and b) to figure out how to talk about what I needed in a way that wouldn't be perceived as whining, well into high school. I think it's up to high school but I cried a lot. I cried at the drop of a hat. (pause) So I guess I'm using that both of, as an analogy of what you're saying, of being confused about [what's appropriate] (ph) and as another example of something that contributes to that. [00:18:02] (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) I guess what I'm saying is, it seems to me that puts you in a very anxious position when you really might need or want something or feel that on one level like it's reasonable to ask for or expect something from people around, I mean, when you're a kid from grown-ups (ph) around. And yet to be treated as though you're being quite unreasonable or a pain in the ass by being whiny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in a way that it sounds like it was just confusing too. Not like, whenever you ask for chocolate cake that was whining. But if you ask for more broccoli, that was OK. It sounds like it was not so clear what you could or couldn't ask for or when it was—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —fair or reasonable to expect or want or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and in the one that I think of all the time is clothes. Mostly because that was like what was just—I was preoccupied with clothes. [00:19:55] And that was where a lot of the drama centered because it's different for men than it is girls. Like in terms of what volume of clothes you need, for starters. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like what—how specific they have to be. Like, what—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just remember, yea, just never having enough clothes or feeling like I never had enough clothes. And feeling on some level like it was like reasonable to want to be able to dress like the other people in my class or at least like a thrift store approximation of that. But you can't get an approximation of that at the thrift store. I mean, I can as an adult now but only because I live in a big city. I couldn't do it normally (ph). I can't, right? I tried. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm feeling like on some level it was very reasonable to be like, "No, it's not good enough to have the pants that have pleats in them and that are two inches too short. Like, I need the pants that fit because otherwise people make fun of me." [00:21:12] And on the other hand, being like, "But this isn't actually a basic human need. I will not die if I don't have these clothes so suck it up, Tanya." But not being able to just suck it up. Not being able to say, "This isn't something that I get to have" and move on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I imagine that you telling me that was a lot because of the shame, whether or how you felt about walking to class with pants that are two inches short and actually being teased and picked on for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. [00:22:01] (pause) Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wasn't like not having the same cool eraser that all the other kids have but nobody else would know except for you. It's like something that's out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (pause) Yea, yea (pause) and also I was at a disadvantage from the get go because I didn't know. My mom really wasn't around so I didn't have somebody to—I didn't own a slip, for example, until I was in high school. And like, [Gerry and Ashley] (ph) were like, "Dude, you're tight (ph)." (laughing) Static, tight skirt, it's like, "There's a way to solve this." (laughing) (pause) Yea, but that was tough. Like, perpetually tough. [00:23:06] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. I'm feeling like and probably (ph) like seeing that kid who is wearing the wrong clothes or doesn't even know she doesn't have the right thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Well, I knew that I didn't have the right thing but I didn't know what the right thing was because they would let me know that I didn't have the right thing. But I wasn't sure what the right thing was, if that makes sense. Or like, what would be close enough. Or like, what would—what—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —(inaudible at 00:23:37) fine that would be close enough. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then other times when there like, that is, pretty clearly, neglect. You seem just a little less clear to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't understand why the abuse (inaudible at 00:23:53) and I might not just know quite where exactly the line is but it is, pretty clearly, neglect. I mean, it sounds like your clothes didn't fit, you had (inaudible at 00:24:02) for two months before anybody notice what the hell is going on. [00:24:06] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There were a lot of other things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. We were alone a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. Nobody made sure you were turning in homework for whatever it was, seven years kind of thing probably. Like, that's neglect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't brush my teeth for years. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. That's another, pretty clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have horrible teeth and I'm ashamed. (laughing) I avoid going to the dentist because I'm ashamed of it. Will my teeth just get worse over it? Well, actually now that (inaudible at 00:24:43) it's gotten better, but kind of like taking care of everything and then I'll take care of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) (inaudible at 00:24:51) it's the same kind of communication (ph) I've heard before actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. There's no bed time routine, no getting up in the morning routine, nobody just looking after you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, nobody, yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody showing you to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I knew that people were supposed to brush their teeth but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. But kids don't want to brush their teeth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I didn't want to brush my teeth. [00:25:08] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like usually a matter of like having, "Hey, go brush your teeth. (inaudible at 00:25:13)"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And the thing is that I don't know anybody else like that. Yea, Amanda didn't—also didn't brush her teeth and she doesn't have any (inaudible at 00:25:21) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just got the bad genes and have to at least one filling for pretty much every tooth. My friend also has terrible teeth but does because she was bulimic for ten years—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that's different (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) But I mean, this, it's the same thing. We've talked about this overwhelming shame at the thought of going to the dentist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And not wanting to. (pause) (crying) And how does that happen? [00:26:07] In some ways, I feel I was kind of the center of attention in our community, or a center of attention, or my father was at least. We had so many adults in our lives that were fond of us. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But none that were thoroughly caring for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, we weren't anybody's responsibility. (crying) (pause) Yea. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also don't know how evident your mom was through most of this time but (inaudible at 00:27:01) to me why she couldn't have been sort of helping your father out in some way. In other words, like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: you were getting clothes which was (crosstalk)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't buy me a lot of clothes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She didn't, yea. I mean, she would have known, I'm sure well enough, what your father would and wouldn't have been likely to figure out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, but I feel like there was an antagonism between them a lot that that contributed to that. So she would buy me clothes to the instance (ph) that she would be the good parent. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she didn't really have a very good idea of what was age appropriate. So she would buy me clothes that were like—and I hit puberty pretty young. And so she would buy me clothes that were for adult women and I was the right size. It's clearly not the right thing for me to—and to them, like my dad would freak out and I wouldn't be able to wear it. [00:27:59] And (crosstalk) I think he tried really hard to keep that antagonism out of our mind because he wouldn't forbid me to wear something but you could see him go, "Eh, put a sweater on please," sort of thing." I don't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it seems (ph) that it meant she was kind of out of it actually. Do you know what I mean? She had three kids and two daughters and couldn't buy you clothes that were perfect for school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And I mean, she did most of the time. And most of the time when we went shopping, mom would take us shopping for clothes. And often papa would give—they would be like, OK, papa would give us some money and she would give us some money and it would be that's your budget. Now figure out what you need and go from there with some supervision but necessarily—not a whole lot, realistically. (pause) [00:29:17] Yea but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's from what age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to say eight or nine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't give even a smart eight or nine year old 50 bucks and say, "Go buy your clothes for this winter," or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, yea. (chuckling) We were going on vacation once and Jason (sp?) was seven, I think. And my dad was like, "OK Jason (sp?). Pack your suitcase." [00:29:55] And he packs ten t-shirts and twenty pairs of socks and no underwear. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:05) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But actually on that same trip, I started noticing that I was losing my vision when I was—with needing glasses—I was probably nine. And my one eye is really much, much stronger than the other so the other was much poorer (ph) so I could kind of fake it for a while. And so then I was ten or so, I got glasses. And then when I was twelve, I didn't get a new prescription. And then when I was twelve, we were on vacation, I lost my glasses somewhere in the journey. And I didn't get glasses again until I was fifteen or maybe sixteen. And was like, "Actually, I really see the board anymore, maybe I should do this again." [00:30:59] How does that happen? (crying) How did my pediatrician not say, "Hey it doesn't look like Tanya is wearing her glasses. What's up with that?" I don't understand. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I assume you didn't bring it up because you were worried about getting yelled at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, and I didn't like my glasses. I didn't bring it up because I didn't want to wear them. (crosstalk) I thought they looked ugly. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yea, that's different. That was more like brushing your teeth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I mean, he knew that I lost my glasses because I got yelled at for that. But—(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, not your pediatrician's fault. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) I know. [00:31:55] (pause) I just don't—(pause) I mean I don't understand—(pause) (crying) No, I do understand why this stuff happened with my dad. It's in his character to be really right there; the perfect person for some very nontangible things. And just completely not have it together for the rest. Like, that's just that's what he is. That's who he is. (crosstalk) Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. You sound (ph) is so much quicker. You go so quickly to understanding how it happened or what it was about for him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. [00:33:13] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or how he was but then thinking about what it was like for you—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —to be [more nervous] (ph) about your teeth or your clothes or anything to do with (inaudible at 00:33:30) or your homework or getting yelled at. I mean, and other things. You tend to focus on how this could have happened. What about him that could have led him to allow this to happen. Much more so on that than on what it was like. [00:34:00] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, yea. I guess I do. But I know what it was like, in some sense. I lived that. It sucked. It was awful. I sucked all the time. (crying) I'm still ashamed to go to the dentist. Like—(pause) it sucked. And so for whatever reason it's—but I know that my father is not a monster. And so it seems very important to me to figure out where all of this crap came from, like how could it have happened? [00:34:57] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that you feel like he is, also? I'm not saying he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt like he was one then and—(pause) yea, yea. (crying) I felt like he was one then and then there's this huge disconnect where I didn't need the things that he wasn't able to give me or that he was not giving me—lets re-phrase that—anymore. And so I could just have a good relationship with him because what I needed was what he gave me. But they don't seem like this—but there's this disconnect and I'm trying to kind of put it back together because—yea, when I think about my childhood, I still think about the monster that I thought of him then in doing all of those things (crosstalk) but I know then that's a real person. That's not the real thing. [00:36:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) People aren't monsters. They're just not. That's not how bad things happen. Bad things happen because complicated, essentially decent, people do crappy, crappy things. Maybe not essentially decent but bad things happen because people are complicated then they do their (ph) things. But the—it's not flat like that, if that makes sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you, in the monster version, felt like he meant it? You felt like he's bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I thought—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eventually (ph) doing this or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And so I felt like either—I felt like he was intentionally doing it. Or that that was how things were supposed to be. [00:37:01] So either that was how things were supposed to be or he was doing things that were really not how things were supposed to be because he was a bad person. Or I was a bad person or both, usually both. So some fluctuation between, "This is happening because I earned it and this is happening because he's terrible." I don't know if that makes sense. (pause) Yea, but I don't know how—(pause) </p>

<p>But the anger is something that I noticed and a lot of the things that you're like, "Hey, that's not normal." I didn't notice until I was an adult. [00:38:06] (pause) That's why I've said it's something else I need to figure out and I just don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>Plus, it's not easy to say like, "This isn't what you do with children." But I can't put myself back into being a child. I can't say, "This isn't what you do with me as a child," or not care. [00:38:51] (pause for one minute) (crying) I really think that if I think about this hard enough, it'll make sense. [00:39:55] (chuckling) Or I really feel that way. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: For what it's worth, my experience, these kinds—it's usually pretty straight forward, not that complicated. The most relevant part, they're very painful. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Straightforward in terms of where they come from? [00:40:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like I think to you—like one or more complicated issues—that if you think hard enough, you will resolve in their complexity and understand better. And I'm saying usually at the end of the day it's more like it's pretty simple and not that many moving (ph) parts. It's just a much more painful story.</p>

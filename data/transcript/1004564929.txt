<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Morning. I told you I wouldn't be here tomorrow right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok, and next week I'll be here Wednesday but not Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Um, did you tell me that already?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, let me just check that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next Thursday starts my month of traveling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, um, ok, right we're not meeting tomorrow, and then next week we are meeting Wednesday not Thursday and then we're off after that. Um, so yeah at least we got today and Wednesday. [00:00:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then we'll arrange, I'll send you an e-mail a week or so after that to arrange some new times when you get back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It depends on whether I have the rest of the schedule in front of me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we're leaving this afternoon to go to my sister's graduation and (sigh) (pause) I don't know, I just, I hate feeling coerced like I feel like I'm being forced to go and I don't want to go. I don't want to fucking go; I don't want to spend time with my family. I don't want to sit through nine hours of graduation ceremonies.</p>

<p>Like it's completely absurd, I don't want to go to my sister's sorority celebratory luncheon. I don't want to go to; she's graduating from the law school, the business school, her honors studies is having a ceremony, her college sorority is having a ceremony for alumni who are graduating from law school. There's uh, I don't even know, I've completely lost track. But there's seven different events, it's completely absurd. [00:02:17]</p>

<p>I don't really feel like I have the option of saying no, I can't go. And I'm kind of frustrated at myself because there's all of this stuff that I needed to get done before we leave for vacation next week, before my job started. Um, you know, I've been meaning to buy a new car and sell my car, I've been meaning to uh, get an eye exam, get new glasses, get new contacts. I am long overdue for a dental checkup. All of the stuff that I was going to get done during the month of May, but now we're leaving and May is over and, I guess May isn't over but we're leaving. So.</p>

<p>It didn't get done; I'm frustrated at myself, and... (sigh) [00:03:09]</p>

<p>I spoke to my mom Sunday for mother's day and she was just (pause) she was doing the classic mom thing of taking, well my mom thing, or a mom in general thing of, taking a position on anything. She's done this on thousands of different topics; that is completely 180 degrees different than a position she took just minutes or hours or days before.</p>

<p>And like, she was telling me all about her misadventures driving my sister from Missouri to Michigan for a visit to a grad school, do a grad school visit. I was like, why the hell were you driving from Missouri to Michigan, why were you going with her on a grad school visit? Like, put her on a plane, tell her to do the grad school visit herself, she's a grown ass woman. She has a college degree, has been working for a year, like... [00:04:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was like oh, but she's so needy and she needs... I'm like that's because you enable her. You enable this horrible codependent thing. And she was like well... and I can't even (pause) I can try to describe how it sounds, she sounded really self-satisfied when she said you know, I will admit I was the first who manipulated her to go to Missouri State instead of Tucson because I wanted my baby close to home. I was like, you manipulated her and you're proud of this. [00:04:49]</p>

<p>And she just sounded so satisfied about saying that she manipulated her because she didn't think she was old enough or ready to strike out on her own. And I mean, you know my sister skipped a grade so she was younger than most college students, but... (pause) And then mom kept going on and on about how you know, she wanted to have her sweet little angel near her, and Jane was such a sweet heart, was such an angel and was her darling baby. [00:05:21]</p>

<p>It's like not half an hour ago she was talking about how Jane was a wretched bitch and a stupid little shit and how she hated her and it's (pause) And she'll do this all the time on all kinds of things. She'll get really really emotional and passionate and invested about saying one thing. And then literally a half an hour later she'll say another thing depending on, I mean just as emotional and passionate and invested in demonstrating it.</p>

<p>Um, especially where dad is concerned. She'll say one thing vehemently and passionately when he's not in the room but as soon as he says something contrary she'll be agreeing with him with you know, the passion of a thousand burning somethings. It's just, (pause) it makes me angry and I can't figure out why because I mean, what do I gain if I prove to her she that flip flops like this and she doesn't actually have any beliefs of her own. [00:06:31]</p>

<p>Like, if I get her to agree with me that she's nuts?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh, how is that a win for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like what do I gain? Like.... But it just every time she does this I want to point out to her that she's being a raging hypocrite and I want to get her to understand that and I don't understand why it matters to me so much that she realizes what's going on.</p>

<p>Um, and then there's also like on top of that, or maybe next to that, there's the, she's so smug and self-satisfied about having manipulated Jane. What has she manipulated me about, or what does she think she's manipulated me about? [00:07:11]</p>

<p>You know at one point in our conversation she said uh, she saw on Facebook that I had a new job and she asked you know, is this what you really want to do? I was like it's a good job, this is what I trained to do, this is my goal. It might turn out badly, but (laughter). And she was like well you know, all I ever wanted was for you to be happy and (pause) the thing is I don't believe her, I think all she's ever wanted was for me to have the life that she wished she had had. [00:07:43]</p>

<p>Which is, she might think that's the same thing as being happy, but it's not, it's really not the same. Um, (pause) I don't know, I've been turning this conversation over in my head since Sunday and I still feel like I'm not done processing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um.</p>

<p>Pause at [00:08:13] to [00:08:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I can think of two things that might make you angry about her angry about her being that way. One is (pause) I think you tend to feel terribly responsible for lots of things and at times to give yourself considerable grief for all the things you feel so responsible for that you don't feel like you're kind of living up to in one way or another. And here she goes not even having to be responsible for what she said five minutes ago. [00:09:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whereas, you feel bad for not having upheld your responsibility to make a dentist appointment. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or not having gotten a lot done in May even if I imagine a lot of the reason was having spent a lot longer than anybody thought it would take to print your friend's wedding invitations. [00:09:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um,</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know part of it was that, and part of it was between there is a wedding on Sunday for my two of my friends and the weekend before that there was a huge party, I think I mentioned it. A lot of people were in, you know town for, so the last two weeks have been essentially almost like a reunion. I've been going out and being way more social than I usually am and then spending a lot more time at home recuperating from being social. [00:10:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my car has had problems and I've been distracted trying to deal with getting it repaired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. I guess one thing that crossed or occurred to me was the responsibility thing; like she sort of allowed something that you take very seriously. And another is, um, I wonder how much her doing that is sort of um, manipulative or aggressive in a kind of subtle way towards you in the moment. Where you are just supposed to believe whatever the fuck she says. No matter what she said a few minutes ago. Like, it's sort of um,</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:11:30)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah, like uh, it doesn't leave you a whole lot of room or kind of oxygen in the conversation. Which in a way, maybe her way is like a pretty aggressive thing to do to somebody? Like narcissism is pretty aggressive, you know what I mean, the focus tends to be on like, how inflated somebody is, or how egocentric or something.</p>

<p>But it's really, I think a way of being, it can be pretty aggressive toward other people. I wonder if you're kind of angry at being put in that very unimportant- you don't really even get to have a view because her view is the only one that can be taken in account. No matter how logical or consistent kind of position and it is kind of a manipulation I think. I'm not sure I know a lot about you and she, so, I might not have the texture of the relationship but I guess I'm wondering about that. [00:12:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess most of my life I just saw her as really weak, compared to my dad and (clears throat) almost a victim of his craziness. But, I don't know, it would be the older I get and the more I see it with adult eyes, the more I get the impression that she's actively enabling him and participating in his craziness.</p>

<p>Um, like just, I don't know, I'm about the age my mom was when I was born. And (laughter) you know all those things that your parents say you'll understand when you're older, you'll understand when you're a grownup, well now I'm that age and I still don't fucking understand (laughter). Like I just, I don't know every so often something will remind me of some event that happened when I was a kid and I'll reevaluate it from you know, if this were my child would you still have thought experiment. [00:14:10]</p>

<p>Or, you know, if this were a child in my Sunday school class, which I actually do have experience with children; there's no way, none. It just, and especially from the relationship stuff with her and my dad. You know if this, if I were in a relationship that broken, I hope I would have the sense to get out. And I mean I understand that there's a lot that goes on in abusive and codependent relationships and it's much harder to get out than it looks like from the outside. It does, it's a mess. And (sigh)</p>

<p>Pause at [00:14:48] to [00:15:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I've always gotten the impression and still get the impressive that my mom is jealous of how much time and attention that dad gives to his kids. Like there, like, and how fucked up is that that you know, mother would see her daughters as rivals for her husband's attention and affection. Like that's just so, I can't even begin to understand how deeply weird that is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think some of that is not actually not unusual both ways, yeah, I mean it really depends on what extreme it is carried to. But it's not so unusual for parents to feel something around that. Again, it you know, um, you know often it's uh; it doesn't become a huge issue. But it's uh, some parts not, having some degree of that is not so unusual. Again that doesn't mean that she didn't carry it to a wacky extreme but...</p>

<p>Pause at [00:16:22] to [00:16:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I certainly don't mean to take issue of the thrust of what you are saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm just trying to think of other things I could tell you about us since you said you didn't have a sense of the texture of the relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm getting on as you're talking. (laughter) Like, I guess probably from this conversation Sunday and partly anticipating seeing her, like, holding her accountable in ways that at times you haven't in part or more with stuff about your dad I guess. [00:17:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she was like, also one of those parents who couldn't decide if she was going to be like a disciplinarian or her child's best friend. Which was remarkably confusing for me as I was growing up, until it got to the point that I just shut her out of everything because... You know, one minute she'd be acting like a best friend and you know, trying to convince to confide in her and share all my deepest thoughts and feelings with her and the next minute she'd be like oh my God that's so horrible, I can't believe you said that, I'm going to go tell your father, we have to deal with this. [00:17:55]</p>

<p>I'd be like seriously? Um, at one point after I graduated from college, I can't remember how long after but she told me that she'd been reading my private journals all through high school. And I felt really betrayed by that; um especially because I hid them in the rafters in the unfinished portion of the basement. [00:18:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, so you went to some lengths.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the way the house was set up, this was the house that we lived in from tenth grade through to twelfth grade. The main floor was an open plan, like a formal living room, a den a kitchen, uh a formal dining room and a breakfast nook that all kind of opened into one another. Dad would sit at the kitchen table where one could see all the rooms on the first floor and the front door and the back door.</p>

<p>And then upstairs were my sisters bedrooms, my parent's bedroom and the guest bedroom, my bedroom was in the basement. Um, so there was a finished portion of the basement and the game room, a computer room, my room, the laundry room, bathroom and then so the stairs opened up into the den and then the den opened up into the two rooms and the bathroom and then from the bathroom slash laundry room another door opened up into the unfinished portion that we used as storage. So like, you had to go through the bathroom laundry room to the back. Which was you know, I tended to, my parents always thought I was long showerer, I would leave the shower on and go write in my journal in the unfinished corner of the basement and hide it. [00:19:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So did they know you had a journal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't realize that they did. But apparently they did if my mom was reading it. I never talked about it; I can't remember why I was so paranoid about it or why I wanted to hide it. Like I can't remember what was going through my head, like in hindsight I can piece together other events and circumstances but uh, I can't remember what I was thinking at the time that caused me to hide the fact that I had it. [00:20:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. I mean it sounds very horrible of her to do. I mean, to I mean for a bunch of reasons. The betrayal of going to find it I mean in the first place and not tell you about it. And also, I don't know what you wrote in there, but I imagine, like you told me, some of it would have been disturbing stuff to read about your child. And I, don't get the impression she ever (pause) um, like, was that supportive around it. [00:21:04]</p>

<p>In other words like she didn't come to you and say look I fucked up I read this, whatever but I'm really worried about you because you said XYZ.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope, never. At one time I told my parents I wanted to kill myself and my father's response was there's something wrong with you and you better not tell anyone else, because if anyone finds out it will go in your permanent record and you'll never get into college because they'll think you're crazy.</p>

<p>I was like, you know if my teenage child came to me and told me that they were being bullied and harassed at school in such a way that they wanted to kill themselves like, other people thinking they were crazy would be the last concern on my mind. Like, [00:21:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can hear my parents voice in my head, like I can hear that their response to that would be you know, well you're still young, you haven't been in the workforce that long, you don't understand and you don't have teenagers yet so you can't possibly understand. Which has been their response to pretty much every kind of disagreement with them ever.</p>

<p>But,</p>

<p>Pause at [00:22:23] to [00:23:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you worried about this trip? Like, how it will affect you, how upsetting it will be? How difficult?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, visiting my parents is always upsetting and always difficult. It always takes me days to weeks to recover my emotional equilibrium after I see them. It's not so much worry it's recognition I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anger as well, or I guess kind of past that to recognition or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just, (pause) (sigh) they fucked up so much of my life. Every year that I've been in college, grad school whatever, visiting for Christmas completely throws off my ability to get any kind of academic work done for the entirety of January. That really bit me in the ass this year cuz it meant that my advisor threw me out of the program essentially and said she wouldn't supervise my PhD cuz that was the last straw for her. And maybe there would have been a last straw from something that I actually caused myself. [00:24:31]</p>

<p>But like, I'm pretty angry at my family because if they just weren't so fucking insistent that I spend a week and a half with them at Christmas every year, maybe I could have held it together a little bit longer, or maybe not, I don't know, but I won't know because they, their,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've tried telling them how much visiting them throws off my fragile mental stability and they just don't believe me, they say I'm making it up they call me crazy, they say there's something wrong with me.</p>

<p>And then they get hurt, and they're like, oh clearly you just want us to kill ourselves, maybe I should just kill myself, put you out of your misery. [00:25:22]</p>

<p>Like, yet dad has actually said if you want me to kill myself, maybe I should just go ahead and kill myself now. Like many times, more than I bothered to keep track of. There's also the time in high school where I tried to run away and dad heard the door open and came out and yelled at me. And then he threatened to just run away and leave. He actually got in the car and drove away in his pajamas and bare feet.</p>

<p>(Sigh) But that, because he was making me so miserable, fine then, he'd just leave. And then he left. Like today. [00:26:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He didn't come back in five minutes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm pretty sure he went to his office and stayed there because when he came back he was wearing scrubs. Um, (pause) but yeah, like all, all I want is for them to admit that they fucked up. Like they might have been doing the best they knew how, but I just want them to acknowledge that if there is something wrong with me it's their fucking fault. [00:26:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was another catch phrase when I was in middle school and high school, whenever I did anything to displease them from forgetting to sweep the floors to getting in trouble in school. Anything, it was I don't understand why you're suck a horrible child, we've done everything for you but you're still disrespectful and disobedient, there's something wrong with your head we should take you to a shrink to fix you, except that would be a black mark in your record. Straighten up or else we'll put that black mark in your record. [00:27:23]</p>

<p>I can still hear my mother saying there was something wrong with me, and I don't understand. I used to think I wanted an apology from them, but I think I've given up on that and lowered my standards for my idealistic what I want from them. I just want them to acknowledge what happened and stop pretending they were perfect parents. That's all. I don't think that's gonna happen. [00:28:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. It reminds me a little of that um, I don't especially subscribe to some, I'm just saying it reminds me of the like stages of grief thing, the bargaining. Um, I mean the process of like mourning how they were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I might as well wish for a trip to Mars. I mean theoretically it's feasible with enough money and enough will and enough resources but like, it's never gonna happen. [00:28:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>Pause at [00:28:56] to [00:29:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which um, (pause) which I guess leaves you sort of trapped with all the like, helplessness or frustration and anger about what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of times I'll just you know, I'll remember something and I'll start telling stories like, mostly because I want reassurance from someone outside my family that this was weird and not right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:30:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, Dave can't handle it; he really hates hearing these stories because I don't know if I had to guess it makes him feel helpless to help me. And he doesn't like that feeling? I don't know I'm guessing here. But...again, he says he finds it really depressing and he doesn't want to hear anything. Sometimes it's just too much for him to cope with.</p>

<p>And you know, my rational brain when I can step away from it realizes that that's all about him and his emotions and what he can and can't handle but sometimes in the moment it feels like he's siding with my parents or like he doesn't care about me enough to want to help and like, again when I can step away from it and look at it with rational brains, it's about him and not me. [00:31:44]</p>

<p>It's really upsetting when I'm in the middle of these, almost flashbacks, like not real flashbacks, but almost and he ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does sound like it's very vivid and they kind of come to life for you the more that you talk about them. Um, and, what you are wanting from him is like reassurance about how fucked up their treatment of you was? Or situations were that you were in? [00:32:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or just reassurance that I'm not crazy for being upset about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we are back to what we were talking about last week, my inability to trust my own emotions. Needing external reassurance that what I am feeling is ok.</p>

<p>Pause at [00:32:49] to [00:33:12]</p>

<p>(Talking in background)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I'll ask her to talk in the hall.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not bothering me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright if it's not bothering you I won't. Um,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Between us, I keep being distracted by the wrinkles in the rugs, the rug. Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's ok. Um, then what is distracting about, like</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like wrinkles. [00:33:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't line up correctly and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess part of me keeps wanting to go over there and tug it out from under the couch because it's pushing up against the leg of the couch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, so about your, the worry that you're referring to is that if you're upset about something that happens along the lines of what you're describing with your parents, it means you're crazy or it's a crazy feeling. [00:34:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, but sometimes I worry I'm actually in the wrong and can't see it. Like, (pause) I guess I'm angry about something. Well I'll give you an example, one that actually happened that I was angry about something where I was actually in the wrong. [00:34:52]</p>

<p>I was, it was after homecoming my senior year, and a bunch of us had gone to a friend's house and were playing pool in his basement, and um, you know, we were you know, playing pool and I thought it was my turn and there was only one pool cue so I grabbed it and started to play. And uh, one of the guys is like no way it's my turn and tried to wrestle it out of my hands. I was like, nu uh, you're trying to skip my turn because you don't think I'm a good player, I'm gonna take my turn, you can't stop me; like we were physically wrestling over control of the cue stick. And uh, my boyfriend came up and touched me on the shoulder and said it's actually his turn. [00:35:34]</p>

<p>I was just so chagrined that I had fought so hard and gotten so indignant when I was actually in the wrong. I guess that's sort of emblematic of what I'm afraid of. But like I'll get really indignant and angry or hurt and upset and it will turn out that what I'm upset over is a perceived insult or perceived hurt that doesn't actually exist. Because I've misread the situation or you know, there's some information I don't have, and you know, I have no reason to be upset and I'll look like an idiot.</p>

<p>Pause at [00:36:06] to [00:36:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I have yet to hear of anything at all like that with your family that you've told me. And, (pause) and what if...</p>

<p>Pause at [00:36:52] to [00:37:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that you're, why the particular worry you have in fact comes very much out of the way you were treated in that uh you're so ashamed of the example you described of having been wrong and getting so indignant about it, but I imagine it's fairly clear to both of us, that that was a sensitive spot for you being sort of implicitly in that case criticized for not being a good enough pool player as you constructed it. And sort of, being ignored, um, and wanting to stand up for yourself and like very much coming out of the ways in fact you had been treated. And feeling like it was such a problem for you to have been wrong. [00:38:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As the same... does that make sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, I can imagine you felt so ashamed of being wrong in that case because you are so vulnerable to feeling like you really screwed things up. [00:38:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. Any amount of being wrong is not acceptable in my house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>Pause at [00:39:04] to [00:39:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was this one incident when I was in the second grade.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, just thinking about trying to explain it all makes me tired. But, I come home from school, no I guess this was first grade. Saying guess what I learned? How to spell Mississippi today! And I spelled it wrong, I had gotten an extra s or something, I don't remember. My parents were like that's not how Mississippi is spelled. And I said nu uh, my friend Jasmine told me and she's the smartest girl in the class. [00:40:02]</p>

<p>My parents were like who do you think is smarter your friend or us? And I was like Jasmine is the smartest girl in my class and you said you got C's in college so Jasmine must be smarter. Like seven year old logic.</p>

<p>And my mom's feelings got really hurt and she and my dad started arguing with me and yelling at me. Don't you trust us, don't you think we're smart. We're smart, we can't believe you don't believe us. And I was like, I didn't recognize it at the time, but in hindsight looking at the memory they acted in all ways like a peer had just insulted them. And they were getting really defensive like, the way I would get if one of my friends had come up to me and said you know, you're stupid, or you know, like insulted me in some way. [00:40:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like how is that even remotely a sane way to react to seven year old logic, one and two they kept hounding me about it. Um, yelling at me and after like lots of yelling and arguing and like verbal abuse, they pulled out a dictionary and showed it to me. I just started crying and it was like, but, but Jasmine is the smartest girl in the class, how could she be wrong? I don't understand.</p>

<p>And like, I'm not even sure if it was that my friend was wrong or that I remembered incorrectly or if I misheard her or good god, I don't know. Like, and they were like see you shouldn't trust anybody but your parents. And that was the lesson that I got from that. [00:41:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just. (sigh) Who fucking cares if a seven year old spells Mississippi wrong? I mean they'll learn the right spelling... It just, oooh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, I wonder if you wanted the smartest kid in the class to always be right about everything cuz if that were the case and someday you could be the smartest you'd be safe. [00:42:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean that's not really the main point of what you're saying which is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also I went to that school for two years, kindergarten and first grade and Jasmine and I were alternating between being friend and being enemies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I remember a time we were at school together, and also, which one of us was the smartest one in the class would frequently flop, flip, like we were both at the head of the class, like not that that means anything when you're seven. (sigh) [00:42:49]</p>

<p>Like this was a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly at seven.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At seven, this was a, um, almost Montessori-ish school. It was a private school run by some woman who had been in the public school teaching for like thirty years. Got a PhD in early childhood education, and I can do it better and started her own school. It was a lot of solitary learning, a lot of splitting the class into groups of like three or four students in every subject math, science reading. Um but we did move at our own pace. Like every child had a different spelling test every week, at their own level. I can't even imagine how much work that was for the teachers.</p>

<p>But, um, Jasmine and I were in the same group. [00:43:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like there was ultimately some rivalry and some like frenemy business going on. Uh if that makes any sense like, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though lived it I'm still a little baffled by my emotional life as a child. It's all confusing to me. I guess that's true for all children. [00:44:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you didn't have a lot of help sorting it out. We have to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow that went fast.</p>

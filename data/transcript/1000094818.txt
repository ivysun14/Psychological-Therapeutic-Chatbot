<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is Susan.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi Susan, Josephine here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So tell me how it is going. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's going ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're still abstinent right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good, good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Can't say it's been easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, no addiction is. Did you find in the group last week, when we talked about the dynamic of eating at the high end of moderate initially, usually it is about that fear of not getting enough... the fear of hunger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, that was very useful to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: To hear everybody's thoughts on that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really, what a bunch of smart ladies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aren't they great?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very articulate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoyed listening to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good. Did it help you kind of walk through some of that fear and have some meals that were a little more mid range? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes, in fact I have been, as we talked, incorporating fruit and vegetables into my meals.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going with a healthier type of a muffin in the morning, not a bran. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: More whole grain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good deal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It made me a little bit feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Those are kind of subtle changes that usually do make us feel better but don't kick in much dieting mentality. Just making those kinds of changes really do make us do feel like I'm being the best kind of mom to my body I can. You know that phrase?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wanted to tell you too, that I saw Eliza, my other therapist last week, last Thursday, and we did a really good exercise. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A guided visualization of my inner family talking to my little girl. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh beautiful. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And taking her back with me. It was powerful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It usually is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really powerful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that was a good thing to do. I felt stronger after having done that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Felt her with me as a separate being almost. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Felt a mother to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Wow. That's wonderful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel when Eliza kind of guided you through the visualization; did you feel like this might be something I could try on my own? Did you feel now that you've done it once maybe it yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. I think even probably more effectively. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely think I could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was nice to go through it first with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is very nice. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Safer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somehow I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if you have the luxury of working with somebody as good as she is, you know, that is the good news that she can do that for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wanted to share that with you that we talked about the inner family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that is going to be very useful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is. It is a very powerful tool. Good. Good. Good. What I have found often times; I think you guys are working more on historical issues, right? Is  that usually the littler inner family members, the ones with the eating addictions, are usually more adolescent and young adult that have been thrown into that grown up world of how to fending for themselves, thinking that we should have all the wisdom of sexuality and dating and finances way before we are really had the life experiences to justify that, and yet adolescents are by their nature not wanting to look like they are a newcomer to anything and so we are thrown into that ...that is kind of a generic version. With us you add in times when our body kind of has a mind of it's own, it's growing, it's making us taller, it's giving us breasts, it's giving us hips, women anyway, and so often times it's the body having a mind of its own and us with so little confidence in ourselves that the eating addiction really takes a strong hold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is a good point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So as you two work to build relationships and be the best mom that you can to your younger selves, probably whose going to show up around your weight shifting is going to be those young adolescent or young adult ages. Young men are often inappropriate, starring at our bodies, or coming on to us etc. It is usually those younger selves that feel that kind of pressure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had not even thought of it. I think I need to explore that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In that I was one who was six feet tall and was wearing a B cup when I was 13 years old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was way too soon.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And emotionally to have a body like that and older guys looking at me </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That probably was part of it, to pad the body up. I do not know, subconsciously. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It certainly is a common one, the one you just described. It is a common way the eating addiction swooped in to be our rescuer, our answer, our solution for a while. Unfortunately, it kind of turns on us in adult living. In a way I am kind of grateful that I had my alcoholism and my eating addiction to get me through those upsetting years, when I did not really have a lot of adult guidance. As you strengthen that tool of the inner family, just maybe know that you can invite in some of the teenagers and invite in some of the young adults. How old were you when you got married?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was twenty-five. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that young married woman, .... How old are you now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Forty-one. [0:06:53.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say that young mom, but you did not have kids too quickly, did you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. We did not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that you might have a young mom that shows up. Your daughter is eight is she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's eight. I was thirty-three when I had her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The young mom is another age that might show up and that is another time, pregnancy is another time when our body certainly does a lot of changing and the responsibilities of being a mom when we have not necessarily resolved some of our own relationships with our own parents. Anyway, just keep that in mind that as you start to work a little more with your inner family to just keep welcoming them in with the same kind of kindness and understanding that Eliza's help will you guide you through. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think there is any significance in the age that I imagined myself as in the first visualization? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually there is. What age was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like my daughter's age.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eight. Certainly that is an age where we are a little more on our own. There is a lot more demands on us at school, cursive writing and multiplication tables, those start coming in around eight or nine. And so depending on, those were kind of generic ones, depending on what was going on in your family, I think by nine or ten, we start to understand family dynamics, not very accurately, but we see them.  I think by the time we are at eight or nine we do get whether people are kind and compassionate, whether the house is safe or not safe. So, was there anything significant going on with your dad's drinking at that time? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I can think of. I'm sure that it was happening on and off. Definitely, that it was happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the history with him? He got sober at one point, didn't he? </p>

<p>PATIENT: He did. He was sober for about seven or eight years. Then after my brother died he went back to drinking and then struggled on and off and eventually became cross addicted to pain killers and eventually died from an accidental overdose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. When were his sober years, that seven or eight years that he was sober? How old were you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was actually out of the house by then. I was nineteen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eighteen or nineteen. Is that what you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Eighteen or nineteen.</p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: When he first got sober. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he was sober for your wedding. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He was. Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old was your brother when your brother died?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Twenty-nine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what did your brother die of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He had a heart condition. He eventually had a blood clot that went to his brain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was everybody aware that condition existed or was it a total surprise?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He also was addicted to pain pills.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did he have other addictions, your brother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So just kind of from the illness you think the addiction to pain meds came up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was legitimately in pain. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It overtook him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it because of that heart condition?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. How old were you when your brother died?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Twenty-three.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Twenty-four, something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Had you and your brother been close? It sounds like there was a chunk of years there between you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Seven years between us. Yes, we were. We were close.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Usually when we are that far apart, you would not be close. It sounds like you were close.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. We were. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Certainly, you are talking about, even though that the eight to ten year old little gal that showed up, you certainly have a variety of ages that have gone through some pretty heavy stuff. For me I was almost this height by the time that I was twelve and it sounds like you were your height by the time you were eleven or twelve too. It is a different experience out there in the world, when we look older and develop early, that can put us in situations that we would not put our own daughters in. You know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It was not a great thing. Then to have my brother seven years older and all his friends, ooh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, my gosh. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was kind of a small guy interestingly. They would say, "Oh, you didn't tell me you had an older sister." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that kind of thing. So it was constantly, older boys running to our house who were kind of eyeing me. I am sure it occurred. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one of those I had my first sexual encounter with and it was not good. He was of age and I was not so it was really upsetting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What do they call that, a statutory situation? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I recall it was not necessarily with any big consent on your part and you did not really have a relationship with him, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I did not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it was more like a molestation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Although, I did not protest at all. I went along with what he was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old were you when that happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably fifteen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he was about twenty-one, my brother's age.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Well, it sounds like as you start to do the inner family work, to just maybe, at the nine year old is the one that is triggering the most parental energy in you. That is a really good place to start. It sounds like that brought out all the right loving energy on your part. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did. It was positive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So had the seventeen year old shown up with her fear and pain, it might not have been the easiest situation. But now talking about her and kind of in a sense in your heart, welcoming her into that family it might give the other ages an opportunity to show up. I do find that the recovery and the healing that takes place in our first year or two of abstinence, that the concept of using the inner family, you can have the nine year old, you do not have to be the nine year old. You can have the seventeen year old; you do not have to be the seventeen year old. </p>

<p>So we can almost have, I think you used the phrase, a separate self in there and it's easier to almost go through our history with a little more compassion and a little more detachment to bring to the inner family. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was interesting to almost be a fly on the wall.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I even remembered something I had not remembered. We sat on a couch that my mother use to have that I did not remember for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. </p>

<p>RESPONDNET: I was almost in the room, there, right there. I saw her and it was completely detached and separate. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From me. </p>

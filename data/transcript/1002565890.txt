<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now, now we're [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, now we're getting down to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Now I can't, now I can't, okay.  Uh, I may be, I have exactly 3 weeks of meds left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're getting low.  So let me get you some more.  No, we'll do that now while I'm thinking about it.  Here you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're all set, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm, uh, I am also, uh, on Imodium AD and Gatorade and this is my first session with that since I was diagnosed with celiac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you having some stomach problems recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's, uh, stress.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stress can really mess with your, I have found out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, my, my gentle giant has an enlarged heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, she cannot walk, they told me not to walk with her anymore that, that she would just, uh, collapse on me and I'd be, uh, left out someplace with this dog I couldn't even lift.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do they know why her heart's enlarged?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, um, I guess, my understanding is, number 1, she's a minimum, they're not sure how old she is, but she's a minimum of 10 years old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So for a dog her size, that's pretty old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause how big is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's, um, she's 85 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, she's a big one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well, one of the things that alerted was that she had, she, when I took her into the doctor for something else, uh, she had, um, she had lost 6 pounds and, um, so they had talked to me about doing an x—ray, uh, because there were 2 things that were, they were suspicious of.  Uh, evidently it's not that us, unusual for either a dog this size, I'm not sure about the breed, but any way, to get, um, to have an enlarged heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they were also concerned of the possibility of a tumor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, so I decided to think about it and in the meantime I was back in there because she wound up with a yeast infection in her ears and just like people, it's never just one thing.  And, um, the vets have just been fabulous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the other thing is that they, I, I noticed what they were doing.  They were, they were trying to find out, um, what level of information I, I wanted—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because there are people that just say, doc, don't tell me; I don't want to know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, of course, I'm the kind of person that says I want to know the whole business so I can make good decisions and so on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I want to know.  And, um, so, um, if I'm, if I'm lucky, she will just go to sleep some night.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's not in pain, well, I, I had, so any way when I took her back with the, with the, with the ear business, I said let's go ahead and do the, the x—rays and that's when we found out.  And the heart is pressing against her lungs and, uh, she's huffing and puffing and, uh, she's not in pain.  They g, she has a little bit of arthritis and so we're giving her, uh, some Rimadyl and some pain medication for that.  I have a pharmacy on my kitchen counter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, then, um, they brought up the possibility of doing an echocardiogram.  I checked in and it was going to, by the time they got done with all the add—ons, it was going to run about $500.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, on a 10—year dog.  So any way, I went back to them and I said, what are, what are we going to find out, what kind of information are we going to get from that that we can do something about or whatever?  Well, it turns out that they will have more information in a diagnostic sense, but to put her on medication means that, it would have meant that she would have been constantly monitored because it might, um, mess with her, her kidneys—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And liver and so forth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'd be in there with her all the time.  That's more stress on the dog—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, so I decided against that.  I mean there's a point of which you just have to, you know,you'd made difference decisions if that was a 3—year—old dog then maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But any way and I, they also told me that sometimes, um, a dog that's dying will disengage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, will just sort of, well, my dog is very alert.  Uh, today's the first day she hasn't eaten anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But up until now she's been eating and pooping and doing all the, those things.  Um, she's very restless.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, then I had, I had one day last week where I just had a really terrible morning over the whole thing and she just seemed really bad and all this and, and I got a hold of myself on, later that day in the afternoon and the dog perked up too so that told me the dog was reacting to me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because that dog has been that way.  Anytime I'm sick, she knows it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes she'll know it a half a day before I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean she has that sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This dog has, has been the best pet that I've ever had and I look at her and, and it's like I, there's something terribly unreal about the idea of being without her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean I, I just, I can't, I can't make reality out of it yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't think I'll be able to until she's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's going to be very hard because you've had her for how many years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Six I think it's been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it turned you, but it was sort of an odd way that I got her.  I had, I had put my previous dog down and she, that, I went for about, um, I don't remember exactly, somewhere around a year without a dog—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, I found this book in the library where people, the authors had interviewed all, all types of different folks that work with dogs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The, the vets and trainers and, and they put them in in different categories.  Now what, what, uh, what exactly, um, was the, was the, uh, what's the word I want?  The, the criteria for a certain category, I don't know, but any way, then what they did was they gave you a test to take and they more or less guaranteed if you get a dog in such, in the, the category that matches your personality, you will be a happy camper with this dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you wouldn't believe, I mean I, I wound up in the dog category where all breeds that hadn't even entered my mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had always had mutts up, up until then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is, mutts are good dogs—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they're healthier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I've spent a bundle on this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But any way, um, so my category was German Shepherd, Poodle, Doberman, Corgi, I mean these, can you imagine?  All of these were in one category.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, there, there were also, uh, they'd also give you a couple of other categories that you would be successful with—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you picked an animal from it.  Well, then it turned out I got a phone call.  A friend of a friend had rescued this dog and needed a place and I said, well, what, what kind and so forth?  Well, it's a German Shepherd.  Well, shoot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Meant to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And to this day, I remember the first time I saw her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, the woman had her sitting right beside her in the hallway of the house, of her house, and had me come over and she had me come in the door.  And so what I saw was the woman and the dog.  I couldn't tell you for anything what the woman looked like.  All I saw was this gorgeous dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's, I, compared to the last dogs I've had, so alert, so, uh, just in, oh, my gosh, smarter than I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm, I hear they're very smart dogs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really smart.  It's scary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  And like you said about being about to sense things like when you're sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Must be very, uh, sharp that way.  Very tuned in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very tuned in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There, there are, when I'm sick, she will not leave my side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I move from one room to the other just to go pick up a cup of coffee or something, she's right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm telling you, unless I slam the door real quick, [INAUDIBLE] goes to the bathroom.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when I was sick for so long there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There she was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so there's, there's a lot of bonding that happens—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And the other thing is that initially I was not all that particularly comfortable with a dog that had a reputation as being aggressive.  Well, if there's anything this dog wasn't, it was aggressive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean she was the lousiest guard dog that ever existed.  I mean she doesn't bark.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just, she wants to make friends and come on in and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, she likes to go with me to visit the neighbors and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, she likes to know what's going on and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just, and, you know, you're right.  Part of it is that I'm going for walks by myself now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm walking further—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I need to be doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need to in, I need to get back to my, my 2 miles every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  That's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, I hadn't been able to do that with her because she would just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Poop out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And just recently I was walking from the garage in the front of the house around the side to the back and I had her with me and she just plunked down on the side of the house halfway there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the other thing is though, I'm hoping that she will localize in some way or something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In a way that will tell me that it's time to put a stop to this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  Yeah, I suspect that somebody will know if she's suffering.  Start whimpering or whining or something.  Hopefully she'll let you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See part of the problem I found out, cats are worse than dogs apparently that from back in the old days, mother nature, uh, provided for weakness in animals by, uh, instilling them the capacity not to show that something hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not to show their weakness essentially—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because then if they showed weakness, they were subject to being preyed upon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So some of that is still a carryover.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they say cats are terrible.  They said, they, cats, they said when they bring them into the vets office, they're, they're just dead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, hmm.  Well, hmm.  So if not, if she doesn't vocalize it, if she doesn't, you know, whimper or whine, maybe by her behavior you'll notice if she's, you know, different, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even if someone else wouldn't know it, I suspect that you and she are close enough, you'll notice there's at least a subtle shift in her behavior.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they told, that's what they, uh, the vets told me.  They said you're the one that knows her the best.  Um, but years ago, I had this old vet tell me, he had, he was in the process, he had to put one of his dogs down and he said, we usually wait too long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I know that [INAUDIBLE] with their dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was awful, oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I just, you know, I, I've told the vets that, um, that I'm, I feel very strongly that we have an obligation not to allow our pets to suffer.  I just think that is what you sign up for when you have a pet and that's an obligation you have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I'm very, I feel quite strongly about that, but I also know that I am so attached to this dog that there's no way around having my, my judgment being colored by this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now she sl, she's sleeping a lot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's much more—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this not eating, we'll see how, what, what happens with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I caught her once this morning she was laying under the table and she lifted her head up like this which meant she was trying to breathe—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Easier.  Uh, her—they told me to watch her gums because if they changed from the, from a healthy pink, that means the circulation is, is reducing and her gums are changing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, it sounds like you're pretty tuned in.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm tuned in, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I mean one of the things I'm wondering is do I have to picture, do I have to picture in my mind life without her or going through, going through that separation before I'm able to see that I should do that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think it's necessary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what's really been weird in the last, uh, 6 months or so for me?  Is, uh, becoming a woman of age sort of speak, um, when [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER]'s mom died—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was only [AGE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm thinking why wasn't that me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I almost think that way about the dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think that's a normal thought.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it's like I'm getting to be an old lady.  Why, why don't they just take me and leave her forever?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's a normal thought to have, but it's obviously not your time yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that a normal thought though?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, it is.  When someone, you know, dies or someone close to you dies, people often think, you know, why them?  Why not me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I never felt that way before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't feel that way when my parents died or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or, or, um, some boyfriends died, that sort of thing.  I never thought for a minute why not me instead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that never entered my—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Head.  This is a new one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe it's new because you see yourself as being ad, more advanced age?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So maybe you're having more thoughts about your own death?  Do you think about your own death at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think part of it is, uh, because with, um, with the celiac and stuff, I don't feel all that great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this week for the last 3 mornings is the first time in absolutely years that my fibromyalgia has, pain has been just awful—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I'd wake up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, but I'm a, I'm a, I'm a firm believer in, it really helps to walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Helps your pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so it's like, uh, I, I don't, I don't take anything until, if it's still with me after I walk, then I might take something, otherwise no.  But I walk first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've been able to walk it off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  We're finding what's works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of, well, and it's kind of, you have to push yourself a bit first, but, um, well, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't know.  You, you don't, you don't have any, any magic bullets because it's, it's just, and I, I have had moments where I thought let's just go and get this over with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, which is normal too.  I mean it sounds like her health is failing.  They told you that.  It's just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, there's no question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's just a matter of how long will she hold on or will she slip in the night some night when she's sleeping or will she start suffering at which point it sounds like you would want to put her down.  You don't want her to suffer, but you just don't know when that's going to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  It—because it's one of those things where it's not pain, it's more a matter of sparing discomfort—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When you can't breathe—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and it's not pain per se.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My, my gut sense is that you'll know if that time comes where she just isn't herself and she's not able to even do the basic things that she used to be able to do and her life is so restricted that it's not a quality of life that, you know, you want her to have any longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she's, to a certain extent, that's already happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm, but does she still follow you from room to room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, for instance, yesterday I was out working in the garage—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was making trips in, in the house and back.  Under normal circumstances, she'd be right there with me.  She didn't.  She just plunked down in the garage and she just stayed there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And didn't, didn't move.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she, it's just, it's just harder for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But yet, uh, a couple, a couple of times, uh, when the weather was, you know, cool and I was going in the car and she really wanted to go so I let her go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And she did okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, sometimes when she comes, when she comes over to me or something I, it's like I'm thinking are you trying to tell me something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she's so sensitive to me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That, you know, this is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and see the fact that there are still doubts or questions in your mind, tells me it's probably not the right time now and I think when the time is right, there, those doubts or questions will be maybe not gone, but much, much less where it's more obvious to you that, you know, it's the right time, if that time comes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My last, my last dog, uh, uh, we've gone, I've gone a long time, I didn't have to have a vet tell me that she couldn't walk anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She did.  And, uh, when I, as I was going to bed and she was laying down on the floor and I heard her groan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Heard that groan and I said that's it.  The next day I took her in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You knew.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean that just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You knew.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just no more</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, good.  So you, you have a good sense then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the meantime—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Imodium AD—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Gatorade.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And Gatorade.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I'm very conscious of just being under this stress—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Something fierce.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why it's important for you to get out and do the walking and do things to take care of yourself still so stress doesn't have cumulative effects on you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See I'm, I'm aware of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't leave the house much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm, but, uh, [NAME OTHER]'s having a garage sale.  So this coming weekend, so I'm taking some stuff over and I'll spend some time over there and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, we'll see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How she doing?  She doing okay with, after her mother's death?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think, you know, I've only, I've only seen her what?  Just a couple of times.  Uh, [NAME OTHER] has not talked about it.  There is the, the estate.  She's the executor of the estate and that is just, just a mess—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't know half of it and, um, so she's working at getting that done.  Garage sale this weekend; next, on the [DATE], they're going to go camping and then her school starts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, so I know she's still grieving, that's evident.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but I, I really, I really haven't had a chance to sit down and ask [NAME OTHER] about it or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My only contact with him has been on the telephone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's, now I'm going to stop there on my way home, but, um, uh, because what, what kind of, with [NAME OTHER], if we just have some relaxed time together, we do real well on the, on the communication thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I miss that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's, he's really busy because he was also been, he's also been involved in the, in this hospital move.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, he got elected to get the, uh, the, they've got a new really upscale, uh, CT scan machine—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he got elected to, you know, put the protocols in and all that kind of stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so he's been—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very busy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Days and nights and, and everything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, the other thing I wonder, he had put his dog down about 9 months or so ago, maybe a year now, one of this dogs, and, uh, I'm wondering how much this is, that dog he had for years and years and years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm wondering that when I, if I attempt to talk to him about it, if that brings back some stuff that he doesn't want to feel again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could, yes.  Hmm.  So that could be why he's maybe a little more distant or not around or not communicative?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On top of being busy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On top of being very busy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, um, the other thing is that he's apt to feel helpless.  That anybody that talks to me has to feel helpless.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean in the sense that they can't fix my dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they can't fix my grief.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I also found out that, that I, I do need to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, it's important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Otherwise you start going a little bit nuts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, that's true.  That's true.  You don't want to keep it all inside.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know what?  What, this niece that's, um, in the nursing program—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, this is back in the Midwest and I don't, I don't know how she must have had, she must have had free, free, uh, what do they call it?  Hours?  Free, free weekend hours or something like that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but any way, she was driving to, to Milwaukee to see some friends and it's about a 3 1/2 drive or something.  So she calls in, well, what [NAME OTHER] had done, I, when [NAME OTHER] was married, I had gotten this, this purse and I knew when I got it that it was one that the younger set would approve of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So any way at, at that time, I said, well, who wants my purse when I get done with it?  Well, 2 of them, she was one of them and then my niece that's in Chicago, they both, we do, you know?  So it's a [INAUDIBLE], but any way, so what I did, [LAUGHING], I turned out that I happened to be in this store and I saw the same purse and it was on sale for $5.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought [NAME OTHER]'s like, just like, I know what I'm going to do.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they both got purses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, but their thing, what I, I didn't tell them.  I had to tell them lat, later, but I didn't tell them that's what I was doing.  So the replies I got was, wait until I tell [NAME OTHER].  Wait 'til I tell [NAME OTHER] I got that purse.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I'm, oh, my heavens, what have I done?  So then I, I've got a confession to make.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Well, it's probably no less important or valuable to them.  The fact they're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They each got one too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, but any way she, she called me.  We must have talked for 2 hours on the telephone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Huh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was really, it was really great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then she said to me, okay, when I'm driving home, I'll call you again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I got another call.  So and that, that was really, that was really nice.  Um, she's, uh, well, she went through, she went through this horrible stage and, and as a teenager.  She is very, very beautiful and very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Photogenic and, uh, she went through this stage in the teen years where boy did she know it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah, that's a tough one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she could get a little nasty and, and she has turned out to be just the sweetest thing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And just, uh, she's, she's really got her head on straight and just—it's amazing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They grow up, don't they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME], you know, it feels like overall you're doing pretty well.  You've got stuff going on, but, you have some stuff going on, but you're dealing with it well.  I mean you're not letting it get the better of you.  You're grieving, you're not depressed.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I'm pretty sure.  You don't seem depressed to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I think it's pretty—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, no, it is grieving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and that's normal.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, but I've never had a big cry yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you haven't lost your dog yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's understandable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I , but I remember the last time, the last time I put my dog down—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I was in the vets office and I was just howling my head of something fierce.  I must have just embarrassed everybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I kind of snuck out the backdoor.  [NAME OTHER] was with me.  I asked him to go with me, snuck out the backdoor</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After he, and said, okay, now take me to breakfast.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fly again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fly again right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did ask him if he could go, I don't want to go alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's nice not to have to go alone, to have somebody with you if you can.  If that happens again, if you get to that point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't know exactly—well, I'll just have to make some phone calls.  The other thing I did find out, the woman next door to me had a dog that had to be put down and they have a,  they have a, they have a traveling vet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've heard of that, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  I've heard of that for other people too that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so he came to her house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know.  A lot is going to be determined in what kind of shape she is in whether I can get her in the car and all that kind of stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if, if [NAME OTHER] is available or if she just goes in her sleep, I just, I can't visualize, I can't, I look at her and I just can't see me being without her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's made friends in the whole neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The woman across the street at one point had German Shepherds and so she called yesterday and wanted to come over and say goodbye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's, she's doing things like losing clumps of hair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I'm doing this time though—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am thinking about getting another one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're, it's really healthy to have a pet.  There's no question in my mind about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely it is, yep, in a lot of different ways, emotionally/physically it's healthier.  Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The woman next door had to put her dog down and she had a new dog in less than 2 weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what she got is just, it, the dog is so darn funny—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That he just, he just has you laughing all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's, I'm not into little dogs all that much, but, but this one is just such a character.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean you give him, you give, you give him, uh, you give him a treat and he will, he will go hide it under the cushions or just does really funny things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so here she is, she's crying for her old dog and just cracking up with the new one—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's kind of a mixed—up feeling—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, she came home one day and here's this little bitty dog.  [LAUGHING].  He had all, all the, the, the seats off, seat cushions off the sofa and just, and he wasn't destructive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He just was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Burying, burying things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or rearranging things or something, but he, and he was, he was immediately on the bed with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now my, my dogs do not get on the furniture.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing like sleeping with a furry cow.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  I agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  So but, uh, so I, I don't know what it's going to take and I say to myself, I want to keep telling myself, you know this is kind of new for me, but I kept telling myself, you're only human, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're just being human.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I, I agree.  I think you're giving yourself good advice, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you're being human.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so too.  I think, I think you're being very human.  So it looks like it's going to stop.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We've got to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right.  Uh, anything else before we stop the, any questions or anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not off the top of my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we do need to set up something, don't we?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  I got us down for [DATE] if that will work for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's see.  Yes, that, uh, at—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At 3:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, is that okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because we used to do 2:00 remember?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I guess we did.  How'd we get off cycle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it was like this week we had to do 3:00 for you to, there was some sort of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Conflict.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Conflict—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and unfortunately—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's fine with me either way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you want to go back, well, next time, I guess I didn't think about that and went ahead and penciled you in.  So it'll be 3:00 next time and then would you, then you can have 2:00 or 3:00 after that whichever you prefer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What would you prefer?  Uh, what time works best for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I kind of, it's, it's no huge deal, but my, 2:00 is probably a little better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Then let me just switch that because they're both open then after this next time.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we'll make it 3:00 and, uh, on the [DATE] and then after that, change it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, go back to 2:00 again on the [DATE], yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  But it's no big deal if it doesn't happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I appreciate that, but that's just fine because like I said I don't have any conflicts on, beyond that next time.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got to get out of here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like a plan.  All right.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], if you need anything before next time, just call me, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought of bringing her up here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you're always welcome to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you've always said that, but I, but I also [INAUDIBLE], you know?  You should, you'd have to clean for a month—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To get all the dog hair and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all right.  I don't mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's really furry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bring my dog in sometimes and he sheds too.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you have?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've got a, he's a Bernese.  Have you heard of Bernese?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A mountain dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, well, now that's a hairy beast</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He is a hairy beast, he is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he sheds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I'm used to it.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take care of yourself.  You bet.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 12.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [I still think I got gypped] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gypped?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gypped [on grade] (ph)? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:00:41.4) [Trying to get myself into these situations] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're still hanging from that other one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, [you know, I'll ...] (ph) You know, I feel like it's just one more instance of injustice at this college, especially injustice directed at me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've been on (inaudible at 0:01:12) again. How do you feel there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm angry, but nothing I can do about it (inaudible). Well, this I don't think is any big thing really, you know, maybe unfair treatment, but ... You know, it's like it probably won't make any difference in my (inaudible at 0:01:45.3) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. But ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ... [I think I've been digging in the whole way for] (ph) (inaudible). And then it was ... Thursday I got really upset (inaudible) because you know, I think I told you about how ... how courses picked out for next quarter, and I had a graphic design course. I was really looking forward to that, so I went to see my advisor on Thursday and she said, "You have to get a section ticket (inaudible) the graphic arts office. So the graphic arts office, and they told me that there was a list being kept in the San Francisco Art Gallery of people and that the list had 30 people on it and they only wanted 22 in the class, so it didn't look good. [0:02:41.7]</p>

<p>And I really got annoyed because nowhere did I see anything that said "Sign up in the San Francisco Gallery," anything like that. So ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I was really on the ball. The notice was put up on the graphic arts office I guess on the eighth, I saw it on the tenth and made an appointment to see my advisor, and the second day of registration it was too late. There was this one guy I know who's seventh on the list and he signed up like two weeks ago or something, even before it was officially announced. So it was probably closed by the time it was announced. It makes me mad, but I think I'll get in (ph) if I just [make enough of a fuss] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but [it's more being] (ph) (inaudible at 0:03:47.1) when there hasn't even been any option for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. Last, last year I found out about the course, I don't know, something like the fourth week of fall quarter, you know, that's like the first time I was aware that they were even offering it. And I've been, like, very alert to the thing all year. And ... you know, so here it looked like very soon that there were going to be no problems at all. And then this (ph). [0:04:24.9]</p>

<p>I don't know, you just sort of get ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like this time, you didn't expect anything to go wrong, you kind of made the provision, and when it gets pulled out from under you under those circumstances, it's even worse.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know, I [was really] (ph) ... I don't know, disappointed and downhearted after seeing my dean and finding out all this stuff. But, you know, it was a lot that ... getting registration out of the way, have everything clean and sure and, you know, like ... next quarter is all determined, you don't have to worry about it, it's one less thing on my mind. And then just everything (ph) put it all off. Like I guess I won't know until ... there won't be any way I could find out until Monday or Wednesday of next week, you know, exactly what they're willing to do. And so it's just having this thing on my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not very ... I don't know ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of annoying to not be done with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I've sort of forgotten about it in two days. If they don't let me take it, well, they won't. I feel fairly confident that I'll get in (inaudible at 0:05:51.2). I don't know. And then I was thinking if I don't, I guess it's no great loss. Then again, it is, because then I have to take a philosophy course in something that I'm not interested in, which is a lot of what's going on. (inaudible) [0:06:23.0]</p>

<p>I don't know, [some way] (ph) I'm getting this feeling of ... just ... you know, while things haven't been exactly unpleasant for me in the last few weeks, just very, very empty. Like ... I don't know. Nothing's happening, just ... eventually I think it's, you know, if it kept on like this it could get very, very boring and not (inaudible at 0:07:08.9) at all, just doing it. Really boring.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's not even ... like in a way, it's just flat (ph), it's just going along and like, yeah, there isn't anything BAD happening, but there isn't anything GOOD happening either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's no kind of breakthrough excitement in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ... I don't even know if there needs to be excitement if I had like routine ... if I liked the situation I was in, that would be all right, even if it wasn't exciting. But it just seems to go on and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you [aren't bothered] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... every day you get up and just sort of bore your way through the day. And ... nothing stimulating is happening. [0:08:05.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Life just being very routine [and everything] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. Not interesting. You know, routine-ness and boredom is acceptable under certain circumstances, like in a job [or something] (ph). I could just sort of tell myself that it's only ... it's only eight hours of the day, I still have 16 and besides which they're giving me $22 for those eight hours. But this ... I mean like this is my whole life that's (inaudible at 0:08:51.7). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's no [break from it] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can't kind of say to yourself, "Well, this will be over."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I would just really like to be able to sit down and concentrate on something. At this point it would be on (inaudible at 0:09:32.8). You know, I really want to be able to sit down and get into it and not think about getting something from the (inaudible at 0:09:41.6) or listening to the radio. It's like I can only do that for a few hours at a time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just to get real involved in something (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Mmm hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say, "for a few hours at a time," does that mean ... what do you mean, you can't do that at all now or you can't do it for [what kind of] (ph) length of time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I can't do it at all. I haven't yet. I'm convinced that I will do it, you know, get into it some, but I just don't know, you know, like whether ... I don't think I'm really going to be getting into it. It's more like it's going to be a chore that I'm going to have to constantly force myself to keep at, rather than getting into it and just doing it. [0:10:31.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to keep on being a struggle. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, I don't doubt that I'll start it sometime, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's the way that you're going to do it once you're into it, that's bothering you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's ... that's probably it. Yeah. It's also I just want to get into it now, [so it's ... I don't know] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And instead, what's happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I keep on coming up with little reasons why I don't have to start immediately, and, you know, just keep on pushing it back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to get it done, you say, but you keep on finding excuses not to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm. Pushing it back. (inaudible at 0:11:434) just make up my mind not to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, make up my mind some way out, you know, like [if I] (ph) I mean REALLY make up my mind and say, "Well, I'm not going to do this." Then after that, if I say, "Well why don't you do it?" I can give myself the reason, "Well, it's too late. I've made up my mind," as if were actually too late. As if it were no longer within my control. [0:12:20.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... yeah. You know, I just say that ... well ... it works in the sense that like when I make up my mind to get an R (ph) or something like that, take an R (ph) ... when, you know, when I really make up my mind, I can give myself all these good reasons why I can (ph), but I mean why I shouldn't take the R (ph) but I just say that, "Well, my mind is made up, and no more thinking about it because I've been through all that before." And so it takes all the pressure off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It keeps you from having to go over that thing and keep on making a choice in your mind. And keep on telling yourself different things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And just go over it once and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And close that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean my attitude here today is [I just don't feel good] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel good, how do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I ... I just sort of feel like coming here and talking for an hour and getting out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is it ... I mean, is it uncomfortable? Is it ... is it just feeling awkward or preoccupied with other things or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's just ... I'm feeling awkward and preoccupied and ... [0:14:12.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Preoccupied with ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worrying about school. I don't know. I just sort of ... rather than, like, than struggling with problems here, I just sort of have come here with the idea that I'm just going to come in here and talk about anything, and I really don't care at all. And just until my time is up and get out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel that I had an appointment so I have to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't really want to be here. You don't really want to be talking about any of this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or there isn't anything that you do really want to be talking about here today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's probably it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I'm just feeling in a pretty ugly mood sort of thing. I could go home and go to sleep, take a bath or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like this is a chore [you resent] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:15:43.6) I don't know, I may have been developing this attitude as we go along. This may not be just, you know, (inaudible), you know, [a quirk] (ph). I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How come you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why do I think what, that I may have been developing ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that you might be developing ... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't accept the idea of a quirk, so (ph) I guess ... you know, like I don't accept that it would have been acceptable for me to call up and say, "I don't feel like coming in today," you know? "I'll see you Wednesday." [0:16:30.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh it would have been if you hadn't called ... if you had called more than five minutes in advance or something like that. It would have been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean if I had called?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, like I have ... I mean, of course even if you'd called five minutes in advance and you said you didn't want to come, I'd say, "Okay," I would mind it more then because it would be more of an inconvenience because I would have been expecting you. But ... to me that seems okay if you did that. You know you ... because it ... you didn't know that or you don't really want to take advantage of that option?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... I didn't really know it and ... um ... I don't know how much I accept that option as being ... as being real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Real?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, just how acceptable is it? Like, suppose today I would say that, you know, "Well, why don't I skip next Wednesday and [just come] (ph) next Friday and sort of give me a little rest or something?" I don't know that that's ... that I really see that as acceptable. Sort of because I have this schedule set up ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Acceptable to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah ... and I'm always thinking in terms of schedules, like I have class schedules and I have schedule here. [0:18:08.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a schedule here and if you break the schedule here, then ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:18:10.9) or something, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what it is about THAT that's strange?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... about missing a class?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean what is it the same thing? [Sad that you had to change it] (ph)? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've sort of undertaken an obligation or ... there's sort of a contract between students and the teacher, like for everybody to show up because if everybody just missed all the time, [the class is much smaller] (ph) (inaudible at 0:19:05.4). Or it might be more appropriate to call in like a seminar or something like where you just have maybe eight people and the professor or something, a small group where absence [is more of a big deal] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've got some kind of obligation to the other person. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I just sort of ... I just sort of feel like, you know, 4:15 Friday is part of the schedule. And ... you know ... suppose I don't feel like coming here, but that doesn't mean YOU don't. It's sort of like ... it's sort of inconveniencing you and it doesn't seem proper or something. [0:20:06.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem proper?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Proper. I don't know, if it had been established on the basis of less of a schedule, you know, by now, I've really gotten used to the idea of 11:00 and 3:15 . And if it had been established like on somewhat of a more flexible arrangement instead of like ... I don't know, it just seemed like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those were the only two possibilities.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not only was it the only two possibilities, but it was always (ph) like ... we sort of have to keep the thing moving. Like you say [you've known most of the people] (ph) twice a week and so if I'd only wanted to come once a week, it sort of would have obligated you to twice as much time in a way, you know, like ... span. The 20 sessions ... as opposed to 10 weeks, it would be 20 weeks. You know, so I sort of feel like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, so you mean it's like if you ... you mean, like when I said that choice, that was a choice [in my head] (ph) where compressing the amount of time it took even though that's more time per week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not necessarily for compressing, but at least planning on it where ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you had not wanted that or if you break that up (inaudible), then it's like, what, going against what you think I wanted? [0:22:09.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not only you but ... you know, the whole, like organization and structure, you know, like they probably have plans for everything somewhat (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, well, I know they must have some sort of plans because when I signed up, they said I could have 20 sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you wanted (inaudible at 0:22:40.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. So ... I figured there is a time that's entering into it somehow and that by missing one here it sort of like makes the whole thing longer and you know, after the 10 weeks, assuming two sessions a week, it sort of starts pushing into other things that you might have planned for after those 10 weeks. I don't know, it's sort of like you're doing me a favor and for me to say, "I don't feel like going today," is sort of ... I don't know </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ungrateful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... sort of like looking ... yeah, ungrateful, looking a gift horse in the mouth, like ungrateful, ungrateful thing to do. It's kind of a funny way to look at this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's how ... what fits, like your view of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose. [0:24:05.2]</p>

<p>Yeah. I just think that's the way I've been brought up. If someone's doing ... more or less doing you a favor, or you keep appointments, and I just sort of understood that I had an appointment and unless ... you know, unless you really can't, that you should keep them. And not wanting to is not really "can't." You know, like if you make an appointment for the optometrist and you just don't want to go, that day is nice or something like that outside, not wanting to is not an acceptable reason, or at least isn't, you know, with my parents. It isn't [in view of] (ph) that's the way I was brought up. [It isn't acceptable] (ph). So that's sort of how I view this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, deep down in some kind of, I think in some kind of way, in certain ways I see it. I think you've raised a lot of issues. There's some differences though, like from not going to the optometristt because it's a nice day [in my point of view] (ph). But what I'm really surprised to hear you say is that it really didn't even seem like an option to you to say, now that you'd want to come Wednesday, like that [type thinking] (ph) very fair to me. And that doesn't involve me at all [in that] (ph). But ... the other thing that's different about therapy in my point of view is that it doesn't make sense ... therapy is different from the optometrist in that the optometrist can do the things to your eyes whether you want them done or not, whether ... unless you're struggling, you know, physically. But ... but it's like ... unless ... he can do different things. But, you know, generally, he can do [a few] (ph). But like therapy isn't a thing like doing it to someone, in my eyes, and it doesn't make any kind of sense if you're coming in when you don't just kind of ... treading water ... I mean, if it seems to you like it's just a day when all you can be able to do is tread water. [0:26:41.1]</p>

<p>Now if that raises an issue on the other side, of course, like if it's ... on the other hand, you know, sometimes you have to work on getting out and treading water, sometimes that's the thing to do. But not always. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know it's just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was thinking if I buy in on [going to see] (ph) some guy down in the Loop somewhere in this [oak paneled] (ph) office and just ... you go in there and you make ... he says, "I'm going to see you every Monday afternoon at 1:00," I'll bet you even if you call him up a month in advance and tell him, "I don't want this," he's going to get upset, [pulling his hair] (ph) and say, "Well you're going to have to pay anyhow."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if you like that or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do I like what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The oak paneled (inaudible) paneled office view of things. Do you endorse that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but that's just sort of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way it's supposed to be. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's just sort of the way I'm used to things being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the way it's supposed to be ... like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's the way I'm used to things being. I don't ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean to you? Okay, it's familiar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not making any judgments. It's familiar, that's the way the system is and you know, I've sort of adapted to that kind of system. [0:28:01.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if I tell you that that system ... that assuming that system isn't the system that I assume, what does it do? How do you react to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... well, it's nice. I don't know ... I can't just throw it out, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't just throw it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Throw out the old system. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't just stop acting then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It would, like, take an effort on my part and ... you know, like there's a first step to be made, like I suppose once I did something ... you know, doing the first thing in your system that would differ from what I'd do under the other system, the first thing is the hardest, I think. And after that, I [might be a little] (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not being able to do it, is that a matter of just, you know, like it's not done. It's just not done. Or is it worrying whether or ... also worrying about whether I'm telling the truth and whether I would (inaudible at 0:29:15.7) [of that] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... well, if you would be pissed off as they would only be because it's not ... it's not done, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like you're part of the thing or the real world and everything too, and in the real world, it's just not done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, actually what I meant was well, do you believe me when I say actually, certainly at least arranged in advance kind of things like that are not a hassle to me. Or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not entirely, because if I were in your shoes, I think that would be a hassle. I'm not ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I could sort of see someone having ... having like ... I .. I </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's fairer to say "a very slight hassle." I mean sure, you know, every time you have to change a little thing in a way it gets erased and ... you know, I mean compared to the other things [that I would be] (ph) in favor of ... (inaudible), it doesn't seem like it counts for much. That hassle is very slight compared to the advantage (inaudible) [0:30:45.2]</p>

<p>But you're reluctant to that kind of testing that particular norm and whether it's really there or not [going in] (ph). Like you don't know if you want to strain our relationship in that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, I was just thinking before that I could conceive of a person being of such an (inaudible at 0:31:18.9) or something that, you know, you could call them up at like quarter after four and say, "Hey, you know, don't feel like coming in today," and the person saying, "Okay, fine," and like it wouldn't bother them at all. I mean I can certainly construct a sort of person in my mind. And I could sort of see how it could be ... could happen, but I don't think that could ever be me. Or at least ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't be the person that says, "Okay fine"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I couldn't be that. Maybe I could, but I'm not that person now. And I think it would be a swell thing to be, you know, like just to take everything I'm feeling in stride and not get bothered by it. [0:32:09.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there are all these medium light bulbs in between too, like the kind of level I'm talking about where something might be some kind of slight hassle, but there are other things on the other side that definitely adds up to, you know, to this "okay." Do you see those middle alternatives as any kind of thing that you'd be willing to risk, or is it just that you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... I think they're good ideas. I don't know what you mean by (inaudible at 0:32:44.9). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well like in a way ... like if you can conceive of a person who would say, "Okay, fine," and mean it, and all they would feel is "okay, fine," with them it wouldn't be a hassle to call them up and say, "Well I'm not coming." Not only would it not be a hassle, (inaudible) maybe it would, you wouldn't feel funny about it. What about to the ... you know, there are a lot of ranges in between saying, "No, you can't come in to my oak-paneled office again" and saying "It's okay, fine."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like ... see, so in a way, I'm saying, "Are you ... can you imagine yourself taking a risk on something like that? Like if you weren't sure that it would be absolutely "Okay, fine," but can you imagine ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it all depends on where I think it is. If I think it's very likely that it's going to be the "oak paneled" situation, I don't know if I'd take the risk. [0:34:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about mixtures, like ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, sometimes I'll have a mixture that had mostly "oak paneled" situations. I sort of need maybe more of an idea that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if the person would come down hard on you, was that what it would mean? They'd say, "Don't ... no you can't do that," or shame you in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, shame me. ["What an ingrate"] (ph) "I've got to listen to his boring talk for an hour and I'm only getting $23 for this, you know, I'm tired because I've heard seven people before. What an ingrate."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he should be glad he's not coming then. [What do you mean?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's getting ... you know he's making $550 a day or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Well what do you want to say to that person, or those type of people? What's your ... if they say that to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it depends on, you know, what would motivate me to go to them, what I would say [in the situation] (ph). If I were really desperate, I might think he was right and say, "Boy, you know, I really overstepped my bounds," in answer to that (ph). But ... you know in another way, I could [just sort of say, "To hell with him, then, I've got no more need for this person because he's hard-headed about something like that."] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's ... well, like here, I guess you're operating on the notion maybe I'm going to react like that, [something like that, do that sort of thing.] (ph). Or there's a chance that I might sometimes change (ph), but you're not willing to ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way I've been operating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So you aren't willing to fight (ph). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I haven't been because I haven't talked about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well what would you want ... [0:36:33.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just sort of assumed until I'm told otherwise that I'm operating in the system that I've been brought up in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you feel about that ... that assumed system [played back and forth] (ph)? Does that seem okay to you? Does it bother you slightly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It bothers me quite a bit, but there's nothing I can do about it because nine out of every ten people or more operate [in this] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What bothers you about it is ... is what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't ...it doesn't (inaudible at 0:37:25.6) bureaucratize or something, it doesn't take people into account, because people, just ... you know, [makes your life consistent] (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'd really like to say for you by thinking your mood (ph) has been taken into account on whether you want to come today isn't take into account enough. Those things don't matter. It's like there's a general rule. Period.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It's sort of a ... simple view, thinking that it's a general rule so it's [a simple view of how things work] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaning a kind of stupid view. Over simple. [0:38:31.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, it's like making a model of some system or something and you know, the more complex your model is, the more accurately it predicts things. That would just be very, very ... coarse prediction, you know, very rough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, so how does it seem to you when you think you're having a ... a kind of coarse prediction just laid on you, a coarse model or just a general thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't seem to be able to ... I don't think it would help to make a big fuss. I can't change it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, well okay, so there's a thing I'm saying it's not worth solving, but do you resent it or anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean a crude system that doesn't take you into account?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Yeah, I mean I resent it, and it frustrates me and I believe that there's nothing I can do to make it any different, and so I wouldn't try, wouldn't try to change anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wouldn't try to change anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, wouldn't try to change anything [in the system, you know] (ph) because it's too big.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now are you talking about the system in general or this therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was talking about the system that ... I'm talking about [at least] (ph) the aspect of a big system like this, you have to go on appointments. [0:40:09.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the social aspect. How it's structured socially. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:40:23.5) but it's not therapy, it's just ... the way the system of how social relations are conducted in this country and culture, this world of western society.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the part that I'm talking about is [just, you go to] (ph) appointments. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Period. Like cancellations aren't allowed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only in cases of emergencies and ... and I just ... I don't like the way ... the way that's handled. You know, I can't do anything about it. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the way it's handled is what? That if you do something like try to cancel an appointment when there wasn't a dire emergency, what is it ... what is the thing that keeps you from doing that? What kind of consequences do you see?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, um ... just violating some sort of tacit agreement. Something like that. [0:42:27.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And ... and therefore ... what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being ... I don't know, an unworthy person. Something like that. Just not fitting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not fitting and not belonging. Sort of like if the person who I treated like that would ever be in a position to help me, he'd say, "Oh no, because he kind of abused ... took advantage of my goodwill before." I don't know, I think the system falls down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Falls down on what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I'm getting more sensitive to exactly what I'm talking about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I was going to say ... ask you if that's the kind of thing that you think about specifically in relation to me, you know, this therapy and not wanting to come. That if you didn't, that then I'd refuse (inaudible at 0:43:53.0) Not only would I [resent it] (ph) ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It could be. It could be. It could be like that you'd resent it and it would just ... I think like the ... like there are a lot of questions in your mind, doubts in your mind, something like that as to what I'm doing here. And ... I just don't ... I somehow don't feel quite ... quite like I fit in therapy. [0:44:56.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I didn't just say just that you don't feel comfortable, that something about how you think you're going to be viewed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, what place do I have here, you know, sort of like keeping someone who really belongs here who's down on the waiting list out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now is that something that you think, or is that something you think I think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I think it, and because I think it, I think you think it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, you have your doubts about whether you have any kind of RIGHT to be here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's pretty close [whether I have the] (ph) right to be here. And ... and ... since it's not too clear to me at all that I have any right to be here and if it's not clear to me, I don't see how YOU would be aware that I have a right to be here. And I just sort of think that you ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me what you mean a little more by "right" and then (inaudible) [0:46:40.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ... just sort of that I don't belong here. Whatever I'm looking for is not to be found in counseling. Or maybe ... maybe I shouldn't be looking for anything [from life] (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe your life is about the best [you can expect] (ph). Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe there's nothing abnormal about it or ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you really believed that, would it make a difference to how you feel about [your life] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I really believed it ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or would still feel unhappy and like you're missing something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, um ... I would still feel like I was missing something in my life. Ah well, there are people ... you know, like my girlfriend, she says something that about I don't belong, I don't need it, that's what she said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does she mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think she means? [0:48:27.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not neurotic or whatever. I just don't need it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No I really don't know what that means.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Counseling center is for people who have psychological problems or something. And I don't need it. I don't know. It's just something ... she was talking to someone I know and this other person said, you know, like, was surprised that I was coming here and she said something like, "Oh, he's one of the sanest people I know."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just felt that she didn't know what she was talking about, you know, saying that I was one of the sanest people she knew. Either that or she has a lot of really crazy friends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't really feel that put together inside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't. I don't know, she ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really didn't bother me when she said that because I knew her first year and then she left the city for a few years so she really didn't have any basis for saying that. It was probably more, you know, an image [or something] (ph) that she carries with her. Something like that. The thing about really [composed or] (ph) (inaudible). [0:50:27.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A kind of [out-of-stock] (ph) picture [of you] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you know, particularly like it was probably formed three years ago and just sort of carried along for three years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And very rigid. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, without changing because I wasn't around to change it. I don't know, so things like that, and my own doubts and my parents say, "You're all right. There's nothing wrong with you." Just all ... and the fact that I seem to have such a difficult time, because I really feel like ... that I strain [a lot] (ph) here. All lead me to believe that maybe I don't belong here. I'm just so ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... doing it out of boredom or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, well, it's a different thing than sitting in your apartment kind of boredom?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure ... well, not different thing than sitting in my apartment but just out of, you know, a big boredom with everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is it that you see about wrong with it ... being wrong with that motive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Coming here because I'm bored?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't consider that a psychological problem or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... this place is here, you know, this place is here for people with psychological problems and it doesn't ... I don't think you attempt to tie this all with boredom. Like this is the wrong place if I'm looking for ... [0:52:47.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of level of solution do you see as being a solution to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To boredom?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean what kind of level? Like accepting it or ... accepting it is one kind of solution or doing something you're really interested in is another kind?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I mean ... yeah, you say, "Well, it's not a psychological problem," well, what is it in your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like a condition of life, sort of. It's something that would be solved by changing the circumstances of my life, like moving from Boston [real fast] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, now I feel like I'm getting lost. Maybe I should try to formulate what I think about this thing, if you think ... do you think you kind of have it out the way (inaudible at 0:53:54.2)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much. I think so. I don't know the (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So I've got to kind of think] (ph) (inaudible) [different things] (ph). [0:54:20.6]</p>

<p>And this isn't going to be a super-coherent answer, so you should stop me when you don't understand. One (inaudible) is that ... I guess I really don't see it the way you do, like it doesn't even ... this thing about therapy and right and deserving ... at all. I think how I see it or what I do, what I do is NOT try to sort whether there are unhealthy things about (inaudible at 0:55:09.5) as opposed to healthy ones and see what the ratio is and come up with a decision [about whether they should be in therapy or not] (ph). I don't make that kind of assessment at all. What I do ... and in a way, I think that's what you're doing to yourself. You're trying to check, I mean "Is this reasonable? Are there more reasonable things about the way I'm acting than unreasonable ones? Does that add up to a ratio such that I should be here or not?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I am going from ... in a way, that's not exactly a question I ask myself, I guess. I guess I take your definition of yourself, [that way] (ph) ... I take your ... you're saying that it doesn't feel that way to you, that it doesn't feel to you like you're all together put together, as legitimate, and go from there. And what I do from there isn't say ... is to ... So that's that. Do you understand that? I guess (inaudible) [0:56:35.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I understand what you're saying, but I don't know what I really believe, because I don't think like ... like this is a place where people come when they're unhappy, or that ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of feel like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to say why else people come to therapy. I mean, it's hard to say. It's hard to say what else people that come to therapy have in general between all of them. (inaudible at 0:57:07.5) That's ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I just sort of think of this tape recorder going now, and how ... like sometimes, if there's always tape recorders going when people have therapy, you get a bunch of tapes from a psychological viewpoint interesting sessions. And then there are probably those sessions which from a psychological viewpoint are very, very ... like absolutely nothing. And I think that all my sessions just ... from a psychological viewpoint just are very ... there's nothing ... nothing psych ... no psychology in them. It's just that ... [0:58:10.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by "psychology"? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, that I don't ... that I ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somebody's theories about the way the human mind functions. I don't care which theories you use, you know, some sort of ... not hypothesis, but you know ... structure or system or something that you're working under ... I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean me? Or you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You. Any therapist. I don't mean that they all ... I mean just the fact that (inaudible) therapy I guess there's some sort of structure, science or (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's ... and some values and [things like that] (ph). And I just think that ... I understand what you're saying when you say that that's like pretty much like being unhappy is one thing people who come to therapy have in common. But I feel very (inaudible at 0:59:41.5) not necessarily sufficient reason for being here. You know, it's ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not by itself. They all have it in common, but it's not really ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well ... it's hard for me to talk about that question which I guess is something like who do I consider is worth having therapy, (inaudible) therapy because I've never done it that way. I've never really operated with that kind of criterion, with a criterion like that, like ... [1:00:28.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel that there were criterion applied to me when I came here and had you know, my first interviewer or something [was John Trevor] (ph) or something like that, that you know, if I had said certain things, or behaved in a certain way, I might have gotten a therapist sooner or I might have, you know ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you had acted more ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Crazy or whatever (inaudible at 1:01:01.9) or if I ... my problems had been of a different nature like if probably, I don't know ... I don't know how it would sound (ph) but I'm just assuming that it affected my assignment to a therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that that's ... so you're kind of thinking, the fact that you had to wait for two months or so that you had to wait, is a judgment about ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not ... no, partially it's my assignment to you as opposed to ... I don't know much about your background ... but as opposed to some 50-year-old gray-haired man with a beard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'll tell you one reason you didn't get assigned to a 50-year-old gray-haired man with a beard is that there isn't one at the counseling center!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, what you mean ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of thought that there was a formal (ph) waiting list so that actually, the time I waited I was reassured ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...by the fact that I was getting it so quick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That the center thought you deserved me, that kind of thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The fact that I didn't have to wait as long as I was expecting to have to wait. [1:02:13.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It made you think maybe you ... maybe it was okay for you to come to therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe. And I'm sure ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are the doubts like in your mind or are the doubts about what you think the center thinks about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I have the doubts in my own mind, and because I doubt myself, I think that everyone must, or something in regards to [this matter] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had one more thing I wanted to say. I've got to stop (inaudible at 1:02:52.3) The other thing which I (inaudible). You say one of the things that makes you worry about whether you should be here is that it's difficult for you to talk, difficult for you to organize and structure what you're saying and lots of times you don't know what you want to get a hold of at all and you can't ... difficult. That makes you think maybe you shouldn't be here. But (inaudible) like ... that really surprises me. From my point of view, it's like if you can do it, that's probably when you don't have [most of these problems] (ph). Once you can get hold of things and structure (inaudible) in a way that (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ... yeah, structure ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But even ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that one kind of way ... one kind of problem that some people have is (inaudible) I hate this thing about keeping (inaudible) legitimate problem because it doesn't really fit with my viewpoint very much. But it's like, okay, one ... we'll just understand what we mean by that and no implications whatever the reference was ... that it's perfectly legitimate for somebody not to be able to get hold of things (inaudible) difficulty in getting into their problems. Like that's ... that doesn't say to me that someone doesn't have a problem. That says to me, more likely, like they have problems, and they also have an additional problem of not being able to approach it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of that? [1:04:58.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) [I mean ...] (ph) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it make a difference ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's accessible (ph) to me. Can't really tell. You know, I can't just ... I can't just sit here and say it's changed my outlook </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would still have to, you know, live with it for a few days. You know, maybe I'll have a better idea by Wednesday or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm not sure if I completely (inaudible). I'll have to think about it too [and make sure] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: By the end of these sessions, if I seem to be on to something (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that's just a function of (inaudible at 1:05:39.9) an hour and a half instead of an hour? Or do you think that it's a function of this whole kind of getting into something, it's more like ... a function of nearness to the end than not having spent more? [1:06:02.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um ... hard to tell. I think that you know, more might be gotten if there were an hour and 15 minutes or an hour and a half. But then again, I might [dread them more] (ph), the thought of, you know, I'm kind of treading water for an hour and a half, not just an hour. I might have a harder time [facing coming here] (ph) if it were any longer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there are also kind of sense ... I guess the thing that [I'm seeing] (ph) now is the sense of being cut off and like maybe that solution that I just threw out now [if it's a] (ph) solution that's viable because it prevents another problem for you. Like that treading ... like all that time, but ... but there's other issues like now, like now we're going to stop and like [you told me] (ph) a good place that we've gotten to (inaudible at 1:07:05.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know that ... I think I might (inaudible) I might not exactly remember it, you know, specifically, like all the details (inaudible) but I think I ... which is probably make some sort of impression (inaudible) so ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's some kind of sense that you lose (ph) something, [that you get] (ph) cut off and can't get right back to (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, before we got to the end. That's partially ... that sort of bothers me in that ... being treated just like exactly ... exactly 9:00 to exactly 10:00, [like this is some chump] (ph). That sort of bothers me. But I've got to accept that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That thing ... well, on what (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not being chump, but I mean just the fact that, you know, you do have other things to do and ... [1:08:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is that the kind of accepting like the kind of accepting of the "oak paneled" situation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, this is something you know which I was [so strongly against] (ph) in the beginning. I sort of think there's a logic behind it now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You mean that makes more sense to you] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There were a couple things that really bothered me, like that sort of does make me feel like being a chump. It doesn't make me feel like being an individual and a human being. But ... it's sort of funny how I resented that but didn't exactly resent not being able to call up and say [I didn't want to] (ph) come in, which treats me as ... doing that is an affirmation of my being [a human] (ph) instead of just a chump.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, could you just re-phrase (ph) ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, um ... I resented being thought of like a statistic in that my time began at 9:00 promptly and ended at 10:00 promptly, regardless of whether or not anything good was going on or not. And I resented that. It made me feel like a statistic. However I accepted the obligation I felt that I always had to show up for every session and I couldn't call up and excuse myself the day before or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that to say kind of that you kept on putting yourself in that position or you let that happen [in a way] (ph) ... there were ways in which you didn't resent that were just as there were some things that made you a statistic, you felt like that, but you didn't resent and others that you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where do you think it comes ... do you have a sense of what's going on in that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are some things getting flipped (ph) around. Maybe I'll ... maybe I will accept being able to call up and cancel out. And maybe I'll [start to resent] (ph) ending promptly in an hour. I don't know, (inaudible at 1:10:33.4) an hour up 'til now because I don't know, hour and seven minutes, and that like even allows for the fact that I was 10 minutes late. So ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So ... what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tend to notice that if we're talking and have a good discussion going or something, then it generally doesn't stop at exactly (inaudible) so that all tends to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like to talk about the (inaudible at 1:11:00.6) again, because there is also some things like the convenience [is one thing] (ph) but there are other considerations that I have. On Wednesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether I (inaudible) vacation or not. And if I do, I'm going to be gone on Friday (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we can (inaudible) Wednesday and you could know by ... you could just call in between [and just] (ph) make an appointment on Wednesday if you don't know by Wednesday and then if you need to call up (inaudible). You could try calling here. I'm here a lot but (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. [1:12:26.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then (inaudible). </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It will probably be good if we try to ... try to make up my mind (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you don't ... I mean, unfortunately I have to take (inaudible) I (inaudible) and so you know either way (inaudible). You can decide.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye.</p>

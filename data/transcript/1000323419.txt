<p>PATIENT:  Because of yesterday, being late, I wanted to ask what should I do if I am late and I haven't called.  If something happened.  For instance, if you know, if the subway were delayed and I was 5 minutes late or something of that nature.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How do you mean, what should you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well, I noticed that they were all leaving and there's no way to let you know that I'm here or you know, coming or anything.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Oh, well, I'll look out for you if they leave.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Something that I didn't say yesterday which wasn't in my mind at the time but I remembered it afterwards, uhm, in regard to the way I felt, uhm, after Wednesday, Tuesday I guess it was.  I used to have that same kind of feeling a lot of times.  I don't know how old I was again, I must have been at least over 6 but I can just remember night after night either being unable to sleep or waking up having been asleep for a while and just having awful pains and at the time I used to always think well, I must have appendicitis and, and I would go to my mother and have to be reassured time and again that what I had, couldn't be appendicitis and then I'd be able to go back to bed and eventually go to sleep.  But the way I felt on Tuesday, I guess, reminded me very much of that same type of feeling that I used to have a long time ago.  And I, I can't remember how many times it would happen, but I just, the impression I have now is that it used to happen all the time.  And also I used to think, either because I was led to believe this or I did on my own, that I ate too much or I ate too fast, and that's what made me feel the way I did.  But I can eat a lot now (chuckle) and nothing happens, so I don't know whether that was it.  And the other thing that happened which again didn't occur to me but perhaps I just didn't want to talk about it yesterday, was when my husband came home Tuesday night and I was feeling so awful, just physically, and I wasn't aware that I felt in any other way awful, except not being happy, that I felt physically ill, but then I just started to cry uncontrollably and uhm I guess I was just all upset, and I think it's something that, I think I mentioned that I was afraid of crying here, and I, I just don't want to.  I think I'm, I suppose I feel embarrassed and again it's an immature thing to do, and, that I should have to control so I wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   As though you were in the presence of your father.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know, I don't (pause) it's just the way I felt in the presence of anybody except my (chuckle) husband.  I don't mind crying in front of him.  In fact, at times I'm sure I've cried to make him agree with me on something that I want and he, he so far has disagreed with, but I've always felt with other people, and I suppose it goes back to my parents and how controlled they were.  And they never, except for my father's rages, they wouldn't show emotion.  They wouldn't show affectionate emotion anyway.  And my mother didn't show any emotion as far as I can recall when I was little, that I began to learn that you just don't show emotion to other people.  And sometimes in a friendship, this has made it very difficult for me, if I was fond of somebody and wanted to show them, I wouldn't know how without feeling really oafish.  In fact, I guess I always felt kind of oafish, as if I'm, I, I'm, there are so many people bigger than me, but I've always felt as if I'm I was sort of a big person that has absolutely no muscular control and, that I'm, you know, that I can't move well and control my body when I come into a room and things like that.  And I know I did have trouble again when I was growing up and I was having the uhm therapy because of my knees, uhm, and I guess I had to have something done to my arches on my feet too, so I had to wear these things in my shoes and this meant I had to have larger sizes and my feet were big enough as it was but with these larger shoes I just seemed to always be tripping all over them, so whenever in class I'd have to go to the blackboard, I'd end up (chuckle) tripping around going to the blackboard and this was just another thing that made me always feel as if I stood out as this big oafish thing.  That, and I, I still was for a while was heavy and having glasses and my mother never did much about the way she dressed us and she didn't really have any interest so we were, we had clothes that were neat and clean and all, but they certainly weren't that becoming to us.  In fact, I once saw a photograph of me in I think it was the 6th grade and I couldn't believe it.  I was just so badly dressed as far as having a thing, clothes fit me and looking, you know, sort of not really stylish but just becoming.  And I imagine all this contributed to the way I felt about how I must appear.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I became very neat about my person when I lost some weight and I never was aware of how very neat, because I just thought I was trying to look like other people, but I guess some comment was made to me in 8th grade or something, about how I'd looked, how she always admired the way I looked because I was so very neat and clean looking and another time somebody commented on the way both my older sister and I kept our hair and how we never had a hair out of place and these were things that just didn't occur to me because I thought (chuckle) I was barely managing to look as neat and attractive as other people.  But now I know I have a real compulsion about keeping my hair, and that's well, it took me a long time before I could even grow it, I have my hair long, and it's I, I cut it again but for a long time I couldn't grow it long because it would just sort of blow around and I couldn't stand that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And now too, the it's almost as if that type of attitude toward the way I must look that I had when I finally lost weight back in junior high school has come back again.  Teaching where I am the appearance a person has is held extremely important by the headmaster and I don't think I have the kind of clothes that a lot of the people do there and I don't have the sense for clothes that a lot of them do and, and so again, I just try to dress the best I can, and then I concentrate everything on my hair again and I don't like the way I have it but (chuckle) I don't know what to do about, and I just feel as if I am almost a prisoner to it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I can say I keep experimenting with new hair styles and then some, thinking that well, now I'll find one that I can just let it go naturally and then I'll start doing things to it until I'm not feeling at all happy about it and I blame it on the hair style and then I'll try another one and that will happen for a while and then I'll get too compulsive about it and so then I'll be unhappy with it and I'll charge it again and it just doesn't seem to end.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny too, because sometimes when e's just going to the office and things like that, he'll comb his in such a way that I don't really think is that attractive and he has it all slipped down in place and then I'll be very critical of him for doing that and he says well, I have to keep it this way because I can't look like I just blew in.  And really, he's kind of reacting in the same way I guess as I am but I, I, I always am extremely critical of him when he's doing it.  (5-Minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of the girl that was, had left school yesterday and she I guess has had some kind of nervous breakdown before and people think maybe this is what's happening to her this time.  But she went home last night and I don't know what type of relationship she has with her father, except I've heard that whatever it is, it's a very unhappy one.  Some things very wrong in it and so I was surprised today to learn that it would be her father meeting her, and she went home by plane.  And I was just imagining what kind of reception she would get from him and I suppose in a way I was relating it back to if this ever happened to me what kind of reception I would get from mine.  And I think in a way how courageous she was.  I'm not sure that I could go home and face mine.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What reception did you imagine?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, it was just kind of vague.  I was more doing it as picturing her being met and I don't know, it, you know, it hadn't really formed.  It was, I was just kind of amazed that she could even think about doing that.  I just, I guess would assume she'd have an awful reception (chuckle) from her father.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Quiet literally an unthinkable one.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes, I guess so (chuckle).  Although, I don't think (chuckle) my father is really that bad.  I'm sure if something had happened then he would have been very nice about it.  He wouldn't have known what to do, I think that would be it.  He would have just been very awkward and would have gotten out of there as fast as he could and turned it over to my mother.  One thing that does disturb me very much now that both my parents do, but he more than my mother, and what made me think of this is just what his reaction might be if he knew I were having any kind of psychiatric help, and that is that he's con--, not constantly, but every once in a while now, he brings up different things that have happened to children of friends and many of their friends have had real problems with their children or at least problems that have been faced and acknowledged, and in all of their circle of friends we are held as being the model children and the successfully brought up children and they are the model parents and so then he will keep asking if we, what do I think, did you know, don't I think that they did the right thing and were they ever too strict with us, and don't I think it was good that they were strict with us the way they were and.  There were certain things that they did that I think were very good and I appreciate but then, I suppose I blame them very much for things that make me feel incapable of living the way I want to live and so then I feel if I answer him honestly, I can't answer him in a way he wants to hear and is it fair to him to upset him that much, because at this point he can't do anything and on the other hand I feel I can't lie and in a way I don't want to.  In a way I almost want to hurt him because he's giving me my chance now.  And then I end up feeling very upset and then I don't know what to say (chuckle) and I'll sort of give some kind of a stupid noncommittal answer and, and usually get very moody right after that which of course they don't understand and, I don't know, he just gets so easily hurt if you indicate at all you think anything they did wasn't exactly perfect.  Once my younger sister who had been taking care of children during the summer at a beach, you know, she stayed with one family, and she had seen how they were being brought up which was, sounded a very confusing way and obviously not the best thing for children, and, but it might just have been circumstances during the summer, it was awfully hard to tell.  But anyway, she wrote to my parents then that this made her really appreciate how we'd been brought up and she thought it was all wonderful.  And of course, she went way overboard and praising everything about the way we were brought up, which she doesn't really feel, at least I know she doesn't now because we've talked about some of the aspects of our upbringing that she's also very upset at.  But of course, my father just brings this up all the time too and you know, kind of gets tears in his eyes about this wonderful comment made by his daughter, it just makes me very angry when that happens.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think my mother is more aware and she, she of course likes to hear praise about what she did, but because I think she honestly was trying very hard to be even and consistent and do the right thing for us in a way my father just doesn't even realize you should do.  And I don't know how she feels about us individually, but I know once she commented to a friend of hers, the mother of the girl I ostracized, and she once told this woman who is an extremely affectionate type, too much so to me now but at the time when I was growing up I was very fond of this woman because I thought, you know, here was the affection that I wanted from my mother and I couldn't get it and my mother did say that she was just incapable of giving me affection the way she knew I needed.  Oh no, I, I think the woman told me this years later, and I think it helped in a way for me to understand my mother a little bit more, or at least accept that this is the way it is and what happened in our relationship because we had an awful relationship for a while and actually I wouldn't want my mother as this woman is.  This woman is, Mrs. HWR, and I wouldn't want her as Mrs. HWR either, because she is almost too much outgoing and affectionate and everything wonderful and so forth.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But there were times when I just needed somebody to really warmly respond to the fact that I was there.  I'd come into a room and I was alive and, and I think I wanted very much to have a very physical kind of emotional response and this is something my parents couldn't do at all.  My father would, and almost my mother too, but especially my father would get embarrassed to kiss me when he came to meet me at camp or something like that.  I mean, he just couldn't stand any kind of contact.  And another thing that disturbs me, and I almost want to tell my parents, well, I have a problem and look at me, you shouldn't think so smugly about how you brought us up because they almost, I think they're sorry for their friends who have problems, but in a way they almost are rejoicing in these problems that their friends have because then they can think how wonderful they are and they don't have them and this, the HWR's have two adopted children, actually this girl was adopted that I was speaking of previously and their son who is several years younger and was adopted and I think he was about 9 months old, uhm, was a very mixed up child and oh, I don't know, he just has a tremendous amount of problems but, and I you know, grew, it was obvious right from the beginning to people that he did have problems and the HWR's didn't want to face it for years and years and years.  And my parents have always just kind of sat back and kind of, well, we could see it all the time, and he's such an awful boy anyway (chuckle) and I always was very fond of this boy and this has always made me mad too.  I was always fo--, I, I don't react to him the same way now but I used to be very fond of him and, and I used to feel very sympathetic to him as if I knew exactly what he was going through.  Only he was going through it in a much more extreme way than I was.  But I almost felt as though I knew exactly what was in his mind.  I don't know if I would now because he, uhm well, his sister had gone away to uhm PWKQ (another continent) with her husband and when, when she came back she went to stay with her parents because she was about to have a baby and it didn't displace MJ HWR the boy, but it almost made him feel as if he, well, he, his parents feel he doesn't really belong, and there's been a whole history behind this, but in any case when their daughter comes and he's completely shunted aside, and he's almost hated by them, I think.  So he was staying with a friend and he asked all these, his sister and parents out for dinner, I, I never did understand exactly how it went but in any case, after they left that night, he burned the apartment he was living in at the time, and, and he was nearly killed and just severely burnt and barely has come through it and I don't know what this had done to his way of thinking, I don't, when he did this, I realized he was way beyond anything I could understand too, so I don't know how I'd respond to him now.  But I used to feel very sympathetic.  I guess now I just feel very sad, because it almost seems like he'll never get help because they still can't face the fact that he really needs something that, that something has gone wrong, even if they don't have to say we did something wrong.  They just can't just face something has gone wrong and get him help and make him have it because he's not capable, I don't think, of choosing.  (Pause)</p>

<p>A thought just has occurred to me, I don't really know whether this is truly a reaction I've had, but thinking of MJ HWR and the girl FKTZ who just left school, I, in a way I almost admire them, or people in their situation who will react by doing something, and almost openly stating " I have a problem and I'm not going to hide it any more.  " I almost admire them because I think I'm, certainly if MSCZ hadn't begun going to a psychiatrist, I would have always just hidden everything and probably not admitted I, that there was anything wrong with me whatsoever in the way I was feeling things and I almost wouldn't have had the courage to face it myself and make an open statement.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was talking with MSCZ last night about the fact that at the end of each session I feel very upset partly just because when I do talk, I, I do get very emotional and very tense, and then suddenly to stop right in the middle even if I, even if it isn't right in the middle of an emotional reaction, I find it very hard.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   To sort of regain control, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I gather from what you say that you must wonder whether or not to tell your parents that you've started analysis.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I think, well, sometimes I guess I have wanted just because they still are my parents and they have a right to know what's happening to me.  But on the other hand, my decision right now is not to tell them, and it's only, sometimes I feel very spiteful and then I think, well, I'll tell them and upset them.  And you know, that it's almost a weapon I can use against them by telling them, that's what I mean, that it would be a weapon.  But on the whole I think right now, my thought is, is it, would probably upset them and, and it would you know, be silly to do that, and there's no need for it.  Because I know that my parents wouldn't understand.  In fact, when MSCZ started, uhm, before we were married he went to uhm, I guess it was a psychiatrist, I'm not sure, in PNWN and at the time I was incapable of keeping anything to myself and so, well, anyway, this was something entirely new to me because I had been brought up that you took care of yourself, you didn't seek outside help and so when he began doing this I just didn't know what to think about it and I talked about it with my mother.  And at the time she seemed very sympathetic and all, but then later she began to question me and then she knew he wasn't going through analysis but she began to question me later, wondering if he would be and I think then I kind of dodged it and she just then expressed herself on analysis and made it very clear that she (chuckle) didn't think it was such a good idea.  And my father doesn't know that MSC had anything to do with it and I don't think she ever spoke to him about it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny too, because things will happen, well, especially before I started, there'd be things happening and I'd think well, I can't wait to start so that I can start talking about them (chuckle) and then when I come here I forget (chuckle) everything.  (2-Minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just remembering an incident that happened today.  I have a boy in my class who is uhm, I don't know whether it's just that he's still very uncertain about himself or what, but any, in any case, he needs to be recognized all the time and if you give the direction he has to have you, say me, you too, and uhm, he gets silly, loudly silly for attention and you know, this type of thing, and I knew he was that way right from the first day, so I've tried very hard to recognize him, at times when he's behaving well and the way I have to expect at the school and when he's uhm, doing a good job in his work and things like that and just at little times when he's up high or something so that he won't have to keep asking me for it because I'm already giving it to him.  But he still asks for it beyond what anyway right now is my capacity to give to him, and uh, he does, he does, get very loud, for instance he'll be in a group and he'll just suddenly start shouting out and at this school this is not understood at all and not accepted.  So, I have to do something to control that aspect and anyway, for his good, he should have some control over this, and today I was just so hot and uncomfortable and I know I was loosing my temper which I don't like to do with a group of boys that young but at one point he did something and I just spoke to him in a way that I understand was probably the wrong thing to do with a boy who just is a very unhappy boy within himself, but I let myself do it.  And then I always feel very guilty afterwards.  And it's the same with another boy who's very dependent on an old friend, and who can do, I think he can actually do some wonderful things but so far he's not letting himself and he's being very immature and, and I know he's annoying me and I try to let myself keep thinking of how he must be feeling but then I have so many things happening and I'll just loose my temper with him too, and that too will make me feel very guilty, and that because I shouldn't ever, even once in a while have this happen.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think I'm still confused any way about how firm or strict or dominant to be with children at that age because on the one hand, I feel I want, that I would now, if I could be a child again, respond much more to a person who really truly recognized individuals, and individual differences and capacities, and who is much gentler.  But on the other, I think my natural inclination is to be very dominant and severe and I expect them all doing exactly the thing that I want.  And I, I have a lot of trouble working those two things out or together.  (2-Minute silence)</p>

<p>I suppose it's only fair that sometimes you can loose your temper with the children you're teaching, if as long as it doesn't happen very often, because that's only what really can happen.  But (pause) I think I have a real fear of losing my temper because of my own family background and also when MSCZ and I were first married I used to have a horror of fighting at all, because I just didn't want to have the same situation develope as I had seen with my parents, and if we did fight, I would fight terrifically quickly because I just couldn't stand the thought of being the way my mother had been with my father.  Because now I think I do exactly what she did do, which is saying nothing and then MSCZ gets very contrite (chuckle).  It's same old pattern all over again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You mean saying nothing as though you had been hurt?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that and, and sort of a silence saying I can't answer you because you're speaking to me in a way that you just shouldn't be speaking to me.  In that tone of voice or something, and, or else I might sometimes say that, you know, I just can't stand to have that kind of a tone of voice used, because then it makes me feel very degraded or something, but in any case, by saying very little or nothing, then he very quickly will become upset that he became angry and apologize.  Whereas if I fight back he won't because then we get into a position where he has some justification for doing what he whatever he does do.  And I think once in a while, when we were first married, when we did fight, I found it very exhilarating almost, because I really did want to hurt him physically.  I'd almost hate him then.  (Pause) But then we'd, but then I would get myself in control and we'd probably be closer than we'd been for a long time, as if I'd worked out whatever it was that was in me and -- (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Time's up.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, what's going on with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, um, basically ongoing issues, you know, like I had mentioned, I had been in therapy before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did you first start?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I first started therapy in '94 when we came back from Ohio, and I was put on Prozac, which helped tremendously at that time and I was in therapy for maybe a year and a half or so.  And technically I think that's why the marriage issues started because I always feel like I sort of got better and moved on, and he sort of stayed where he was and such.  So, you know, we went that path.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you learn in the therapy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I grew up.  I basically grew up.  Um, to me as cliché as it is, is the whole little kid trap with my mother stuff.  Let me turn this off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what happened with your mother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, like I had mentioned before, um, well she was depressed.  When you mentioned bipolar because I have often, uh, compared [NAME OTHER] to living with my mother, the walking on eggshells, the, the hysterics, the rages.  Um, the thing with, I'm, I'm the third of 4 siblings.  Um, [AGE] I was locked in the attic.  That was the big traumatic thing for me.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was the big what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Traumatic thing for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why was you locked in, accidentally or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, no.  She pulled down the stairs, I marched up and she locked me up there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you were terrified?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, I mean it, it was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For how long did she leave you in there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I, I don't know, but when I discussed this previously, I mean it was long enough that I cried myself to sleep and I was sleeping for a while.  So she said well it's not any 5 minute deal if that happened.  Um, and it was mainly to punish my older sisters is why she did that.  My mother, you know, unfortunately was not nurturing type of parent.  She didn't have it in her.  So, I get, worked through a lot of that, and, um, actually because the therapist at that time had said, and I am not sure at all of the terminology, but more or less like an acute depression.  When I went and spoke with the psychiatrist, he said no, I've pretty much been depressed all my life, you know, more or less, a, a chronic type thing.  So, after that, I really was in a good place.  I mean I really, you know, was doing pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long did you stay on the Prozac?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well I was on it for about 2 or 3 years, and then when I quit therapy, I went to my regular doctor, you know, weaned myself off it, and then I, I could feel it when I need it.  You know, you just sort of feel that cloud coming in, and whenever I sort of got that way, I, my regular doctor would prescribe it, and then I didn't have a whole lot of faith in that because I feel like, you know, Prozac sort of worried me to begin with, the weaning on and off, and I just felt like you should get somebody in that profession and not an M.D., you know, to monitor that type of thing, but I was off of it for a while, and then like a year or two ago, well that was in '93.  Then, of course, when everything happened with my husband, went right back into it, and I actually, I saw [NAME OTHER] one time and this was at the onset when my husband said he might be open to counseling, but he would like to see a man.  So she referred me to a male therapist.  He never showed up and I continued with the male therapist for like 3 years through all this stuff because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When was this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ninety nine and 2000, in those years because then all the issues with my kids, you know, crept up and all this kind of stuff, so I was seeing him probably for 3 years.  Um, and again, I was on medication then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prozac again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you felt improved as a result?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did.  I mean I think as far as therapy and me and, I don't know, he helped me get through that time, and he was a good resource for me dealing with my kids, yet, um, as far as my own issues, I don't know if we dealt with a lot of those along the way, but it was like a crisis thing for 3 years.  You know, it seemed like every week there was something.  And then, uh, it was like a year and a half ago that I started, you know, feeling it again and just the anxiousness and I remember I was at my daughter's house and all my kids and it's like I had to get out.  I just, you know, whatever, and talked to my sister who's in the field and she recommended a psychiatrist in [DEIDENTIFIED].  She put me on Lexapro.  I didn't, you know, maybe a month or two and then I just sort of dropped that, and I've just sort of been on my own here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't like the Lexapro as well as you did the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really didn't see it doing anything.  Um, at that point, I started, I really like [NAME OTHER].  She's the one I had seen years ago and I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The counselor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is she now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's not practicing.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She retired or she—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she had a baby like into this, and I think as he got preschool, she cut down her practice and then I think she just stop practicing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so now you feel like you're kind of in limbo—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Floundering and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, you're not, you haven't been on the Lexapro in a year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you haven't been seeing a therapist in a year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, now things are stabilizing in the home situation you said, correct?  There is a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, and I want to talk to you about that too because it's stabilizing, but I don't know, there's definitely an improvement of behavior definitely.  Now a week and a half ago, I don't know if some of it is that I just don't confront her anymore.  You know, there was one night and it was a week and a half ago, I wanted her to stay home.  She wanted to sleep over.  It's 11:00 at night and I'm walking down the street after her, and she ended up just taking off.  Um, so whether I'm just getting so complacent with [INAUDIBLE] life, I'm getting very nervous because she's [AGE].  I am looking to school next year, and that's what I wanted to talk to you about today for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, high school to get her back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To go back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I know the first time you said we're nowhere near that and I agree.  Um, the school's recommendation is rehab.  I don't think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I think, I think we'll see over time with the Lamictal a stabilization of the mood.  You know, you talk about your Mom possibly having a bipolar depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's what we're dealing with, and I think what she's on now is the right medication.  So I think we need to see how much improvement there is.  In terms of what type of school, where is she?  What school is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would they be open to doing like an assessment at the end of the summer to see what's most appropriate for her or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's how this started is when she was seeing [NAME OTHER] and she said ask the school, we were under the impression if a parent requested an evaluation, they had to do it.  They don't.  They bring it up to their PPS committee.  This has been done twice, and of course, the school does not want to spend money on any kind of home tutoring or anything.  So me and my biggest mistake I ever made, the first week back in February, um, conference with her counselor and the dean and stuff.  Her counselor and I were just sitting off to the side while the dean was talking to her, and we were talking about situations and where she is, and I mentioned that she smoked pot.  Right then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They wanted to send her to rehab.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's a [AGE] stoner, she needs rehab.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's the last, um, decision they came up with before the school year got out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was hoping, because I know I'm going to have a fight on my hands, and I was hoping if I had something from you saying she doesn't need rehab—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're working towards this direction, she might need some kind of special ed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Shortened schedule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is, is she open to going back to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My gut feeling is she is.  Back in February, she did not want to drop out.  She doesn't have a, didn't have a, even the dean said, you're not our typical dropout.  Now, I feel like she's in with [NAME OTHER] and, well [NAME OTHER] goes to school.  To her, it's acceptable to get a GED, to not go to high school, and, you know, I think if you have that capability—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you're intelligent, you need a high school.  I'm not talking college at this point.  I'm talking a high school diploma.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, let's do this.  We still have time.  It's only June now.  I think for her, let's give the Lamictal 150 mg like a month and, and then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can reassess where she's at and see how cooperative she would be with school and then we can approach that, and, you know, suggest that there is improvement based on the different diagnosis, the medicine she's on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she what they're willing to do.  In terms of you, what would make most sense, since you've had successful experiences both with Prozac and therapy, is to put you back on Prozac again.  What dose were you taking back then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twenty or 40 or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was going to say 60.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you that high up to 60?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was pretty high.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I usually don't like going that high.  What I would suggest, maybe we start with 20, see how you do and then if you need to taper it up—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that would make sense to go with that drug.  Um, in terms of the therapy, if you want therapy for you, I think [NAME OTHER] might be a good fit if you, if you can drive her to see her.  I don't know if you would want to do that.  I can schedule a time with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Would it be like weekly or biweekly?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Depending on what you needed.  You know, maybe meet with her one time and kind of go through your history and see if, the therapy is, is the relationship basically and there needs to be chemistry to have it most effective.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, to see if you feel that you and she are on the same page.  So what I suggest is meet with her once, see how it feels.  If it does, discuss with her frequency and, you know, and then we can figure out what we do with your insurance.  We could send it in too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, based on because you have insurance, but [NAME OTHER] doesn't I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She has an HMO.  I have a Blue Cross PPO.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Blue Cross PPO.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'm not in network, but they'll cover some percentage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we, we can find out what it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's what I would suggest would make the most sense, and then if you do feel comfortable with her, stay with her.  If not, we'll find somebody that works for you, and as we're doing, finding a person that'll work for you, we can gradually boost the Prozac dose up a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Until we get to the right, the other thing is the best natural antidepressant is aerobic exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] this morning.  I'm trying to, to get back into that routine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sunlight is the second best, so being outside in the summer is ideal.  Protein in your diet is very important because when people are depressed [INAUDIBLE] are neurotransmitters which are made from proteins.  So protein in your diet, I don't know if you eat a lot of protein.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I pretty much do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you eat fish, chicken.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and stay away from carbs as much as you can, breads [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the hard part for me, but I try to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you'll have dual benefit.  Your mood will improve, plus we'll control your weight as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I mean just decrease it, not stop it because you'll get tired if you stop it totally, but if you reduce the amount of breads, like if you have a sandwich, have a half a piece of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bread or pasta half a bowl and just have extra protein.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just have a little bit.  I have double fiber bread or the whole wheat pasta, that type of stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Double what stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Double fiber bread they have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  It's a little—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're going to have it, but still limit it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I would still limit it as much as possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that would help, you know, and like I say, the exercise and the sunlight and, uh, yeah, that will get you back into some state of balance.  Lexapro and Prozac are different drugs.  They're both serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but Prozac has other receptor stimulation that Lexapro doesn't have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's possible you needed that.  It was another possibility, do you have attentional issues like [NAME OTHER] does like focus and organization things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are you a big caffeine drinker or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh, a cup of coffee a day in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it would sense then to use the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the situation with your husband now, where is that now?  I mean that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, with him and me other than fighting tooth and nail for anything for [NAME OTHER], I mean it just frustrates me his, the way he treats her which is nothing.  I mean that's just another problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have no contact at all you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, are you divorced or separated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, we're divorced.  We've been divorced for 8 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you divorced him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and, and it never was a good situation with him and the kids.  So, she's very angry and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With him, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you, but you're just separate?  I mean you don't have any, uh connection with him now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Other than the kids, emails and that type of thing with kids, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] still gives you support for [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But not the other two?  The other two are adults.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, the other 3.  Yeah, they're all on their own, yeah, but in that respect, it's like once the kids get to be a certain age where they don't require so much from him, then he comes back into their lives.  He's, you know, as far as [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and he gets along with them.  [NAME OTHER] is still sort of on the outskirts because she still might need a little help from him, you know, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[AGE].  Now she's the one that [NAME OTHER] has the problems with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, has she had any contact with her lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well actually driving out here, [NAME OTHER] said, uh, because [NAME OTHER]'s been coming over to my house a couple of days a week to use the computer.  Like 2 weeks ago, I get a call from [NAME OTHER] hysterical, you know, you got tell [PHYSICIAN NAME] when I'm here, and they get in fist fights and stuff, well she was saying this week, [NAME OTHER] was over 2 days and they along well.  [NAME OTHER] even commented that, you know, she can really tell a difference, and they were discussing things and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I thought would happen.  You know, once we stabilize [NAME OTHER], her relationship with the family will improve.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And to me that's a benchmark, her and [NAME OTHER].  They have a such a, a love hate relationship that if they, they can come together, I think that's something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  All right, yeah, I think that's a good approach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and then we'll kind of leave [NAME OTHER] out of the therapy for now, you know, just you talk to your own person and then, uh, [NAME OTHER]'s not really open to therapy and the medicine's working.  And then we'll see, maybe there's something we can even through school.  You know, sometimes they have peer support groups at school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, that we can, you know, make a case for, and I think, uh, I mean I don't see, like I say, when you first talked to me about her, you were ready to send her away to a long term setting and I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, we did the gamut from, and we started in February with [NAME OTHER] even saying, the [DEIDENTIFIED] was partial hospitalization, she didn't need that.  We went from that to residence facility.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like a roller coaster for 3 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no, I, I think, yeah, like I say, the problem when people have depression, bipolar depression, as I said originally, there are neurotransmitter issues, and if you can correct the neurotransmitters, people improve.  Their relationships improve.  Their mood improves.  The only time you need those residentials when you have a lot of character problems.  You know, when it's actually part of their personality structure, and that way medicine isn't going to change that, and you have to kind of recreate their personalities, and I don't see that with her at this point, and based on the response to the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think we'll have to go that route, but there are things the school might be able to do to support her, and they might be open to that because if we could do in school rather than sending her to a different environment, it's going to be less expensive for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they might be more open to that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they have an obligation.  I mean, you know, school has an obligation to educate somebody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I looked into faith and all that and it's, you know, and my sister [INAUDIBLE] vacation in Wisconsin, so she was helping me there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The main thing is not to develop an oppositional relationship with the school because that, I've seen that happen, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you work as a, as a unit to help [NAME OTHER], I think they'll, I haven't worked with them directly.  I work with the school districts here, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's wait a month for that and then we'll, we'll talk to her and approach her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe what I can do is I'll see here in a half, in a month and maybe you can come with her then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And maybe if you want, I could touch, you could see [NAME OTHER] maybe next week if you want—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then in 2 weeks I could touch base with you just for a short appointment just to see if this Prozac is enough or if we need to go to higher doses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because sometimes it takes a couple of weeks for the Prozac to kick in, and you didn't have any side effects from the Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.  Can I throw one more thing out with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I didn't say it earlier on because I didn't want to taint like your objectivity, but it's something that even when she was in elementary school, it was in the back of my mind and a couple of people I've talked with, but like not this specifically, but a very high level of something like Asperger's because she really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't see it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her interaction that you can't sit and, you know, when she was in grade school, you couldn't sit and do homework with her.  She couldn't process what you're doing.  She'd just get shut down, get totally frustrated.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She definitely has ADD.  So that ADD could alter her processing ability.  Um, Asperger's usually present a little bit more bizarrely than, than she does.  I mean there's a little, I mean she has a boyfriend.  She has, uh, interactive skills, not the greatest, but they're there.  Um, I don't, I don't see it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't see it.  I see her as the ADD probably getting her frustrated, and you know, there might be two conditions like a bipolar condition in terms of the moods and you can see that, you know, combination—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't label her as Asperger's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Actually her having the ability to have relationships, this boyfriend is how long now, a year or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's it too.  It's like obsessive on one and then, it, it just seems like even things as minor as a movie or a book or something else, and she would have to do everything.  You know, watch it over and over and over again.  She'd have to buy everything out there having to do with it, and then overnight it's gone.  And then she focuses on other things.  And that's how she is with—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Obsessive with the boys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Boys, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But she switches.  I thought she had this long term relationship.  How long is this relationship?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER]?  A few months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it's only a few months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And she throws herself into it, and, and I, I think that's where [NAME OTHER] and I were starting to worry because of her behavior.  I know she's sexually active.  I know she smokes pot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But she's not promiscuous though, is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not, not as far as I know, and I don't think she does anything else, but smoking pot.  I mean I really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even with the Asperger's patients that I treat, they're not usually sexually active.  I mean they're usually withdrawn.  They're, they have a hard time connecting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and, uh, so she just doesn't look that way to me.  You know, not to say that [INAUDIBLE] very high functioning yet but I, I don't see it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You think it's more the ADD?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it's a combination or ADD and I think like your Mom, there's a genetic history, probably a bipolar issue and I think that's, and that's what I'm treating with medicine.  If we get dramatic improvement and we've already gotten some in a relatively short period of time, I don't think we, we should explore, I mean we could always test her if you want to test her for the Asperger's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if it's not necessary—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I wouldn't.  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To treat the symptoms so she can get [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't look for things at this point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like I say, because to be honest with you, treating Asperger's is a lot more difficult.  Uh, you know, you got to use major tranquilizers and, uh, you know.  I wouldn't at this point go look for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would, I would love to see how much improvement we get over the summer, if we can get her back in school, get some support from the school system.  See, you know, I mean I'm, I'm encouraged by her relationship with her sister improving and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just her personal report that she's noticing improvement because that's the first time she said that.  She's been frustrated over the years that she hasn't been feeling any better, is that correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, because I just went over with you the last time she was in what did she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The last time I didn't see any improvement yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why this Lamictal is a slow titration.  It takes a 5 week period.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think we'll see even more with 150.  I got as high as 300.  So we're still not at a high dose, but 150 might be the right dose for her in combination with the Vyvanse, and then if we have a great month and she is motivated to go to school, then I think rather than even the therapy, just go with the school's support system.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever they'll provide, and then see what she's like maybe 6 months from now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, and I feel better because I feel like there's a plan.  I mean the past month—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like just sort of floundering and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I wanted to make sure—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Needed some direction for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I wanted to make sure we get a response and I'm seeing the response I wanted, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and for you, like I say, based on your past, we're going to kind of redo what, what was done.  So, I'll give you 20 mg Prozac.  Give it at least 2 weeks.  I could see maybe for 15 minutes in 2 weeks—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just to see how it's going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] schedule maybe?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Maybe I'll do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to do them both?  Yeah, we could do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that'd be one trip out here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, and that's, that's without [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right, and then her in a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

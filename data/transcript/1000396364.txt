<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I'm thinking about uhm, I guess I was ending thinking about FSO yesterday.  And uhm, I, I don—, I don't remem— the, the girl that is uhm, starting tomorrow is FMC, and I don't remem— remember how much I was thinking about FMC here.  But uhm, I think on my way home I began thinking about her, if I didn't start here, and having some questions that uhm, must have occurred to me when I met her yesterday morning.  But I don't think they were, th, they were that strong when I met her.  And uhm, well, I think I had the feeling here yesterday that it was almost like I'd be critical of anybody, but uhm, I don't know, things seem, I'm, I'm involving myself in it more.  And uh, I'm, well I just, I don't know quite why I'm doing it, whether there is really something to be concerned about or uhm, or just what.</p>

<p>But what's complicated my, my feelings about it I guess is that uhm Mrs. CDB, who was supposed to come back last night and call me, never did.  And uhm, I was quite worried about that because then I was worried, what would I do with FSO today?  And uhm this morning when I was unable to reach her although, it had been arranged that she'd call me, I uhm, called FDC and asked if she could take care of FSO today, which she was glad to do.  And I had asked her uh in July if for any reason I needed to use her it would be all right and she had said yes.  And I had hesitated doing it because I thought, well the first day I really leave FSO for an extended period of time it might have been better to have her in her own house.  But then it turned out she remembered FDC and FDC's house and uhm, as far as I could tell she had a very happy morning.  And then I took her back there when I was coming here and she seemed uhm very happy to go back in.</p>

<p>So then I start going over again what had been something on my mind after FSO adjusted in July and that was whether or not it would be better to take her there.  Uhm, because I, FDC is nice with her and she will have other children there.  Uhm, and so then it, it makes me think FMC, think of things about FMC that I hadn't felt all that good about.  And I, I don't know, it seems like I just dwell on them then.  And uhm, I forget all the reasons why I decided not to have FSO go to FDC's, but why I preferred not to if we could find somebody else, uhm, things like, it would just be more convenient for me to have somebody coming to our house if FMC won't live in, except she'll stay overnight some nights, but she won't actually live in.  And uhm, uh, well I, I don't know, I mean it is more convenient for me, but then I start worrying that FMC will be able to do all the things that I want done for me, but that she won't be, that FSO will be unhappy I guess.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it seems like it must be the contrast, because I remember she was, FSO was very unhappy when I first took her to FDC's.  In fact it really worried me the first few days and then, and then it clearly, she was OK.  And, uhm, FMC is still an unknown, enough so that I just can't tell yet how things will work out between them.  I think there will be some problems, but uhm, I don't know, I mean there's no reason to expect they'll never work out.  Except, I don't know, I just get this feeling, comparing the way she is now at FDC's and then anticipating how she'll be with FMC.  And I, I, well I just keep worrying over and over at uhm, uhm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, somehow this, the way I'm reacting to it and the way I'm, keep working over and over it that, uhm, I mean it seems pointless to keep thinking about it.  Because either I tell FMC that we've decided not to have her come or else we'll try and see how it works out, which is clearly what we're going to do, and, uhm, and then there's nothing else I can do.  So that, but I, I don't know, I, it, it's the approach I have about worrying over it that it seems like I'm looking for some solution that will get by everything.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Z,,,, I guess that what I was thinking of, uhm one of the ways I've been working this over in my mind and then MSCZ called this afternoon just to see how things had gone.  So that uhm, and I'd mentioned to him how FSO had adjusted very happily to FDC's and uhm, he actually brought, he actually suggested this, although I think I might have worked it out, maybe, I don't know, but he said, maybe FSO could go there once a week or something like that.  Uhm, I mean it's almost like a play group for her.  And uhm, then we were just talking about, well what we do, because FMC would, wants to come every day.  And uhm, I know just how we'd work out this if we tried it that way.</p>

<p>And uhm, and that leads us into thinking about the money side of it and uhm how we'd readjust what we were asking from FMC if we did it and if she agreed.  And, but then, I don't know, I get this im, image of uhm, well, I don't know whether it's because FDC is a lot older, because she's old, I mean she's a grandmother, or whether I'm used to her now and it's m—, it's mainly I'm not used yet to FMC.  And, and I haven't seen FSO adjust or, or what, but, I don't know, it's as if I get this feeling that FDC can handle things and do things so that FSO will be happy.  And uhm, I don't know, I don't know, somehow I, I think I keep getting this image of FMC, first of all, being unaware of things to watch out for because she hasn't been around children that much, and then uhm, well, somehow being insecure.  This comes out of something that she said to me about, she was kind of concerned over how FSO would adjust to her.  And uhm it made me feel she's concerned about whether FSO's going to like her or not.  And so then I, I guess, what I do is, I start worrying over uhm, uh well, uh I, I don't know how to put it exactly, except just that she won't be able to handle FSO very well.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But, well, it seems like it's also uhm, well somehow, it reminds me of how I use to react with FCE.  Only s, somewhat differently, because now I like the way FDC is and I felt threatened by FCE I guess.  But uhm, when, when I'm thinking of comparing them I don't know uh, I was thinking that FDC is sure of herself.  I guess maybe that's it and feeling FMC won't be, probably out of inexperience.  And that could change, but I don't know, somehow partly out of her attitude and, I mean FDC's brought up her own children.  She's had grandchildren around, she's done this with having children coming in for quite some time, so that she's just very assured and uhm, she's kind but she's firm.  And I, I, somehow, (pause) well again n—, n—, I guess what I said before is, what I think z,,,, uhm that I don't, I mean we're going to try FMC.  So why I keep working over this I don't (?) — (pause)</p>

<p>Well now, what uh, I was just thinking is (?) be well I'm just thinking about the fact that the way I keep switching in my view of FMC.  Because uhm, for some reason, and I'm not sure what exactly caused this, uhm, when I heard about her answering the notice that FDO had put up, I, somehow I f, felt that she just wasn't going to, to work out, I don't know why.  It might have had something to do with the fact that, because she didn't want to live in, and at that point I just didn't see how it could work.  And then she wrote a letter, uhm, for me, but, but through FDO and she wrote it in CHN (language of PCHN).  And I couldn't completely understand it so I couldn't completely understand what it was she wanted, but I also couldn't really get a feel of what she was like because I was just struggling to understand the CHN.  And uhm, so again I still had this feeling, well I'll keep pursuing this, just to see, but I don't think it'll work out.  And then — when I wrote back I'd asked her to write in English — and when she wrote back the second time in English, I could get, I could g—, somehow, get more feel of her.  At least it seemed as if it was her, maybe not, because maybe she wasn't putting herself through in the English, but anyway I liked her better.  But I still wasn't sure and so then, when I met her uhm, I guess mainly it was, she seemed like a pleasant surprise and uhm, I, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but anyway she wasn't what I was expecting and so I liked her.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But then, I guess what I was just thinking is that now I want FDO, who's about to go back to Paris, I'm hoping that she'll be able to stop by before she goes and meet her.  And then just, you know, sort of tell me what she thinks of her.  I need somebody else's opinion.  (Pause) And I, and it's in the line of something that MSCZ couldn't do, because somehow I had the feeling FDO could because she's from Paris and, in effect, the liaison between us and knows somebody well that this girl had worked with.  And uhm, well, anyway that she would, just knowing CHN people would be able to judge better.  And uhm it, it has something to do with, I think FDO judging for me, what she thinks this girls involvement would be with us or with FSO.  And I don't, somehow I think I have this feeling that she's doing this mainly just because she has to, which is true, but that uhm, she really won't like it.  And, and it's not so much she won't like what I want her to do around the house as uhm, that she won't like having the charge of FSO.  (Pause) Now I'm thinking about how I had thought about other things but uhm, are really more crucial, in the sense that it, I can do something about this.  If I find out that FMC's not working I can stop that situation and if I'm finding I feel FSO going to FDC would be better I can do something about it.</p>

<p>And uhm, but then I was just thinking that yesterday at first I was thinking about things that, well, I guess I could do something about them too, but I mean my relationship with MSCZ, but that I haven't done.  And uhm, you know, and I don't know, I mean this might just be a way not to think about problems that I prefer not to.  But it also seems like this kind of a problem, I mean thinking about FSO and who's going to, to care for her is something that then MSCZ and I share, so that it sort of, well, I can't think of it any other way than it gives an illusion of our relating because we both would share the same problem here.  And uhm, so I don't know, it seems like it serves a double purpose in some way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well the, then I was just uhm, thinking about FSO uhm, going in with FDC and, I guess wondering how much she'd charge me if I did take her there one day a week.  And, oh, and I was thinking about the fact that this morning when I came back I asked her how much it would be, because we hadn't arranged it over the phone and uhm, she ask— said, $3.  And then I felt kind of guilty about giving her only $3, so I gave her $4, uhm, which she accepted, uhm almost like, well, I wasn't sure whether she was hoping I'd even give her more than that, which maybe she really was.  But anyway, and then I was thinking, well, maybe I made a mistake, because I know she doesn't charge FYR very much at all.  But that if I do something like that she'll start charging me more as a result and she did charge me more in July than FYR had expected, considering what she'd been charging her.  And uhm, so anyway, then I, I was wondering, I guess, what she'll charge me tonight too, but mainly if we worked it out so she, FSO went there once a week, what she would charge.</p>

<p>And uhm, and then I had this, this quick uhm, I d— know, sort of imagining, because FSO was hav—, I said to FSO, "You're going to go with FDC now," and she went right into the building.  And there was a little, well not so little, a girl around six, who's been there sometimes and FSO knows her now, with FDC.  They had gone out to get some ice cream and uhm, so they all went into the building, FSO running ahead.  And FDC was laughing at the way FSO was going in so happily and, and then I just had this vision of FDC being way behind and FSO running and falling down the elevator shaft, which would be impossible since it's shut.  And that made me think of this summer.  I kept having, every once in a while I'd have uhm, same type of fantasy of something horrible happening, and I, I think to FSO mainly, mainly, but uhm, and I can't remember any of the particular instances now, I just remember that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That kept happening, (pause) well, I'm not sure.  I know my reaction, whenever I'd have one of those, was, I d— know, was sort of to catch myself up immediately and, and to think w— of, sort of, what I did now, I guess, but you know, just to think, "Well I'm, I'm imagining that and it's no basis of reality at all," and uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But it means something, that you're imagining.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Which you surely know.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I know (pause) and I know then during the summer, whenever I'd do it I'd, I knew it then too and I'd just, uhm, sort of put off and push it away.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So what about her uh, running down the elevator shaft?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, in each case I think, like in that one too, it somehow, in the end it seems like it's my wishing to get rid of her, (pause) right on top of, well at least for today, my being so terribly concerned about her and her welfare and uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So your concern then is to hide the opposite.  Your excessive concern about this problem, which is easily solvable, clearly reflects just the opposite feeling.  You, by that, say to yourself, you don't really want to get rid of her, which is what the fantasy says you have in mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) You know, t, the only reason I can think, I'd want to get rid of her, because uhm, I mean, for what she is, uh, I don't know, I find it, I find I get very rigid on this and think, if I'm have fantasies of wanting to get rid of her, then it must mean I hate her and uhm, that I don't love her.  And yet I feel I do love her.  (Pause) And so, well, anyway, w, what I was going to say is that the only reason I can think of having fantasies of getting rid of her, or feeling it, which I'm not very willing to admit, is uhm, because she's not a boy, that maybe I'd, I don't know, maybe I'd feel that way about any child of mine.  (Pause) Well I, the other part, I mean it, part of it would be then because she's not a boy, but the other side of it might be an extension of that, that uhm, she did not answer something that I had hoped she would.  (Pause) And it seems now like uhm, I'm hoping that the combination of FSO and work will answer it, instead of just FSO alone.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you said, yesterday and today, that really FSO is the main  bond you feel between you and MSCZ, in effect.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, I'll, but th, then the way I've been thinking today, it would seem like that would be, I don't want that, to feel that bond.  Except it seems like I really do and that I've been building it up.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   See, and now you are running away from thinking out loud about it.  You're shutting me out —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   — You're retreating.  You're pulling away.  You're withdrawing from it.  The implication, it seems to me, is clear that the fantasy of FSO falling down the elevator shaft or whatever the counterparts were this summer of her dying or getting rid of her, destroys the one bond you feel with MSCZ.  So your reason for being married to MSCZ would vanish.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) You know uhm (pause) I think my first reaction was to think, but that, if, if that's so, uhm, I've often thought how things would seem better to me between us before she was born, or that they were getting better.  And that since she's there, since she was born uhm — not that she herself did it — but that somehow something happened to me and the way I was, I don't know, trying to do things or feeling, so that our relationship worsened.  And then it might not be that it really is so.  It might just be, I see it more, or something, but uhm, I think I've had some kind of feeling of, well, I mean, I know that she is not at fault but, but still somehow blaming her for this.  But then, but then I think, well, maybe that's just thinking an excuse, because that, well, I, I don't know, I mean then I, then I start wondering that of whether I really want to get rid of FSO, who is the only bond between MSCZ and me because I really don't want to have any bonds between us and uhm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, then it, then, I mean, which leads clearly to my thinking, "Well, do I want to, to divorce MSCZ?"  And uhm (pause) I just feel very unready to even think that or think about it.  (Pause) Because what I, whenever it's, comes to that, I guess what I've always thought is, if I can be happy with anybody, any man, then I can be happy with MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well uhm, it also seems to me that part of this is, if I, well I don't know exact—, I, uh, I mean I, I'm, guess I'm kind of guessing, but uhm — (pause) It, it, I mean, what I keep thinking is that the problems between MSCZ and me are because of my attitude toward men.  And then it takes on toward him individually, but that it isn't uhm, but that, if I could get rid of these problems then things would be all right between us.  And what I won't look at is, sort of our th—, I don't know if "impossible"'s the word, but just, "Are MSCZ and I, I guess, mismatched?" or something, and I don't want to, to look at that.  And it, uh, I, I think the feeling I have is, if I look that, ask myself that, in any kind of a real way, uhm, that the answer will be "Yes."  (Pause) And I think what I keep telling myself to, whenever this has come up, uhm, wondering about it, is that I, I don't know how to ask it too.  (Pause) Or, or maybe it's even just that I just don't know whether I've made him, because of my attitude toward men, into something that he really isn't.  And when I think I, well, I could be happy with him if I could be with anybody, I'm thinking of what he really is.  But then, on the other hand, I am reacting to him because of what I've made him and I don't know whether I could ever get around that, or uhm —  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well it takes on the, the idea of starting all over again and starting something new, uhm.  (Pause) Except I really can't imag—, I mean c—, because it's as if things are just too tangled up to untangle.  But then I can't imagine uhm, I mean I don't feel I know the answers to those things, but then yet I can't imagine starting over and not ending up in a mess again.  (Pause) You know, I've gone on to thinking about FRA and that conversation I was talking about yesterday.  And uhm, I, I suppose, somehow speculating whether or not, because yesterday I certainly was feeling z,,,, when we had the conversation too, that FRA going through therapy has brought her closer to MNO.  But I think right now I'm wondering if really, something else isn't happening, and wondering, would they ever end up getting a divorce, which is absolutely no reason for me to think.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then just thinking of something she had said.  I don't know which of us said it first, but just when she asked, I think it came out ab—, around the time she asked how MSCZ was reacting, and, well I just, I might have said something about our relationships having to change.  And that there were reasons that we got married that, that aren't valid now or, maybe something new could be built.  But anyway uhm, I don't know how much I was feeling, really feeling, what I said, but I know it's true.  And uhm, she just agreed and said something about, "Oh, I know when I look back on it now how we ever made the mistake of getting married," meaning just simply all the wrong reasons at that particular time.  And uhm, I mean she didn't say it with any kind of tone of things were really wrong now, but that's sort of the way I'm choosing to look at it today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well maybe there's something I just am not uhm, seeing, because I, I mean, uh, when I think this, I recall at some point — I don't know how long ago, it must have been after FSO was born when we were talking FSO — my hoping FSO would be the answer to things that I wanted and uhm, not needing MSCZ then because I had FSO.  And, uhm, I don't know, somehow it seems like, when I'm thinking about divorce, on the one hand I get very frightened by it and I push it away and think of all sort of things that would deny that as a possibility.  And yet it seems that on the other hand I sort of want to be able to choose in a way.  I mean hopefully I could because it would be awful if I couldn't, but I'd know somehow in a way that, uhm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, it seems like it ends up (?) my really wanting to be able to say, "MSCZ, I really don't need you and I don't want you," and uhm, sort of throw him out.  (Pause)  Because well, I mean it, uh, it just occurs to me that whenever things have gotten so bad between us that I've thought, well, maybe a divorce, it does have to be the only answer.  And whenever I've even been able to think about it, all I'm feeling, I suppose in a way most defensive, but also I'm trying to feel very aggressive and, "Well, I don't care," and "I can do it on my own."  And uhm, I don't know, somehow my thinking about divorce seems like a fighting kind of thing.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You mean, like an attack on MSCZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Which is as hostile as dropping FSO in the elevator shaft.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well there's something I don't understand or else uhm, I don't know.  I mean I don't (pause) I don't quite s—, I guess maybe wh— it is, I don't see, quite see where I think I'd get myself if I get rid of the two of them.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Z,,,, not right because the, the next thing I think I, I just uhm, I guess maybe I think in terms of, well, I don't see where it would be getting me.  And I think of what I'd be losing.  And then uhm, and then I think of FSO, because the only time I've been, I felt I really know I'm feeling love, is for her.  I suppose I must have from (?) my parents, but recently anyway, for her.  I, I'm never sure what I'm feeling for MSCZ, except sometimes I know I'm feeling anger and uhm, probably hate, but I don't know if I really feel love or uhm.  (Pause) Well, I just a find it harder to be able to sort out my feelings for him and uhm, (pause) I don't know, I thought of some.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time is up anyway.

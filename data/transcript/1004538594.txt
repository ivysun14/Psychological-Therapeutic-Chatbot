<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Now I'll finally be settled in.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't know what happened. I just completely totally flipped my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it wasn't even a case of I know I should go, but I'm feeling miserable, and I don't want to get out of bed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just like it wasn't even ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Huh. (Sigh) Yeah, I mean given that it happened last week as well, it makes me sort of scratch my head and say, "I bet there's something going on there, but I don't know what it is."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Neither do I.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:00:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean I had a lot going on this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been feeling pretty miserable, but (sigh) ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's talk about whatever's on your mind and maybe it will become clearer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So three weeks ago, I picked up a writing assignment from the website I occasionally write for, and they wanted ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. They were trying to seduce you into offers that I kind of remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there's this game that was quite fun, and they needed a walk-thru for it, so I said, "Sure," and then, you know, as I progressed through the game, and it got increasingly more difficult. It got more difficult to get the walk-thru done. And it just was stalling out and getting frustrating, and I also had these wedding invitations I needed to make, and those were two pretty big projects.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well - and at the print shop at least, like there's no point in going unless you have like a four- to eight-hour block of time because stopping points aren't that frequent, and clearing off and making the shop usable for the next person to come in. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's a half hour at minimum to set up and get going, and then, an hour of clean up and tear down -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - so, like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You can only spend 15 minutes working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So, you know, I would come home and be really tired and be like I have this assignment to do that I need to work on, and it got increasingly tedious. What was fun and entertaining for the first 30 levels by the time I was on level 70, which was like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - oh, my God. Get me out of here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have to write a walk-thru for ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I was feeling increasingly upset with myself for not getting that done by deadline, and, you know, reverted to a bunch of patterns of, you know, avoidance and fuck it, I've been miserable all day, I deserve to like kick back and have a glass of wine and watch a TV show with my husband, but I deal with school. And his brother has been visiting us since he went down to Philly Friday night, came back with his brother Sunday, and his brother is staying with us. And his brother is very high needs. He's very low functioning down syndrome. [00:03:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's just like hugely stressful, -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - even though Dave is doing most of the work of taking care of Brandon, you know, like goes to work during the day, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - since I'm not taking classes and my job hasn't started yet, I've got Brandon during the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you spent much time before taking care of Brandon?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not on my own. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had him Monday and Tuesday. And yesterday and today, Dave took him to work with him. Dave booked a conference room at his work, and he and Brandon have been - he's been working in the conference room and then setting Brandon up with a spare laptop and some TV shows to watch, and some Kindle games, and etcetera, etcetera, but - so I don't know. Yesterday, I got up, and Dave and Brandon had already left the house, and it was like, "Ah. This is really nice. Dave took Brandon to work. I can like stay in bed, relax, read a book. I got up and made, you know, some pancakes for breakfast and enjoyed my day - [00:04:30]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and then got your text message and it was like, "Oh, shit." Oops.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also spent a good bit of yesterday trying to force myself to go in to the print shop and get some work done on that, but ... I felt guilty because the - the walk-thru that had an earlier deadline still wasn't done, so I stayed home and tried to work on that and got distracted by other things, and ... yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many levels in the game?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thirty. [00:05:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you just going in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much do you have to write for each level?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not the writing so much as the taking screenshots, which is a pain in the neck because the Kindle and the Nook don't have native support for screenshots. You have to connect them to your computer and then install -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - programs from the computer for your computer to grab the screenshot off the USB. And then marking up the screenshots with directional arrows - [00:05:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and very specific directions. It's - it's a puzzle game, and part of the challenge is to complete the level in as few steps as possible, so, you know, in - in a field that might be, you know, 15 squares by 15 squares, there's no way you can describe that in words and be concise and legible. You have to do it visually ... which, yeah. It's a lot of editing and Photoshop and that gets - you know, the first 30, 40 levels or so were fairly straightforward. One screen shot, a couple of lines, and Photoshop, done. But as the levels get increasingly more complex, it was like okay, this image is getting too cluttered. I have to break it up into two images. Now I need four images. You know? It got to the point where I was needing to edit, you know, eight or nine images per level, and I was just - [00:06:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like I eventually e-mailed my editor late last night and was like, "Here is what I have. I can't finish this. I'm sorry." And he was kind of annoyed, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I'm imagining you were somewhere like between 100 and 200 images. [00:07:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a lot, even though I had two weeks to work on it. It's still a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Did they pay you well? I mean like - I - in a lot of - yeah, as much - without any - even as much about the money as about like some kind of acknowledgement with the money of how much time this is gonna take, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. Sure. I mean ... the payment for anything I do for this site, if you think of it in hourly wage basis is absurdly ridiculous, but the payment is on a sliding scale depending on how complicated the game is. And there certainly is recognition that this is a lot of work, and - you know, if I had gotten it completely finished and submitted on time, it would've been like eighty-five, ninety dollars. Which again, given the amount of time spent on it is like a crap hourly rate. But, you know, for writing gigs, writing gigs don't pay that well, and this site pays better than most, so ... like for a simpler game, you know, like there have been some walk-thrus I've done where the games were simple enough that they were like eight dollars, ten dollars, whatever, so at least there's a recognition that this is a harder than average ... [00:08:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like I don't do it for the money because like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a Master's degree. I can earn far more in my day job. This is not - like I do it mostly for the entertainment and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - the challenge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like it's got quite tedious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So ...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I - I guess probably what I was thinking is that it sounds like - I mean if I got it right, that sometimes you can get so wrapped up in the kind of internal logic or frame of what you're doing, like getting upset or frustrated just 'cause you haven't got it done, - [00:09:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - then it's like hard to step back and go like, "Okay, wait a minute. It doesn't Tomer that much."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a tremendous amount of time. Like I've already put a lot of time into it. They should be happy sort of a - you know, of what - all those thoughts, but that - I guess they get hard to think when you're sort of really -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - in the throes of the ... yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And also, I had a terrible time Friday evening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:09:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I went to this event with some friends, and I went with my friend, Brenda, and her roommate, Ann. And I was running late from the start, which, you know, my bad, and Ann was annoyed with me at the start for running late, which you know, fair enough. Well, then there was the event itself, which was a book reading by a woman who is part of the, you know, Emphatic Substance Movement. And, you know, I asked what I thought was a fairly reasonable question, which is, you know, you look at these fashion blogs written by and for fat people, and they're all very feminine, very girly, and where - like where's the aspirational fat - fashion images for people who aren't skinny enough to read Mainstream fashion blogs and aren't fem identified like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Brenda's roommate, Ann, just jumped all over me for that. Another friend of Brenda's talked down to me like I was a 12-year-old, like explaining that, you know, not every blogger's fashion suits every reader. I mean there are like 400 people who post outfit photos to the Fashion Community, and of those, I may - maybe five are my personal style or maybe you just need to look a little harder, and, you know. Like seriously, come on. Really? Like I - I understand that not everyone's style is for everyone, but looking at general trends, and - like if I was just terrible, and she was just really condescending and snide, and then she was like, "And I've been trying really hard to be tactful, but it's hard, you know." I was like that's just so like - I want to say bitchy, but I try to avoid gender insults when I can, but really, like let's just... (Sigh) I'm trying to be tactful. It's just ... [00:11:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like patronizing and obnoxious?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so, you know, we're standing in line to get books signed. I made a comment to Brenda, who is the friend who invited me, but, you know, well, you know, your friend was really insulting to me. I don't appreciate being talked down to. Like I don't know what was going on. I'm like these are sorts of things friends say to each other like when you're frustrated and so, -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like if you're hanging out with a friend and something someone says frustrates you, you might comment about it, and Brenda's roommate just jumped all over me. She was like, "Well, you were being really reductionist and rude. And I don't think you understand what it's like to be a fat woman." I'm like, "Excuse me? You don't think I understand?" I mean I was probably the skinniest person there, but I can't buy clothes in a regular department store because the sizes aren't big enough for me to wear, so, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Back the fuck off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. I just completely lost it and like started crying right there in the middle of the store, which was super humiliating for me, and so Brenda pulled me aside, and we were talking, and like ... [00:13:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you don't like - I mean if I remember right, you don't really like crying anywhere or in small groups -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - let alone in that kind of situation. You must've felt really lousy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And - like I think Brenda was just completely misunderstanding what I was trying to say 'cause she was like, "You know, it looks like you're having a meltdown, and, you know, I'm sure they didn't mean to be mean to you, and they didn't mean anything personally, and, you know, let me give you some resources for finding fat fashion." I was like, "That's not the point." Like I - I can totally understand if the answer to my original question was, "There's just no website serving that demographic. Sorry, you lose." Like the point - and like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was - it sounds like it was more the way you were being treated. [00:13:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't think I was being very clear about that. And, yeah, I was getting increasingly more upset. And at several points in the conversation, I completed Brenda personally with the movement in general and how it's so very extraordinarily straight, feminine centric, and Jesus Christ, it's so irritating. And (laughter) since Brenda is in fact a queer woman, that was really insulting, and I wasn't with it enough to realize how insulting I was being at the time. But once I got home, I realized, "Wow, I was being a real dick to Brenda, who is my friend and who was trying to be supportive," and ... so, yeah, just completely miserable about an hour after I got home. And Dave was out of town. So yeah, I called my friend, Tom, and he came over and spent the night and failed to get out of bed until like 4:00 the next afternoon, but these things happen, so ... [00:14:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like a pretty shitty night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it got better once I contacted this guy, Jesse.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Then I felt guilty all day Sunday because Saturday I spent the day with Tom instead of getting work done on either the wedding invitations or the walk-thru. And yeah, it's just been at this point a whole week of browbeating myself for the things I should've done already but haven't gotten done yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um.</p>

<p>(Pause)<br></p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing that sort of may run through some of this is how you seem to kind of distance yourself from ways or - ways or opportunities to like be feeling like supportive, supported, like you're doing good things, or people want to do good things for you. So, like, I've heard you talk about wanting to get the invitations done quicker, - [00:17:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - being concerned and frustrated about how - how much longer they're taking you than you wanted them to, - [00:17:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - wanting to meet certain deadlines for your friend. I have yet to hear you say like, "Gosh, I feel so nice. I'm really working my butt off on these things for my friend, -</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - even though they take way longer than any of us thought they might. You know, this is a, I don't know, eighty-hour project. And like, you know, it feels so nice to like have the time now to be able to put so much into doing something for her. -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I hope it helps to make their wedding nice." I haven't really like heard that angle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't know. That hadn't even occurred to me. No, it's been more of "Why haven't I got these done already? Why didn't I go to the print shop yesterday? Why are they not coming out as nice as I want them to come out - come out? God, I suck," and ... [00:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're right. It is nice to have the time to work on it. If I were still working on the thesis or if I were still taking the classes this semester, there's no way I'd have the time to even consider it like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And from the point of you, your friend, like she's managed to find somebody with a pretty low hourly rate to like do a pretty big amount of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - work involving a quite obscure skill set,...</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... who also happens to not be working, and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you know, not be otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like ... [00:19:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean and I picked this up because - so, there's a mailing list for everyone who's qualified and trained to know the press. And she had e-mailed back in November asking for this job to get done, and the current print shop manager said, "Yes, we can do that. No problem." And they went back and forth throughout the month of January finalizing the design, and the manager was like, "Sure. We have undergrads who would be totally happy to get this done for you over spring break." And spring break came and went, and all of the undergrads who are active members of the chapter of our fraternity just completely flaked out because, you know, they're undergrads and that's what happens. And Vivienne was saying in a chat room that a number of us frequent semi-regularly that she was really frustrated that, you know, those undergrads said they could do it and they couldn't, and she really wanted hand printed invitations, but they were going to have to find a professional printer. And I was like - actually, just yesterday in fact, my advisor said that she was done with me, so - [00:20:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - so I can take this on. No worries. And yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was - that was the 6th. I know because our paper was due on April 5th. And today's what, the 24th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today's the 26th. [00:21:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 26<sup>th</sup>. Yeah, that was three weeks ago. That's not that long ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not that long ago. And you - my impression is you spent a fair amount of time on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. And they're still not done. I need to go in after I'm done here. I'm actually gonna grab a late lunch and then go in and do some work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But last I checked, you're one person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. It's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like (coughing and inaudible at 00:21:29) amount of time she might expect for - you'd be able to spend on something like this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I feel if I had gone in at 9:00 AM every day, I could've taken it. I could've done it in a week, but I didn't, in part because I can't get out that door that early. And in part because after three days in a row of working the press, I was physically exhausted and too sore to put in another day. [00:21:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I lost momentum and I had this other project that was taking -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - my attention and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's possible this is all reasonable. And you're still working on doing something pretty nice for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's also possible that I should've recognized my limits and not taken on the walk-thru project and just told them, "Sorry. I can't do this." Or, you know, cut my losses earlier or ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I - the - the person who's clearly - I mean it doesn't sound like anybody is losing out horribly here, but the one who's sort of paying the most for this is you. I mean, so they're not that bad for you. Probably not that bad for anybody I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would also imagine that if this like game company gets 70 levels of walk-thru out of you for whatever they're going to pay you, 30 bucks or 50 bucks or something like that, they're still doing pretty well. [00:23:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, though like - I mean my - my - my point being part to say that, but in part to say like something else I suspect hadn't crossed your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They had a (inaudible at 00:23:34) says that, you know, the walk-thrus are pretty much no financial value to the site unless they go up the same day that the game review goes up and unless they're complete when they go up, so, I don't know. Something's better than nothing I guess that ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like really, I should just tell them that I don't want to write for them anymore and get off all the mailing lists. This is not the first time this has happened, and ... [00:24:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if you're lucky, somebody else will just pick up the last ten levels, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not - I'm not - this one I'm - I'm not sure about, but ... I'm not clear about the details of how you sort of took up the point you were making or sort of interacted with the - the people after you made the comment who were like patronizing and obnoxious. But I guess I - I like have this sort of question of whether you sort of worked against ways that you like could have got a more supportive response. In other words, like deprive yourself in some way of support you could've gotten in the community for the way you're feeling marginally - [00:26:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, see what happened was there was a Q and A session after the talk, and my question was one of many. And when I asked it, like there were cheers from several people in the audience, and the speaker was like that's a problem and I know it's a problem, and I don't know where to find those images.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I think the speaker actually understood my question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was like, "I don't know and that's a problem." And I tried to recruit people to do that kind of blogging, but like it's really hard to find.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible/crosstalk at 00:26:52).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, that was fine. It was after the fact when -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:26:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - you know, this woman came up to me and she was just all patronizing, and I was like seriously. I tried to explain that no, actually I have looked and you might think you don't have a lot of role models because you found 5 out of 400, but I found zero out of thousands. And she continued to be patronizing and ridiculous to me, and that's the point where I cut that conversation short -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and went to go talk to the friend who invited me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's Brenda.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like Br - yeah. Like trying to seek support from her. And then her roommate just dropped this, "Well, you were being reductionist and rude, and I don't think you understand, and like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I take your point, I - I ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she just turned around and walked out of the bookshop. It's like seriously, you're going to say something rude and dickish to me, not even wait for me to respond, whether - like I was still trying to decide if I wanted to challenge the content of what she said or just say something snide about her attitude. But like, she didn't give me a chance to do either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like seriously?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, it sounds kind of horrid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. No, it sounds like that - that - that doesn't sort of ... [00:28:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe it is a tiny bit reductionist to say, you know, well, there's either fem fashion or butch fashion, and never between shall meet. But like ... I feel like A, I would expect Ann at least who has met me several times and knows me like I'd expect her to know that I know there's more than just like the simple binary between fem and butch. And also, like I was trying to ask a question quickly in a Q and A session where, you know, each question was given 20 seconds -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. Right. You're trying not to (overtalk and inaudible at 00:28:55).</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and it's like you don't have time to go into a long discourse about, you know, all of the different variations and interplaying, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And your point in some sense still stands.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Or your - the point that emerged from your question - question which is that there is really only more fem-type stuff out there. [00:29:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I mean you could get into a whole discussion about, you know, lesbian culture, and how there's this assumption that butches are butch because they don't care about fashion, and fashion is a fem thing, and then you're into scapegoating in front of an Indian, you know, going all the way back to the Victorians and how men lost the ability to be fashionable because the Victorians decided that fashion wasn't for men. There's a whole like, you know, replicating heteronirmative gender stereotypes within the queer female community, where you have the early fems and the manly butches. Like there's this - [00:29:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - you could have hours and hours and hours of discourse about that, but not (laughing) said at a Q and A session.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. And none of that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean really.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - none of that spares much on the fact it seems to me that like you'd like to see this particular sort of thing out there and you can't find it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And like, I guess part of what I was asking when I was asking the question was I was hoping like there is some fabulous website that just like, I was using the wrong Google search terms or whatever, -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - but it turns out no, no one can find. And then, a lot of people spoke to me after the fact and said, "Well, you know, I don't know of any queer fashion websites for fat women, but you could look at like all of these awesome websites for fat dudes." There's like, I get that you're trying to be helpful and supportive, but, you know, this idea that if you don't identify as feminine and don't want to dress in like mainstream feminine styles, that your only option is the eight various male subcultures like - [00:30:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Isn't that weird?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - but that's another false dichotomy that you can either dress like a woman or like a man. Like there's - like I feel like the - for both male identified and female identified people, there's a whole range of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - how you can present yourself that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's so frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - how - one thing I'm not clear about I guess because we haven't talked about it, that I didn't think of before, how much does it matter to you that this kind of thing is not out there? Like, in other words, I'm - there's a few different issues in play here. One of them is being treated like crap, and it's a thing which sounds like it's the big one, but I - I guess I'm unclear how much the other matters. Like - [00:31:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - the content of what you're asking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean - I don't know. I'm very lucky in the regard that my high school was very - it's not actually queer friendly, at least accepting, and not hostile to LGBT kids. And then, in college, the - the co-op house that I lived in had a number of gender queer people. Like half the house was somewhere in the LGBT Umbrella. And all of my friends were queer or, you know, at least active allies. And so, it was just (clears throat) - I sort of - I've never had the - the need to see queer role models and media because I didn't have that in my life 'cause I always - I always kind of had that, - [00:32:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like the entire time I've been aware of my sexuality. So in that regard, I'm very lucky, but, you know, there's also the fact that I went to an engineering school that even though, you know, we had parity in terms of male and female admissions, there was still this whole male culture, and a lot of the women I knew were very much about fitting in with the guys. And there's also this aspect of geek culture that, you know, fashion is for people who are too stupid to do real things with their lives. So there's the whole, you know, block of development for my life where I really believed and internalized this message that, you know, there's something wrong with you if you care about fashion or if you care about how you look. And it's only been like in the last two or three years that I've started to realize that - no, actually I do care about how I look, and I care about my clothes, and I want - like there's an image of myself that I want to present to other people, and I don't want that image to be, you know, a person who thinks she's above caring about this shit. [00:33:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's - and again, we could have a whole conversation about fashion and the distraction for women and a way of keeping women in their place, but (sigh) I don't know. It's complicated. And I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it, but I do want to take more care in how I dress and how I present myself, and that's - I don't know. I was always teased for my clothing when I was a child because, you know, my parents bought me cheap clothes that they thought looked good, but... You know, my parents would send me to school in like discount dress pants from Wal-Mart, which is just a horrible combination for so many reasons. It's like you're wearing dress pants, but they're not even quality dress pants. They're like cheap, crappy polyester, and like instead of like wearing what all the other geeks are wearing. [00:34:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Jeans or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, like I have a great deal of fear of committing a fashion faux pas, which is why most of my clothes are fairly plain like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like solid color turtlenecks, solid color button-up shirts, plain jeans. And that - that's boring. That's really boring, and I - but I don't feel comfortable picking my own exciting clothes, so that's why I really want to find fashion magazines or blogs or whatever where I can say okay, this is what people who I think look cool are wearing. [00:34:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean maybe I should just like get over my fear of negative evaluation from other people and say, you know, who cares, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine both are possible. Like - I mean worrying less that way about what other people think, and hopefully, finding people who you like the way they dress, I mean, you know, kind of inspire you to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - kind of like (inaudible at 00:35:35). But now, it seems at least theoretically possible.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm trying really hard not to be upset at my size because well, that way of life's made ys, but it's also not very healthy, but I don't know. There's a big part of me that wishes I could just be skinny because then there - all of these styles that look like crap on me because I'm big, and if I was skinny and had smaller boobs, that would just be fine and ... [00:36:11]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something you struggle with a lot, feeling critical of yourself that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For a long time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For a long time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Like, my parents started telling me that I needed to diet and make sure I didn't put on weight 'cause, you know, when you grow up, it's much harder to take off weight than when you're young, starting when I was 10. Like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Woo.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I did fad diets with my mom throughout middle school and high school. And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, gosh. [00:37:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and like eventually, I got to the point where I was like fuck dieting. This is stupid. But I mean on both sides of my family, all of the women are heavy set. Like all of them. I don't have a single skinny relative. And also, even at my healthiest, when I was working out, you know, five days a week, and eating nothing but vegetables from my farm share, and, you know, local free range, blah, blah, blah meat and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - cooking everything myself. Like I was still a size 16. Like, there is (laughter) - and it wasn't dieting, but it was eating, primarily eating whole foods, home-cooked, like -<br></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And working out a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - doing everything right according to the health experts, and like my muscle to fat ratio was higher, like a much higher density, but I was still pretty big, and ... yeah. And like and on the one hand, I understand that a lot of these things are genetically determined. There's not a whole lot you can do. There's also the evidence that when I was, you know, doing the right things like ... [00:38:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm never going to be a size 4 model, you know, but there still - I don't know. A lot of things would be easier for me if I were skinnier. And it's really hard not to feel frustrated about that. And also, like conflating legitimate concerns. Like I get out of breath more easily because I haven't been working out for two years, and I really should go to the gym for health reasons. Like conflating that with you're a fat, ugly slob, and you're worthless because you're fat, and like those - like some of these things are valid and some of these things are not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they get conflated and like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - it's (sigh) ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like there are times where you've hated yourself for it -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Definitely. [00:39:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - which is incredibly painful, I would think.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other times and ways in which you feel - thought about how you look and what your body ...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really ... I don't know. I don't know if I could say that I've ever liked the way I look. Like there's always things I hate about the way I look, but there is definitely a - when I was working out regularly, and I could see defined muscles, like I could flex and see my biceps or, you know, looking at my back in the mirror, I could see muscles on my back. Like that was, you know, definitely a source of pride of, you know, I have worked at this and look at how strong I am. Roar and yeah. [00:40:30]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have people that you've been with helped? Like - I mean does Dave help you to feel better about things like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He tries.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't sink in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean most of the people I've had intimate relationships with have been friends first, and none of them are what I'd describe as conventionally attractive, so like, ... so I don't know. I guess the answer to that is no. People I've been with haven't really helped because the - the things that attracted us, that - that brought us together weren't looks to start out with. [00:41:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I don't know if that makes any sense, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I've always assumed that the people I've been with are with me for my personality and not for my looks, and, you know, that's fine and ... [00:42:05]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine you've also felt they've been attracted to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but - you can be attracted to someone without thinking they're pretty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, yes...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I mean attractive and beautiful are -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah. No, that's ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: - are - are - are - are different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:42:53]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think the relationship though can be complicated. No, like ...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it is reminding me of - somewhat of other things we've talked about where things spreaded - like you tend to focus more on the more self-critical, you know, side of it. [00:43:59]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Surprising neither of us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now. But we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will do my best to remember to call one friend. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we should - well, keep thinking about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:44:22]</p>

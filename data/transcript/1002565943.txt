<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  What's new, anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, I'm still working on the disability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any word?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I talked to the attorney and I've got to get information for him out of my work files and I'm still accumulating my paperwork for Signa and I've got to give that to him to review before I send it in and the doctors still need to fill out their paperwork for the long term.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's on the long term and he's waiting for [NAME OTHER] to review the transcript from his interview with him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the short term, just to verify everything was accurate, the way it was typed, and that really looked good when I read the report.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good and [PATIENT NAME] did [NAME OTHER] tell you what's going to happen?  Does he just have to write a letter to the disability company or does he have to set up a court date?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's writing, no, he's writing a letter to them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And including all of this information, including, I had a phone interview with a person that does, I can't think of that, I hate when I can't think of words anymore, but he does the like ergonomic—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Evaluation on what you can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's writing a report also based on his phone interview with me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my job description.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he was really great on the phone.  I could tell he really knew what he was doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was really nice so, apparently he's worked with him a lot in the past and he's including things like, because this is such a, you know, they're wanting tests saying yes or no conclusively you have this and there's no such thing with my disease, so he, you know, like the interview with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] discussed the disease and the physical tests that they do—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it's a physical not a blood test, that type of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's also getting the report from the, when I had the physical with the rheumatologist who, the rheumatologists are the ones who diagnosed the disease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, he conclusively diagnosed me a couple years ago also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did he check trigger points on you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, each of them have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I thought so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's how the whole thing had started was with the therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], so my case was real different from most people, where most people are going out looking for doctors trying to diagnose them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was just looking for trying to get better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was denying the disease, so everybody was diagnosing me with it and I was saying no I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I was real reverse of everybody else, so I wanted my life to be complete, it's like no I don't have that, you do this and this and I'll feel better.  Remember I kept wanting to do the chiropractor and the massage therapy and all that, so it was more than massage therapy, it was the neuromuscular specialist who also, man coming out of there it was so funny, it was like okie dokie.  I can remember when I went back, he was like, told you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's really funny.  I like him a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's a good guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that type of attitude, you know, he doesn't force things down your throat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He kind of throws the information out there and lets you digest it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But yeah, it was the first time I met with him and I wasn't looking for a diagnosis from him and he just said, does that hurt and I was like yeah, stop it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was standing up, I wasn't laying on the table or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I was like knock it off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got the rheumatologist to diagnose it, you got [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that diagnosed it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean for eight years and the whole reason I was sent to the rheumatologist wasn't for re—diagnosis, it was because of some of the blood results, that it turned out and I didn't know, till I saw the rheumatologist, why, because [NAME OTHER] tried to get me in with a rheumatologist because he was having difficulty handling my pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they wouldn't take me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like, okay, now you have fibromyalgia, we don't take those patients because there isn't anything else they can do with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's nothing else they can do, so it wasn't them being difficult, it was we don't handle those patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So if you already know what the disease is then that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so then it was to the pain management but when [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had referred me it was, you know, they took me right in and I thought oh it's just because it was a different office and that doctor was great and he was real thorough and everything.  He said no, it's real stubborn fibromyalgia, you've got all the classic symptoms, everything, and we went over it and he said you do not have lupus.  I was like what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the blood work, I guess sometimes he said it's typical that sometimes that can look like that and the blood work, he explained, which was over my head, so they explained a lot of stuff that's over my head but that's great, I like that they really go over the information with me.  At the time you understand it but then later it's like, okay, whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you had three different doctors that diagnosed fibromyalgia, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] too and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and the rheumatologist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that was years ago, I mean that was way before the disability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I can't see how the disability company can say you don't have this or that you're not disabled when the doctors are saying you had it and you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's just a matter of getting all the information together, hopefully.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's this stupid ERISA thing where congress said they're not responsible so they're not even trying to get the information.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's, what are you talking about, ERISA?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's an ERISA case, I have an ERISA case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the short term where I bought it through the company.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where I have no course of action other than hiring an attorney and going through all of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're not responsible and accountable for trying to get this information and that's why people go through so much hell, unless it's a private account like my long term now is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's one of the things I have to bring him is where when they got rid of my job after I went out on disability—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I held on to my, I converted my long term over—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've been paying for that on my own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They've sent me paperwork back showing and stating that it's now a private account and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that changes the rules?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In terms of it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So in the long term, not for the short term it won't change because that was filed under the other one but for the long term it'll be a private.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which means that they're responsible for making—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For getting the information—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Information.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doing the discovery and the reason is that I can't sue them for, what is it, for not doing their job—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And all that, so to where the other one, I have to present all information.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But the average person like me doesn't know all this stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you need an attorney to help you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't know what to gather and what to get, so when they say well we don't have the information and we're looking for reasons why you're not able to work, I'm thinking well I've proved it, so to me I've proved it and when they say we want this, I'm thinking well I've showed you this and, as you know, I pulled all the information from the doctors, all the stuff I did before I finally got an attorney.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that just wasn't enough for them, so you really do need an attorney and the longer you wait, the longer you're going without any income.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's, it pushes people into that whole financial thing where, you know, it's been since April that I've brought in any income and, you know, you're looking at refinancing your house, you look at, you know, you lose, people lose their houses, everything, if I wasn't with [NAME OTHER], you know, if I didn't have a husband bringing in income, I would have lost everything before now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is [NAME OTHER] making enough to at least cover the basic expenses?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we cover some but not everything, like he can't cover the house also and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what's happening, are you able to borrow that just to get by?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, when I get that, you know, I get about, what is it, like 67,000 was what I was making so that'll be a huge chunk of our—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so now I'm looking at a loan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, like a second mortgage you mean or just a personal loan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm trying to decide, I've got to decide quick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh and then the hope is that when the disability kicks in they'll give you back benefits, back to when the doctors put you on disability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have to, yeah, if you win, you win back to that but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did your attorney say how long that might take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From when I met with him, he said it could take a year to two, one to two years because if it goes to court—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then it depends on the judge and, you know, the judge can take forever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, they can take nine months to when they want to rule on it, you know, to think about and I will never go to court, you know, that's where you never get to go and have your say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you won't go to court?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How come?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't work like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only the attorneys go—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And talk to the judge.  The attorneys go like one time, talk to the judge—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why everything has to be in the file in an ERISA case.  He said everything has to be in the file the first time when he sends it to Signa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if it's not, then it can't be included later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so he wants to be real thorough then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now see, I wouldn't have known that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On my last filing, before you sue, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can't include something later and go well what about this or I've got my sleep study showing this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and who's the attorney you're using again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's really, he's really great to work with and talk to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know, he's not in a big law firm so you're dealing with him directly all the time and even if he has a paralegal call you, it's because he asked them to call you about this specifically, he needs this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not they're working your case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's real ethical and honest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if you were to talk to him, he tells you up, he told me right up front, you know, if you want to talk to him, he prefers you call and, you know, set up a meeting time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For a phone conference, you know, and he laughed about how it's always easy to talk to an attorney until you hire one and then you can't find them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's true and he's like, you know, he said that he prefers you do that so he can make sure he has your case file there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Instead of I'll have to get back to you on that, I've got to look at that, he said that ways it's more, it's amazing in 15 minutes I've never had to talk to the man more than about 5 or 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In that time, you can get so much done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he's very organized and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He sounds like a good one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  As a matter of fact, one of the doctors told me, he said he's real ethical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said that's what I want to know.  I was like great, so I feel really good and comfortable and he was real good about the information price wise up front of what he thought this would run.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he charging you an hourly rate or a percentage?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hourly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no they don't charge a percentage on this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On social security, which they're going to file social security too, social security, those attorneys, they do that percentage wise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so you're going to file for social security disability in the near future you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, see he told me to wait because he said they never pay in the first six months so I haven't done that yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that was good information.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I was going to file that one, thinking well I got screwed on that one, I'd go ahead and he said don't file it yet, wait till a bit towards a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when was your last, the last that you worked, do you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE] was the last day I worked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're coming up on a year in just a couple months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know what's funny, I don't miss it, yet if I physically felt up to it, you know, it's not something that I don't want to do, does that make sense.  I want to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But because I know I can't physically, I don't feel the drive to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it had become so stressful too.  The situation between trying to take care of your own health and trying to get your job done, the combination was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like this week with the weather and all, I just have felt like crap, like this morning I almost missed my appointment, I slept till, I fell back asleep after I took the boys to school and I fell asleep until eleven, I woke up, you know, I'm sitting there and I hadn't taken that Provigil yet and then I took both of them and that was at eleven so now I'll probably be up till whenever tonight, so I'll be all screwed up but, you know, I get up at five thirty with them but I've been trying to, you know, lay back down and then have them wake me up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like 2 minutes before we leave, so I'm getting up after six instead of at five thirty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that, you know, was helping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've been trying to go to the pool, you know, as often as I can during the week instead of just, you know, a couple days a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how often are you getting there on average?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, see now today I slept through the morning and then yesterday it snowed so that's why it's like trying to go as I, you know, and then I'll go, you know, tomorrow and Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're trying to go—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're trying to go five days a week but if you get there like three that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About an average maybe, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you go, can you still feel the benefits?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, it's such a psychological thing now, I was telling it to the therapists that work there, I said do you know when I get here, just smelling the chlorine, I think I start feeling better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You probably do, it's probably a conditioned response, it teaches you or conditions you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what I think it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your muscles to relax, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I swear I feel better not walking down the hallway into it from the outside but once I get and I smell it right then but by the time I get in there and you're signing in and then you go to get dressed, I'm moving better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before I get in the pool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I really do think it is now and they know, I have to watch myself driving there because one day, when I hadn't been for a while, I caught myself driving really bad, I was starting to get an aggressive driver, like the pool wasn't going to be there when I got there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought what are you doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were so anxious to get there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what it was, it's that beneficial that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like you can't wait to get to it because you know how much better, you just want to get in that water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [PATIENT NAME] are you just doing therapy on your own now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's all I've been doing for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Since you stopped the class.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My class was over in June so that's, yeah, it's just really, and I, you know, I don't, you don't want to get out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Well, I think it's great, I hope you can keep going then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wish everybody that, you know, felt like I did could have a private therapy pool, not necessarily at home, that you know you can just wake up and go into so you felt better right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would a hot tub do the same thing or do you need something deeper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.  Well, it's the heated pool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean you can't do all the work out in a hot tub but, yeah, it's the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have a hot tub at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  You know, my parents have a pool which they've sold their house now and they're moving by me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But my mom used to always say come use the pool here and I was like it's not warm enough.  Now she says I wished we [INAUDIBLE] so that we understood how hard you needed it, she said with the hot tub in it would help you, I said yeah.  She said well we can control that hotter for you if you want to come over anytime.  I should have done that more but, yeah, she didn't understand.  Now she's starting to understand that 10 degrees makes all the difference in the world.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well maybe once you get out of financial struggles, maybe you could get a hot tub or something at home if that would help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it would be for medicinal purposes too.  I've heard of people having their pain doctor or somebody write for a hot tub if it, you know, if it's therapeutic.  I don't think, I don't know if the insurance would pay for it or not though, probably not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it would help you feel better it would be nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, God yeah, I mean that's, because that's something I would do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'm thinking if it was at home it might be easier to get to than having to go to the pool.  How far is the pool from your house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It takes me 2 hours to do the round trip.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So my morning is shot when I do the pool, plus you know you shower but you also have to do your hair, you know, so that's not over with, that's just 2 hours getting there and back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At least 2 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know, depending on, you know, if there's a wait for the showers and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's not talking to anyone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So if anyone gets visiting or anything then it takes longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And traffic, so if everything goes smooth, you can get out the door and back in two hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it's an hour workout, so I spend an hour in the pool, so the drive is over 20 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Each way and then you've got to have time to change, shower and all—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then when you get home, you've still got to dry your hair and all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's if I wash my hair there, you know, if there's not a wait for the showers.  If there's a wait for the showers, then you can't, I don't want to hold everybody up, so then you have to do all that when you get home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's time consuming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's, yeah, so there's an hour on the road that's additional.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm just thinking about what else is going to help you manage this fibromyalgia so it doesn't, you know, interfere with your life even more and it sounds like the pool therapy helps.  Any of the medications, are any of them helping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think that Lyrica just has really been great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think that's the best thing that I've tried out of all of them.  I've been able to cut down on the Morphine and when I meet with the, I guess he's going to, I asked him to cut down on the Morphine when I called in for a refill last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, yeah, because when I met with him, when we went on Lyrica, we talked about that was the goal to get off the Kadian—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the Morphine completely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he said when I wasn't using the Morphine, I guess, I don't know how he was going to do it but I guess next time I meet with him he's going to cut the Kadian in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I'm ready for him to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the long run, it's going to be a lot safer for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I remember all the work I've had on my gums.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see people lose all their teeth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From receding gum lines?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or the dryness, they start getting cavities and they need root canals, their teeth rot out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I had a woman years ago that I worked with who was in her early 40's and she already lost all of her teeth, it was just awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How long had she been on all of it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A few years, I don't remember how many years but it was a few years.  I've seen people lose their hearing.  Two patients lost their hearing from being on narcotics long term.  They scare me long term, I mean short term they're wonderful but long term—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know they don't warn us about it?  I have never been warned about it and everybody that I've talked to, no one knows any of this stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the hearing loss, I don't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The doctors don't tell us this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know if it's even been reported but I believe, I really do believe it's from the patients because they went and saw an ear, nose, and throat specialist and they couldn't find any other reason that they were losing their hearing and they were both on long term narcotics, I believe that's it and the dental problems, I know dentists know that, if they see patients on long term narcotics they know to watch for it because, you know, it just drys the mouth out and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I get yelled at for not taking care of my teeth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that was my dentist that's been here forever and is considered one of the best dentists and I said, I was like what, you know, when he retired and somebody else took over, I said tell me what I'm not doing and he's like you're doing a good job.  I was like yeah and he's the one that fixed my receding gum line.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I was getting so angry, it was like what am I not doing right then, you know, tell me what's happening and I'm the one saying look.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And yeah, you get so frustrated because you feel like your whole body is falling apart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the one lady that I know that was on them for years, she would break a bone because her bones were getting weaker and then they wouldn't heal for months, you know, where it normally takes six weeks, after three or four months it still wouldn't heal.  She got off the narcotics and now she's, she broke her neck actually and it healed just fine but if she had been still on the pain pills, I'm afraid she would, I don't know what would have happened, so I mean there are a lot of long term effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She needs to be more careful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well she had a seizure actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she couldn't even control it but, again, the good news is she was able to heal from it because she was off the pain, the narcotics but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So yeah, long term they have some scary side effects, so it's good if there's an alternative like Lyrica that seems to be a lot safer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know, I think people, some people aren't honest about the medicine—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In what—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the truth is that, about what helps and doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because narcotics take the edge off but the one that really helps with the pain, like the Ultram, those are the ones that really help you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Deal with it, I mean really address the fibromyalgia pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The narcotics, they address the pain differently so the people that just keep wanting to take them and all that stuff, I think they're going for a buzz or they're getting hooked on them or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it's a combination, you're right, some people do get an elevation in mood which feels good, they feel better on them so they think that's a good reason to keep taking them but they don't always weigh the side effects or like you said, some people get addicted to them where they initially work, then they don't so they need to take more and it works for a while so they think gosh this is great and they start to take more and more and that gets to be a vicious cycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, you know, the one I told you had to quit, [NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, see I think she had a problem with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a growing problem.  I tried to call in a refill, not for a narcotic because I don't prescribe them but for a different medicine to the [DEIDENTIFIED] and they called me back and said we need you to fax in the refills and I said why, I've never faxed in refills.  They said because we're getting so many forged prescriptions called in now the DEA is requiring us to have doctors fax in the prescriptions now.  It's a huge problem, I guess, that there is a large prescription drug abuse in [DEIDENTIFIED] and so they really have to watch it closely and there are kids dying from it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you heard the news, taking pain pills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The pain pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In fact, my wife just told me [NAME OTHER] was on pain pills, the actor that died in [DEIDENTIFIED], pain pills, antianxiety pills, the combination, they think, is probably what killed him so people don't always realize the dangers that go along with them.  They think they are safe and they can be, at low doses for short times, but in high doses with long term use, they can start to cause serious problems so I'm so glad you're able to back off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I know even the Ultram, when I first went on it, from Vicodin to that and that was when I first had the surgery and couldn't get out of the pain when this all started—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we were trying to figure out what was going on, it was making my heart race and I was having like an anxiety, you know, I felt like I was dying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I couldn't, you know, I was having trouble breathing and everything and I called the doctor and it was, you know, an obstetrician that had, or a gynecologist that done it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I called the office, I was at the mall and I was freaking out and they were like well you probably just took it took close together, the doses too close together and, you know, they just totally blew me off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like, hello and, you know, I was having a reaction, it was not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, where your arms are going numb and that was not okay but sure enough if I took it, like if I forgot that I took it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Couldn't remember if I took it and I took it again, that's what happens and it's not fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have to be real careful it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well now I carry, I do everything in, I had to do a pill thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good idea, those pill boxes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't know how anybody can do without, whether they're just going oh I need them now or whatever, you have to do that or else you do that where you forget and then you take them again too close together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you start hurting again, you're like oh I don't, or you get busy and stuff and that's what happens, you just can't remember with everything going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I was trying to do the timing thing and it was like, oh did I or didn't, yeah, so yeah with the pill thing then I know what I've taken, if I have or haven't and that's it and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or then like with the narcotics, it helps to, you know, that helped wean myself but it was a visual thing too, that's what you have for today so even on the bad days, I said do you really need it right now, you know, I could buy time on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that helped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the bottom line is, in a lot of different ways you're finding out what works like using the pill box to keep track of your medicines, the Lyrica to help the pain so you can get off the narcotics, the pool therapy, you're learning what you have to do to manage it so it doesn't manage you and your life and that's the important thing because some people get it and it just takes over their life and they just stop doing anything and then it gets worse and it can always get worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you know, I figured out what it is if you have like fibromyalgia and stuff, remember we talked about it before that it's, when I took the clinic and I was having to learn how to accept the illness and, damn now I can't think of the word.  I'm going to start writing words down.  I'm going to have to start carrying a little thing, the fibro fog, I hate it, it sucks.  But it's a different word of dealing with the illness because people think of accept like you're endorsing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When you're accepting it, it's like endorsing it and that's the problem, so they don't want to accept it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so they don't want to accept it, it's though they're caving in, it feels like you're caving into the disease and you've, you're just giving in to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sort of like acknowledge it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so exactly, you just have to acknowledge it.  You have to acknowledge that you have it, you know, you can deal with anything, you know the saying, I can deal with anything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, if I know what it is I'm dealing with, therefore, if you acknowledge that you have it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can deal with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's the difference I think, like in that clinic, is acknowledging and that was the word, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're very helpful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it makes perfect sense though, it's like somebody who has a heart problem and if they don't acknowledge they have a heart problem, they're not going to do very well because they're not going to get treatment or do what they need to do.  On the other hand, if they accept it to a degree where they just give in and say I have a heart problem, I can't do anything, that's not healthy either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The word accept is not a good word, it's acknowledge.  If we acknowledge it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you can do something about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a different mindset.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See, we make a good team.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We could work together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, yeah, that's a great idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I thought is with the fibro stuff, I thought I'd really like to, you know, it's like [INAUDIBLE] at point is, get a, like that fibro clinic—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think they've stopped it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really, they weren't getting enough referrals or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they were, the classes were full.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], the one who put it together—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Apparently, she's not working there anymore, they got rid of her because they didn't have enough hours for her or something.  She's working over here at a new facility they have at [DEIDENTIFIED], it's a really great facility.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember the name of it but [INAUDIBLE] too.  [NAME OTHER] told me that she's up here now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] she went to get her master's degree, she went to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she awesome, I mean she is a really excellent physical therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he said it's a really great facility—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when it opened, he almost went to work there but they didn't have enough hours and stuff at the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so that's when he went to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been open for a while, you know, it didn't just open.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she's working there now so if you need a good therapist close by, she's over there and so she's not there to run it now and then, what's her name that was doing the palates, is going to be going to the new facility that they're opening up north, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, without her running it and stuff, I don't know how they do it and I said that's awful, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it just kind of fell apart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] the one that was working with her on it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She went out on medical leave with her husband and I guess she didn't come back then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like family leave or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she didn't come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] was excellent.  She's the one that, she worked with her on coordinating the whole thing and she worked with the boys on their physical therapy too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] did some and [NAME OTHER] was just really sweet too and she did, in the pool part, she would give us our instructions—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so when we wanted to continue the pool therapy and do classes for us—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were all carrying on that we wanted [NAME OTHER] because I guess in like the class before us they had another therapist do it instead of [NAME OTHER] for the pool part—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that class really liked her and we were like we'll kick their butt, we want [NAME OTHER] but [NAME OTHER] was just so fun, she was really great, you know, I hope she's doing okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm more worried about, you know, how she's doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, so you're having to kind of look around though too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that just frustrates me because it's like I really would like, remember like when they did the, I really loved working with the kids doing the suicide survivor support group with the kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would so love to be able to do that again and then I worry, well what if I'm not up to it that night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it's like one night a month but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well I think the key [PATIENT NAME] is to figure out what you can do, you know, what's meaningful for you, what you're able to do physically and emotionally but also give you some purpose and meaning in life again too because one of the biggest struggles people have when they get disabled psychologically is a big part of what's given that person meaning, their job or their career, is gone and if they don't find something else to replace it, whether it's a volunteer activity or something with their  family or whatever it is, people start getting more and more  depressed and they start, you know, it's a vicious cycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I don't feel, it's funny, I don't talk to friends or anything during the day.  When I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] Friday, [NAME OTHER] works where I used to work and I was talking to [NAME OTHER] and they were saying oh did you hear so and so died and I said, he said do remember so and so and I said yeah and I almost said something negative about her and she's one of the few people I would and he said yeah they're dead, did you hear that and I was like no and I said oh I almost said something.  He said something and I said that's what I was going to say, wasn't she kind of an angry person.  She was, she was very angry, she was an angry elf.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is someone you worked with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she was very angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she was so nasty the one time I had to deal with her.  I went over to support one of the IT guys—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they were carrying on so bad every time she called in something and it was related to a product that I had implemented and there was an attacher product that they supported and I went over to help them, for moral support, and she was so nasty.  Her manager was standing there and not stopping her and even her coworkers were just cringing around her, so she was a very angry person.  You talk about somebody who's just not happy in life, this is her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So yeah, no wonder she died of a heart attack, okay, and you know that's a lot of stress on you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They say stress kills, she killed herself and I mean that's an awful thing to say—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I understand, oh I've seen it happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think it's the job, I think it was her and that's why they hated it every time they got a call from her, she just looked for something to hate and bitch about and she started screaming about how if I'd installed the product correctly to start with, and she knows nothing about the product technically, it's the one I went, I spent that whole summer running around installing across the country—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And two days after I got married, I spent two weeks in [DEIDENTIFIED] on that big thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so supposedly now she knows how to do it, okay, that thing, yeah, the one that took up 60% of day supporting and she was, she's a transcriptionist but she was going to tell me how to do this so I was standing there going I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so her manager just wasn't doing anything about it and I tried calming her down and I tried doing all the right things but I finally said, you know, I'm not having this conversation with you anymore, I've already explained how things work and what we can and can't do so if you want to have this conversation anymore or again, we'll be doing it in [NAME OTHER]'s office.  I've already explained to you that he's aware of how I installed it and the decisions that were made so if you want to continue this, it'll be in [NAME OTHER]'s office and that's the district manager and I walked off.  When I was standing up to her and all, her coworkers were like, you can't do that and I was like why doesn't anybody stand up to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Enough of this, so that's why when he mentioned her name, I was like she's kind of an angry—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, that's the only thing that came to mind and then when he said they found her dead, yeah of course I felt bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then when he said heart attack, I kind of thought yeah she had diabetes, you know, a bad heart and stuff, I thought it just didn't surprise me, it kind of went together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, well and [PATIENT NAME] that's what happens to people if they don't manage their anger, it manages them—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or their emotions, not just anger but especially anger.  Did I ever tell you about the woman I saw have a heart attack right in front of me, she was so angry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Years ago I was working at the hospital and there was a very stoic German woman who was depressed and her family brought her into the hospital.  She didn't want to be there though but they brought her in because she was so depressed and I was sitting and talking with her like you and I are talking and all the sudden she just collapsed and I hollered for help, there was another doctor in the unit, we got her into a gurney and wheeled her in and they did the tests on her and she had a heart attack but what was amazing about it was when they did the cardiac catheterization, normally what they find with a heart attack is there's an artery that's blocked from build up of cholesterol and plaque, her arteries were wide open, no blockage at all and the cardiologist said what had happened is she had gotten so upset and so angry that the coronary artery actually spasmed and cut the blood flow off to her heart muscle and she had a heart attack—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just from her anger, purely anger, no blockage at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's, that left an impression on me that showed me if we don't deal with our emotions, it can kill us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And fortunately, she—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [NAME OTHER] gets real upset—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	His face turns red and all from his high blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like, you need to calm down.  He's like I'm fine and it's like, no you're not, and he gets so upset over things that's it's like you can't do anything about it or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are things going with him at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're going to have our big talk I guess this weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, he could tell I was really upset the other night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was like why are you sounding like you're so angry at me?  I said I'm not angry.  I kept telling him I'm not angry, I'm not angry and he said well you're obviously upset, I said but I' m not angry and I said, you know, he said something and I said, he said well I tried to ask you when you went to leave and I said that's just it, you try talking when I'm going out the door to pick up the boys or, you know, like now I'm trying to go to bed, I said I can't talk to you then, it's like, so he finally has started wanting to talk—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's like, and but then he was just really really, he's been really perceptive, like I was trying to make something different and I thought it'd be fun to cook with [NAME OTHER], you know, he wanted cookbooks for Christmas, well I wanted to cook and so it turned a lot more difficult than it should have been and so [NAME OTHER] just kind of jumped in, plus there was an ingredient that I had screwed up when I told him what I needed at the store and I said, oh I must not have written it down wrong or I read wrong and he said, I'll run to the store and get it and I said, oh you don't have to, you know, I don't mind.  You know, he's really great like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He really is awesome in a lot of things.  Like how many guys would just, he does that stuff all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so he comes back and says don't expect it all the time and [NAME OTHER] says but we do and I said yeah, you should have thought of that before you spoiled me so, because he does and it's close and he'll just run out and then he just says, he goes here [NAME OTHER] give me that.  You know, he [INAUDIBLE] and then it didn't turn out the way, you know, they made it sound.  I was like oh, he said I don't care for this, and he was no I think it's good, you know, every thing's good, you know, I said shut up, I don't even like it, so yeah he's so funny.  Well, yeah, you know, he's a chef and how long [INAUDIBLE].  He's so sweet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then last night, I made something I hadn't made in years but I have made before, we take the lid off and the chicken is raw, bad deal, and I called the boys and they kind of went like, oh bad, you know, so what's the deal with this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] is like well, however, so I was like you can have something else or, because they're like we'll wait so [NAME OTHER] the chicken man and will try to make it work.  I was just laughing, I'm like God—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said I'm just going back to the basics, this really sucks and he said, you know, we haven't cooked together in a while and that's the thing that we always enjoyed doing together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And a lot of people, you get in each other's hair in something like that, we like doing that together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he likes to cook and he makes a terrible mess but, you know, he's funny in the kitchen so, no, he jumped right in and I was hurting by them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so he took over cooking the chicken.  I said can you help with that part and he goes, I said something about how long I'd been standing, he goes, you don't even have to explain, just, or when he walked in the door I was sweeping the floor and he just looked at me and goes would you like me to take over on that, he could tell I was hurting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I tell him, you know, I really appreciate when you do those things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's good, it reinforces it.  So how are you doing mood wise, are you doing, been relatively even or up or down or both?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I've probably been even.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm still on the two pills of Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Remember we cut back to two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, let me grab my notes actually, and that's working okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, so can we cut back more or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So can we cut back more?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can, the thing we have to be careful about is if it's giving you some relief from pain, your pain level could go up and I don't know how much it is if it's helping at all but that's the one thing we have to be careful about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it was [DATE], it's been a month, yeah, how do you feel about that, do you want to try cutting back again or do you want to wait until, because if you're cutting back on the pain meds and Cymbalta at the same time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I've been at this level on the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so how do you feel, do you feel like you want to try cutting back or do you feel like you want to wait?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, let's try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you want to cut back, let's see, cut back to one then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I see what you're saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean the timing is important too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no, I see what you're saying that's why I'm thinking about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [PATIENT NAME], what I would suggest, if you're okay with this, is maybe wait for a little bit longer.  I mean if you really feel strongly that you want to try cutting back we could but you're not on a high dose by any stretch, so if it was me, I would probably wait at least another month or so, wait till it starts warming up a little bit maybe, hopefully, make sure you're doing okay on the Lyrica—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I see what you're saying, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah because the pain issue, yeah.  Let's do that but can we write the prescription so it's for that dose, the new one for that dose?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For the, which dose, the two a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, just so it's not so expensive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'd be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now here's another option, you're taking two 30's which is 60 mg, do you want me to just write you for one 60 mg capsule, that might be cheaper as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  Oh yeah, because you had to do that so I could do the three a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you getting it filled locally?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and I'll go and put a lot of refills, like a years' worth of refills even though we may cut back before that and if we do, I'll just get you a new prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you doing okay with the Topamax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and the Provigil, let's see, you've got refills on that one, and it's working okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, unless I, you know, the days that it doesn't work—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I haven't gotten maybe enough sleep.  I mean there are days where it still isn't working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm probably not getting enough sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so most of the time it works?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good, so there's the prescription for the Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.  Anything else that we haven't talked about that you wanted to, any concerns, questions, problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think, I think I need to, I'm just having trouble, we'll have to address that one next time, my focusing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and I don't know, again, if coming down on some of the medicines may help with that.  I mean I don't know how much was the fibro versus the medications.  I think the more we can cut back on the medicines to a level that still manages your symptoms, you know, but if we can cut back that may help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it phases though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Goes in and out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do really good, like last week I was right on top of the game.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now this week, I haven't gotten anything done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Well, that sounds less like medication then, because the medication has been the same both weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] I think the other thing is you're doing a good job at trying to stay active and keep doing things because the thing you don't want to do is become inactive where you stop doing things, both for your depression and your fibromyalgia, it's real important to keep moving and focusing on things mentally and physically and you're doing that, like going to the pool, you know, working on this disability paperwork, getting that taken care of, you know, any—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm getting a lot done around the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're getting changes made there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good, you want to stay active and my hope is there will come a time when you can start finding things that you really enjoy doing, you know, that you feel passionate about, whatever they are, you know, hobbies, interests, just to kind of have some focus back again, because that actually helps people feel better physically and emotionally too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean last summer, even just the things I did—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were great but right now I'm just busy with stuff at the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's not, you know, and that's what I think I was starting with was when I was talking to him, I just, you know, I don't talk to anyone except, that's weird, I just realized the other day that I don't talk to my girlfriends or guy friends or anything anymore and it's not that, you know, I just don't have time or don't feel the need and I used to be really like that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, really contacting everybody and out there all the time but I just don't feel the need to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's okay but we do need to be careful—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I'm doing okay with being me right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's good, as long as you don't get isolated and that's the thing with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's just it, I've checked in with myself on that and I'm not feeling like I need to stay in the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And be isolated or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or avoid people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, because I go to the pool and I visit with those ladies and stuff and I just love them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're all so cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's perfect, you know, you find a level of interaction that works for you and that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think that's just it, I do have my interactions but, and I did catch a time where I was realizing that I didn't want to leave the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like it was too much work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought, geez, what's wrong with you, get out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, that's what you do, not push yourself, yeah, so you don't [INAUDIBLE], all right good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean I put on makeup everyday when get up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's important.  So let's see here, two weeks from today work for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] coming again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two weeks and I'm coming again?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, if that works for you, that works for me, that's the [DATE] so, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, sounds excellent.  Keep up the good work and stay warm.  It looks like the front might be coming in.  I heard we might get some more snow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really, I thought that was it for us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I heard this morning, this afternoon we might get a dusting they said.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's not nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, then I think it's supposed to get warmer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you take care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, you do the same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They can be challenging can't they.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I don't like either of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a difficult time.  All right, see you later, bye bye.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>FEMALE VOICE: Good afternoon. I'm very sad. </p>

<p>MALE VOICE: What seems to be the problem?</p>

<p>FEMALE VOICE: I'm very sad. You know, I always have problems with my husband. I'm very sad. I don't know what I'm going to cope with him. </p>

<p>CATHY: My family and I have a problem and the problem has to do with the relationship of my nuclear family, my husband and my children and myself with my parents and his parents. The problem also involves the fact that my husband and I adopted several children of different races and it's the acceptance of these children as grandchildren by our parents that is the problem.</p>

<p>NAOMI: My family and I have a problem. Well actually, I guess it's my problem. I'm 28 years old and I'm still at home. I live at home and all my friends have their own apartments and I think I should move out but I feel kind of badly about it and I don't know how to talk to my parents and so I'm still at home and I'm still having problems.</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, my family and I, we have a problem and I don't know, maybe it's my problem but we (inaudible) disagreement. You know, like my parents, they like me go school, you know. I just passed high school and they like me go to college (inaudible at 0:01:53.4) but I don't really want to do that, you know. I got some other ideas, maybe try to find a job or something like that. So things between me and my parents, man, they ain't too cool right now. 0:02:03.8</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Hi, I'm Lannette Shizuru and this is Allen Ivey. The purpose of this tape is to raise issues about the role culture plays in counseling. As you know, different cultures have different styles of helping and different ways of coping. Allen, do you have any experience with this?</p>

<p>ALLEN: Okay, my own experience has been basically come up the hard way, Lannette, in terms of I started out saying that counseling was a generic process that would probably work the same across culture, a variance of the school of hard knocks, but different cultures do indeed respond differently. For example, in the U.S. we tend to respond to the individual using the word "you," "I," very much and how does an individual want to make his or her decision? Whereas for example in the Japanese culture, a different emphasis I found is more appropriate. What would that be?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well I think in the Asian cultures what is more important is a relational-type of - a systems approach to counseling where what's really important is not just the individual, what they can do, but really how the person fits in a group process and how a harmony can be reached for the person to adapt better or acculturate better, not only with his own culture, but also with the majority White culture. 0:03:19.7</p>

<p>ALLEN: There has been a movement of course Lannette, toward family therapy and toward assistant view in counseling and psychotherapy yet most individual counseling still focuses on the individual and his or her feelings. The particular set of tapes we are going to show coming up shortly will focus, first of all, will have a White pair doing what we'd call a (ph) Rogerian-style of counseling focusing very much on the individual and her feelings. Second tape is a Japanese counseling interview and the focus of this is going to be a little different.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: That's right. And the focus of the second tape was really on how the person fit in with their family and how you could raise the family's awareness of what the person was going through and how the family maybe could help the individual. So a lot more emphasis was placed on communication skills or what the group really felt about this, not just how the individual felt. We started with the individual but we really want to work through a harmony of how the support system can help the individual to cope.</p>

<p>ALLEN: And finally you're going to see a third tape in which we have disharmony: two cultures working together and ending up, in effect, a cultural conflict. Anything you want to add before we show these last three tapes?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I think the important point about the last tape in terms of the culture conflict is really that the counseling situation is really a culture in itself and the person has come in with a culture of his own and what's really debilitating to that person is that counseling, per se, is a very Western perspective; coming into an office, talking to someone, sharing their feelings is really not the way a lot of people want to be helped. They are looking for something else. 0:04:53.2</p>

<p>ALLEN: So at this point let's look at three counseling, short counseling (inaudible) role plays, get some idea of some alternative approaches to the counseling process. Okay?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Okay.</p>

<p>LARRY: Good morning. You're Cathy?</p>

<p>CATHY: Uh huh. </p>

<p>LARRY: My name is Larry, and hi. I'm a social worker here and I understand that you wanted to talk over some stuff, so maybe you could help me by understanding what brings you in here today. 0:05:32.6</p>

<p>CATHY: Okay. I'll try to explain it. My husband and I, we have three children and two of them are adopted. They're different races and we're at peace with this. We're really glad we did it. We've never regretted it. We are now though on the verge of moving, his company is moving him back home to his home and his parents are very much - and my parents are there also. And they oppose the adoptions and they've learned to tolerate us over the years and we'd go home for a couple days at a time but living next door is going to be different and Andy's really worried about how to handle this relationship with our parents who are still important to us even though we knew they opposed it when we adopted the kids and we made that decision to go ahead and do it anyhow, and that's okay. But we're also concerned about the other relationship. 0:06:31.5</p>

<p>LARRY: Well as you imagine what life is going to be like once you get back to the town where your parents and his parents live, what kinds of things do you think might happen with you?</p>

<p>CATHY: I'm afraid that it will probably be like when we first started bringing the kids home and it was a novelty at first. Relatives came out of the walls we hadn't seen in years and showed up to see the kids. You know, you can handle that a little when the kids were young and the kids didn't know the different because they can't keep track of all those relatives anyhow. But I'm worried now that the kids are in their early teens and they will know if they're treated differently and that's what I'm worried about because his parents and my parents both have other grandchildren and they tend to see our adopted children differently than they see their biological grandchildren. 0:07:32.8</p>

<p>LARRY: What is it, specifically if you can (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CATHY: - How they treat them differently? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>LARRY: If you can think about it that - no, no. What is it specifically that goes on with you as you have seen these kinds of things happen in the past and as you think about the kinds of things that are likely to happen in the future once you get back? What comes to mind in terms of how you feel about all of this? </p>

<p>CATHY: I guess I'm really fearful that, that the relationship will become (ph) confrontive, that it won't be a peaceful one anymore because of the intensity of living near each other and the expectations of seeing more of each other, which until now, because we've lived away it wasn't there. You know, they knew we could only get home occasionally, once or twice a year or something. And the smooth relationships with my in-laws and my parents are important to me and they are to my husband too, and we both come from large families and we just don't like to see that relationship threatened. So I guess I resent their, what to me is a limitation that they can't accept the children and yet I can understand that, but it's easier to understand it from far away.</p>

<p>LARRY: That's a very difficult situation. On the one hand, you're really concerned about wanting to have harmonious relationships between yourself and your family and your parents, your husband's parents, and at the same time you're also afraid that because of their feelings about your adopted children, that it may be very difficult for things to go smoothly. Is that...? 0:09:24.7</p>

<p>CATHY: Yeah. And I'm afraid for the kids, because I don't want them to feel like they're different.</p>

<p>LARRY: What do you think you can do to help to bring about a more favorable kind of interaction between all of these people?</p>

<p>CATHY: I don't really know and I guess part of why I'm here is because I can't anticipate all of what might happen, and that makes me more afraid than if I could anticipate it. But I've learned from having a multi-racial family for this many years that a lot of the fears we had didn't happen but a lot of things we didn't anticipate did happen. And I can't anticipate everything that will happen when we go back, and I guess that's, you know, the biggest thing, what bothers me.</p>

<p>LARRY: Of course it's gonna - </p>

<p>LANNETTE: Could I break in here?</p>

<p>LARRY: Certainly.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, what's been going (audio gap at 0:10:22.8) explain what you've been doing. Cathy, how do you feel about this interview?</p>

<p>CATHY: It feels comfortable because Larry is asking me how - letting me express myself and that's really what I came for. I don't know that there's any one answer, or if I had knew what to have done I would have; you know, it'd already be in action or I would have done it already. Over the years we've maintained a decent relationship, fairly good I think under the circumstances and he's letting me vent my fears about what might come. 0:10:58.3</p>

<p>LANNETTE: And Larry, what was your purpose in the way you handled this interview with Cathy (ph) Spaum?</p>

<p>LARRY: Well, it became evident within a few seconds after the interview began that Cathy was in conflict about the problem which she mentioned and I felt that there were a couple of things that needed to happen. The first thing, and the most important thing was she needed to have an opportunity to express that conflict clearly and get some support acknowledging the legitimacy of that conflict and an indication of the willingness on my part to try to help, and my plan really, which I was about to put into action just at the point that you joined us was to begin to talk about some of the specific kinds of things that might come up, and to talk about how she's handled some of those things in the past, what worked, what didn't work, as a way of helping her kind of explore the dimensions of the relationships and how she could intervene to perhaps do some things differently than happened in the past in a way that would make things go better. 0:12:11.5</p>

<p>Obviously my focus in this interview was pretty much exclusively on Cathy. I really didn't get into how the other members of her family or her parents' family or her husband's parents' family were reacting to this because I felt at this point that really what was important was to get at her feelings and to help her to deal with some of those issues.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Okay, I think that's a really important point, that this is a pretty traditional type of counseling situation where a lot of your verbalizations was on Cathy's feelings and how she would deal with them. In fact what you wanted to find out was what she could do, you know, as an individual to like maybe change her feelings or change her perceptions of how this situation could be changed and it was very little of maybe thinking of bringing maybe her husband in with her. How did you feel with that, Cathy?</p>

<p>CATHY: It felt good because at this point, it is my problem. The family hasn't experienced the whole thing. We talk about it in the family but it's my fear and it felt appropriate for Larry to deal with it as my, you know, my problem.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I think that's another distinction that should be made with Western-type of counseling is that the responsibility is always put on the client, you know, that you are here putting the responsibility to change on Cathy, where in some other types of counseling styles it may be in just, not only it's your fault and you should change but maybe bringing in someone in and let's see how we can (overlapping voices) -</p>

<p>CATHY: The group. </p>

<p>LANNETTE: - And let's see how we can work together fix it. 0:13:39.5</p>

<p>(audio gap)</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Hi, Naomi.</p>

<p>NAOMI: Hi.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I'm glad to see you. Why did you come to see me today?</p>

<p>NAOMI: Well, I'm kind of feeling badly today. I'm kind of having problems with my family, I guess. </p>

<p>LANNETTE: You want to explain a little more to me?</p>

<p>NAOMI: Well, I'm still living at home and I kind of want to move out because all my friends are moved out, but I don't know how to talk to my parents about it. I've tried but they don't listen. But I really want to move out. </p>

<p>LANNETTE: So you're having some problems with your parents?</p>

<p>NAOMI: Yeah, and I can't sleep too well either; not concentrating; my schoolwork's going kind of badly now. So I don't know, you know. I don't want to flunk out so I came in.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, yes. We don't want you to flunk out, so...well maybe you could explain what kind of problems you're having with your family.</p>

<p>NAOMI: Well, you know, I want to move out and every time I talk about it with them they just kind of ignore me or they don't answer so I guess they don't want me to move out. So I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: How does that make you feel when they don't answer you?</p>

<p>NAOMI: It makes me feel kind of hurt, kind of angry, I guess.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: So you don't think your parents understand you?</p>

<p>NAOMI: Mm hmm. They don't understand me.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, I have the same problem as you so maybe I can help you a little bit. Maybe -</p>

<p>NAOMI: You think I should move out? 0:15:30.1</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, I think we should talk about it a bit more and then maybe we could find out why your parents don't want you to move out and then you can make up your mind and we can decide what we can do.</p>

<p>NAOMI: I know my parents don't want me to move out. I know that already.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: How can you tell?</p>

<p>NAOMI: Well, because every time I talk about it they don't want to talk about it, you know? I know they don't want me to move out.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, you know why they don't want you to move out.</p>

<p>NAOMI: They want me to take care of them, I guess. I can't take care of them all my life.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well that would be difficult, wouldn't it? </p>

<p>NAOMI: Well I don't want to take care of them all my life.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, do you understand that your parents feel that if you move out, you're abandoning them and that you're ungrateful?</p>

<p>NAOMI: Is that what they think, you think?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I think so. I think maybe they think you don't love them anymore. I know you really love them because if you didn't love them you wouldn't come and talk to me about this; you would just move out so you're a really caring person but I think we have to make your family understand that you're not the same generation as them and that you have your own life and you want to go (crosstalk) -</p>

<p>NAOMI: Well how am I going to make them understand that?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, we'll have to try to find that out.</p>

<p>NAOMI: I didn't tell them I came here.</p>

<p>ALLEN: I'm going to break in here at this point and say this is an interview which is being handled in a very different way than be handled in, say, a White on White counseling session. For example, the emphasis would be more on the individual. The emphasis here is more on relationship. Could you two elaborate more on what's going on here and what you see, particularly Naomi, that you like? (inaudible at 0:17:08.6)</p>

<p>NAOMI: Well, I was trying to portray a woman who's torn between her desires to be independent, to be an individual, and also pulled by her obligations to the family and a person who's in quandary over which way to go.</p>

<p>ALLEN: And in traditional Western counseling i.e. before family therapy began to change our view, we would tend to focus on you, the individual, and ignore the family where you have been very much focusing on her feelings and also on the family feelings. Am I right in that?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Yeah, I think it's important for Naomi to understand that she does see this as a relational problem because if it was only an individual thing she would just move out totally; she wouldn't even come here. And so she has to understand that her problem is her concern of keeping this relationship with her parents good as well as satisfying her own needs and becoming independent. And it's really a counter conflict because in her age group, it would be all right to move out; other people are doing it. But from her parents' point of view, that's not all right. And I was trying to make her feel, or make her see how her parents really view this so she could understand it better and maybe that way improve the communications between the two groups. 0:18:20.5</p>

<p>ALLEN: Now earlier, Lannette, we talked about the concept of harmony as being particularly important in Japanese culture. You might elaborate a little bit how you see the concept of harmony fitting in with this particular session.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, I think for Naomi's well being she has to be in harmony, not only with herself and her peers, but also herself and her family because actually she wants everything to be all right, everyone to be happy, her parents to be satisfied with her and herself to be satisfied with herself. And sometimes the two (audio gap at 0:18:50.6) two groups aren't in harmony so she has to find a way to bridge the two groups.</p>

<p>ALLEN: And how's that sound to you, Naomi?</p>

<p>NAOMI: That sounds really good. I think it was also good how you pointed out that it was okay that I felt this obligation to the family. I think a Western counselor might not have said that. </p>

<p>ALLEN: Now you are a clinical psychologist; how would you imagine a typical Western clinical psychologist might have approached the same problem?</p>

<p>NAOMI: I'm not a clinical psychologist yet.</p>

<p>ALLEN: On your way.</p>

<p>NAOMI: I think a Western psychologist might have focused specifically in how the individual felt about not being independent and focusing on the problem of dependency perhaps as being a bad thing. I think in the Oriental culture, dependency is a fact of life and it's looked at as a very positive aspect. 0:19:41.6</p>

<p>(audio gap)</p>

<p>PRANI: Hey, Greg. (sp?) Hazzid.</p>

<p>GREG: (sp?) Hazzid.</p>

<p>PRANI: What brings you here today?</p>

<p>GREG: Well, I guess I'm having some hassles with my family. </p>

<p>PRANI: What seems to be the problem?</p>

<p>GREG: Well, see my father and my mother, they really are what you call - they really value education so like I just (inaudible 0:20:29.5) high school and you know, they like me to go onto college, go to school somewhere. But that's not really what I want to do. I don't want to go to school for right now.</p>

<p>PRANI: Well, have you talked to them or something happened, or...?</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, yeah. We talked. We just argue and fight.</p>

<p>PRANI: Are you still living at home right now?</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, (ph) why?</p>

<p>PRANI: What do you have in mind? You want to move out or you want to go to work or you want to do something on your own?</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I been thinking about maybe (inaudible) a job, or try to start out on my own or something, you know. Something like that.</p>

<p>PRANI: Why are they trying to stop you?</p>

<p>GREG: Well they just like me to go to school, see. I don't like to go to school.</p>

<p>PRANI: Have you tried to sit down and talk to them? Who seems to be the biggest problem? The mother, the father?</p>

<p>GREG: Well, you know, they both get into it. Like my father, he's a little bit more. But I told you that already. </p>

<p>PRANI: What would you like to do then? Just go to work? </p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, I work already. 0:22:11.2</p>

<p>PRANI: Maybe you can tell me a little bit more about the family, maybe. Is that just a going to school or are there other things than this, than just the pressure of going to school?</p>

<p>GREG: What you mean, the family?</p>

<p>PRANI: Well, maybe sometimes it's just not one problem; it's a combination of other problems as well. I don't know. I don't know your family that well so you can tell me a little bit.</p>

<p>GREG: Well, I just told you, you know. They like me to go to school and I don't want to go to school. I like work.</p>

<p>PRANI: You have brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>GREG: What does that have to do with this right here?</p>

<p>PRANI: See, I don't know your family, right? So if you have older brothers and sisters and they're all going to school and maybe that's what they want you to do or they expect from you.</p>

<p>GREG: Hey, that doesn't matter, right? What matters is what I like to do, right?</p>

<p>PRANI: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>GREG: Okay. Well what we got to talk about my brothers and my sisters for? Or other problems? That's not your business. I came here and I explained to you what the problem was already. You understand where I'm coming from?</p>

<p>PRANI: Yes. And you need my help to help you through the problem, right?</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PRANI: How can I look into your problem if you don't tell me what's going on in the family?</p>

<p>GREG: I told you. I like to go to work.</p>

<p>PRANI: Well I just asked you if maybe there's not just a problem of going to work or going to college. Maybe there are other things involved, so...</p>

<p>GREG: (ph) Oui, oui, oui, oui.</p>

<p>PRANI: I just ask if you have brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>GREG: That has nothing to do with what we're talking about here. I told you: I like to go to work, my parents like me to go to school and that's it. You understand where I'm coming from? 0:23:59.5</p>

<p>PRANI: Yeah, I understand that. That's a big problem, Greg. But like I said, there might be other problems than just going to work and going to school.</p>

<p>GREG: Well if there is other problems that's my (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PRANI: Okay, I (crosstalk)</p>

<p>ALLEN: Okay, I'm just going to break in here with the two of you just for a moment and say what's going on here? What are some of your experiences in this interview, Greg?</p>

<p>GREG: I feel like he's really pushing me. He wants me to get into some areas that, you know, it's not relevant here. I got a problem and I want to get a job and that's what I want to talk about. Not my family.</p>

<p>ALLEN: I see. So in fact you'd like to get some action and some things happening.</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>ALLEN: What specifically is (ph) Prani doing that is kind of getting to you here?</p>

<p>GREG: He's asking all what other family problems do I have and if my brothers and sisters go to school and stuff like that. That has nothing to do with what we're talking about here. 0:24:55.1</p>

<p>ALLEN: So what we have here is what I call almost a problem in culture conflict that often occurs in the counseling relationship. Prani comes from the Ocean culture. And what have you been trying to do from your point of view, Prani?</p>

<p>PRANI: The problem seems to be so clear cut but I would not think that it's just that. If it's just that then I might go off different way (audio gap at 0:25:17.8) but that's it and there wouldn't be any more problem. Besides, he graduate from high school. What I was getting at is that he is really in conflict with something. I feel that it's not just (inaudible) clear cut and he wants to work and the father wants him to go to school but maybe the family might have something to do with him.</p>

<p>ALLEN: So coming from your cultural background and your view, we're talking here more in the area of relation, and you would like to see him thinking more of himself in relationship to others.</p>

<p>PRANI: Right.</p>

<p>ALLEN: Whereas coming from your culture you're saying I want some specific things to happen now.</p>

<p>GREG: Yeah.</p>

<p>ALLEN: And the relationship issue is not so important. So we might wind this up in saying that this is something that can and often does happen in the counseling relationship. Neither point of view is right, neither point of view is wrong; they're simply different ways of viewing the same situation. Okay?</p>

<p>(audio gap at 0:26:09.7)</p>

<p>ALLEN: Lannette, this last tape involved a Laotian counselor counseling a Chinese Hawaiian. There seem to be some problems in the interview. What were some things that you predict as particularly important for us to think about?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I think what's important about that tape, Allen, is it really shows that the counseling situation is culture bound and also the counselor is culture bound as well as the client. So there's a lack of communication between what's going on. Everyone comes in with their different assumptions, different (ph) bounties and different ways of communicating. So what's really important in that kind of situation is for the client as well as the counselor to be able to communicate effectively across both of these cultures as well as within this culture-bound situation of conflict.</p>

<p>ALLEN: So in effect, the client brings a culture, the counselor brings a culture, unless [there's some reasonable message] (ph) 0:27:02.9 the counseling isn't going to work.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I think yes, another important thing about that, our discussion here is that we're talking about counseling on a very conceptual plane. I think what's really important for effective counseling is to look at in terms of a more skilled approach.</p>

<p>ALLEN: Okay, and what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the micro skills approach to counseling. The micro skills approach to counseling is concern with breaking down the counseling process into specific, teachable components. Before I go on and I'm going to monologue about this, is there anything you'd like to particularly have me focus on as I go into this discussion?</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, I'd like you to bridge the gap between the conceptual point of view about talking about the individual, the relation, and the culture and how this can be analyzed in terms of micro counseling skills and how this can be taught effectively so that each culture will use the skills, but yet in an effective and appropriate way.</p>

<p>ALLEN: The important point basically, Lannette, is that different cultural groups apparently have different patterns of counseling skill usage, different counseling skill sequences, different ways of conceptualizing the interview. I do believe it's possible, Lannette, to break down the counseling process, analyze it, and look at what specifically are different cultures using in terms of different counseling skills.</p>

<p>At this point I'd like to bring on on-camera, on-screen a chart listing the several single skills of micro counseling. As we see from this chart, micro counseling is a single skills approach to the counseling or helping process. We break down counseling into single skill units so they can define rather precisely and taught systemically one at a time through the use of videotape. The purpose of this particular tape is not to get into depth on the micro skills approach; there are other avenues toward this. 0:28:55.3</p>

<p>What is important is to be aware that different cultures have different patterns of skill usage, different patterns and sequencing of the usage of the basic micro skill. In essence we really have about 20 basic skills of micro training or micro counseling. Selected just a few skills here to illustrate a few basic points. For example, the skill of questioning, asking questions, is a single skill of the counseling process. Some cultures, for example Eskimo and Inuit tend not to ask questions whereas in the United States, in certain counseling theories, lots of questions are asked. Different counseling theories have different frequency and amount of question-asking procedures. </p>

<p>As you move across cultures, different cultures have different usage of these skills. Paraphrasing and reflection of feeling or active listening skills are used differentially across different cultural groups. We move also to what I tend to call the influencing skills: advice, direction, information, explanation, interpretation; different cultures have different patterns of skill usage here as well. Now considering these last three interviews we've seen, the first interview we'd seen Larry, the White counselor asking a fair number of questions but very much into paraphrasing and reflecting feelings, focusing on the inconsistency that the client, Cathy, felt within herself. So the focus was on the client and using mainly the reflective listening skills. 0:30:24.1</p>

<p>In the second session where we had two Japanese individuals, Naomi and Lannette, we saw some questioning, paraphrasing, reflection of feelings and relationship and we saw some advice, direction; also some self-disclosure. Lannette was sharing some of her own personal experience in relationship to Naomi. Finally in the third interview we saw a Laotian individual who had somewhat of a relationship orientation focusing on questioning, paraphrase and reflective listening skills gained by his training in a psychologically oriented curriculum.</p>

<p>In terms of debriefing this particular session with Greg, the Chinese Hawaiian individual, we of course found he would have preferred talk time at the beginning, in other words just plain talking, sharing stories and so forth so that he would feel more comfortable. (audio gap at 0:31:17.0). We found in many types of cases like this the influencing skills of sharing information, advice and so forth are far more welcome to this type of individual than reflective listening skills. So in fact what we found within the micro training framework that different individuals have different patterns of skill usage. </p>

<p>We're now going to see an interview between a White counselor, first counseling with a Fijian about an issue of personal concern and we're going to see some interesting problems. In effect we're going to find reflective listening approach is used really quite skillfully by the counselor, Larry and you'll see that it does not work well with the Fijian who probably would have preferred this more active influencing approach to micro skills. Okay?</p>

<p>LARRY: Well, good afternoon, Conway. My name is Larry (sp?) Shoitt. I'm a counselor here at the agency and it's nice to meet you.</p>

<p>CONWAY: Yeah.</p>

<p>LARRY: And I understand that you have some things on your mind that you wanted to talk about, and why don't we begin wherever you feel comfortable. </p>

<p>CONWAY: Okay. My problem is basically getting adjusted to the lifestyle here. (inaudible/crosstalk at 0:32:45.3).</p>

<p>LARRY: And you're from...?</p>

<p>CONWAY: The Fiji Islands. Okay. Where things that are a lot more communal. I mean you have your friends. Things are a little more looser than they are here and things are different, they're very different here. They're individualistic and so often time I think, I mean I've been taken for a ride by people, just knocking at the door and say hey, I'm selling this thing here and then if you buy a little bit more of this and I get a free trip to Mexico, something like that. And I've been taken. </p>

<p>LARRY: So you're getting a good dose of American free enterprise. 0:33:22.0</p>

<p>CONWAY: Right, right. Yeah. And it's uncomfortable. You don't want to feel that you're a sucker. I don't know.</p>

<p>LARRY: How long have you been here now?</p>

<p>CONWAY: Well, we've been here say three four weeks now. So...</p>

<p>LARRY: It must be quite an adjustment to have to make. It must feel like getting a lot of cold water thrown into your face or something.</p>

<p>CONWAY: Yeah. Yeah, I guess you could say that.</p>

<p>LARRY: Well what are some of the feelings that go along with this kind of transitionary period? I mean, what kinds of things have been going on in your guts?</p>

<p>CONWAY: Okay, I guess the first thing is you don't want to feel like an idiot, like you've been taken for a ride, I guess. That's the important, that's the basic thing.</p>

<p>LARRY: What are some of the other differences between life in Fiji and your experiences so far here that maybe you're finding a bit unsettling?</p>

<p>CONWAY: I guess the other thing is probably the fast pace. (inaudible) things that are regulated. They're very much regulated in terms of time (inaudible at 0:34:39.6). You gotta be here on so and so; you gotta be here on so and so. Time in Fiji is a little more lax. You know, a 2:00 appointment could be 2:15, anywhere from quarter to 2:00 to 2:15. And keeping up with all this timetable can be real taxing, really. I don't feel (inaudible). I mean I don't have a watch and I don't feel like I have to keep time to go anywhere. If it's 2:00 and it's anywhere around 2:00 and I get there anywhere around 2:00, that's fine with me. But, you know, you get there at 2:00 or say five after 2:00 and they say well, you missed your appointment. Your appointment was at 2:00. You should have been here at 2:00 and you missed it; now you got to wait and just hang around until we could fit you in somewhere. It could take somewhere from two hours to something like that, just waiting around. That's another thing that's pretty difficult to adjust to. 0:35:37.2</p>

<p>LARRY: So life is really pretty different here (crosstalk) than...</p>

<p>CONWAY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Sure. I don't know; how does one adjust to that? I mean how does the (inaudible 0:35:53.8) I guess.</p>

<p>LARRY: Well, maybe we ought to talk about how you've been adjusting to it so far and see if we can identify some scenarios that you've been doing well in and look and see if we can find ways to help you to deal better with some of the other areas as well.</p>

<p>CONWAY: Yeah.</p>

<p>(audio gap at 0:36:13.9)</p>

<p>LARRY: What are some of the other kinds of things that you've been doing to try to deal with some of those pressures?</p>

<p>CONWAY: Well, I don't know. I don't know; TV kind of helps a lot. I mean, you can sit down and watch TV and watch how people behave and just learn something. Especially the TV that the (ph) communities like that produce locally or document, or whatever; (inaudible at 6:48.5) or something like that.</p>

<p>LARRY: It's a way of kind of getting an idea of (crosstalk) of how things function and what people's expectations are, and so forth. Yeah.</p>

<p>CONWAY: I've noticed that (inaudible) kind of helps. They tell you what is supposed to be good, what is expected. Yeah, TV I guess helps a lot, just watching TV and see how people react, how people behave.</p>

<p>LARRY: Well, you know, one thing that strikes me about what you just said is that it seems like the situation has been uncomfortable enough for you that you've kind of felt the need to keep yourself away from people right away and (audio gap at 0:37:41.0) you know you've used the media as a way of trying to get a sense of some of the things that go on here without having to really directly participate. But one of the things that I think we really need to consider together is how you can begin to move back out again and use the experiences that you will have with people as a way of learning kind of the way things are here and getting more comfortable. I can appreciate that, you know, at the beginning it's sometimes better to just kind of stay away but at some point, you're going to have to begin to move more directly into the thick of it. Are there other Fijians here in Hawaii that you've met?</p>

<p>CONWAY: No, I haven't met anybody. I don't know anybody. 0:38:44.9</p>

<p>LARRY: Well, have you had much contact with the International Students' Office here yet?</p>

<p>CONWAY: Oh, there is one? I didn't know there was one out here.</p>

<p>LARRY: Yeah. They're located over at the Student Services Center which is across from the post office. And there are some real terrific people who work there who know who's here and where people are from and one of the things that might be really helpful for you is to find some Fijians or maybe some other Pacific Islanders from the same area (crosstalk) who have kind of gone through what you're going through already, and perhaps they could kind of, you know, help to steer you along and at least you wouldn't feel so alone.</p>

<p>CONWAY: Yeah, right. Well, that's what I'm here for, I guess, to see if there are other people around here that I could get in touch with.</p>

<p>LARRY: Well after we've finished for today, before you leave I'll give you the name and telephone number of a person over at the ISO that you might want to contact and maybe that's a good first step anyway. And then we can also begin to explore some other things that we might do together to help to facilitate this transition.</p>

<p>CONWAY: Yeah, sure. Yeah that would be nice. 0:40:04.9</p>

<p>(audio gap)</p>

<p>ALLEN: With the interview you've just seen, Larry the counselor used what some might consider really quite good reflective listening skills. He began by asking questions; he paraphrased; he tuned in with feelings and yet the interview didn't work as you noted the problems in non-verbal communication, the gradual distancing is, in effect they almost moved away from each other during the interview. We're now going to see another cross-cultural counseling interview. This time Larry will be working with a Chinese woman. You'll see some of the same reflective listening skills but you'll also see him be more supportive. You'll notice a certain amount of gentleness and, I think, patience as he attempts to understand and work within the framework of another culture. Notice some of the similarity of the skills but also notice how very differently the skills are used in this forthcoming tape.</p>

<p>LARRY: Well, good afternoon Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Hello.</p>

<p>LARRY: My name is Larry (sp?) Shoitt and I'm one of the people on the staff here. It's nice to meet you. I understand that there are some things on your mind that you wanted to talk about and why don't we begin wherever you'd like to begin. And by the way, feel free if you have any questions you'd like to ask me to just go right ahead and do so. 0:41:35.4</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Thank you. Um, it's about my divorce. I'm getting divorced - I filed for a divorce.</p>

<p>LARRY: Okay.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: I'm having a hard time because my husband goes away on business and when he goes away, nobody takes care of the children and I worry about them.</p>

<p>LARRY: Why is it that nobody takes care of the children when he's away?</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: I don't know why. He goes away and he leaves the children at home by themselves. When he went, one time, he told the neighbor to take care of them and he pays money to the neighbor, but last week he went away and he did not tell the neighbor to take care and I go over and nobody's there.</p>

<p>LARRY: I see. So you and your husband are not living together at the moment then?</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: No. I live by myself. </p>

<p>LARRY: I see. And the children have been living with him.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Yes.</p>

<p>LARRY: I see. How do you feel about that?</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Very sad. They don't talk to me. </p>

<p>LARRY: They're unhappy with you in some way?</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: I don't understand why. My husband, I don't know what he tells the children but when I go to the house, they don't open the door and they don't let me inside; they don't talk to me. I take food because I worry. Nobody cooks for them, nobody takes care of them. I take food and then they don't open the door. 0:43:42.3</p>

<p>LARRY: Sounds very sad.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Yes.</p>

<p>LARRY: You must be feeling very unhappy about that. </p>

<p>MRS. LEE: I don't know what to do. I want to take care - I want my children to be safe.</p>

<p>LARRY: You must be very worried.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Yes.</p>

<p>LARRY: Yeah, and very unhappy about that whole situation.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Yes. </p>

<p>LARRY: Maybe enough to make you want to cry.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: I cry lots of times. I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>LARRY: Now, are you working also?</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Yes. </p>

<p>LARRY: And do either you or your husband have relatives here?</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: No, no relatives.</p>

<p>LARRY: So there's really nobody else (crosstalk) to help.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: No, no. We come from China so no family here. </p>

<p>LARRY: Wow, that really makes it difficult. Well, I can really understand how worried and upset you must feel. Now what's the situation between you and your husband? I gather that since you're not living together there's some difficulty in marriage.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Yes. I do have money. I work for somebody, for a family. I take care of their children and I cook, so I live at their house and I take care of myself. My husband spends plenty money and many years now, he spends plenty money. Many bills he does not pay so I must pay, and he does not give me money, and children too. I work. 0:46:33.0</p>

<p>LARRY: That's a pretty unusual kind of situation.</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: Well I have to help my husband and we have hard times so when he doesn't have a job I have to help him.</p>

<p>LARRY: You're very loyal to him. </p>

<p>MRS. LEE: But now I get divorce. </p>

<p>LARRY: Well, I'd like to talk with you some more about that but beforehand, and I hope I'm not prying too much and I hope you'll feel free to tell me if I am, but what is it that your children are so angry with you about? Why is it that they -</p>

<p>MRS. LEE: I do not know! That upsets me. I do not know. Many years now is always my husband and the two children against me. He tells them not to like me. Before when I lived same house, when I take shower, the children turn off the water. I do not know why they do that. My husband tell them these things. When we lived in the mainland, no money, my husband say we save money. Winter time, snowing, no more heat. He turn off all the heat and he buy three sleeping bag for him and the two children only; no more for me. 0:48:37.4</p>

<p>LARRY: So you feel kind of cast adrift at sea. Just all on your own with no support at all from anybody. </p>

<p>ALLEN: We've seen several incidences of cross-cultural counseling. The last one was ineffective and effective use of cross-cultural counseling skills. And yet, we've gone (inaudible at 0:49:04.1) from circularly just from a micro skills and individual relationship point of views. I think there are other ways these individual interviews could be analyzed. What are some of the things that occur to you that particularly - where could people go from here in terms of thinking about improving cross-cultural counseling skills? 0:49:20.5</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Well, I think what's really important in improving cross-cultural counseling skills is the knowledge of the culture on one level, the conceptual level of knowing what the person really expects, maybe trying to find out what really is the problem from the client's point of view, the perspective from his culture, and then trying to use the increased communication skills and trying to bridge that gap by effectively working together and making the counseling situation a culture in and of itself so that the two people can work together and come up with an outcome that both are satisfied with. </p>

<p>ALLEN: Yeah, Lannette, I'd really like to underline one thing you're saying particularly, is that counseling in Western society is usually considered as an individual process, and the whole idea of thinking of context and relationship and the idea of the culture is present in every individual interview is absolutely, I think, essential and perhaps a place to start; counseling I think starts with the individual and then occasionally thinks about culture. I'm thinking more and more that culture ought to bracket the individual interview far more than it does.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: I think that's really true. What's really important, that counseling should be seen as a process with a context, a content, and in the end, an outcome and the outcome should be a compromise between all of these interactions between the environment and the person. </p>

<p>ALLEN: And so to wind up here, I think some places people can go is learning more about different cultures, studying the skills used by natural helpers in each individual culture and then not getting involved with what we could call cultural imperialism: imposing a single Western point of view upon other people. So thanks so much for participating. Thank you, Lannette.</p>

<p>LANNETTE: Thank you, Al.</p>

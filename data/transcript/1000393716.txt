<p>PATIENT: (Silence, clears throat) Really 2 things occurred to me when I came in here.  And one was something I was thinking while I was outside, uhm, connected with the reports that are due soon.  And (Clears throat) I was thinking I should start doing something for them tonight.  And then I just had this feeling that I can't do them.  And I know I can and I will, but there was just this feeling that, right now anyway, feeling the way I do I couldn't do them, and something will have to change.  And in my, well, I guess, emotional response to them before I can accomplish them.  And I don't quite know why I feel so much that I can't do them.  Because if I'm just sort of offhandedly talking about the different boys, I do know them.  But yet, now I have this feeling I don't know them at all and I just couldn't possibly write a report on any of them.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And then I was thinking of how last night when I went home, I had this great urge to eat something, like potato chips or that type of thing.  And, and then I just started thinking about the fact that when I have ever done papers or, I thought of the reports too, because I do this when I'm doing them, I'll get something that's either sweet or things like potato chips to eat.  And then wait awhile, and sort of hold that as the goal.  I'll have to get so far before I have it to eat, or when I finish certain things, then I have this treat to eat.   And it,  I don't know, I don't feel quite the same way about it now, but last night it just seemed like such a silly way to go about doing it.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And then I just began to wonder, just now, if the way I feel after the Christmas vacation has anything to do with the fact that (Clears throat) the reports are due shortly afterwards.  So that as soon as I go back to school, that's on my mind.   Because I think in many ways I feel just like I did last year at this time.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What goes into the reports?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, well, there are 2 sides, and one is broken down into different academic areas or, well like reading and writing, and language, and number work and uh, and then play activities, which is sort of their social development.  And then we're supposed to write comments on the back about — and this is the thing that I've never probably had as clear an idea, but just sort of general trends in their academic and social development.  And in the past I've written quite a bit. </p>

<p>But — this is another thing — I was just thinking when I was outside that this year, now anyway, I think that perhaps when I get started I'll find I have so much to say I'll be as wordy as ever. </p>

<p>But uhm, I was just thinking  that it always seems to me after I write the reports, that I say too much.  Although at the time it seems like something that I should say.  But I have, I've established now that I write these reports this way.  And I was just wondering if I could write a much more concise report this year and get away with it.  And also, I just — I don't know if I could just from my own feeling about them, because I never write concisely. </p>

<p>And so I think I have this feeling that not only do I have to know the children in, in terms of the work they're doing, but then I have to be able to make a big thing out of it, in, in that I have to say a lot about it.  And so, I don't know, well especially their social side.  Because I used to always get caught up in saying a lot about it and (Clears throat), I don't know, almost being critical of practically every child, as if I had some perfect state that I thought these children should be in socially, and none measured up to it or very few did.  And this year I, they just  all seem, each one has a problem of some sort or other, but I don't know what person doesn't.  And they just, it just doesn't seem to me r—, at least for today, right now, such an important thing.  I'm not even sure I want to mention it or m—, certainly not make much of it.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>But I think the worst thing is I haven't started (Clears throat) and right before I start reports — it's al—, at least I've always felt this way before, I get this same feeling of — (Clears throat) well, it's almost a panic, because I don't think of the children individually,and so nothing specific comes to mind.  And then I just — makes me feel I won't have anything to say or I don't know them, one or the other. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was also thinking that it was almost worse going to school today, and my feelings while I was there were almost worse.  As if I were even less sure of what I was doing, and I don't know whether it's again, I'm comparing myself to FBS, or if I just generally feel like, I have some vague idea of what ideal teaching would be and I'm not measuring up.  But (Clears throat) I don't know, I just have this feeling that I'm not doing anything good.  And if FBS did do anything, I'd always start thinking, well, that's really good teaching and what's the matter with me that I'm not keeping such a high standard?  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>I, I don't know, I'm not sure exactly what I was thinking, except just sort of generally the feeling I had today.  And again, I guess I'm, I keep thinking that if I understood it, if I keep thinking about it long enough, then I'll understand what's causing it and then I can handle it. Which is almost what I'm doing when I'm critical of my teaching, that if I just get more intellectual about it then I'll handle it alright.  But if, I don't know, on the other hand I keep thinking  what I'd like to do is be a little more free and less rigidly planned and I'll do that for awhile.  And then I'll get feeling I'm being a sloppy teacher, and then I'll try to go the other way.  And I just kind of keep going back and forth without being anything.  It's almost as if that's it. </p>

<p>But then, I was just, it struck me earlier too that today anyway, here I was feeling this way that made me hate being at school.  And usually if I feel that way I'm very down on FYLR.  But today I wasn't at all. (Sniff, Pause)  Or maybe, it's been this way before, too, that I'm either down on FYLR and don't want to associate with other people at school; or, I'm down on the children.  And today I was, I guess, well, I don't know,  wasn't even being down on them, but I didn't want to be there as their teacher and responsible for being their teacher.   I might have liked being there if I weren't in charge.  Because when I could relax and feel well,  there were a few minutes when I didn't have to start thinking about the next thing or hurrying because the time for that particular period was almost up, then I could enjoy it.  But it was just somehow the aspects of being the teacher in charge that made me not like having to handle the children. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, I, it was almost as if I didn't want to think this.  But I suddenly realized I was thinking of specifically something that happened today.  And then, it's something that since school began just these last 2 days, has been bothering me.  Because I've taken it almost as a sign that it's proof my teaching isn't what it should be.  And that's this class's uhm — I can't remember how they used to be before vacation started,  but they seem to me, since we've come back, very physical with each other.  Either in play that they just always want to bump into each other and wrestle and so forth.  Or, that they'll easily become angry and hit out, and push around and so forth.  And I keep taking it as a sign that I'm not handling the scheduling so that they, they can handle being in such a large group in a small room. </p>

<p>Because I keep thinking well, they weren't that way before.  And it really bothers me to see them being that way.  And yet, then I — this is 1 of the things that has been bothering me the last 2 days, because I can't think of anything — well, I feel as if I'm not thinking of anything to do about it. </p>

<p>Almost as if that somehow, they're fighting as a result of my attitude toward them. </p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean, as though you're responsible for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Now, what are you afraid your attitude is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I don't care about them.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence)  I don't know why I will fluctuate, because I know in the fall for awhile there, I did care about them.  And I don't know why I cared about them then, or whether I truly cared about them.  But there was some interest that I had in them that helped me planning and, I don't know, everything went very smoothly.  And it was just a cycle then.  It seemed one thing worked and then another did. And now, and — I know there were periods after I'd had the operation and right away at the beginning of the year also, I'd just have this feeling that I don't care about them, and I, there's nothing I can do to change that.  And then, it's almost as if it's another cycle and everything follows, no matter what I try to do. (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you understand it?  I mean, how do you explain to yourself the change in your feelings, so that you feel you don't care?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just now when I was thinking of it, I wasn't.  Because I really just didn't know.  But I remember before when I've noticed that, I've sort of thought well, if I'm thinking more about myself then I'm going to think less about them.  And then at one point, I know, I used to think — and perhaps it's still something I'm wondering about — I used to think that when I cared about them, before the, before I went into the hospital, it was almost like an escape from not thinking about other things and — but I don't know, I don't know, it does — when I say that now, it doesn't seem that would be true. (Silence)</p>

<p>But, well, I was trying to think back in the fall, too, because I know I'd gone through a period of feeling, if not exactly like this, a similar feeling of I wished I weren't at school and I wasn't  interested.  And then, then I handled it, or got out of it, or something happened anyway, so I stopped feeling that way.  And I started feeling confident.</p>

<p>Because I was just thinking now that all this wanting to eat and everything, which I have connected with, I don't know if it's exactly lack of confidence, but anyway, eating is a substitute for feeling interest in other things and, I don't know, feeling involved, anyway.  And I think people have something to do with that.  So maybe now I just am feeling more lack of confidence, but I don't know why I would now. (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think I was just thinking about how when I'm feeling the way I do today and did yesterday, having absolute control seems essential and yet, I don't have the belief in doing the things that I used to when I first started teaching, for having that kind of control.  And so I get very frustrated when I don't have it.  And yet, some of that control is like having the room quiet in case somebody comes in.  And, I don't know, lots of little things that, I don't know how much it's true that this particular school demands those things and therefore I'm fearful am I'm trying to be obedient.  Or how much I've made it up in my own mind and am trying to do it. </p>

<p>Because, I was just thinking that yesterday the headmaster came around to, I guess, wish people Happy New Year.  And I was just, I guess, trying to remember how the room was when he came in.  And just thinking today, that j— I had a small group in the room.  They made puppets and then they were really organizing their own puppet show.  But they were very noisy about it. And my first inclination was almost to take over because they were being so noisy, and then I stopped myself.  But it just made me realize, I wonder how much I do sort of rule them.  Because it ended up working out all right.  Because I have this fear, because it was just a fear.  It didn't bother me for any reason, except what if somebody walked in.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You were afraid of what the headmaster would think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know if anybody else would bother me.  But, well maybe if my supervisor, FNYZ, if she came in.  And I wasn't sure how she'd feel.  But it's people who are over me, I guess, who might have some reaction that would be disapproval of some sort. </p>

<p>ANALYST: He would disapprove of the fact that you were letting the kids be noisy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not sure.  I —</p>

<p>ANALYST: I mean that's what you were afraid of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not sure.  Yeah, I guess so, you know, it was all sort of vague.  And there was something about the fact they were doing it on their own. I should have been pleased, because it's something that I've been working with them on.  But in a way, it's almost as if I weren't necessary.  And so I wasn't.  Maybe if I exerted more authority and demanded more control or res— or obedience to me, then I'd feel more necessary or something.  I think there was something like that in there.</p>

<p>In fact, that does seem to be, often I've thought, I wished I were better at almost in—, having them do independent projects, or somehow, really go off on their own.  And yet I think, if I ever start doing it, then I get fearful and I'm not sure of what.  And I sort of pull them back in my control. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I think that feeling is especially true at this time of year.  Because I know in the fall I'll try new things and I don't know, I know last fall I fluctuated a lot.  But it does seem I feel better about things, or well, I don't know how long this feeling's going to last, but last year certainly it lasted longer than any other time.  And then in the spring I'll try new things, and sort of let them go a little bit. This time particularly, I seem to pull them in and want them all doing exactly the same thing under my control. (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just, I, I guess I was trying to figure out why this time of year things would bother me so.  And it occurred to me that not only all the reports, but then there's parent's day in February, and I'm always starting to be aware of it now and wondering what I can do for that day, and what projects the children can have done previous to it, so that there'll be signs of things they've been doing around.  And I think what I start judging things on is how I'm going to appear as a teacher. </p>

<p>Because I, then I started thinking back to that time when I was the happiest teaching.  And I don't recall having that be part of my thinking or my reaction at all. It was more, just simply I felt, I knew, I had some idea of what the children would respond to and what they'd enjoy and get something out of, and what I believed would be worthwhile to do.  Now it seems to be all what will make me look good as a teacher almost.  And then, what do I have to do as a teacher, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So what's happened this year that has changed your feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know that I understand that.  Because it's something I've had off and on.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's true, but then you did feel differently in the fall.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Until the operation. (Pause)  And I've never gotten back to that feeling that I had before I went into the hospital.  And I remember, before I went in, I don't know, it was almost as if I knew what I was going to do to myself.  Because in 1 way I didn't want to go in, I suppose because I was afraid of it and all, unconnected with school.  But then, I kept also thinking that everything's going so nicely at school and I'll lose it when I go in. (Pause)  But when I say it that way it makes me think, it's almost as if I thought I had a penis then and I was afraid of losing it.  And that sort of makes me wonder about how I felt then. (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>It just makes me feel that if that were true — and I remember once before, it was almost as if, when I was talking about how I felt before going into the hospital, I was seeing it almost in terms of having a penis then, and then that makes having felt good and competent and all; for the wrong reason.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I was just thinking of some, another must be closely connected, but it isn't precisely school itself that is part of this attitude.  Uhm, and I always do it after a vacation particularly, and maybe always after weekends.  But there were certain things that I knew at some point I was going to have to do.  Uh, and during the latter part of the vacation — I did a lot of things before Christmas, but then, some of the things occurred afterwards.  I mean, some were like laundry, which have to be done periodically anyway, and I don't know, a var—, just a variety of things.</p>

<p>And I kept almost just not thinking about them, or at least thinking well, there's still more days to do them.  And then finally the vacation was over.  And I immediately got this terrifically strong compulsion that all these things had to be done immediately, and certainly before I started doing reports.  And so I was just putting this pressure on myself that was almost as if I were making up all these things that I had to do.  Because they're just little things.  Some, some are time consuming, but doesn't warrant feeling the way I have of — as if they are all these tremendous things that I've got to do. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I started thinking about the reports again, and this time I was thinking about them a little bit more specifically.  But I, but still, I don't know, it was almost as if now I know I can do it, but it will be horrible to go through. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I left there at 10 after 11. Long story, but there is never a parking spot here usually. I just discovered that lot there underneath the —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The two-hour lot?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It usually has good turnover.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's only $3 for an hour. Anyway, so I'm pleased with that. Otherwise I would have been a lot later. (pause) My life these days is just selling things. (pause) That's about it. It's busy but it's also rather liberating getting rid of stuff. I'm sure you may have had to do that recently yourself. (pause)</p>

<p>[01:07.9]</p>

<p>As it turns out, I won't be driving after all. I'm flying from Indianapolis to St. Louis, so that is no longer a concern.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you plan to do with — even though you're driving through, what are you planning to do with your dad? Figuratively.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm trying — (pause) When he was going through the stuff in his and my mom's condo and he was getting rid of things, sending things to Goodwill — and it's just like him to do this — it didn't quite dawn on me until yesterday, when he said a few weeks ago "Yeah, there's some stuff of yours here, some wedding pictures and things like that."</p>

<p>[02:18.7]</p>

<p>And then I realized those aren't mine, those were for him and my mom. So he's left those things with my brother. And if that's the case, which I'm sure it is because we didn't leave anything there, I'm just — I'm trying not to let it get to me yet because I don't know where it is.</p>

<p>He said he was taking two pictures to his new wife's place, one of all the family and some other one. But my God, it's like "You're giving these things back to us because that's not you anymore?"</p>

<p>[03:06.5]</p>

<p>So anyway, if that is the case, I'm just going to ship them to him and say "These were a gift. If you don't want them, send them to Goodwill." Because that is just like him to be completely thoughtless. And again, I'm trying to keep that on hold and not assume that's the case, but I have a pretty good reason to think it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you feel pretty hurt and angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. (pause) Yeah. It's not so much this as it is the theme of him acting as though his hands are tied. He can't stand up for what's right. (pause)</p>

<p>[04:21.3]</p>

<p>And then — so yeah. It's — I don't know. I guess I wonder if I had had the reaction that he took them to Goodwill. (chuckles) I don't know if that would be better, or I just didn't know what happened to them. (pause) But his plea that there's no room in their new place, I'm just not going to buy that. Because frankly, if you're combining households, you don't combine two pictures from this household into this (inaudible).</p>

<p>[05:20.1]</p>

<p>But I don't want this to be the defining event that I blow up on. So I'm trying to keep it in perspective, and I don't know — (pause) Again, it gives me pause because at his age, you know, what do I expect? So that's that.</p>

<p>[06:26.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does it impact what you want to share in your letter, that all that stuff happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's just it. I don't really know because — (pause) I mean, that's what I've been trying to think about since yesterday. Does this confirm something that I'm trying to say? I don't know yet. Does it reinforce something that's already to be in the letter? I don't know yet. But I think I'm just going to have to write it and edit, you know, as needed and figure out where it fits, if it fits at all.</p>

<p>[07:27.3]</p>

<p>It might not affect it at all. I might just send them to him and say, you know — (pause) "I don't want these. I have my own copies. These were for you. And if you don't want them, then you can do what you want with them." I think that message is simple and straightforward enough so that it's not a —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And keeps it about that particular thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's not saying "You're an asshole. You always have been, and this is just another reason why." I don't think he's had to account for these things.</p>

<p>[08:26.3]</p>

<p>You know, it's so funny because he obsesses over things that he has no control over. (pause) He worries and he worries and he worries, and he occupies himself with thinking about it. "What if Richard loses his job? What will he do?" It's just ridiculous things. So it's so funny that he spends so much time worrying about things he has no control over, and is so thoughtless and careless —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It's not like he could make a choice about] —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That to me is one of the themes in the letter. So perhaps — it seems like it's becoming a novel at this point. (pause) But that is just how his mind is prioritizing, I guess. I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>[09:53.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is your goal for — when do you cut off adding stuff in? What's your goal for wanting to move onto the next phase of sharing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm not sure that I have one yet. I guess loosely the goal is before I leave the country. (pause) I know I'm putting some things off until the first week of July, because I'm going to have an entire week where I want to work only three hours a day, and have the rest of the time to do whatever I want.</p>

<p>[10:57.9]</p>

<p>And because I'm legitimately busy right now, just trying to get prepared for that trip. I don't feel like I'm putting it off, but I do think it is coming to a head in my head. I'm starting to see its shape. So I guess I didn't answer your question, but I said something. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) That's okay. I ask because it does seem like it's feeling like it's time. Just from what you've been saying, I'm getting the sense you feel ready to move on. I want to make sure you don't get stuck in perfecting it and not allow you to actually move ahead and let go of it. I think the goal of writing the letter was to be able to clarify your thoughts, and then let go of a lot stuff you've been carrying with you.</p>

<p>[12:06.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I do have a tendency to be rash about some things and be a perfectionist about others. I guess that's the nature of who we are as we [occupy extremes sometimes], just like I pointed out to my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The goal is to meld those two sides.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I know what I want to say. I think my concern — and it's not so much of a concern as just a caution to myself about how it's toned.</p>

<p>[13:10.5]</p>

<p>Not that I think I'm going to give him something that's damning and condemning. But that is one of the things that I am wary about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have put a lot of thought into this, and I trust you will find that space somewhere in between, where you want to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. I also think that last week we did come to a place about some things about what he faced during that whole thing. But I had never really considered — I had, but I hadn't. (pause) And so I think that will help temper it and make it more constructive.</p>

<p>[14:28.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of modeling what you want him to do, being able to see things from other people's perspective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Exactly. And I can understand the disparity between how low he was after my mom's death and how he was uniquely affected. Because we all lost our mom, but we didn't lose our life partner. The disparity between that and what he sees now as a new lease on life, and how he might make decisions that aren't necessarily all that well thought out as far as how we might feel about certain things. (pause)</p>

<p>[15:35.1]</p>

<p>I mean, I guess I think it's like when a friend has a new girlfriend or boyfriend. You never see them again because they're so into it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel kind of abandoned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or not even abandoned, just so much — like re-prioritized. I mean, I can understand it. I don't know. At the same time, I just have a hard time imagining his worldview with that ability, unless I take into account how I feel about [whether or not he really wanted to be a parent].</p>

<p>[16:44.4]</p>

<p>So, yeah, I guess that's about all I want to say about that. (pause) Who knows, maybe I'll have it done next week. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know we've been spending a lot of time talking about your relationship with your dad and your letter, prompted by the fact that it does feel like time is short before you leave. But our time is also short, so I thought it might be important to talk about what you would need to feel like you had wrapped up this piece of work.</p>

<p>You're not going to (inaudible at 17:19.6), and that's okay because you can go on to do other therapy chunks. You can see them all as pieces of work. I know I won't see you again for about a month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I think we're on for next Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you seeing me next Monday? Okay. I'm sure you thought I'd finally jumped ahead. We had planned for like July 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>[17:43.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You looked at me like "Are you still here?" (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm hoping I remember — oh yeah, there you are. The 2<sup>nd</sup> at 10:30. Okay, we're seeing each other then. But then did we plan for the end of July?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your therapist is not totally crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Oh that's right. This is all on the record.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm human too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's been flawless the entire time. The one time was my fault. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, I did have that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, and then the 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Still, my point of thinking about —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. And frankly, I really want to have this done and off to him by the 20<sup>th</sup> or the 21<sup>st</sup> — no, sorry, the 24<sup>th</sup> or the 25<sup>th</sup> — because I want to know what — I could also just ask my brother what it is dad gave him.</p>

<p>[18:47.9]</p>

<p>So in that case, I think I'll have it written and done by the 13<sup>th</sup>. But I also want to bring it in before I send it. So it might be that I try to do it before next Monday, but I don't want to make any promises.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could also e-mail me a copy or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, that's true, if I'm on the road. Alright, well, I'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't give us a chance to talk about it in the same way, but I can certainly read it and give you some responses or feedback.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. And I'm also toying with the idea of letting my sister read it because she and I have had some of the same issues. I'm not sure about that yet.</p>

<p>[19:51.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're missing a knob, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've been missing a knob there for years.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I was like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the knob.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's in a drawer somewhere, and I just never managed to put it on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean it's brand new and it came like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I've had that furniture ever since I've had my office.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. Because I've sat here and wondered if that's some sort of, I don't know, secret — I just finally noticed it. Anyway, not too —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just has tissues and stuff like that. Nothing really secret.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Not kid-proof?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so, I think I'm — (pause) I'm preparing to do that, and I don't want to wait any longer. I just don't want to wait.</p>

<p>[20:53.7]</p>

<p>I don't want to wait any longer because I don't want his and my relationship to be strained any longer. I also don't want him to get any older. Not that I'm hoping he'll change, but I want him to know and hear this and reflect on it while he's sentient. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's a good timeframe, and you've done a lot of the work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've really put a lot of thought into it. You've sat with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think I can steep in it any longer. It's just a matter of making the time to do it. I think if I actually work on it even a half an hour a day for the next four or five days, I can probably get close by the time we meet again.</p>

<p>[22:05.1]</p>

<p>So I think I will make that the goal. As far as being ready, I'm also looking forward to having it behind me and looking forward to whatever feeling is next once it's off my chest. (pause) Are those alive?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For now. I've been told they're hardy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lichen and moss.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You just add a little water here and there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. The directions say to mist once in a great while and to let them dry out in between. If they totally dry out, they don't actually die. They go dormant, and then you can re-mist any time you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nice. That's perfect for you. (laughter)</p>

<p>[22:58.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is the next experiment. In better lighting conditions, I can keep plants alive. This is a challenging area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh come on. Well, I'll grant that. (chuckles) I wish you good luck with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. You can check on them when you get back. I'm sure they'll still be alive by Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. (pause) What else? I have not called the counselor you referred, and I'm just a little bit — the reason I'm not is mostly because I just don't know how much time she has and how much time I'll be able to, either one of us can, get in before I leave.</p>

<p>[23:54.1]</p>

<p>And just even to get to the point of explaining the backstory seems like that could take two or three sessions there. And so I also feel like we're learning more about each other, for the better. (pause) So I think it's going to (inaudible at 24:43.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They do have therapists there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yes, I hope so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's absolutely no barrier to pursuing it there. You'll both be there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I don't think they have dentists there. (chuckles) There's some great teeth among the Europeans.</p>

<p>[25:05.8]</p>

<p>Yeah, so I think that's kind of where I am with that. (pause) I don't know. That's kind of where I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel you need to do in here to be ready to say goodbye at the end of the summer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. (long pause)</p>

<p>[26:35.1]</p>

<p>I think — well, I think one thing is when I get that letter off and when he responds, I'm probably going to need to discuss that. But aside from that, I'm not sure. I still have issues with an attraction to you in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That might not end.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean — what do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I don't know that's necessarily something that needs to change by the time we have our last session, or that will change. It might. But that might be a piece that is sort of ongoing with our work, and you may take it with you.</p>

<p>[27:49.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would that mean for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it's something I continue to work on? Oh, it's what I expect. I don't — (pause) I mean, I think there are certain things I'm learning about myself that I can trust myself. But I struggle with trusting myself and trusting my desires.</p>

<p>[28:53.8]</p>

<p>I mean, trusting myself to do the right thing and hold to the promises I've made. (pause) It's something so ingrained in me from such a young age that I don't expect it to lift easily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know one of the things we talked about when we started addressing your feelings or fantasies about me, we talked about working through that in here and what it might mean for what happens outside of here.</p>

<p>[29:54.1]</p>

<p>And I'm wondering what it would be like for you, since it seems like it's not something that we will completely work through before we end. But those feelings and thoughts are something that still come up for you in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. What was the question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just what that would be like for you, since it's not going to be wrapped up in a neat little package and done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I see it as a work in progress that I work on every day in every situation. (pause) And I guess when it happens, I do think about it intellectually. I mean, I guess I think about it. But I also think about it — I don't know what the word is — perhaps clinically, what it is that's going on with me that's causing it.</p>

<p>[31:02.5]</p>

<p>But I also acknowledge that there are beautiful things in this world, and I'm going to find beauty in them. And that there's nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Well, that's harsh on yourself].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And more realistic, I think. I'm not a bad person if I find you attractive or beautiful. I think it just depends on what it is that I do with that information. I think that's where I tend to be more harsh with myself. (pause)</p>

<p>[32:07.6]</p>

<p>But I also wonder what level of fantasy is just part of life, you know. (pause) I mean, I guess I consider a lot of entertainment and fiction to be expressed fantasies. And so in a way, it reinforces the idea that fantasy is normal. On the other hand, it's a world that people are wanting to create, not just something that they've necessarily experienced. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>[33:06.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess it makes me think about what level of control you have. Does it feel like something that's imposed on you, or do you feel like it's something you are creating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What, the fantasy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Whether it be with me or with someone else. How much do you feel like it's something you have active —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I think it's a lot of control that I have. (pause) I think it also depends on the myth that control and the reaction to it — that doesn't make sense. I should say the creation of it and the reaction to that is largely shaped by my being present to what I'm doing.</p>

<p>[34:12.8]</p>

<p>If I'm totally present, I don't even think about it. I don't see it. It doesn't happen. It's kind of idle. But if I think I'm overwhelmed or stressed or whatever, I think it's right underneath the surface, and I'm happy to let it fly, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's a defense against feeling overwhelmed in those instances.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I said, it's an escape, I guess. (pause) But I think at this point, for me to just look at you without you knowing it — and I guess that would be objectifying — but just looking at you to appreciate it and not necessarily to think that something might happen.</p>

<p>[35:31.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the role of me knowing or not knowing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think — (pause) I don't know. I think it's, I guess, a protection of my intent. That appreciating your beauty but not fantasizing over it, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that feels safer to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the piece I don't get is how does whether I know you're doing it or not know, how does that change it for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still don't know.</p>

<p>[36:27.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I didn't know if I missed it or —</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was in there. You just missed it. No, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just something to think about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess if you were somebody on the street, I wouldn't want that person to get the wrong idea. And the person on the street doesn't have the same legal, professional (inaudible at 37:01.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're not protected from them. It's a protection that I'm not going to act on anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But, you know, at the same time what I do want someone to know when I'm looking at them has more to do with not appreciating them but actually trying to get attention. And we've talked about that, of course.</p>

<p>[37:38.1]</p>

<p>I think that might be the key difference, how I'm feeling. If I'm feeling confident and trusting in myself, I can appreciate someone's beauty —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you have my attention, right? So I wonder if there's a difference between what happens in here and what happens with an unknown person out there. Because you are getting my attention. You're not getting that type of attention, but you are certainly getting attention. I wonder if that changes what else you need or what else you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It could. But even in here, I think that's the difference. What am I doing looking at you? Am I appreciating your beauty and therefore can feel that I trust myself?</p>

<p>[38:34.7]</p>

<p>Or am I looking at you and hoping that by looking into your eyes or something, that I connect with you on some sort of, whatever level. I think that is feeding me. Whether you intend it or not, that's just my perception. And I think that's also what happens in the street, so to speak. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's stop on that thought for today. I'll see you on Monday at 10:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 10:30, Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. That's definitely what I have written down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay. Agreed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will be here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are very welcome.</p>

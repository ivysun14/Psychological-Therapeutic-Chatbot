<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are things going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, before I say anything.  I mean, I don't want to say the wrong thing with you.  You'll bite my head off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] today.  I'm going to and even not to talk that much because I think it's going good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Promise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Nothing to say really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Let me review what you looked like when we met last and.  Okay.  As you know, the way this works, um, you, uh, that's going to be hard to take off, you got the zipper on.</p>

<p>
CG:	I think you need a new coat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which reminds me, you ever see that Seinfeld where he's sitting there with the therapist and he's trying to get his zipper down.  It was just on the other night.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Was that George?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, George was sitting there with his therapist and he's saying I can't get this down.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I love that show.  I love it.  It's just so real.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't it, especially to New Yorkers, right, it's totally real.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I saw you [DATE], your chief complaint was tell my mother I don't need meds.  You're normal, you have no problems.  Your mother, on the other hand, said he's paranoid, he's socially withdrawn, he's a loner, he has idiosyncratic thinking, odd, I mean, she didn't say all of this.  This is the sense I got.  He's angry, poor frustration tolerance, throws things, breaks walls, grandiose.  And then after hearing all that you said well, I'm easily agitated and sensitive.  Okay.  And then we talked about baseball and the Internet poker you do and all of that.  Now you were presumably on Abilify at that point, but we established later on that you weren't really taking it.  And the story was one of maybe at age 9 two seizures, the Tegretol helped.  You had behavior problems.  You're anti—authority, stubborn, difficult, [INAUDIBLE] you wouldn't go to school, although you weren't hearing voices or paranoid at that point.  At age 14 you had a depressive episode.  You went to Mount Sinai for a week.  You were flat.  At 15 you had odd behavior.  You thought you were making people cough.  You were so grandiose.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] diagnosed you with schizophrenia.  You went to boarding school.  Then [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] at [DEIDENTIFIED] in August of '07 put you on the Abilify.  Your mom thought it helped.  Um, but you stopped it, but two weeks ago you were supposed to have restarted it, but as we then found out, you hadn't been taking it.  Right?  And then, you know, your mom got all bent out of shape thinking that you had been on it and you weren't on it and you guys had some kind of conflict here over what you're going to do and she kind of put her foot down to my recollection saying if you don't take this medicine, you're out.  And so I think it was important enough to you to stay living there that you agreed to take the medicine.  And so since then he's been taking, under your supervision, he's been taking his Abilify 5 mg every day?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Let me first ask you, how's this month been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's been fine.  I mean, I've been taking the medicine and I don't think it makes a difference, but it doesn't make a difference in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but it makes your mom happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Makes my mom happy because like, I don't know, it's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's reason enough.  That's reason enough in the beginning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, that's not a good reason to me because if it's happening for a false reason.  This is just my opinion that I feel, but I don't even want to, but it doesn't matter bad or good.  And I don't think I'm angry anymore anyway for any reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, do you suspect your mom has your best interests at heart?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So I would suggest just keep taking it for her benefit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I just want to, I just don't want to do it forever.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One thing I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just do it for this week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, yeah, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One thing I really notice is one thing that always upset me is when there was something that happened like 9/11 with the crane thing and I would mention it to [PATIENT NAME] or he'd hear it on the news, so big deal, I don't care.  It didn't happen to me.  The other day when the crane fell, this is the first time in years he says, oh, what happened, that's too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, give me a break.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean, he actually shows a little bit of empathy, although today—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See if he can get outside himself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, give me a break</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean, you know, that's the first time because, but he seems, uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so let's just start with basic things.  Has he been calmer?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Dramatic improvement in his agitation?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So much less agitated and his anxiety level?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're going to school every day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you smiling 'cause you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm smiling 'cause I feel my behavior is the same as it was in January when I wasn't taking it, but.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He won $98 playing poker today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I didn't win $98.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What, $92?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now when you, you know, you sit there, um, and half closing your eyes with a bit of a smile on your face, might you be hearing something that we can't hear?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm not crazy, I'm just, I'm smiling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I asked you a very specific question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you hearing anything that's not really there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I heard exactly what was said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any ideas that are odd?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm positive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None of those, you remember what grandiose means?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any grandiose ideas that you have more power or more, or any special powers that other people don't have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any ideas that people are trying to hurt you in any way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have any sense that he's had any of those ideas?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I haven't really seen him much.  He's been in his room doing his thing, totally leaving me alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess that's normal for [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  He shouldn't be that interested in hanging around with mom.  Right?  He should have his own interests and be developing them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's actually been helpful and how's your day, have a good day, and, um, you know, very pleasant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he's pleasant.  Now you hand him the medicine every day?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I hand him and I watch him swallow it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You watch him swallow it.  Have you been messing around with it at all or are you really taking it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm taking it.  I can't hide it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  My sense of you is it feels a little not good to have to do this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't care, but, uh, I'd rather not take it.  It gives me hiccups sometimes.  I just don't feel, it's not a huge deal but I just don't feel healthy people like, you know, that do sports sometimes stuff like that, that just is not really necessary to be doing it.  That's my opinion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you having any real side effects though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, no, no.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Actually, I think he's sleeping better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what is your sleep like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleep's normal, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Eight hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your self esteem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't feel like you're no good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is your mood good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fine, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you seem more interested in doing things.  You did the exercising and you went to the [INAUDIBLE] store.  He's more motivated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You um, it kind of upsets you if we say you're doing well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well it's not, my mom is like trying to find any excuse to like the praise the medicine.  I just don't get it.  It's like I don't know, maybe to older people medicine seems like a miracle.  As far as I know, maybe 'cause I'm younger, but to me medicine's not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's the enemy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not the enemy, but it's just not really special.  I mean, if anything it's like, you know, it's okay.  It may help some people, but like I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, listen, you know, you're a young guy and you have your whole life ahead of you.  And I think it's fair to say that you were having some struggles.  And even if there's 1 in 100 chance that this thing could help you with those struggles you were having, and because there are no side effects, you know, why not?  Why not just embrace it, stop fighting it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, first of all, it's not a big deal that's worth like, you know, I mean, like making a Michael Moore film against the anti—pharmaceutical company.  I don't really care that much.  But it's just that like, um, you know, I think, you know, my problems are so, I mean all problems are social.  Medicine may help in some ways and like hide some, you know, emotions that people are feeling that might hurt them in their workplace and whatever.  But like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, so that's a good way to understand the medicine.  It helps you hide some of the emotions that get in the way of you moving forward in your life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  What I feel for me that is I don't really have those problems or anything.  I'm not angry about anything, like nothing stresses me out.  I'm calm.  I've got my privacy in the home.  I can relax like, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, I understand your point and I, and you've kind of, um, made clear your objection to the treatment.  Okay?  You're, uh, what do I say, your protest has been lodged.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?  So it's duly noted.  And but I, for now I think we should all agree that you keep taking the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?  And so you're in agreement too, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, and he's seeing [NAME OTHER] too once a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, how's that going?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I didn't go the last time, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It went fine.  I just told her my school history and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you find that she's nice, that she's, you know, sympathetic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's nice.  All the therapists are pretty nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But the reason I think she's good is that she's very kind of here and now, what do we do now to move this forward.  You know, a lot of them you go to will say all right, tell me about your mother, and your father, and how that felt and, you know, getting into things that are not that important in the here and now.  I think you have challenges in the here and now that could use some help.  Is that true?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, maybe, uh, I don't think I'm at a disadvantage but anybody, you know, including myself, could always use, you know, motivation and, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he needs help with too trying to figure out what he wants to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't need help.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, and he doesn't have any idea besides baseball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I, you're in school now, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he has to declare a major.  And he just, this semester he took political science and all political and he decided he doesn't want that so that's almost a semester wasted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't go towards?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he'll see an advisor but he refuses to go and see an advisor.  And, you know, maybe now that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you could go with him.  Would you go with him to an advisor?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we could do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I'm going to see an advisor but it's city college and I'm not like, I went to an advisor a few times and it's like kid's mom [INAUDIBLE] sometimes and they're not really helpful.  One time I went with the intention to speak to an advisor and it's just this girl which had signed me up for classes with some bad schedule, albeit it was already late and the class was done filled, but, you know, it's hard to, you have to be really like motivated to get people's attention to like help you.  And I haven't been that motivated, so.  But, um, I can do it, but I also have a pretty, I have a pretty, you know, solid understanding just like a book that a college bulletin that says the information is all in there.  So that's what I think a lot of people do if not most people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what kind of major are you thinking of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, probably economics or something and if I have to do two, which I might have to, I might need 120 credits, then maybe like psychology or something.  I don't know if I'm going to want to do a lot more time in graduate school, but, um, you know, so probably economics and something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, I guess the first step though is to pass your classes that you're in now.  And when do you have to decide, are you going to school over the summer or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I guess I don't know.  That's probably, I mean, my mom is usually, you know, I haven't the last two summers, but, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Get a job or go to school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so that's that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've got to do something, um, although [NAME OTHER] could help you get set up with, uh, there are programs like [INAUDIBLE], have you heard of [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he's part of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you doing [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm not like working for them or anything, but they like pay for my stuff, my books.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So they should have advisors there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I don't know, my mom's talking about like college advisors to tell me specifically how many credits I need.  They don't really do that in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] actually most of their kids they have too are geared for vocation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.  They don't have jobs like summer jobs they could place for?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, they do, well, I don't know about summer.  [INAUDIBLE] call on Saturday they had to see if you wanted a job but I told them you were in school.  I should ask them about summer jobs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Summer job would be nice to, or school alone.  You know, you may be tired of school.  How many courses you take now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm only taking four, but I also like it was summer school and like winter sessions, it's like the classes are like three hours and, um, it's bad enough as it is that I'm sitting in a class, like today I had a class, professors just puts me to sleep, you know.  Some teachers are interesting, it's like you're taking a risk sometimes.  Most college professors are good and it's all good, but it's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, he's so good in chemistry and stuff like that but I don't know what he could take to major in.  That's what he seems to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, why doesn't he?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, but what jobs could he take?  I mean, I thought research or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I think there's a better future in chemistry than in economics.  Economics is very, it's not business.  You would think it's business, but it's not.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you like it too.  You could say he's in chemistry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Data chemistry, biochemistry, that's good stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's good stuff.  I was about to do chemical engineering but I got a D in calculus so that, and I'm not, I didn't want to take that again.  I would have to take it again and get a C.  And then that, I would have, that's harder and it would take like three more years of college or four, I would have to start from scratch.  And, um, I don't know.  See, I don't know.  I just don't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I think you should talk to an advisor, I really, you know, you could talk to, go to the Gateway, they have a place for students like him where he can talk to the head versus the student.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of his condition he's going to need a little extra help along the way.  All these things are relevant and appropriate, but there's going to be a little extra help.  So I would suggest [NAME OTHER] or you, you know, to go with him to move things along in ways that'll be difficult for him on his own.  He's not just a regular student showing up for, you know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I hear that, but then he doesn't want me to do it.  He wanted to do everything on his own, but now I think you're willing to work with me, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think you should accept a little extra help.  No one's going to do your work for you.  I mean, you're going to have to learn these things on your own.  But I think it can be a little confusing for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's not that I'm confused, but it's that, uh, first of all, I know every job [INAUDIBLE] job that exists, but I know like what [INAUDIBLE] there are and, you know, um, like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let me suggest something else though.  The, um, the condition you have comes with a difficulty organizing.  Organizing though and just organizing one's self in the world, and so people around you like your therapist and your mom can give you a little glue to keep things together so to speak.  It would help a lot.  I think these things are too complicated to manage on your own.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I'm, because what I'm thinking is starting to come, you know, go this way.  I'm starting to really think that my life is going to be a nine to five just like most people on the planet and then I'll just enjoy my life outside of work what it's like, like with like hobbies, sports, or socialization.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe.  But wouldn't it be nice to find a career that could be gratifying?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was thinking he could do something with baseball like the MBA is located here.  They're going to be, uh, moving to [DEIDENTIFIED], they're going to build a big office.  He could work there with scouting and, or, you know, just doing different things if his interest is in baseball.  That's what your coaches do, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know.  I'm just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, listen there's a lot, listen, and we don't want to overwhelm you, but, uh, but, you know, maybe if you would go to one or two meetings with [NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE] also and see if you can all organize things in the right direction, 'cause his heart's in the right place, but execution, getting things done in an organized way is not his strong suit.  I don't think, left to his own devices, that these things would get done.  I think he needs a little help.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he has improved.  I've seen that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's like nothing to do right now.  It's like city college.  I may look like I'm enthusiastic about life sitting in this room, but city college is so easy that it's not even funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That means you're going to get all As.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right now if it was done today I should get all As.  One class I haven't had one homework assignment, one assignment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One class I haven't had one assignment the whole time.  The only class I like.  The other class I had like six pages to write.  Another class with the same teacher I have had no assignments so far.  And another class I've had one three page paper to write.  So I've done three pages here and six pages on a little notebook.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Music to my ears.  You're managing this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Another thing I noticed too is that [PATIENT NAME] always has a hard time reading, you know.  He, um, his attention span is very low, but the other day, what were you reading, you were reading some—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't read.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What was that book you were reading, some [INAUDIBLE] book.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't reading anything.  I was just looking at this book.  I wasn't reading, it had pictures in it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.  I thought you were reading it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wishful thinking.  Well, listen, it seems to me like you're much, much better from when I saw you last.  I'm not saying it's the medicine.  Maybe you just got your head on a little straighter, but you're doing better.  You're less agitated, you're less angry at your mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm sorry about last time.  I just thought that, yes, I hope this guy's going to agree with me and say no medicine, but at least, like you said, [INAUDIBLE], so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.  So the protest is lodged with the commissioner.  The commissioner of psychiatric treatment.  And, uh, we'll get, they'll go through the instant replay and see how it comes out.  I think this dose is decent, 5 mg, we're not going to change for now.  Although we, you know, hold open the possibility that a different dose might help.  I'm just happy he's on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  And we're both going to see [NAME OTHER] on Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good.  And I would talk to [NAME OTHER].  So you don't have to come to me that frequently anymore.  You know, I'll see you again in two months.  We'll see how you're doing.  If there's any problem you can give me a call, but [NAME OTHER] can be in touch with me also since I see her regularly.  And, you know, we can keep an eye on things from there.  Okay?  All right, good.  I'll see you in two months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, let me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

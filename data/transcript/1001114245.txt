<center><P><B>KOTTMAN PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION TRANSCRIPT</B></P></center>

<center><P><B>Introduction</B></P></center>

<P><B>Terry Kottman, PhD</B> is a leading teacher and recognized expert on play therapy, regularly presenting workshops all over the country. She spent 15 years as a professor of counselor education at the University of Northern Iowa and the University of North Texas. Dr. Kottman is the author of <I>Partners in Play: An Adlerian Approach to Play Therapy</I> and <I>Play Therapy: Basics and Beyond</I>, as well as many journal articles and book chapters.</P>

<P>In this session, Dr. Kottman illustrates that children communicate through play and that all play has a purpose. Dr. Kottman meets with a 5-year old boy who is split between two homes and lacking a sense of control in his life. By reflecting his actions, and using encouragement and suggestions through play, Dr. Kottman soon discovers that this young client needs to show her who’s boss.</P>

<P>Kottman: Joshua, this is…this is our play place, and we can do most of the things we want to in here. So we’re going to play, and… they’re going to make a movie of us playing. Okay? That’s what they’re doing. I have to tell you one thing, okay. You see that blue line right there? We need to stay on this side of the blue line so they can keep on making a movie of us, and then we’re just going to pretend they’re not here, okay? And we’re just going to play. Okay? Okay. Got it. It’s a deal. Shake.</P>

<P>I was going to shake with that hand and I realized I was handcuffed. How do you do? Okay. It’s a deal. Okay.</P>

<P>So how many do you have on?</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Kottman: You don’t know. Lots and lots of them.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ve got thousands on here.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh my goodness. That many? And they’re beautiful colors, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: One of them’s a rainbow. This one’s a rainbow.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, that's a rainbow one?</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Seems like you like that one kind of the best.</P>

<P>Oh, you’ve got the sword, too… Are you going to poke that with a sword?</P>

<P>Uh-oh. Don’t make it too tight.</P>

<P>Joshua: I am…ok.</P>

<P>Kottman: Don’t make it too tight because that would hurt me. You kind of like being in charge of those handcuffs.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: You like being the boss of stuff.</P>

<P>Joshua: Ah, this one’s the one.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one’s different... Looks like that one feels maybe a little bit…tougher. Oh!</P>

<P>Kottman: Now you’ve found a phone. Going to call somebody up.</P>

<P>Joshua: I know. Why?</P>

<P>Kottman: Looks like you know somebody’s number, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: Why?</P>

<P>Kottman: Who’s number is it?</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Kottman: Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Hello, Joshua? Are you there? No one answers. Joshua didn’t want to talk to me right now. Sometimes when you get it started it’s hard to get it to stop. Uh! But you figured it out. You figured out how to get it to stop. But you couldn’t quite get it closed the way you wanted it to.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa!</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh! You got it closed but then it didn’t stay closed. Whoa. Now you figured out a way to get it closed. Joshua, you know how to figure out so many things.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, there’s the gun again.</P>

<P>Joshua: And here’s the key.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, now you’ve still got the key.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now it’s going to be in here.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you hid the key to the handcuffs again. I notice….So every time you hide the key to the handcuffs you kind of tell me where they are.</P>

<P>Joshua: Look it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, my goodness. A new kind. You really like those. Every time you find a different one you sound very excited about them.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh. I found another one on. I’m putting all of them on.</P>

<P>Kottman: You are putting them all on. They make a…they make a cool sound, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: There’s a new one.</P>

<P>Kottman: That’s a different kind. That’s different than all of the rest of the ones you have.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa. This one’s little.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one…That one’s too little. It won’t go on your head.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yep. [inaudible] can get it to get it.</P>

<P>Kottman: I bet. There might be a way you can figure out how to get it to go on you, though, if you wanted to.</P>

<P>Joshua: I know.</P>

<P>Kottman: I bet there’s a way. Keep on looking.</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: Look at it. Do you see something that you could use to get it on? Yes, you do see something you could use to get it on.</P>

<P>Joshua: How do you open this?</P>

<P>Kottman: How do you open that? Let’s work together as a team and do it. Ready?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: Grab it. One, two, three.</P>

<P>Joshua: Cool.</P>

<P>Kottman: We worked together as a team to do it.</P>

<P>It won’t fit around that way, will it?</P>

<P>Joshua: I can’t even get at it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Can you get it? Oh, you did get it. You got it all by yourself. You didn’t need…even need any little bit of help that time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, this is to make you fit some more.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, and—</P>

<P>Kottman: —you figured out that that one did the very same thing. You know, I notice something about you, Joshua, that once you figure something out, you can use what you know about it to use it in other situations.</P>

<P>Oh, did you get it?</P>

<P>Joshua: No. This is going to get it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Is that going to get it? That one’s a little bit tougher. Having some trouble? Would you like to work as a team or do you think you can do it by yourself?</P>

<P>Joshua: I can do it by myself…. No, I’m not going to use them.</P>

<P>Kottman: You decided it wasn’t going to work out the way you wanted it to….</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: You were going to get rid of it.</P>

<P>Joshua: That one’s nice. Look, I have another one. Oh, that one’s super little.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one’s super little, but…do you have a plan?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yeah.</P>

<P>Kottman: Because you know there’s a plan for figuring out how to fix those, those ones that are super little. And you use that plan to figure it out and…</P>

<P>Kottman:…you didn’t even need any help that time because you got it.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa. Uh-oh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Little bit frustrating because it’s not working the way you think it ought to. I bet you can figure it out, though.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, no. This one’s going, gone.</P>

<P>Kottman: Uh, going to get rid of that one, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: Lookit. I’m putting all of them on.</P>

<P>Kottman: Something that I noticed: when something doesn’t work the way you think it ought to, you just decide you’re not going to mess with it.</P>

<P>Joshua: This one’s super.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oooh. That one’s got a different shape.</P>

<P>Joshua: I have to open this one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, there’s another one you have to open. You’ve got the pattern figured out. I’m wondering if that’s going to work…the way you want it to. Nope. Got a little frustrated. Decided not to use it.</P>

<P>Joshua: These one’s can’t use.</P>

<P>Kottman: So those ones that don’t work the way you want them to, you just kind of got rid of them.</P>

<P>Joshua: Where’d I get this one?</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, did you try that one?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yes.</P>

<P>Kottman: You don’t give up before you try a little bit, though. Oh, it worked! Some of those ones that are hard work and some of them…you decide they aren’t going to work, but it looks like you’re giving them all a second chance, too. So even when you decide things aren’t going to work out the way you want them to, you still give them a second chance. Some of them you have to press really hard and some of them you don’t have to press very hard at all. Oh, that one you pressed really hard. It still didn’t work, though. You figured out a different way to use it, though. You figured out a way to make that work and have fun with it even if it didn’t do what you wanted it to.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, wow. Uh-oh.</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-oh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Sometimes those break. It’s not a big deal. Sometimes they got….Sometimes they kind of fall apart, and it’s no big deal. Stuff just breaks sometimes. Looks like you were a little worried about the fact that that was broken but so—</P>

<P>Hello. What’s your name? Are you being a little shy?</P>

<P>Joshua: Another handcuff.</P>

<P>Kottman: I think she was feeling a little shy. She decided to leave.</P>

<P>Joshua: Pull. Now this one’s stuck onto my hand.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now you have a handcuff and I have a hand—Oh! But you took yours off. You are in charge of who gets handcuffed and who doesn’t.</P>

<P>Joshua: These are closed.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yeah. That one’s going to be closed now.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: You have figured out how to make those go really fast, too. You know, when you first came in here, you didn’t know how to use those at all. And since then you have not only figured them out, but you’ve figured out how to use them really, really fast.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa, now we both have a handcuff now.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now we both have handcuffs on.</P>

<P>Joshua: Where’s the key?</P>

<P>Kottman: What did you do with the key?</P>

<P>Joshua: Right here.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you remembered where it was. I think you were pretending you didn’t remember and you were acting a little confused but you really knew where it was.</P>

<P>I wonder sometimes if it’s kind of fun to scare other people into thinking you don’t know where stuff is when you really do.</P>

<P>Oh, you decided to let me out of my handcuff. You’re going to let me free.</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t think so.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you decided maybe you weren’t after all. I think you’re trying to get me to be a little bit confused about whether you’re going to let me out or not.</P>

<P>Kottman: Since you like to be the boss and show me how things work. Uh-oh, don’t do it too hard, okay? Thank you.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now the key’s—Hey! How’d that happen?</P>

<P>Kottman: I don’t know how that happened. It won’t stay, it won’t stay too tight I think. That’s a little tight, Joshua. Will you make it a little looser?</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: A little teensy bit looser for me.</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know how.</P>

<P>Kottman: I bet you could figure it out. Could you either press that button or use a key and just make it a little teensy bit looser?</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. I can’t.</P>

<P>Kottman: You can’t? Oh no. Well, you know what, I need for you to so either you need to do it or I can, or I have to do it myself because it’s kind of making a mark on my arm. Oh, thank you. That’s perfect. That’s absolutely perfect. See, that’s not making a mark on my arm anymore. It was making a little mark on my arm and I was, that was hurting a little bit, but now it’s not. But it’s still on if you want to leave it on. It’s up to you.</P>

<P>Joshua: The Grinch.</P>

<P>Kottman: The Grinch.</P>

<P>Joshua: I was the Grinch for Halloween.</P>

<P>Kottman: You were the Grinch for Halloween. Oh wow.</P>

<P>Joshua: That’s easy to get out.</P>

<P>Kottman: It is easy to get out if you decide to let me out.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa. It’s a little bit loose, but it’s still not open yet.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now it is.</P>

<P>Kottman: It’s going to be. You’re going to let it open.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: It’s kind of up to you.</P>

<P>Joshua: You have, this time you have to hide it from me.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, this time I get to hide it from you? So I get to be in charge?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, that’s kind of cool for you to be in charge sometimes and me to be in charge sometimes.</P>

<P>Joshua: I think this is not going to work.</P>

<P>Kottman: You think that’s not going to work? Shall we try it again? Do you want to undo it or do you want to leave it that way?</P>

<P>Joshua: I want to undo it.</P>

<P>Kottman: You want to undo it. Okay. I bet you can figure out how to undo it. You did figure it out.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now it’s your turn.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, now it’s my turn.</P>

<P>Joshua: All right. It’s cool. Now I want to do it like this.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, so you’re going to, you’re going to handcuff yourself. Make sure it’s not too tight because I don’t want you to get hurt.</P>

<P>Kottman: And then I get to hide the key.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: And do…then I, do I tell you where I hide it or do I keep it a secret?</P>

<P>Joshua: You keep it a secret.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa, you are really trusting me.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa!</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh my goodness. Did you get it? Oh, I see what the problem is. Do you know what the problem is?</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re trying to make it go around the outside instead of…. I bet you can figure out how to do that. It has to go in between those two.</P>

<P>Joshua: I know.</P>

<P>Kottman: I bet you can figure it out.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, I got it on the one…</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, no, you got it on the, the same arm as the other one. Some people might be helpless and powerless using handcuffs but I can tell you are the kind of guy who is not going to be helpless and powerless using the handcuffs.</P>

<P>Whoa, you handcuffed yourself and you gave me the key, so that’s a big responsibility for me.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now I have to try to find it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now you have to try and find it. Shall I tell you where it is?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: No. I should just hide it and not tell you where it is. Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m going to be handcuffed myself.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: I have a sword.</P>

<P>Kottman: I was hiding that, hiding the key, so now the key is hidden.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. That’s easy to find.</P>

<P>Kottman: You know where it is already? Oh my goodness. You found it so fast. You are tricky.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now do it again.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now hide it again. Should I make it about that easy or should I make it a little harder this time?</P>

<P>Joshua: Little bit harder.</P>

<P>Kottman: A little bit harder. Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now this is kind of tricky. Two on it. That’s easy to get out.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, it’s hidden.</P>

<P>Joshua: This time do it a little trickier.</P>

<P>Kottman: I did it a little trickier this time, but you’re very close.</P>

<P>Joshua: That’s easy.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re very close to finding it. I think you’re going to find it. You’re very close. Oh, oh, oh. You’re very close to finding it. You found it!</P>

<P>Joshua: Again. Again. Hide it again.</P>

<P>Kottman: You want me to hide it again? Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: This time, put it in the puppets.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. Put it in, inside one of the puppets?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yeah.</P>

<P>Kottman: Do you want to tell me which one you want me to put it in or do you want me to decide?</P>

<P>Joshua: Decide.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, you want me to decide.</P>

<P>Joshua: How do I take these off?</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, no! How can you take those off? I’m going to put it inside one of the—Oh! You’re looking. You saw me.</P>

<P>Joshua: No, you’re supposed to do a different one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, I’ll have to do it—Oh, oh, oh. You’re looking again. You don’t want me to really hide it where you don’t know where it is, I think.</P>

<P>Are those hurting you?</P>

<P>Joshua: No, I just want to open it.</P>

<P>Kottman: That’s bugging you a little bit? You want to open them or you want the key?</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ll just open them.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. You can figure out how to get them open.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, yeah.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yeah, you know how to do that. Yup.</P>

<P>Joshua: Mm-hmm. I just have to do this.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yup, you just have to do that. You have it figured out.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, what the heck!</P>

<P>Kottman: What the heck! Getting a little frustrated because it’s not working the way you think it ought to.</P>

<P>Joshua: Look.</P>

<P>Kottman: Did you try it a different way?</P>

<P>Joshua: Obviously, I’m going to have to keep these on.</P>

<P>Kottman: We’re going to have to keep those because you can’t get them off. I think you can get them off if you wanted to. Sometimes you have to press—Let me show you something, Josh. Okay? Okay. You can do it that way. Sometimes also you have to push this and that opens them. See because when it was over here, it wouldn’t let you use this, but now if it’s pushed over there it will. But you can just use the key.</P>

<P>Joshua: What the heck!</P>

<P>Kottman: What the heck. Can’t get that open. Try, try that thing now if you want to.</P>

<P>Joshua: What thing?</P>

<P>Kottman: That little thing right there. Yup. Did you get it? Yeah, you got it. Try it again a little bit. Try it again a little bit. You’ve almost got it. You decided you didn’t want to open it? You wanted to just squeeze your hand through?</P>

<P>Kottman: Ah, you got it a little bit more.</P>

<P>Joshua: That’s how far I wanted it.</P>

<P>Kottman: That’s how far you wanted it. You wanted it just that far. You wanted me to know you didn’t want to open it all the way that particular time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now I do.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, now you decided you did. You know what, you like to have me think you know just exactly what you’re doing. And I do think you know just exactly what you’re doing. You did it! Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: Again.</P>

<P>Kottman: Again.</P>

<P>Joshua: This time I’m going to put two on you. On your back!</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh no, you know what, I won’t, I don’t like to have them handcuffed behind my back. You can handcuff me in front of me and you can handcuff me to you if you want to but it’s against the playroom rules to handcuff me behind my back because it’s too scary to me.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh.</P>

<P>Kottman: That’s really scary.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa. That was cool. You figured out a different way to use them. You are always thinking of new ideas of how different to do things. That’s remarkable how creative you are.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, oh now we’re stuck together.</P>

<P>Joshua: Not for long.</P>

<P>Kottman: Not for long. You decided we weren’t going to stay stuck together.</P>

<P>Joshua: Not you—</P>

<P>Kottman: Did you lose the key? There it is.</P>

<P>Joshua: Thank you.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re welcome.</P>

<P>Oh, you undid yourself in just one time that time.</P>

<P>Joshua: That time.</P>

<P>Kottman: That wasn’t very frustrating at all because it happened really quickly. You got it to work just the way you wanted it to. Remember not to do it too tight. That’s perfect. What should I say?</P>

<P>Joshua: Say I locked them up.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you’re not going to let me go?</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you hid the key on me. You’re in charge, Josh, of what’s happening.</P>

<P>Joshua: I found it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you found it. Oh, I’m very relieved about that. I was feeling a little nervous.</P>

<P>Joshua: Ow.</P>

<P>Kottman: Decided you don’t want all of those on there anymore.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now I want to keep them. Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa. Those ones got tangled up, but you untangled them.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oopsy.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oopsy. No big deal. Sometimes stuff kind of comes apart. Sometimes stuff gets broken and sometimes there are just things that come apart.</P>

<P>Joshua: Wow.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, if you try to take them both up at once, can you do it? No!</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m a mask.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, it’s like a little mask.</P>

<P>Joshua: What am I going to do with this? Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: They’re all tangled up there.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m taking them off to you.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re taking them all off at the same time. You’re getting lots of them off this time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa. This one’s getting tangled.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one’s tangled-y, but I bet you can untangle it. You are really amazing at getting…</P>

<P>Kottman: …to know how to figure things out. And get yourself out of situations.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa. This one’s getting really knotty.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one’s getting very knotty, but I bet you can figure it out because I know that about you already and I’ve only known you for a little while.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Wah! It’s all tangled. I bet you can figure it out, though. You are just remarkable at getting yourself out of tricky situations.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ve got the key.</P>

<P>Kottman: You do have the key, and you are in charge of the key. You are in charge of who is handcuffed and who is not. Seems like you’re pretty excited about that, too. You’re almost, you’re almost free of all of those necklaces that you have on. You had to put them on, Joshua, and you took them all off again.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oopsy.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, one more.</P>

<P>Joshua: This one’s still on.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one’s the one that’s still on. And you remembered how, that you have to take it off because you have to take it off kind of a tricky way and you did it.</P>

<P>Kottman: That tricky way wasn’t a problem for you. Some kids wouldn’t have been able to figure that out, but you did.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: You have the key.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now I’m putting myself in.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now you’re going to have your handcuffs on, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: No, I’m not because this ones can’t fit.</P>

<P>Kottman: It’s having, you’re having trouble fitting it on your, over your jacket. I bet you’ll figure it out. Sometimes—</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, this one can’t work.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, it can’t work? Remember you have to switch that. Oh, you got it. You thought it wasn’t going to work but you figured it out.</P>

<P>Joshua: I want one of mine.</P>

<P>Kottman: Just one?</P>

<P>Joshua: I need two.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now you’re going to do the other one, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh! Now I think I’m going to be stuck forever.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you think you’re going to be stuck forever?</P>

<P>Joshua: Not for long.</P>

<P>Kottman: Not for long because you have the key and you know how to figure them out.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oopsy.</P>

<P>Kottman: This one’s oopsy.</P>

<P>Joshua: This one’s going to be stuck.</P>

<P>Kottman: That one’s stuck, too? I’ll be you’ll figure it out. Oh! You did.</P>

<P>Kottman: You figured it out. Boy, you are the person who is in charge of those handcuffs.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now you have to close them and I have to hide it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Want me to close my eyes? Or you want me to just keep them open?</P>

<P>Joshua: Close your eyes.</P>

<P>Kottman: Close my eyes? Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: Ready.</P>

<P>Kottman: Open them? You’re ready already? Hmm. Is it under here? No.</P>

<P>[as stuffed animal] Hello. I don’t know where it is.</P>

<P>She doesn’t know where it is.</P>

<P>Do you have a clue?</P>

<P>[as stuffed animal] I don’t have a clue.</P>

<P>She doesn’t have a clue.</P>

<P>[as stuffed animal] Why don’t you ask Josh? Maybe he’ll tell you.</P>

<P>Josh, do you have a clue? You don’t have a clue, either? Uh-oh, it looks like you’re…</P>

<P>Kottman: …giving me a clue, though. It looks like you’re looking down here which might be a clue. Oh, there they are!</P>

<P>Joshua: I got it.</P>

<P>Kottman: I found it, but you grabbed it first. Because you’re in charge of that key. Uh-oh. Where did it go? Is it lost again?</P>

<P>Joshua: Now you have to find it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now I have to find it again?</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ll find it. I found it!</P>

<P>Kottman: You found it.</P>

<P>Joshua: You’re never going to get out.</P>

<P>Kottman: How are we going—Okay. What’s going to happen next?</P>

<P>Joshua: You going to have to close your eyes still.</P>

<P>Kottman: I have to close my eyes again? Okay, I’ll close my eyes.</P>

<P>Joshua: Done.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re done already. You are fast. Okay. Hmm. You think I should ask the monkey for help? She wasn’t very much help the last time, but I’ll ask her again. Little monkey, little monkey, do you know where the key is?</P>

<P>[as stuffed animal] No. I don’t know, but I think it’s back there somewhere. Why don’t you ask Josh? He might be willing to tell you.</P>


<P>Kottman: Josh? (Joshua shakes his head.) No. Josh won’t tell me.</P>

<P>[as stuffed animal] Well, look back there somewhere. I think that’s where it is.</P>

<P>Okay. Let me check it out. You are a pretty tricky guy. I’m not sure where it is. Uh-oh.</P>

<P>Joshua: I got it before you did.</P>

<P>Kottman: You did get it before I did.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay, now it’s my turn still.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. One more turn then we’re done with that particular game.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: Ready? Set. Go. Ready.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re ready already. You are fast. Okay, I’m not going to ask my friend the monkey. She wasn’t very helpful. This is what I’m going to do: come over here. Am I getting closer? Am I getting closer? No?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: Am I getting closer?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: Am I getting closer?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: I give up. Oh, my goodness. You were tricky that time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now nobody can get it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Now nobody can get it?</P>

<P>Joshua: It’s going to be over….</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, put it over there.</P>

<P>Joshua: I can get it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, it’s going to stay over there if you want it to. Let’s do….</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: I want to play a game, and you can have a choice.</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, you ready? You can either draw a picture for me or you can play in the doll house. Which would you rather do?</P>

<P>Joshua: Draw a picture.</P>

<P>Kottman: Draw a picture? Okay. Can you draw a picture with handcuffs on?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yeah.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, I’m going to go over here and get some paper and get some crayon which may be really difficult with handcuffs on, and then we’re going to go back and sit down again.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay? This is hard. These handcuffs make it very tricky.</P>

<P>Joshua: What are we doing?</P>

<P>Kottman: We are going to draw a picture. Actually, you’re going to draw a picture of your family.</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: And you can draw it really fast or really slow if you want to. I want you to draw a picture of your family with everybody in your family doing something.</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t want to.</P>

<P>Kottman: You don’t want to? You don’t have to.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oopsy.</P>

<P>Kottman: What would you like to draw a picture of?</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t care. Well, that’s making me very tight.</P>

<P>Kottman: That makes it very tight.</P>

<P>Joshua: Like, get one off. I only need one off anyway.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. I know, Josh. Will you draw me a picture of a family of animals?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: Like frogs?</P>

<P>Joshua: How about…. Guess.</P>

<P>Kottman: There’s the key. You’ve got it. You’re going to toss it over there?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup. And then it’s going to be in….</P>

<P>Kottman: It’s going to be in there? Cool.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. I’ll color.</P>

<P>Kottman: What color would you like?</P>

<P>Joshua: Color this.</P>

<P>Kottman: We’ve got a whole bunch of different colors.</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s this?</P>

<P>Kottman: Those are markers.</P>

<P>Joshua: Good color markers.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’d rather, rather color with markers.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa. They’re kind of tough to get out, but I bet you can figure it out.</P>

<P>Joshua: I bet I can search again. What the heck!</P>

<P>Kottman: What the heck. Sometimes it’s frustrating when stuff doesn’t work the way you want it to.</P>

<P>Joshua: I want this.</P>

<P>Kottman: You want that one?</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-huh. The red one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Can you get it out or shall we work as a team?</P>

<P>Joshua: I want black.</P>

<P>Kottman: You want black?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: I bet you can get it. If you can’t get it by yourself, we can work as a team.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. How could we work as a team? How about you hold one side. Which one do you, which one are we going to try for?</P>

<P>Joshua: This one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you got it by yourself! We didn’t even need to work as a team.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, now what?</P>

<P>Kottman: Now what are you going to draw?</P>

<P>Joshua: Tic tac toe.</P>

<P>Kottman: You want to play tic tac toe?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yes.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, I’ll make a deal with you.</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: If you will draw me a picture of a family—and it can be any kind of family you want—then I’ll play tic tac toe.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: What shall we do first? Play tic tac toe first or draw the picture first?</P>

<P>Joshua: Tic tac toe.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, what color should I have? (Joshua points to green marker.) Green. Okay. These are hard to get out. You know what—I got it. I was going to ask for your help.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay, now. Now…Now do this. Oh no, can’t do it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: One, two….</P>

<P>Kottman: You know, even when stuff doesn’t work out the way you want it to, you just try again, Josh.</P>

<P>Joshua: I can’t do it. Your turn. You can do it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Looks like you did it just fine. I think that will work perfectly.</P>

<P>Joshua: You can, I get to go first.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. You get to go first.</P>

<P>Joshua: The middle is good. That’s a good spot for you.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’ve already got a plan. I can tell. You’ve played this before. Okay. I do O’s. Where should I go? Okay, I’ll go right here. Oh! Did you trick me?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yes.</P>

<P>Kottman: I asked you for some advice and you tricked me so you….</P>

<P>Joshua: I can’t do it.</P>

<P>Kottman: You did it. You did it.</P>

<P>Joshua: I got tic tac toe. Do you know?</P>

<P>Kottman: You got tic tac toe. You did. You won.</P>

<P>Joshua: Nobody put any right there.</P>

<P>Kottman: Nobody did.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, we’ll play one more time, then the drawing. Okay? You’re going to go first again?</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, what the heck? Where’s the middle?</P>

<P>Kottman: Uh-oh. You didn’t have that exactly the way you wanted it to so you decided to make another one.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh. This one’s going big. I get to go first.</P>

<P>Kottman: So you’re going to be O this time?</P>

<P>Joshua: I got in the middle.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, you got in the middle again. I’m going to be X. You know what?</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: I’m not going to ask your advice this time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Since you gave me advice that wasn’t very helpful last time. So I’m going to count on my own advice this time. So I go here.</P>

<P>Joshua: And I go… here.</P>

<P>Kottman: Uh-oh, I’m feeling nervous. I’m feeling very nervous. I think you’re tricky. Oh my goodness.</P>

<P>Kottman: I go here. You are so smart. Nothing I do could trick you.</P>

<P>Joshua: Nobody going to win.</P>

<P>Kottman: Nobody’s going to win. You sound a little disappointed by that.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup. Nobody won. Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. Now… a family. What are you going to draw a family of?</P>

<P>Joshua: A snowman.</P>

<P>Kottman: A family of snowmen?</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m going to do a snowman.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you’re going to make a snowman. Okay. Well, then you could make a family of snowmen. That would work.</P>

<P>Joshua: There’s that. And a hat.</P>

<P>Kottman: You did a hat. You know how to draw.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now his mouth. That.</P>

<P>Kottman: Sounds like you know how to draw everything that a snowman needs. I think you’ve done this before.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now feet.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re making sure that snowman has some feet.</P>

<P>Joshua: There.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa, you did it.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now the arm. Two arms.</P>

<P>Kottman: Two arms.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. Done. It’s a drumstick one.</P>

<P>Kottman: It’s a drumstick one?</P>

<P>Joshua: Done.</P>

<P>Kottman: Done. Is there anybody else in that snowman family?</P>

<P>Joshua: No, because it’s too big.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, he’s too big to put any more people on that page, or any more snowmen on that page. Well, we can make the rest of his family on another page if you want.</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s that….</P>

<P>Kottman: Did you hear some kind of sound that you were wondering about?</P>

<P>Joshua: No, I’m making a picture frame.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you’re making a picture frame.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now what?</P>

<P>Kottman: Now what. How about the rest of his family?</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m putting two O’s in it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: And then one nose and two nose and a big forehead.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, my goodness.</P>

<P>Joshua: And now a big mouth.</P>

<P>Kottman: Wow.</P>

<P>Joshua: And now teeth.</P>

<P>Kottman: Big teeth.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: This one the mean one, this the good one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, he’s got a mean one and a good one.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay, now ears.</P>

<P>Kottman: You know exactly what you want to do.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now the arms. Now the, now, now the arms.</P>

<P>Kottman: There’s his arms.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now his other arm. Okay. Now…. Now what I’m missing?</P>

<P>Kottman: What are you missing?</P>

<P>Kottman: What else do you need?</P>

<P>Joshua: Snow.</P>

<P>Kottman: Snow!</P>

<P>Joshua: See, we don’t have any colors. Where the white!</P>

<P>Kottman: We don’t have any white. You’re right. What colors would we make the snow out of? Oh, we do have white. I hadn’t noticed that.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yeah.</P>

<P>Kottman: You know, even when I don’t see things, you find them for us. Okay, that was easier than those markers, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: And then the clouds.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, clouds.</P>

<P>Joshua: It shows up on blue paper.</P>

<P>Kottman: It does show up on blue paper.</P>

<P>Joshua: And here’s some snow for them.</P>

<P>Kottman: You figured it out.</P>

<P>Joshua: There. Snow.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa, snow.</P>

<P>Joshua: And here’s the clouds.</P>

<P>Kottman: There’s the clouds. Looks like the snow is falling from the clouds.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: This picture’s done.</P>

<P>Kottman: Wow, that picture’s done.</P>

<P>Joshua: That’s a good picture.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yeah.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay, now what?</P>

<P>Kottman: Would you draw me one more picture?</P>

<P>Joshua: Of what?</P>

<P>Kottman: Of a house.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. I have more paper than one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Well, just draw me one, though. Or you can draw me more than one if you want to. You can draw me two houses.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m going to put this in there. What color houses supposed to be?</P>

<P>Kottman: Whatever color you want them to be.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ll be white.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. Sometimes you ask me the answer to things and you already know the answer. You’ve already figured it out, so you don’t need me to tell you the answer.</P>

<P>Joshua: A mailbox.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, so the person who lives in this house is going to get some letters maybe.</P>

<P>Joshua: Numbers.</P>

<P>Kottman: You think so?</P>

<P>Joshua: If the numbers are old.</P>

<P>Kottman: So he’s going to get some numbers instead of some letters?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup. This one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Will he get some mail?</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Who will he get mail from?</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay, now…(giggling). Okay, now all these supposed to be in…. I’m just going to do this.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: I got enough. Enough this one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Done with that one.</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know how to make a house.</P>

<P>Kottman: You don’t know how to make a house?</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know how.</P>

<P>Kottman: Hmm. Well, what would house need if you were going to draw a house?</P>

<P>Joshua: What the paint is doing here.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yeah, we don’t have any water though so we’re not going to use the paint today.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa. I’m doing crayons.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re going to do crayons instead.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, white.</P>

<P>Kottman: You are trying out all of the different things. Oh, another white. You’ve got another white when I thought there wasn’t any. You are so tricky.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Whoa. That’s okay. Sometimes crayons just break.</P>

<P>Joshua: That one.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yup.</P>

<P>Joshua: You don’t have a marker that’s white.</P>


<P>Kottman: No, we don’t have a marker that’s white. I don’t think they make markers that are white.</P>

<P>Joshua: I think so.</P>

<P>Kottman: You think so? Well, then maybe they do. You are pretty tricky about knowing stuff.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa. That’s okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: No big deal. No big deal. You want to give it to me? I’ll put it in my pocket.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh. Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Do you want to keep the crayon? Because we could just peel the crayon. You know what, Josh? Will you unlock me?</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. I don’t know where the key is.</P>

<P>Kottman: You don’t know where the key is.</P>

<P>Joshua: Too bad.</P>

<P>Kottman: Too bad. Would you unhook me then?</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s unhooking?</P>

<P>Kottman: When you do that.</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: No. Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m going to use the pink marker.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. Okay, I was going to put this in my pocket and then I decided I was having trouble putting it in my pocket because of the handcuffs, but I figured out how to do it.</P>

<P>Joshua: Why I, why do I have to color?</P>

<P>Kottman: Why do you have to color? Well, you don’t have to. I wanted you to draw a house and then I wanted us to go back to playing. We’re going to play for a little while and then we’re going to clean up again.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup, clean up the whole room.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yeah, there’s not very much to clean up, though. We haven’t made a very big mess, have we?</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m going to kick it all around.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, well, that would make a big mess. Sometimes you like to make threats that you’re going to do stuff even that you’re not necessarily really going to do.</P>

<P>Joshua: What do you think I’m going to make?</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, I don’t know. Only you know for sure what you’re going to make.</P>

<P>Joshua: I bet you know what this is: a Christmas tree.</P>

<P>Kottman: Yes, I did. It’s a beautiful Christmas tree. You look pretty proud of it, too.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m done.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, we’re done.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ve got more. Now you draw a picture then.</P>

<P>Kottman: I draw a picture. Okay. I’m going to draw a picture of a house.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. All the colors you want.</P>

<P>Kottman: Thank you. I’m going to use….</P>

<P>Joshua: I want… I want…</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, did you want that color still?</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: I put that back, but did you want it?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: No?</P>

<P>Joshua: Except where’s the key?</P>

<P>Kottman: I don’t know what you did with the key. I thought you put it over there by the castle, but I’m not sure.</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-uh.</P>

<P>Kottman: No?</P>

<P>Joshua: I can look right here. Found it.</P>

<P>Kottman: There’s the picture of a house.</P>

<P>Joshua: Now what?</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you found the key.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: There’s a picture of a house.</P>

<P>Joshua: Except where’s the mailbox.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, I forgot the mailbox. Do you want to draw the mailbox for me?</P>

<P>Joshua: First I want….</P>

<P>Kottman: You want to undo me.</P>

<P>Joshua: I can’t even have to stay here.</P>

<P>Joshua: Next time I’m going to tape you to somewhere and then you won’t have to, then, then you can’t go home.</P>

<P>Kottman: Then I can’t go home? My little boy would be pretty sad if I didn’t come home, though.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh, I can do it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Sounds like you’d kind of like to stay here and keep playing for awhile. If you made sure I couldn’t go home then we could stay here and play for a long time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Whoa.</P>

<P>Kottman: Will it come off? Still having a little trouble?</P>

<P>Joshua: Now you have to go get it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. I’ll go get it in a few minutes. Or do you want to go get it?</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know where is it.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, there it is.</P>

<P>Joshua: I got the wizard.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you have…. You’re the wizard now?</P>

<P>Joshua: I still have the [inaudible].</P>

<P>Kottman: You have one, one more house. Here’s another house.</P>

<P>Joshua: Well, you didn’t do the mailbox.</P>

<P>Kottman: I forgot the mailbox. Okay. Uh-oh. I just broke that crayon, too. Argh. Okay.</P>

<P>Joshua: You have to put that one in your pocket.</P>

<P>Kottman: I have to put that in my pocket? There it goes. Now that one’s in my pocket, too. Here’s a mailbox…</P>

<P>Kottman: …in case we need to get some mail. And there’s a mailbox in case we need to get some mail. Now. You know what I want to do?</P>

<P>Joshua: What?</P>

<P>Kottman: You have the magic.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, and this little guy, our snowman, needs a house.</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: He needs a place to live.</P>

<P>Joshua: Let’s do that.</P>

<P>Kottman: Where’s he going to live? Would he live in that house? Who lives in that house with him?</P>

<P>Joshua: Nobody.</P>

<P>Kottman: Nobody?</P>

<P>Joshua: We’re going to have two pictures for the snowman.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh. Is he going to live in both houses?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: Oh, you figured out a solution to the problem. He can live in both houses.</P>

<P>Joshua: Unless you can turn into a star.</P>

<P>Kottman: What did you want me to turn into?</P>

<P>Joshua: A star.</P>

<P>Kottman: A store? Or a star?</P>

<P>Joshua: A star.</P>

<P>Kottman: Star in the sky?</P>

<P>Joshua: No, a store.</P>

<P>Kottman: Store that you buy stuff in. Okay. I turn into a store?</P>

<P>Kottman: Hello, Joshua. What would you like to buy today?</P>

<P>Joshua: Everything.</P>

<P>Kottman: Everything. Okay, here’s everything.</P>

<P>Joshua: Thank you. Turn into a…. It’s…. You’re not going to see me again.</P>

<P>Kottman: Am I a ghost again? Yes?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: No.</P>

<P>Joshua: I want to do red this time.</P>

<P>Kottman: You want to do red this time.</P>

<P>Joshua: One red marker.</P>

<P>Kottman: Red marker instead. Josh, in about three minutes, we’re going to put everything away, but we can play up until that time.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: So….</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s that screw for?</P>

<P>Kottman: What?</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s that screw for?</P>

<P>Kottman: What is that screw for?</P>

<P>Joshua: That I throw.</P>

<P>Kottman: I don’t know. What do you think it’s for?</P>

<P>Joshua: I don’t know. The paper.</P>

<P>Kottman: Maybe. You got me. It’s kind of a mystery to me.</P>

<P>Joshua: Guess what I’m making.</P>

<P>Kottman: I don’t know what you’re making. Looks like somebody’s face. Who is it?</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay. It’s a man! Now like that: doo, doo, doo doo. I’m done.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re done? Does he live in one of the houses?</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup.</P>

<P>Kottman: Is it a girl or a boy?</P>

<P>Joshua: Boy.</P>

<P>Kottman: Boy.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’m done.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re done.</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s that glue for?</P>

<P>Kottman: I don’t know.</P>

<P>Joshua: Paper?</P>

<P>Kottman: Maybe. I’m not sure. I don’t know what it’s for.</P>

<P>Joshua: Oh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. Is it time to clean up? Looks like you’re cleaning that up. We have one more minute until it’s time to clean up and then we’ll clean up together.</P>

<P>Joshua: I’ll clean up now.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. You’re going to start cleaning up now.</P>

<P>Joshua: What’s the scissors for and the glue for?</P>

<P>Kottman: I don’t know, sweetie.</P>

<P>Joshua: The paper?</P>

<P>Kottman: The paper, maybe. We could put the paper in there. That’s an idea. Okay, if you want me to help you clean up, you’ve got to unhandcuff me. Or do you want me to unhandcuff myself?</P>


<P>Joshua: Well, I can…I don’t…. Where is it?</P>

<P>Kottman: It’s right there.</P>

<P>Joshua: I got it first.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, undo them.</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, then I’m going to undo them myself. There they go.</P>

<P>Joshua: Okay.</P>

<P>Kottman: Want to do it? Want to do that one?</P>

<P>Joshua: Catch.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. I’m going to do it then. You decided you didn’t want to let me free, and you know what, I can’t figure out how to do this.</P>

<P>Joshua: No, I not.</P>

<P>Kottman: You’re not?</P>

<P>Joshua: No.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. There we go.</P>

<P>Joshua: And I’m going to keep this key.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, you’re going to keep the key.</P>

<P>Joshua: Yup, see ya.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, let’s see. What do you want me to pick up? We have, we have to pick up the monkey and the magic wands and our paper. You’ve already put the monkey back somewhere. And now you’re going to kick those things and get them kind of out of the way. And then the magic wands. It looks like you’re doing all of the cleaning up. And you cleaned that up, too. So…</P>

<P>You’re cleaning those up, and you cleaned that. You’re putting everything kind of away. I’m thinking maybe you also are feeling a little irritated about leaving because it’s time for us to quit. Shall we pick up anymore of our necklaces or shall we leave them where they are?</P>

<P>Joshua: Leave them where they are. I’m done.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay, we’re done. Then are we done?</P>

<P>Joshua: Uh-huh.</P>

<P>Kottman: Okay. We’re done. Then we’re going to go find your grandma.</P>

<P>Joshua: Bye.</P>

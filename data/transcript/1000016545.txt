<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client number 1429-110, Therapist Dayton, interview number 8, December 21, 1970. Client 1429-110, Therapist Dayton, interview 8, December 21, 1970.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:00:22.4) beat that thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, (inaudible at 0:00:24.8). Is that all right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Christmas cards?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:00:48.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you ever done anything with dream analysis or anything like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I was talking to a friend of mine who's trying to get into - I think it's this Jungian Institute. He was thinking about. And he attends these - I think it's called the "Analytical Psychology Club." And we were just kind of talking about - apparently, what he does is write down - you know, he writes down his dreams. So I thought I'd try it. 0:01:38.3</p>

<p>And I was just - yesterday I kind of - what was yesterday, Sunday. Sunday afternoon I sat down and I kind of went over, like, all my sessions I've had here. And then the last session, which would have been last week, I kind of typed up a few things. And it's more, you know, for my - like, during the week kind of thing to think about and see if anything comes off those things.</p>

<p>Anyway, last night when I went to bed - see, I never remember my dreams. I maybe can recall a dream once maybe every, like, couple of years it seems. And so when I went to bed last night, apparently, all you need is when you wake up - I don't know if there's a technique for doing it - when I went to bed last night I said, "Okay, now when you wake up, you'll immediately think about what you were dreaming about." So when I woke up - I only slept about five hours. When I woke up, my first thing - the first thing that flashed in my brain was the name of this kid I have, Madison Brant.</p>

<p>And, oh crap, I wasn't dreaming because it was just a name. But then I remembered that I had been dreaming. And the feeling I had was that there was a whole bunch of dreams I had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I could only recall the last one. So I was really groggy, but I wrote it all down. And it's really kind of - it was really kind of funny because I was real tired, then I felt it rushing away, you know. And, you know, I was trying to catch it and I knew it was slipping back. And - but I did catch it, I just want to tell you. 0:03:44.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's see, I was sitting in an office. And one thing I thought I'd never dream about is work. I never can remember dreaming about work. But I was sitting in this office and it was on the second floor and it was by a window. But I couldn't see out the window. And I was sitting at a desk, and it was a big old wooden desk like they have at Public Aid. And I thought I was sitting in the West End office because I thought I was half - the West End office is a Public Aid office, and I thought I was halfway there, except for things that happened later in the dream. I must have been only - well, I know I was on the second floor.</p>

<p>And I was right in the middle of the office, but my desk was never in the middle of the office when I was over at Public Aid. And there was a big guy who was sitting a-ways away from me. And where I was sitting was actually in the supervisor's position. But there was a big guy who called to me and said that he had a kid to place, and did I have any ideas. I says, "Yeah," and so I dialed on the phone and I got, like, a - I didn't ask him any questions.</p>

<p>You know, usually if you want to place a kid you ask all sorts of questions, like how old the kid is, what his problems are. Something like that, but I didn't ask this guy anything. This guy was a huge guy and he was partially bald, but I can't remember his face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bigger than you, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:05:31.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said huge, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was big but he wasn't fat. And he asked me if, you know - and so I dialed this number, and there's some things that were a little hazy. But I got the person on the phone, and it was, like - I think it was, like, a small house where - not so much, I didn't see the house. But for some reason, I could see who I was talking to on the phone. And there was music in the background like when my ma used to wash clothes, and I'd wake up in the morning to that kind of music. That's the only thing I could associate with that. And then the woman that answered was a middle aged woman who wore glasses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You saw her even though...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I saw her.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I saw her on the phone. And I don't know how that worked. But I saw her and I talked to her. And she started asking me questions like, how old is the child. And I didn't have any idea and I felt like an idiot. And so I asked this guy, how old is the kid? And he said nine or ten months. And none of this makes sense because I never give a male worker a nine or ten month old baby. And I said nine or ten months. And then she said, "What's his problem?" And I didn't know what his problem was. So finally I called...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Felt like an idiot again?</p>

<p>
PATIENT: Yeah, right. And I - it was like a feeling I get sometimes when I talk to really professional social workers on the phone and they ask me questions like that. And then - so finally, I don't know if I called the guy over. Anyhow, he took the phone and he - I don't know what happened after that. And then later - I don't know what happened then. But later I saw him and I said, "Did the kid get accepted?" And he said yeah, and then I got mad because he didn't thank me, and I thought I had done all the damn work on it. 0:07:40.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I was - it was weird, I was walking - right after that, I was walking a little. And I happened to glance my right and there - you know, like, on an escalator - you know, the escalator, the chutes the corridor thing. Well, it was stairway, it wasn't an escalator, but it was a stairway to the entrance of the building. And the - to the entrance of my office building, it was the same office. But the West End office, we were on the five - on five floors. I don't know of any stairway just like that. And the stairway - I looked straight down and there were two people down there. And there was a woman. And the woman's face I remember, it was nobody I knew.</p>

<p>But the woman was kind of, you know, pausing at the first step. And she was looking up with a kind of an uncertainty as to whether or not she should come up the stairs. Like, somebody that isn't quite sure where - whether they should go up there if that's where the office is. And the man - the man's face I didn't see. But the man was, like, turned away like that. And all I could see was, like, she was almost going to pull him. But the expression on her face was, like, she was uncertain as to whether or not she could come up.</p>

<p>And she had red - brown red hair and kind of a fleshy face, and a little too much makeup on. And she was - she was not fat, but she was matronly. Well, a heavy - not heavyset but just kind of matronly. And if she would have had a name, her name would have been Madelaine because there was a woman back in my old home town that was named that. 0:09:35.5</p>

<p>And that name struck with me right away. And anyhow, she was looking up and she said - I can't remember if she said that somehow I had the idea that they were there for the baby.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, to pick up a...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And it wouldn't have made sense because it wasn't the couple that had accepted the baby. It was this woman on the phone. And of the - there were five people in the dream. That was the end of the dream then I woke up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, that big guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The big guy and had a partial face. The woman on the phone, all I remember is glasses. And then the woman on the steps was the clearest face of all. And the man that she was kind of tugging on the sleeve had nothing. I don't even know what shape he was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm and you were the fifth person? </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was the fifth person in the whole - oh, and there's one other thing I didn't say. I can't remember if this was part of the dream, or if this was part of what I wrote down about the dream. 0:10:55.8</p>

<p>But when I found out that the child was nine or ten months old that made me feel very uneasy, and I think it must have been when I wrote it down that I felt uneasy. I'm not so sure I felt uneasy in the dream, but when I wrote it down. And back in June - the only thing I can figure out is it had something to do with abortion, because in June there was a girl who I was dating who got pregnant. And we went to Tiajuana for an abortion. So I don't know if that was the thing that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That triggered it off?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if that was the thing, - I don't know if that was the thing, like, with the baby. There were other - you know, the woman I kept thinking was my mother, the woman on the phone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who was willing to take the baby, or who you were trying to get to take the baby?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but see, she was, like - when I was talking to her on the phone, it was like talking to a professional person, like a foster home mother.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and she wanted - she was asking all these questions. And yeah, that was strange too. It was, like, a private home and yet, I was supposedly calling someone for a professional - you know, like a - when you call an agency or a independent - you know, like, let's say an orphanage, you would talk with a professional. When you talk to a foster home mother, though, they are rarely trained professionally. 0:12:49.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never known any to be. And yet, she was asking me questions as though she was a professional, yet I know it was a private home and they had this tinkling music in the background. I don't know, that's - you know, I don't know if it was all part - it had all be part of because it all happened in the same office. I'm not that sharp on, you know, really getting, you know, remembering it clearly. Like, I wouldn't do it every day when I get up (inaudible at 0:13:31.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, what does it mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You tell me, that's - I don't - nothing seems...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Associations you have of the woman on the phone was your mother, unlike your mother or was it your mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it was not - it did - it was not my mother. But, like, the association with the laundry room thing. The woman's face was similar, but did - wouldn't have talked like her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, well, it was your dream. It wasn't really your mother there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why. I think the reason I think it was my mother was because of the impression that the - oh, it was like a laundry room. And then this isn't - you know, it doesn't make sense either because why the hell would I call a laundry room? My ma was a homemaker.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, you know, it had the association of the radio, you know, or the music when my ma would be washing in the morning. And the - for some reason, it was confusing there, but I thought the woman was a laundry woman. And yet, the picture I have of the woman is that she had speckled black hair with gray in it. She wore glasses and she had on kind of a maroon - I don't know if it was a business suit or what. And she was sitting, but she had stuff all around her. I remember that too. She had - I don't know if... 0:15:20.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she was like a professional woman, except that all the things around her were not - you know, were much more menial.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With all her stuff around her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, except she didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was dressed as though she were, you know, professionally dressed, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it didn't make any sense why - if I say it's my ma, you know, it doesn't jive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, why would I call my (inaudible at 0:15:55.8) - I don't know anything about dreams. But why would I call my ma, you know, if I'm at work? Supposedly, the dream is - you know, you hang together on your - I don't know if dreams are supposed to hang together or what. I know totally nothing about - I never remember my dreams. The things I remember most was the feeling I had when the guy didn't thank me. And I says...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, wait a minute, we were just talking about this woman.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. But - the woman - it doesn't even - it doesn't, you know, it doesn't - I cannot figure it out. I think it was my ma but it didn't look like my ma. So it couldn't be my ma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't look like her. It wasn't my ma. It wasn't my ma's - unless I wrapped her up in something else. It was a woman I didn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did. She didn't look like your ma, but you thought it was your ma, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in the dream I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, only afterwards you thought it was she? 0:16:59.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and when I tried to figure out whether - in the dream it was a woman I didn't know. But there were little things around it, like, the radio, the music.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That made you think of your ma?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the dream - in the dream itself I - it - you know, it seemed to go together. Things just happened. It was crazy the way it happened. You know, it - to me it - in the dream it was just a very, you know, rational thing to have happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And with the baby I can't remember - okay, well, I'll try (inaudible at 0:17:44.3). There were little segments that, you know, I can't pin down as to why I don't think it was my ma. Things were all around this woman. Like, I think there was a - an ironing board in front of her, a basket to the right of her, some crap like that. And yet, she was answering the telephone and talking. When my ma would work things would be, you know, very proper and she'd have plenty of space to work. You know, for some reason, I don't want to call it my ma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. It's just so covered up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what dreams are all about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but how can my mind make, like, an imaginary person that I've never seen up, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe that's a safe way to disguise your ma. I don't know. What would it mean to you if that person were your ma? Why would she - why would she have there? 0:19:30.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, in the dream I wanted to talk to that lady to find out if I could get a friend's kid accepted for placement. So I was, like, looking to her to provide a home for a kid. And I was doing this for another worker.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she made me feel uneasy by asking me questions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. "How old is he, what's wrong with him?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But the reason I felt uneasy I don't think was so much because of, you know, the fact that there were questions, I felt uneasy because I didn't know the answers.</p>

<p>COUNSELORS: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I had to keep asking this other guy, you know, "How old is the kid, and what's the matter with him?" And, you know, questions which any idiot...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What answers did you get about what was wrong with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That one wasn't answered. That question wasn't answered. It was at that time that I can't - I don't know if I don't remember or if it phases out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But somehow he got the phone and completed the conversation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, talked kind of behind your back, or at least you didn't know what he was saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I finally - you know, I - the feeling I had was that, you know - I can't remember. After the second question, "What's wrong with the kid," then I just - I somehow - you know, I said, well - I put the phone on my desk. I says, "You take it."</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, hmm (inaudible at 0:21:20.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it was that so much, it was just that I didn't want to be bothered anymore asking all - you know, she was asking the questions. I can't do it. If it would have been my kid I would have known.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Suppose you were the kid that you were talking about? Suppose that lady were you ma and you were trying to place yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:22:01.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think of yourself as being all that mature, right? 0:22:13.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you sometimes wonder whether your ma would still be wanting to take care of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All 27 years of you instead of the baby?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might mean something, but I really don't want to - you know, it sounds too crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to think about it, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't want to think about it. It...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Johnny, all things are crazy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you know it didn't - you know, how do you interpret them, though? How do you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm offering a suggestion is maybe one way to interpret it or to think about it. And when I offer that as a suggestion, it was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:23:06.7). I don't want to (inaudible at 0:23:08.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There may be something to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I went - I went at it from a lot of angles but not from that angle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. 0:23:21.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: The - okay, if I was trying, you know, to - if I was trying to get myself in, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With your ma?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she asked typical questions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That any foster mother asks me when I pick up the phone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, maybe you want your ma to be different. To be loving and accepting no matter what, and even when she asked, you couldn't answer (inaudible at 0:23:58.5). How much do you know about yourself? That what you've been saying all along, you really can't figure out what's going on? So you give it to somebody else to tell her about yourself, and then you don't even hear what he says. That's, I guess, not really atypical role of you either, is it? You know, give it to George, he'll tell you all about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like you said to me, "Well, you interpret my dream."</p>

<p>PATIENT: That - I didn't even think of that. And not only that, but it would have been - oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I'm not trying to get out of it. I don't think I am. But I did another thing yesterday, which maybe precipitated it. You know, don't let me off that in case I want to get off because I got a feeling I want to get off that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But yesterday afternoon, I sat down and I typed, you know, all the things I could recall in any way came across my brain. And on some of the things, like, for instance, the phrase I keep repeating, like, I don't really understand why I don't take respon - you know, all this (inaudible at 0:25:59.8), you know, just, you know, popped out so many times. When I got to that section, you know, where I was typing away on that, I somehow got around to the idea that - well, it has to do with sexuality. 0:26:30.3</p>

<p>And I said, okay, now, if I don't take responsibility, if I don't take the initiative, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, part of it must be due to - that somehow I lack confidence in myself. That I lack, you know, really in - well, it all had to do also with being a man. What does it mean to be a man?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And to have confidence...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In your own balls and stuff like that. And I - all of a sudden I thought back to a time when I was circumcised. I was circumcised I think when I was four or five. And the conditions under which I was circumcised was, my ma told me - we lived in a small town. And she told me that we were going - we were going on a holiday or we were going to some place to stay in the city and it would be lots of fun. And there would be a nice room and we would have candy, you know, all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And instead they circumcised you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and nobody told me. When I got to the hospital and I was taken to this damn room and nobody told me. Nobody even told me it was a hospital. You know, I didn't know what was going on. And I was real little I remember that. And they took me into this room, and they still used ether in those days. And, you know, they put this crap on my nose and then this nurse started talking dumb talk, you know, about bicycles and things like that. And I remember she told me to count down from a hundred. And I got to 97 and I zonked out. 0:28:34.3</p>

<p>And when I woke up - I don't think I've ever been, like, that angry. When I woke up I think I was yelling, "You tricked me, you tricked me," you know. And I was furious because when I woke up my - they wouldn't let me put my hands under my covers because they - you know, they butchered me and I was all bloody. And I didn't know what that meant. Nobody ever - nobody explained it to me. And, you know, I don't think I ever forgave my ma for that. And I never...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll bet not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Terrible (inaudible at 0:29:22.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and what it does - you know, what it does is - well, you wake up and, you know - and you don't even know you're going to get cut up like that. And - oh, and you're vomiting too. You're really vomiting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From the ether?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and well - when I typed it up I was - I just got furious because I never realized what this did, like, to my ideas of trusting people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:29:56.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think at the time I ever - you know, I didn't - when I woke up I was mad. You know, I remember just being really mad. And my ma - I don't think my ma had an explanation. And now when I think about, I think it was like, you know, being castrated. And - you know, and I don't understand to this day why it was done...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why she did that to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why it was done so late, yeah. Why wasn't it done right away when I was born? Why - you know, I don't think there was any - I can't remember going to any doctor before that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just took it upon herself. And your father was still alive but he wasn't with you, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I don't think he was alive anymore. I must have been five years old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, and she just took it upon herself and then just deposited you in the hospital, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but she didn't tell me, she didn't tell me anything. She didn't - she didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:31:06.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worse than that - worse than that, I wonder why she did it. I really wonder why she did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why she didn't leave you alone. You know, what's the sense of doing it then, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I - to this - well, I never even thought about it. But I remember things, like, in gym class, you always had to deal with - you know, when I started gym class it was about in seventh grade. And in gym classes, I kind of ran over this too. It was a big deal, like, how big your pecker is. And if you're small, the guys laughed and I was pretty small.</p>

<p>And then when I was about in tenth grade - oh, that was horrible. I went to the doctor and, you know, like now I know what was going on. One of your balls was not - you know, it can get hung up and then it drops.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, wasn't fully descended.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and they can give you a shot for that, but they got to get it there, otherwise, you can become sterile if that isn't done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know any of this. I didn't - I didn't, you know (inaudible at 0:32:23.8). But I didn't know any of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:32:25.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I came back home I had to tell my ma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait a minute, you went to the doctor for what purpose?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was just a general physical. I was also sick a lot when I was a kid.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: This was just a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of your testicles wasn't descended, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and also there was no pubic hair yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it was in tenth grade. It was, you know - it was when you were already in the area where you had gym class. And so he says, "Well, we can give you a couple of shots." So he gave me a couple of shots and then things started happening. But - oh, and I had to come back home and I had to tell my ma that I had shots. I had to get shots because, you know, things weren't growing right. Which is was another - but, you know, I couldn't face her. I told her when I was in the gym. 0:33:12.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so embarrassing, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really. Yeah, and then - well, like, in about two hours yesterday afternoon I just sat and thought about that, you know. And I - as far as my trusting, you know, people especially women, I don't think I trust them. It really caused me to wonder about - and for instance, when I did - when this girl did get pregnant, you know, why was I such an idiot, you know, to get her pregnant? You know, I didn't take any precautions at that time. The thing with my ma...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, does that fit back now to the dream, this girl that you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, now...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, all that - that stuff - I had other things, there were other things to that. Because I was trying to figure out, like, in high school I didn't date girls. And I says, of course, I probably didn't if I had - I was living with my mother, my sister and my grandmother, was the three biggest influences of my life.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, my...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your un-descended testicle?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, that I didn't know till later, but I had this bad experience with that. I never - you know, I never made any of the high school girls - none of them, my sister had (inaudible at 0:34:57.0). All her friends were good looking chicks, (inaudible at 0:35:00.6) all the time. 0:35:05.7</p>

<p>And it just really - I got - you know, I really got furious. I think I called my mother a - you know, yesterday, a trickster and a - I think in essence, you know, like she really did castrate me in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had another word for her too, I think "liar." I think that was the other one too because she really did lie. You know, she really did lie to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't understand...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:35:58.0) feeling today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't say that with much feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not liar, but I was feeling something before about - about that I just - that I don't trust now. And I really don't trust - it's hard for me to trust a girl. I'm not so sure if I trust men either, but I - a woman...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More than women? Not that that's a lot is what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't trust...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe a little bit more than you trust women?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible at 0:36:42.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only way I could...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only way I can soften that is by saying that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should you soften it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm trying to understand my - you know, my ma. But I don't know, she...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say that as though you're trying to talk yourself out of thinking she's a liar or untrustworthy. She did lie to you. 0:37:19.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to believe that somehow (inaudible at 0:37:31.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to believe it because then I would think that there were other things going on in the back of her head that were much more than just a liar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why would she really have me circumcised when I was that old?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm, maybe she did want to castrate you, is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if - like, she's not that sophisticated a woman. It would have to be on sheer instinct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if that would - you know, if that would serve to - I don't know (inaudible at 0:38:20.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe she read something in the "Reader's Digest" that said that boys should be circumcised. How about that? You say she's not sophisticated, maybe that's where it came from.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She doesn't read "Reader's Digest."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Coronet," "Look," "Life," what's the difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She reads the local paper period and she listens to the TV.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Maybe she got it there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then, why didn't she tell me that's (inaudible at 0:38:45.3)? Unless, you know - unless she thought she couldn't get me there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe she thought she'd protect you from this bad scene and not make you anxious beforehand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like she'd done all along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe she did it the best way she thought she could, but she was still a liar. I guess she lied to you out of love. How about that? 0:39:14.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then it makes me feel bad just to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know, see, it seems to me that you really have difficulty in expressing these negative feelings toward your mother or thinking about how stupid she was in some things that she did. Like, you really shouldn't think that about your own mother. Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she's my mother first of all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know that. Does that make her without any liabilities?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I always want to - I'll - you know, I'll think of things but then I'll - I always want to excuse them about her by saying that - you know, things like she was doing her best, stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which doesn't change...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: What she still did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she's still a liar, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still think that, you know, there's something more than she was just, you know, trying to protect me because I really don't - her ideas then of protecting...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that was just far out guess, you know. I have (inaudible at 0:41:27.2) that I say that. I was just offering that as a suggestion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, it makes sense to me, you know. The reason it makes sense is because, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The point is, I guess, one other point. I said, it's difficult for you to think of your mother, in spite of the fact that she may have made mistakes, it's difficult for you to think about the mistakes she may have made. Like, your mother shouldn't do those things or doesn't do those things. 0:41:54.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can think those, I can't feel them very easily, though. I can think - like, I - yesterday afternoon I thought a whole bunch of other things that, you know - that kind of just ran off that thing. Now I don't know if I was hunting for things or what, but that would have followed from that, which I could think, but my anger was really just at the point of when - well, I think because when I woke up from ether I was so mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - I can't think of anything rottener to do to a little boy at that age. I think I must have been five. I mean, that to me was just a - it's like every time my ma has done that. Like, when my sister got pregnant. I didn't know a damn thing about it, and I came walking in like a complete ass, and there's my sister, you know, about seven months pregnant and I didn't even know about it. You know, that's her (inaudible at 0:43:15.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Always withheld sexual matters from you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's (inaudible at 0:43:23.3). Yeah, my sex education was confined to one sentence when I was in ninth grade. And a big hairy promise to always be a gentleman, that was it, you know, one lousy sentence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I said this last time when I was home over Thanksgiving, I asked my ma, you know, what was my dad like, you know, and how affectionate were we and all this shit? And she said that in their household, you know, affection was considered a sin, affection, you're not screwing, just affection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:43:58.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you imagine what their screwing must have been like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, probably pretty good. I think my dad was a good, you know - I think when she...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was good but how about her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I remember my ma screwing once (inaudible at 0:44:18.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of her boyfriends, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. That's one of my earliest memories. I don't know, I never told her. I wonder what she - I should test her on it just to see what she would do. One time when I was going through these think back deals, we used to live in a little house that was separated. The kitchen was separated from the living room by a curtain. That was our first house for seven years.</p>

<p>And one of my earliest memories was smoke blowing like that. Well, that usually meant - when my mom was smoking late at night, or usually when this boyfriend of hers was coming over. Now they never screwed, at least I never knew about it. But - and I didn't even know what screwing was so I - I don't know. But anyhow, one time I remember and this wasn't with this guy. This was with (inaudible at 0:45:21.6). And I usually would lay awake at night worrying or getting jealous or something, you know, because, you know, she was - that's the way sex was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sex was late at night, never tell the kids, all this sort of thing. Don't tell your mom and dad about it. Oh, God, she'd never tell her mom and dad if she had a boyfriend. It was a big scene when she had to even do that. But anyhow, one night I remember. It was one of these late at night things. And all I heard was the screen door open and I heard low, muffled voices. But it was some guy and I know they took out the - we had this little rollaway. 0:46:13.5</p>

<p>And I remember I thought she was getting hurt because it was all these, like, moans and stuff like that and squeaking. It must have been squeaking for about two hours, or at least I thought it was. And I remember I was crying in my bed. And I didn't know - I don't know if I knew that they were screwing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid to get up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, God, (inaudible at 0:46:40.4). Oh, I was - no, I was - I must have been jealous. And I thought she was getting hurt. I think that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jealous that somebody else was hurting her instead of you hurting her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to reject that, but I was crying because I thought she was getting hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were jealous that you weren't there with her instead of somebody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, I don't - I don't know about that. But I just remember that and I know my ma didn't know that I knew that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That she - she - well, she's never known that I knew that. Somehow I think I knew who that was. That's maybe a - that same day, it seems to me on the same day that that - I don't know, this might be just trying to pile something up. But on the same day that that happened, a person had stopped an old car earlier in the afternoon. And it seems like it was my father's brother. His name was Donny. But I don't know if that happened on the same day. 0:49:09.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're saying that you think it was your uncle who was screwing your mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it flows together, I can't remember. Because I didn't recognize any voices, I don't remember any voices. But it seems to me he stopped there that same day and he only - all I remember is his car I don't remember him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I only met him once and he was killed somewhere. That's - you know, that's the way it was. It was always - both of my ma's boyfriends that when they were finally introduced, it was a scene.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A big scene, first time, both of the ones she ever dated for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: First time it was a - you know, I knew he was coming, it was the same damn thing. She would put the kids to bed and, you know, he'd come in late at night. And she'd think we were sleeping, you know. I don't know how dumb she thought us kids were. But I usually - I don't know, I usually couldn't go to sleep then either. I don't think they were messing around or anything. And - see, usually what I could anticipate on which night this guy was coming. And usually I'd go over and sleep at my grandmother's. 0:50:44.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And on one night I was balling again and I left. And I just stormed out of the house and I ran over to my grandmother's house. And then I told my grandmother that my mom was seeing this guy. And I must have said something like I wasn't welcome around there or something like that. And then my ma came over that night and, you know, introduced him, like, you know, guilty as hell kind of thing. And the other time was - it was a similar sort of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Okay, we'll meet again two weeks from Thursday, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: January 7th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What can you read on the dreams? What would be a good thing to read on them, is there anything that - or is it more of less what I think the dream means?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's what I think, it's what you think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing really to read?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, there's several books. Freud has a book on interpretation of dreams. Jung has a book in which he analyzes a lot of his own dreams called, "Memories, Dreams and Reflections," I think. I think he has a book on dream interpretation also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'll snatch (inaudible at 0:52:24.6). Do you ever interpret any of your own?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I sometimes try to. I have trouble remembering my dreams, though, too. Merry Christmas.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, same to you, have a good Christmas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See you on the 7th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay, so long.</p>

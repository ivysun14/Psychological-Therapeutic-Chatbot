<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) Just separate things came into my mind.  And (clears throat) I don't know, I guess I've been trying to decide which one is sort of more importantly on my mind.  One was the — it's all z____ — one was, uhm, a feeling I had this morning when I was j—, I just happened to, my eye was caught by a letter I'd thrown away by my mother.  And the parts showing from the wastebasket was where she signed her name, said, "Love"  and then signed, "Mama".  And for some reason it had, had a very strong feeling of, well, anger was the only way I could describe it but it was more than anger or it was a variety of things.  And it made me feel uncomfortable.  And I ended up just feeling angry.  And this really surprised me.  It wasn't a letter I'd received recently and that just, it caught my eye quickly and I quickly had this very intense feeling.  And I sort of had to fight against it.  And then I r—, just was, well, feeling surprised that I'd felt that way.  And I think the reason I felt the anger and, I don't know, a variety of emotions was somehow, seeing the word, love, and feeling that she just automatically used it in that case and it's the only time, when she writes letters, so that in a way there really isn't any feeling behind it, is what was bothering me or it, it was, there was something about the mechanical relationship that we have or everything's done according to a formula or rules.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it made me think, too, that, uhm, whenever I've seen my mother using this in writing, it's always given rise to this emotion because I've always felt that it's an empty word, the way it's being used and that it's only in letters or cards or something like that that you use it.  But if you're with the person you can't show this.  (Pause) In fact, sometimes I think when I've gotten birthday cards from my parents or cards for other occasions, I've wished that they hadn't sent them to me.  I think I'd be hurt if they didn't remember my birthday or I'm pleased when they remember other days but the fact that I have to look a this word written down there bothers me enough so that I think in a way I'd rather not get these cards.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And a word keeps coming to my mind that ever since I read it this weekend, just seems to apply so much to my family. Uhm, and it's the word, uptight.  It was in a review on "Portnoy's Complaint."  And I don't know, just, nobody dares let anything out.  Everything, everybody's uptight.  (Pause) And I th—, another thing I was just thinking of, uhm, something else I read.  Uhm, I think it was an interview of Roth and at one point he made some comment about the fact that people's concern with guilt and persecution and all was comic.  And he also referred to "Othello"  and how, in a way, it, that was also a very comic situation.  And just the whole view of that kind of thing was something that I'd never looked at it that way before.  And it made me think of how myself and everybody in my family, we all take things so seriously and, again, are tied up with guilt feelings.  Or, or I was just thinking now, it's almost a misconception of what we do wrong and how it can affect other people.  So often we justify our guilt feelings or how we act because we think we shouldn't do it because of the effect it can have on somebody else.  But half the time who cares?  It's almost like if we just were free for a while, acted freely and just the way we felt like, that we're telling ourselves we can't because somehow it'll affect somebody else adversely.  And it's sort of the way our sense of responsibility fits in too, this great feeling that if we shirk our responsibility 1 minute, then it'll be an awful load on somebody else.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I start thinking about the other thing that I thought of when I first came in here.  It's continuation of Friday, just, well, almos—, just sort of wondering how much the fact that I can't imagine or believe or anything that my parents had intercourse more than 4 times for 4 children has affected how I look at things.  Because I think I felt more than I ever have before that, in thinking of it in this way, that just having intercourse for the pleasure of it is, is something I, I just can't accept.  There has to be a purpose and so that would be for creation.   And it ties in with the fact that that's the only time I can believe my parents ever did it.  (Pause) And it's always, uhm, well, not always, but very often, if I am enjoying having intercourse, it's when I suddenly realize I'm enjoying it that something will happen and I, I lose my ability to enjoy it.  I, it's almost as if I have to not let myself, now, to punish myself for having enjoyed it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  That's when you get uptight.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Ah, I make the point because you said these 2 things were separate at the beginning.  And I wonder if they aren't related.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  Well, the uptight, the word just struck me because it seemed to cover everything, everything I can think of in terms of my family. (Pause) Even to when my parents are — just makes me think of the image of my parents kissing me at any time, hello, good bye or any time.  And you just feel they're a little ramrod somehow putting their arms around you but in the process of doing that, they're also pulling away.  (Pause) I think I felt about that, this, when I was younger, the same way I feel when I see them writing, "Love"  or any such closing in a letter.  Uhm, again, just why did they have to do it if they don't really feel it?  And it makes it worse for them to do it without the feeling, especially with my father, because he would just be so nervous when he had to kiss us.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p> The word, uptight, made me think of something else or just this whole thought of not having control — I was thinking more in terms of having control or not having control.  And I read an article this weekend by parents, a couple who'd just had a child, on their experience.   And they, they were taking one of the courses on, uhm, different things you can do to make having the birth easier for the wom—, on the part of the woman.  And, uhm, just one comment by somebody who had been at one of these courses struck me.  Because they asked people who've had children before to just tell their experience and, I guess, what led them to take this course for the second baby.  And 1 or 2 said that they'd had this terrible fear of losing control, which I suppose is really — I don't know, when I read that, it just seemed, yes, that's exactly how it, seems to be the fear I have.  (Pause)</p>

<p> And I think there's something about being in a position that you can't change and having it one that I find, when I think about it, terribly, well, embarrassing or, again to have a lot of people wandering around.  Because it seems like there's more than just one person there.  In fact, some, some of my friends talk about all these interns who are learning about delivering babies so they're all around.  And, and the fact that they aren't looking at me as me, I mean, I can keep telling myself that but I think there's something about that that really disturbs me too.  It's, I mean, it's just another example of having absolutely no control.  And this makes me think of, this fear of not having control makes me think of something that I've felt confused about recently because, I don't know, it seems that what I really want is not, not to have, is just not to feel I have to control myself but that I redirect how I control myself.  And then I just feel very confused, when I think about that. Because if I, — well, I suppose the reason I'm thinking about that is right now, sometimes when I'm feeling a lot of tension or pressure for whatever reason and, well, I just probably take it out on MSCZ by being just awful to him.  

And then I can see that that is where I should have control over myself. So that in a way, not having, I associate not having the kind of control I'm familiar with, with just becoming very immature and horrible and selfish.  I suppose it's because the emotions that come out if I stopped controlling them, are all awful emotions or lead me to do things that aren't very nice.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, you know, you said last week, not for the first time but I think more directly last week, that you were, eh, — or it might have been the previous Friday or so.  At any case, that you felt, when you were quite small, that you had the picture of yourself as someone who could kill.  You could have killed FNA, you wanted to kill MLWZ.  If you view yourself in rage or in anger, I think it frightens you terribly that that, in fact, is the case, that you're always worried about it.  That you have to keep a tight rein on things lest you get out of hand, in specifically that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, I know I've felt that way at times but, in thinking in terms of MSCZ, either I've hidden it too well, or else — I don't know, it's just sort of a feeling that I want him to be totally concerned with me and considerate and do what I want but I don't want to feel I have to return it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Last week you put it in a slightly different way.  You recall when you said his penis is the source of all your problems.  If you could get rid of that then it would settle everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I guess it depends on the mood I'm in.  (Laughs) Because sometimes it just seems that I'm just trying to be a little girl and have him be fatherly to me.  And because I'm a little girl, he won't expect too much from me. I can give what I want but I can stop when I want too because you don't expect that much from a child.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think that, I'm just thinking about something which I'm not very clear on right now but in going back to just letting go and not controlling these emotions that so often I seem to be kind of pushing away because they're too unpleasant or lead to, to unpleasant things, uhm, there's an aspect of it too which makes me feel guilty, I guess, but of just sort of enjoying this feeling so awful. And, and then that will, I don't know, I'll become aware of feeling awful and then I'll pity myself.   And the whole cycle, I, there's somehow, if I start getting into that, I do, I think I get some kind of perverse pleasure in it.  And then after a while, it just disgusts me so much that I'll feel, well, the only things to do is to control yourself and push it all aside and get out of this state. And I think another aspect of my confusion comes because right now I do think a person has to get themselves out of a state like that but I'm not doing it in the right way because all I'm doing is pushing things under the carpet. It's like all my piles that I'll hide in closets or something. Instead of really just taking care of them, I'll put it off.  And I think of that in particular because this weekend I was trying to just throw away a lot of things that — I could do it for a little while then I just lost all my ability to do it. And while I was doing it, I could feel myself getting more and more upset over it or tense.  Or, at the beginning it was a relief and I felt good about it and then sort of doubts would come in: "Well, maybe I'll need that."  Or "Maybe I should look at this."  And, and pretty soon, it made me feel almost sick to be throwing the things out and I had to stop.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's funny.  I was trying to throw away a lot of old magazines, for one thing, this weekend.  And even when I'm rationalizing and I know it, I still, it works for me.  Because I don't know, well, I think I was, the most blatant case of rationalizing was feeling that I'd paid for these magazines and, somehow, even if MSCZ has read them, it doesn't really help me feel that the money's been spent well.  So I feel I have to look at them all.  And then when I see things I want to read, I somehow feel that I'll lose some great opportunity if I don't read them.  So then I read them all and have an awful time, however long I spend on it, because I'm under this terrific pressure that I'm not getting these things thrown away.   And I don't really enjoy reading them.  And the whole experience becomes sort of a nightmare.  And I'm kind of dragging around through it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think sometimes I've thought the best thing for me to be, in a way, though I have a terrific horror of this for the same reason, but if ever all my possessions could just be burned up in a fire.  Because somehow I have this feeling I can never, I couldn't function without all these things that I've saved or have.  (Pause) And I think sometimes now I have the feeling if I, if all these things could just be burned up, then I could find out a little bit more about myself and what I do want and am interested in and like and so forth.  Because now I'm just imprisoned by all these things I've kept.  And I have to have to have a reason for having kept them.  And sometimes looking at them will disgust me too just like being in a self-pitying mood will or, well, I think sometimes I've even felt disgust, I'm not sure about this, but I think I have even when I've started to enjoy intercourse and then have stopped being able to.  I don't know whether it's just frustration or if it's disgust at myself there too.  (Silence) It's almost as if the feeling I have when I think about this type of thing, in particular all the things I save but even more than that is, if I could just sort of wave my arms around and break apart all these things that are — well, I just feel imprisoned.  But somehow it will take more courage than I think I feel.  (Pause)  And when I realize I don't quite dare just throw my arms out, my, the next feeling is to roll up into a little ball.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: These things you refer to, there are the things that you, you refer to as the magazines, for example, and which, quite a while back, you talked as the stacks and piles of things that you keep, papers and, is that what you're referring to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I was also, just a minute ago, thinking about the kitchen and, I don't know, I just, lots of little things that I don't throw away or find a place for.  It's not that bad and, but just somehow it depresses me, drives MSCZ crazy.  And right now it's depressing me because I just don't know how to handle it but I know I don't like it the way it is and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Can you give me an example, in your kitchen?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, things are on surfaces and, uhm, we don't have very much storage space so some utensils and things are on surfaces.  And then I have a bowl which, uhm, in the summer I have fruit in and that type of thing but in the winter it just becomes a catch-all. And I never seem to really get it cleaned out and empty and then put that away.  Or I'll just put things down for a while and it take—, and I won't get them put away until a day or 2 later or I don't just get things taken care of.  Or, as soon as I clean up the kitchen, which I've done on occasion, so that things are all put away and surfaces are clear so you don't feel there're are just things all around you, I just start all over again.  I can't seem to maintain it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And this feeling that I have to save anything that might be useful someday (clears throat) like bottles or a lot of things come in sort of aluminum containers now and I've, have to throw them away now because I don't have room but it drives me crazy and I have saved some.  And I don't know how much I — this is an attitude my family has, particularly my father.  My mother too.  I don't know how much it's one of them or the other but their, their kitchen has always been cluttered and junked up just the way mine is.  Only now when I see theirs it drives me crazy too.  And I don't know how much that it's just from seeing it that I'm doing the same thing or if it's something much more basic than that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You refer to it as their kitchen.  Is that the way you thought of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I do now. I, their whole house, I do feel that way now.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because when we go into it, just, there's just junk everywhere And I completely disassociate myself from it because it drives me crazy. In fact, sometimes when I go to their house I'll think of ways to help my mother pick some of them up because I just can't stand it.  And since they're not my things, I find it very easy to clear them away.  It's just when they're my things that I've saved that I can't throw them away.  (Pause) In fact, sometimes when I've thought of having a bigger kitchen or just having any kind of a kitchen I'd like, I've had this feeling I don't want a big kitchen, which is what my mother's always had because all I can think of is this big kitchen getting piles of junk all over the place.  And somehow when I have a small kitchen, you can only have so much junk so then it's more controllable.  (Silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Something else just occurred to me and I think it's connected with thinking about how I will often keep things clean, I'll clean the house, but yet there'd be, the house could be a mess, even though I'd cleaned it.  And it made me think of how I've always been particularly, but particularly when I was in high school, how I would be very neat about the way I appeared. And well, it's only recently that I can stand to have the wind blow my hair and not have every hair in place, and things like that. And this seems sort of ironic that I would be so intense on appearing so neat outwardly but somehow it was the complete opposite of this, well, chaos that I feel inside. (Pause) Or it's the same when the more uncomfortable or upset or just different emotions that are going on inside me, the more on the surface I'll look calm and in control.  Well, even in high school, I remember somebody once said that they thought I was a snob. I was so afraid of people that I guess I just looked like I didn't really care and wasn't interested.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

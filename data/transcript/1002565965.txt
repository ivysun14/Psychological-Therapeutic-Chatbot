<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what's new?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	New, uh, my son is [AGE] today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yay, that's exciting.  Going to do anything fun?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I haven't decided what she'd been planning, which reminds me, may I pay you at the end of the day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, sure, that's fine, no problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Waiting for parental.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine, you can give me that check when you get it, whatever works for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So something that's not too expensive, but fun, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  He finished his kindergarten Hooked on Phonics section.  He's read all 15 of those books which is where [INAUDIBLE].  On day three of drug holiday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you on a break from school right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it just came to a small lull, okay.  Now is as good a time as any to try this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To go without the Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you notice any significant difference off of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, wow, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Waking up in the morning is brutal, staying on task is brutal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, finding a task to get focused on is brutal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's hard, do you mean just to initiate projects?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then once you do initiate, it's hard to stick with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm sitting there looking at microbiology and my second A&P and also looking at the fetal pig that I have spread out on my table and I sit there and I'm like what, which of them's the most important, whereas with the Adderall it would just be like it's all important, choose one.  Dive in.  Got to get done, dive in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how many days you going to stay off of it before you go back on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll probably go back on it today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You know, if this were the future, something to think about is a lot of people do a drug holiday like either over spring break if they don't have a lot going on or Christmas break or summer break just 'cause that reason, you're describing it's not as hard to get things done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd gotten so far ahead that I just thought, I'll just try it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no harm as long as you don't fall behind or anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's school going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	School's going well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	School's going well.  Microbiology is a little hard.  It's not something I'm used to.  Um, you know, of course I don't have an incubator and all these other things that they said that you would need.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh, they want you to have your own incubator?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and then I said I'll build one out of a box and a fluorescent lamp with like a shoebox, a fluorescent lamp, some tinfoil and something else.  That didn't provide 37 degrees centigrade for anything.  So the closest thing I found was on top of my water heater in the closet and that stays about 37ish.  So my culture are hit or miss which means my results are hit or miss.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, hopefully you can get through it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But when they do work it's really fascinating, it really is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're growing different kinds of bacteria, is that what they have you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And  E Coli is one of them.  I didn't know that they would send you E Coli.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, there are different strains of E Coli.  Some are pretty benign, some are pretty toxic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm hoping this one was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, benign variety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Benign [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I hope so too.  And now you'll be applying for nursing school this spring, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When does that start, the application process, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I've decided against moving out [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, way down south and way down southeast to trinity colleges with no wait list.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, that's right, I remember you telling me it was like Trinidad there was [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and one other one, Trinidad, they're associated, and Lamar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lamar, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just can't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just plug it up from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My rates have gone down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, that helps a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, man.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good, so, um, [INAUDIBLE] I hear they got like a, I don't know, a two year waiting list or something like that?  Is that what you've heard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't know about [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED] is up to three years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.  Do you know how long it is at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think they have one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think they just have more stringent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Criteria to get in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Guidelines, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you should be in good shape, so hopefully you'll get in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, good.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I guess they just can't enough nursing professors I guess is the problem.  There's a nursing shortage period and the nurses that are working can make a lot more working, you know, in the community than they can teaching.  So we just can't get enough professors I hear.  It's just too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.  That'll change though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully, hopefully.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The nursing profession will age as the baby boomers aged.  They don't want to get out of it, they want to stay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do more teaching and less clinical work.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how's your mood been overall, doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mood's been good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just ended or got out of a relationship.  I started dating the neighbor upstairs, which I will never do again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't work, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She has a [AGE] daughter.  Yeah.  So bizarrely, she asked me for advice about parenting.  She said, you know, [NAME OTHER] well behaved and [NAME OTHER], I can't get her to listen and do anything.  And I said very politely I said, well, I think it's you're just, you're inconsistent with her.  One day she's allowed to scream and stomp and another day she's not.  She took that as the most offensive thing.  And threw my coffee cups over the edge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Destroyed a couple of my books, not my school books, but my regular books.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she went into a rage, huh?  Well, that's where [NAME OTHER] gets her trouble then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mom's rageful and emotionally explosive.  The daughter's probably going to be explosive too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Mom's military, mom was away for seven months.  So that probably may be a factor too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, it's a huge impact.  Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm happy to be out of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's probably good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I'm just uncomfortable, we pass each other on the stairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tough.  Yeah, well, that's too bad.  Well, are you sleeping well, are you losing sleep at night?  Sleeping fine, okay.  And eating well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And is your energy level holding up pretty well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, in the past few days not so much.  I've been drinking a lot more coffee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So with the Adderall, you have good energy, without it, not so good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  And [INAUDIBLE] concentrations, okay with the Adderall, not so good without it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Have you been having any anxiety lately that you think is more than circumstances warrant?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And are you getting some enjoyment out of just day to day activities?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually  I wrote that down, you asked me something to that effect last time, what I do for fun and I couldn't answer you.  I drove away thinking am I not having fun?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the question is, I mean, sometimes people just get enjoyment just like spending time with your son for example.  But other times people feel like they're just going through the motions and even those kinds of things, like hanging out with family is not as enjoyable as usual.  Do you get some enjoyment from hanging out with [NAME OTHER] now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wrote down a few things.  It bothered me.  I was thinking, what, surely I do something for fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So what'd you come up with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we have plants all over our house.  I love plants.  And, um, it seems like every time you've called me we've been out on a rock climb.  So rock climbing is in there.  Legos is kind of like the thing that he and I do together.  And then I like fidgeting around with my computer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's that.  Just so you know I'm not without fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fun or joy or anything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I know with school it makes it a little tougher because you probably don't have the amount of time that you would otherwise have, but, yeah, it sounds like you have plenty of things that you find time for that you enjoy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's at least a half an hour a day of rock climbing if weather permits just for the exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.  Where do you go rock climbing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's nice.  Good, all right.  Any side effects from the medications you can tell, from the Adderall or the Xanax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Xanax is the same as it's always been.  It's there when I need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And it works fine still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and the Adderall, the same thing.  It's there when I need it and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So no loss or diminishment in benefits over time that you can tell with either one of them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.  The Adderall I became really aware of, um, when it kicked in [INAUDIBLE].  And when it started to come, wean off.  It was very, very draining.  It was like, okay, here it is, time to sit down and study and go at it and then without fail I would get a feeling that it's not quite around.  I could press on and keep studying but I'd feel this exiting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the effects of it were more noticeable both at the onset and when it wore off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More so when it wore off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Yeah, so hopefully medicine will continue once you go back on.  It should.  And then like I said if over spring break or even over the summer if you wanted to take a longer medicine holiday, you may find that it's even more effective when you go back on it.  Um, what else, any new stresses?  Anything other than the relationship you mentioned, anything else going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, one day when—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] contacted my parents and asked them if they thought it would be okay for her, [NAME OTHER] grandmother, to get in touch with me and possibly schedule a visit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, how long's it been since she's seen him, since you've seen her or [NAME OTHER] seen her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In two or three years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he doesn't even know her then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he has no idea who she is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.  So do you know where that's coming from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Guilt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She, it really upset my dad, you know, because they've been sending, they've been [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If she's not paying any kind of child support?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not paying child support and her mom just flat out cut off communication with us, with our whole family.  Our whole family has tried to reach out to her and [INAUDIBLE] she'd be a part of his life or whatever.  And now out of the blue she just says, you know, I'm sorry, I was an absentee grandmother and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it the grandmother or the mother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Grandmother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, his, remind me, his mother, where is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's in [DEIDENTIFIED] also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they're both in [DEIDENTIFIED], the mother and the grandmother.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And is it his mother or his grandmother that wants to see him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Grandmother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she amended her e—mail with, um, the notion that, you know, the first couple times she'd like to just come and visit alone and then maybe [NAME OTHER] could come along later.  And, you know, I'm trying to, I don't know the psychology very well, but, you know, you and my mom and my brother I'm trying to run it past them and say, look, the implications could that have upon him.  He never asks about his mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, poor little boy.  A lot of it depends on what kind of influence she would be in his life.  I mean, would she be a consistent steady force in his life?  Would she be inconsistent and disruptive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that sounds exactly like what my mom said and my brother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other thing to think about, I mean, is she in a pretty, do you know anything about where she's at in her life if she's in a stable place or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] his mother, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  The only thing I know about [NAME OTHER] is that, uh, her mother says that she has completed her 12 step program and continues to go through AA meetings and, you know, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And here's another challenge, do you have legal, full legal custody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you do, okay.  Excuse me.  So that she doesn't have any legal, does she have a legal right to visitation at this point, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, but she would have to go back to the courts to re—establish it 'cause at one point, um, when I left from [DEIDENTIFIED] to come back to [DEIDENTIFIED] to go back to school I was court ordered to pay for two round trip airfare tickets for her every year, um, within two weeks of her giving me notification if that was workable.  And then she had to leave [DEIDENTIFIED] within 48 hours of that time period.  She never took advantage of it.  She never paid child support.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are your court orders in [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], okay.  'Cause everything with each state, the laws are different about what can and can't happen.  Um, boy oh boy.  I'm thinking at some point [NAME OTHER] probably will start raising questions.  And oftentimes when kids get in school and suddenly see that other kids have a mommy and daddy sometime, you know, most of the time, not always, a lot of times they don't, but that's when kids start asking more questions typically.  Um, so he'll probably start having questions like that.  Now how you deal with that is up to you.  There are a lot of different choices.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm bracing myself for that day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, and it happens a lot.  I mean, there are a lot of single parents.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, so it's not like you can't manage it just fine.  I guess the challenge is going to be if [NAME OTHER] is wanting to re—establish contact, you know, what do you decide?  I mean, I don't know the right answers since I don't know her.  I don't even know what your legal options are in terms of can you say no, do you have to allow her to have contact?  And if so, you know, how much and when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I called my attorney in [DEIDENTIFIED] and he's looking into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The options and things like that.  I just, I kind of wanted to get your take and see if there was a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, from my standpoint the most important thing is what kind of influence is she going to be in his life.  I mean, if she can be a positive influence where she sees him consistently maybe twice a year, visits with him, and is a positive role model for him, that could be something that could really help him in his life.  If she is disruptive, she's inconsistent, she's, you know, those kind of things, it could be very disruptive to him in his life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I left her in 2004 that was her in a nutshell, inconsistent, explosive.  Drunk and doped out of her mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so she was using a lot of drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh my gosh.  She looked like a skeleton when I left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the challenge is going to be, you know, is she stable, is she sober, been sober for how long, you know, can she space over the negativism and be a positive influence or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I followed, I have heard her legal, um, her whole legal thing on a tracker on my computer she's been in and out of jail for, you know, failure to pay fines, um, she turned a corner without signaling and her license was still suspended from a drunk driving accident.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she's had a lot of legal problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of them are little things, but still part of me just says that that's going to provide inconsistency and I don't want to keep [NAME OTHER] from his mom unless she's going to be, you know, pathologic influence.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's the most important thing.  I mean, kids can grow up with a single parent and be just fine.  They can grow up with parents who split up and be fine as long as the parents are loving and consistent.  It's the inconsistencies or the negative behaviors and the destructive behaviors that can have horrible influences on kids.  I think you're smart to talk to your attorney, find out what your legal options are first.  And then I mean there's another option, at least in Colorado, and again I don't know the laws in [DEIDENTIFIED], where if the parent's concerned about the other parent's kind of mental state they can request a, it's like a custody evaluation, there's another term for it, I can't think of it right now, psychological evaluation of the person to see if they're really fit to be involved as a parent.  It's not cheap, but and again the laws vary in terms of who has to pay for that.  But it's something else to consider, does she need to have a substance abuse evaluation, a psychological evaluation to see if she's even stable enough to see [NAME OTHER] and spend time with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was fine until she, until we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] and the drugs in her system.  She was just normal, loving mom.  I couldn't have been happier with who she was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then very rapidly changed, very, very rapidly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What was she using?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Crystal meth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It changes personalities.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very quickly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so I agree 100% with what you're doing in terms of consulting with your attorney, find out what your legal options are.  And if you still have concerns you might consider seeing if in [DEIDENTIFIED] they have some provision whereby you can request a psychological evaluation or substance abuse evaluation on her to make sure that someone else feels that she is mentally stable enough to be involved in his life.  'Cause given her history if she's not, it could be real disruptive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was less than a year ago she refused drug, mandatory drug testing and took community service.  So what does that say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm still on drugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, she's not wanting to clean up.  Well, the best thing you can do I think also is just keep taking care of yourself, you know.  Keep being a stable steady influence on [NAME OTHER] life, 'cause that's what he really needs.  You are his parent now.  He's, depends on you and the more your life progressive, stable, it's consistent, you know, the better he's going to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And dating, I think after that incident every bone in my body says just wait, just hold off until he's 18 and gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's tricky.  You know what, it's tricky.  I mean, there's some positive advantages of having a female role model in his life if again she's a positive stable influence, but it's also very difficult.  I mean, statistically the odds say for a family to become a blended family with stepchildren, the divorce rate is higher than for the first marriage, you know, for the first marriage, about 50% of marriages end in divorce, for blended families it's like 60% or 70%, and it's usually because it's very difficult to stepkids.  Parents have a difficult time, um, parenting someone else's children and being a stepparent.  It's very difficult.  It's not the same as raising your own biological child.  So it's challenging, but if you find the right person, I mean, and it's a positive stable influence, again it could be a real positive thing for it too.  So I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to that.  I mean, you kind of have to trust your own instincts and be real careful and cautious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just nervous 'cause he really latched onto her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Almost as a mother figure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And her daughter did the same thing with me, but, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's part of the challenge, two parents.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if it doesn't work out sometimes it can be really difficult for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't have coffee cups thrown downstairs and screaming and yelling and kicking and everything else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not healthy, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  Yeah, I think you're wise to be very cautious.  So do you need a prescription for the Adderall too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, there are a lot of challenges, but overall it sounds like you're doing really well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really have no complaints.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Well, hopefully things will keep [INAUDIBLE] school too and career.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I can't wait for the career.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As much as I love school I need to get paid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it helps.  There's the prescription for a month's worth.  Okay.  Anything else today that you want to talk about before we set another appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, um, do you want to check in in a month, do you want to go a couple months, what do you feel comfortable with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm fine with a couple months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well, in a couple months you can call if you need a prescription or if you need anything before then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So this is [DATE] so maybe around [DATE] or thereabouts.  Is there a day of the week that works best for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, any day is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  We could do another Monday eight or eight thirty, nine thirty, what time works well for you in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, nine or nine thirty would be better because if [NAME OTHER], I'm already out but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about Monday [DATE] at nine thirty sound okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  When you get low on the Adderall just give me a call and I'll get you another prescription so you don't run out, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or if you need anything else before then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I feel like I'm forgetting something but [INAUDIBLE].  I got the major bases covered.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you think of it later just give me a call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you have a good day and enjoy [NAME OTHER] fifth birthday, it should be a fun one, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever you do, just hanging out together could be pretty fun, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And we've got some more work to do on the place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that's a big one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  Take care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You too, bye—bye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there a pharmacy nearby?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a Safeway pharmacy, there's a Walmart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, Walmart might be cheaper for the prescription.  You know where that is on [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you go out, um, as you go back to the interstate, go over the bridge, take the second stoplight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Second or third?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Third is [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Over the bridge?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't turn on the highway, go over the bridge?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, go over the bridge and actually the second right, it's called [DEIDENTIFIED], that'll take you down by the high school and keep going and it'll curve around to Walmart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?  See you later.</p>

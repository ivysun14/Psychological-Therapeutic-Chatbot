<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so, I'm just looking at your chart here, [PATIENT NAME], and the last time I think you were here was December.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really, it's been that long?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then I, I know that you'd been at the hospital and I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you up there about a month ago, give or take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably about March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Little over a month.  So you, you were up there for about a week and yeah, it looks like you got out on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So about a month and a half ago.  Um, I think we made a small adjustment in your medication while you were there, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Memory serves?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, we, uh, the Zoloft to, um, 3 times a day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which would have been 100 mg out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, in addition to that, you're still taking Abilify and I think you're at 30 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We didn't change that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're still taking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Doxepin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doxepin?  Mainly at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, just at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's, that's helping you to sleep, hopefully?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, um, my family doctor put me back on Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you got Ambien now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Um, I just wasn't sleeping, Doctor.  So, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So we've got the Abilify and Zoloft, we got you back on 10 mg on the Ambien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And when you got, you still taking the Doxepin, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And then you're, you've always been on the Neurontin as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I think as far as what I gave you at the time you left the hospital, that sounds like the, the way it was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  We're also taking the Vistaril as a p.r.n.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I want to talk to you about that, if we could.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Just, uh, give me an overview what, what you been feeling like in the, in the past 4, 6 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, Zoloft is doing the job.  It's, it's definitely helped.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In, in what way do you think it's helping things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it's in, my moods improved immensely.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about anxiety wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anxiety wise, um, a little bit of on the anxiety and the, and the Vistaril seems to be helping that.  But what I was, um, asking you if, if, if we could do that every day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often have you been using the Vistaril lately?  Has it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's p.r.n., but you've been needing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You taking it once a day usually, do you ever -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I was going to ask for you do it twice a day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I think that's an option.  You've got a fair amount of medication that you're taking, so we, we certainly want to not overdue it if we can help it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, just the problem is, Doctor, um, I get my medicine from, you know, the monitor and they only have a monitor from 4:00-12:00.  So, um, if I need it during the day, I, I'm, I'm shit out of luck.  And I'll have to wait clear until 4:00, so if we could do 1 in the morning and one at 4:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does the monitor actually come out to your house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does that work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They, they tell me they were, they're there from 4:00-12:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where, where exactly is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, my, where I live at [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's their job.  They come and they, and one of the things they do is they give out medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but they don't come to your apartment, they're just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the central place for everybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they hold your medicine there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.  I, I have no contact with my medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what if you have a pill that you're supposed to take first thing in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I have to get up at 7:30 in the morning and go down there, and then they give me [INAUDIBLE].  They send somebody over from [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I get it, then I get all my morning medicine at 7:30, and then there's a monitor at 4:00 and then there's a monitor there at night.  So I get the same monitor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those the bedtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, so I get my bedtime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long does the monitor stay there each time, just until everybody comes and goes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four until 12:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're there for the whole time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about in the morning?  Seven in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, just, just, as long as they give their medicine.  Once they get to, give the medicine, they, they leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how do they do it with the p.r.n.  Medication, when, when it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  If I need it, they just, I just say I need my p.r.n., and they just, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What if you need it at 3:00 before they get there?  Can, can you say I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Shit out of luck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you say I need one because I, I'm I got something coming up later tonight and I might need it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I was only getting 1 a day, so it wasn't, you know, I, I, I'm, I'm, I, I, I, I imagine you could probably do that.  Um, you could, you know, if you're, it's 7:30 in the morning, if I fill out, got something at, at, at 3:00 and I, it's going to cause me anxiety, I could ask for a p.r.n.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let me ask you about your Abilify.  Is, is there any concern taking that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  If, really, um, when I got out of the hospital for about the first week, I was really depressed.  Um, then it just took, it just needed medicine, just needed to get in my system.  And, uh, I had a weekend where I was just, I was down and out, man.  But I started feeling better within a couple days and my mood has been e, excellent since then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had any times that you've felt paranoid -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or felt afraid of people watching you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or saying stuff about you or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are, are you getting out around people much -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> These days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which, which people?  Family or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I go to my, I got to my meetings, um, I go to my [INAUDIBLE] Anonymous meeting.  Thursday I go to, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  Um, I go once a week and cook for my buddy's family.  Um, I love to cook and [NAME OTHER], his wife, doesn't like to cook so I go there and I spend some time.  He has 2 boys.  In fact, um, [NAME OTHER] and, and [NAME OTHER]'s [AGE] and, um, [NAME OTHER]'s [AGE].  And so I get to spend time with them.  Then I go to mom and dad's on the weekend.  And I'm also, um, it's in the process of happening.  I'm going to start doing some volunteer work, um, couple days a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you got a, a lot on your plate right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to increase it, because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you more stressed when you're doing all those things, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm happier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does it keep your mind off of other things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm happier, Doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now how often do you have meetings, is that once a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Once a week.  [NAME OTHER] really pushed for this.  She really wanted me to get, get more involved in, you know, because she thought I had too much free time and I finally agreed with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you said [DEIDENTIFIED], you said meetings, you said you're cooking for your friend -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, was there something else, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to do some volunteer, it's in the process.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not started yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's, it's in the process.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any idea where you'd like to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm going to Catholic Charities, um, hopefully with, help with kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's more, you know, it's my love.  So, um, I'm hoping, you know, she has, I had to give her 3 references, and she's on the last reference.  She has to talk to [NAME OTHER], and then she'll call me and then I do an interview.  They tell me, you know, here's what we have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you first came to the hospital a, a month or 2 ago, anything come to mind that set us back to that point?  Did, did anything weigh down or were you having any intrusive or troublesome kind of thoughts back then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was just really depressed, suicidal, just wanted to end it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On account of any particular reason -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or trigger?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  Can't say there was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were you having thoughts in your head that just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] wont let go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] with me.  And I'm just really negative, real down, dark, stuff, you know.  Um, so I just, and I do, I, I really felt that the Cymbalta had quit working.  It seems like that's what we have to do every once in a while, Doctor, is doing that change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now tell me about, um, the sleeping these days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sleeping has improved since they put me back on -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Since -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Since Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, how long has that been, uh, used again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About a week.  Didn't want to do it, but, um, I got to sleep.  If I don't sleep, I get, my paranoia just kicks in big time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you go to the doctor specifically on account of sleeping, or were you there for some other reason?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, when I have a, I have a doctor that comes to the house?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so I just called him up and told him I wasn't sleeping, and, um, it had been going on for about a month and, um, I told him that in the past, um, my doctor put me on Ambien and that worked.  And so, um, he said, "All right."  He says, "We'll try it and see."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you say you get more paranoid when you're not sleeping well.  What, was that kicking in to some degree before -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You saw this doctor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, not to the degree that it was troublesome.  It was a little.  It was a little bit, but not to where I was really worried or concerned about it.  Um, I just knew that if, if I didn't do something, that it would get worse.  I thought it would get worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been there before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So that's why, that's why I called the doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's the energy level now, now that you feel like you're sleeping a little better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, my, my only hope is that we're not stuck with a, an Ambien a night for the rest of your life.  I, I hope -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I don't either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That we can get it, get this kind of under control on a temporary basis.  How has the appetite been through everything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've really been watching my weight, Doctor.  It's something I'm real happy about.  Um, my dad had a talk with me.  I, I was up to like 318 pounds.  And, um, he said, you got, we got to do something.  So really, I'm down to 308.  I started about 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exercising too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that just at home, or do you go somewhere to do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you sound to me like you're saying you're back on track a little better.  I, I'm a little bit surprised when you say how rough it was the first week, because I, I didn't get the impression the last day or 2 at the hospital -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that you were feeling so bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] feeling much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You kind of came up and said I feel better and I'm ready to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  And then I went home and, uh, and that, it was a weekend, Doctor, that it was just, oh, man.  In fact, I, I,I, I considered going back up to [DEIDENTIFIED] but I just, I said no, I got, I got to tough this one out.  Because I really felt like if I gave Zoloft a chance, it would work, you know.  And it was, it was, it was soon, you know, I wasn't, it was only, I was only out of the hospital maybe a, less than a week.  I think sometimes, Doctor, like when I'll, I feel like if my mood, I do better at the hospital I once we made that first change and then I get hopeful that, and my, I start thinking more positive.  But when I get home, then sometimes, you know, it's hard.  I mean, let's face it.  The hospital is a safe place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You don't have to deal with life, you don't have to deal with, you know, all this stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your physical health been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking any different medications physically than what I had from December?  Uh, thyroid, Synthroid, the muscle relaxant, and the Spiriva and the CPAP?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that sound about the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And last I knew, you weren't having any trouble hearing things or seeing things -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> None of that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to look back here and to see, you've been on this Abilify now for, it's been a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Close to a year, hasn't it, Doctor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I want to say more.  Um, because I know we tried all kinds of different things beforehand.  You were on the Seroquel, remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The last Seroquel prescription was 8/07, August of '07.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No kidding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We tried -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We tried Moban there for about a month and then by October you were on Abilify.  October of '07, that's a year and a half, give or take.  And I, I think it, that's the, the most stable thing that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We had there for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your insurance is still covering it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're not giving you any hard time with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So my thinking is that I want to say we're at least on track and, um, in terms of you being, uh, on Ambien, um, last I had you on was 100 on the Doxepin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One hundred fifty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One hundred and fifty.  That's right, we raised it.  We didn't lower it in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One hundred and fifty.  Um, do you have any thoughts on wanting to try to cut that down, if you're taking Ambien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is there any, is there any feeling that you're slowed down or you're, you're tired or groggy from it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I first get up in the morning I'm a little, I'm a little, I'd like to have it a little bit more pep to me.  But, um, you know, I'm in favor for, if you want to cut it back, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but he's got you on Ambien, I'm inclined to want to cut back somewhere else.  And I think that's probably the, the logical one.  So we're going to do the Abilify the same, then we're going to cut down the Doxepin.  We're going to do the Zoloft the same, 300 mg.  Um, Neurontin the same, which is, uh, 4 pills a day.  Let's see what else we have here.  Have you been using any Artane lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No more Artane.  And, you have been using Vistaril.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, the Vistaril, I think, is something we did in the hospital as well, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, that's 50 mg and you're typically using it every day and may even be thinking about wanting to take it twice a day.  If I write it down twice a day and put as needed, are you allowed to say, I don't need it this time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I can put it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For twice a day and then you could say yes or no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it would be easier just to put up there in the first place instead of trying to add an extra one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Up, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think we'll do it that way.  I'll put you down for twice a day as needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And go back to 100 on the, on the, uh, Doxepin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  We'll go back to 100 on the Doxepin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now is that doctor that comes around at home, going to check in with you from time to time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He comes, um, once every other month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, does he give you enough prescription to last until he comes again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, usually he, he don't give me, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're good for a couple months on your Ambien prescription right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I'll, I'll just call him if I need to.  I, I don't want to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If there's ever a day where you're able to not take it, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you know the, the less the better with all those sleeping pills.  So you got any plans coming up over the spring, the days getting nicer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yes.  Want to go out and see the Indians at least once this year.  Um, just went in the, you know, just got to enjoy it.  It was a long winter, Doctor.  A long winter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Staying inside and to yourself a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And watching the Browns wasn't all that exciting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Shoo, geez.  And that was like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You spending much time with, with your folks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I go over on Sundays, and spend about 5 hours and then come back home, and that's, that's enough, you know.  It gets me, uh, over to see the dog, which brings me a lot of happiness, and, um, you know, I get to spend time with them and, uh, then I come back home.  And it's, it's, it's, it's not too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they ever still get overbearing or not understand what's going on with you, or is it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My dad can be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Progress?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tough sometimes, Doctor, but I have to look at the good side, too.  I mean, a, any time I need him, he's there for me.  Um, he did, I don't think he fully understands my illness.  I don't know that he ever will because he's old school and he's just, he thinks every time I'm depressed there has to be a reason.  And I try to make him understand, dad, it's clinical.  There's times when there is no rhyme or reason, and, um, he don't fully understand that.  Then if I need something, I just, all I got to do is call, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm working on all your prescriptions here.  I think there's 5 of them I need to give you.  Does that sound about right to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, that's quite a few.  That's the problem.  I was [INAUDIBLE] yeah, 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think for now I'm going to go ahead and give you 3 months' worth of refills.  You, you got, you got your support groups and you know how to get in touch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can pretty much trust you to let us know how things are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Going, whether it good or bad.  And I'm optimistic that if we get you up to [DEIDENTIFIED] again, um, at some point it's going to be for a ball game and not for a hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, I agree.  I agree.  How's the family?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't complain.  Everybody's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looking forward to a little bit of sunshine and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I hear you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe even take a break for a week or something this summer.  We'll see.  See, I've got it, g, get one more prescription here; I'm working on the fifth one.  That's going to be your Vistaril.  So it wasn't that long ago that you had stayed pretty far away from the hospital for a good while, and I'm, I'm -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Optimistic we can, that, that was, I want to say more than a year, maybe -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a little longer a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now you've got all of the prescriptions and I think I got through asking about everything I need from my end.  Is there anything else that you wanted to touch base on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I think we covered it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And as far as I know, your prescriptions are all getting covered okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Only the, the Abilify is the only one that's more -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Expensive and iffy, but if they're, they've been good for a year and a half, I'll just assume it's still good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  They called like, um, oh, it's probably been before I went in the hospital and we had to do another year, and I just had it sent to, uh, [NAME OTHER] and she took care of it, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For the prior authorization thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  So I had another year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Once you get the first year, I think the second year is a little bit easier, so hopefully that will keep, um, clicking away for, working for us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All righty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, you have a good rest of your afternoon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, thanks so much, Doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good to see you and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, always.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll touch base in about 3 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want to make that appointment up front.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take care, Doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you too.</p>

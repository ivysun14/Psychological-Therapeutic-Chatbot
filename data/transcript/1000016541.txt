<p>COUNSELOR: Client number 1429-110 December 10, 1970. Therapist Dayton. Interview number 6 with client number 1429-110. Therapist Dayton, December 10, 2970, interview number 6</p>

<p>PATIENT: You got a shirt and tie today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm impressed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I almost look professional today, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if you look professional but..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Different. Right. Oh wow. Whoo. I'm really (inaudible at 0:00:55.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh man. I killed about, well I used the expression. I started it with you know like an inch. And now I use it like about a half inch to a quarter inch. And it's down to about here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that's? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's, that's what I'm indicate to my supervisor I'm going to quit. I always tell her I'm going to tender it. Tender my resignation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, well today it was just. It's always like just 11 things. I don't know. Maybe that was one of the reasons why I got into therapy. I was talking to my desk partner. And she says that whatever problems you have are amplified by that job. You know like tenfold on up. Or else it brings out whatever problems there might be. And why, like this week you know there's been about, I counted them one day. Just 11 different you know, kids whose problems would be you know just to straighten out physically. You know like house, food, things like that. 0:02:06.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would require like maybe one to two days apiece. And they're all you know the kind that can not wait. There's no waiting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. They're all emergency cases. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right, yeah. A kid, like a kid, there are kids coming in from Trenton that you know, flipped out out there. And I'm supposed to bring him to NYU. Well, I barely know the kid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your agency placed them in a home in Trenton. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I, yeah, no not in a home. In a residential treatment center. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So he's coming back tomorrow morning. And simultaneously to that there's been, in order to get them in you have to go through the whole routine of all these agencies. And you call them up you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get them into NYU right? Or give them back to NYU? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he's going back to NYU through the whole routine. NYU is really you know like certain, belongs to certain zones. The whole city is supposedly split up that way. But everybody calls them. So they get, you know well, besides the impossibility of their job. And, well they picked one of my kids up for sleeping in the laundry room. You sleep in a laundry, I knew he was in the damn laundry room but there was no place else for him to go. And they picked him up, arrested him and put him in county jail for two days. He'll be 17. And besides he's subject to you know homosexuality. I don't know if they're mentioned in the psych reports but if he goes down there, he's afraid of homos. And so he's had a little stay there. And finally we got him out of there and really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everything's working out the wrong way for your kids. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. You know and then I question to myself, I say, "Is it?" You know. I don't. Like I don't think my upset comes so much from the fact that these kids are having a shitty time. I think it comes more from, I think my own, my own feeling that really anybody could be in that job doing about the same things with those kinds of satisfaction. And.. 0:04:22.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not allowed much creativity in your job, huh? There are rules and regulations you have to follow. Forms to fill out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's not enough humanity in your job. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's part of it, you know. I think the other part though, and the part that maybe, maybe causes me the, you know I'm just, it's like that really. You know it's the same thing again. It's the knowledge that you know that I'm really not throwing myself into it. You know by, by attempting to alleviate a few things. Like just clarify what procedure is it to get a kid into a state hospital. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know maybe that's administratively higher up. But God, it would save, you know it would save so many phone calls and so much aggravation and so much general shitting around if we would have quite clearly stated where the hell a kid should go. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, if you had the streets, the area of the city that this problem's taken care of. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Anything, anything like that. And what kind of problems can get him in? And you know maybe and there's a lot of different ways in which, you know with a little bit of work I could at least feel that I was clarifying a few minor things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet you know, I can't, I don't know why, I'm starting to feel like I felt, I don't know if it's a feeling. I'm starting to think and respond in the ways I thought and respond when I kind of made up my mind that I couldn't hack the ministry. It's like you know, I really what I'd really like to do is just split. 0:06:09.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always, I have this saying about going to Toronto.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to go to Toronto.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Become a server, I don't know if I'm serious about that or not. You know about doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but everything's getting down on you now so you just want to get the hell out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't have any sick days. I don't have any vacation days. I don't have any comp days and I don't have..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll have them January first though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll have them January first. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'll have three more then. I have over 15 and the first available day it's going to go you know, because. And now you know like I've made a rule. No working Saturdays. Because really, you could work every Saturday if you chose to. But this, you know, this Saturday I've got to break, I can't see any other way but breaking the damn rule. Which I'm not really..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not willing to work Saturday and take another day off?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm going to do it but I'm not too happy about it. I imagine I'll feel ok once I get out there. But I tried to figure out a way to get out of it. But I don't know I, you know it's, I mean this kind of stuff, you know I'm home alone in my head all day long but I don't. You know like when you, when I left last week I was looking at the bulletin board and I did get in the, just one superficial, well not superficial but beginning, you know beginnings. Like I've never taken social work, professional social work courses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know so I at least I'm into that. At least..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking about that.0:08:01.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you're doing that too, you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I have a course coming up next quarter. But you know I'm not really doing anything about school. This is thing I can't, you know it, it's like a whole bunch of things playing together that I can't really tie together. I've been, I'm spinning off all the time. I can see that, that for some reason I'm afraid to commit myself, get involved. Or I don't. I don't know maybe I'm just lazy, you know. Maybe. I can't pin it down. I can't understand it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you'll be too much reminded of your own lousy childhood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean in the job I'm in now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I did the same thing with ministry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've asked myself whether or not, you know people ask you, "Oh what kind of childhood did you have?" I always had a given answer, like I'd go, "I guess it was happy." That's what I'd say. I guess it was happy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you? Do you guess it was happy? Or do you guess it was unhappy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: The more I think back to the things that stick in my mind are the things that were in some way bad things. You know when I, when I really sit down and think I can't remember the really happy times very often. We were going to a lake once, I bet you I can name on one hand the times that I really was quite happy. The bad things stick out way more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:10:04.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless I was trying to think that way. But when I just let it go, it's the bad things that come to mind. Not really the good things. But I never considered myself a bad kid when I was little. I thought I was always very obedient. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who said you were a bad kid? Where did that come in? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Lousy childhood. I thought of it as being..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm talking about you. I'm talking about how you felt about the way everybody else treated you. How you were brought up. How's your parents, your siblings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, ok I thought when you said the relationship with your job to remind you of your own lousy childhood</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. I was thinking, I was thinking like most of my kids I think of as bad kids. In other words they..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you avoid thinking of why they're bad. Do you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I try to see, I usually, usually I attribute what I call their badness.. Ok, in my childhood I always said that like, I felt being obedient was a good thing. So I'd be obedient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd listen to what my mom would tell me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. These kids, most of my kids, now some of them aren't, you know. They can't take (inaudible at 0:11:37.0) but the ones I have trouble with are the ones that seemingly listen but never do. Like for instance lying is a primary thing. Lying, disobeying, saying one thing and doing another. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:11:57.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Drinking, doing drugs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All things you never did. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All things I never did, right. And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about that? That you never did those things? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really mixed because I think I'm trying to do some of those things now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. But you missed out on them when you were a kid. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So in a lot of ways I don't take my guys seriously when, you know like some foster mother really gets wild about something, I don't take that... The kinds of things I take seriously...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like they're doing the things that you wish you did. And that you're beginning to do now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think I usually understand it too like, I figure the kids are the way they are because of the people they've been with. Most of them have been in foster places that I've got for a long, long time. So I just look at the kid and I look at the foster parent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I would, you know that's, some things you know, some things I don't understand about that either because I really... This one woman today just got her kid. You know like he's done stuff like he claims to wake up at night and not really wake up and pissed in a can, a tobacco can and put it under his bed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he hoards things all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He hoards especially batteries and he hides them under his bed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know he does all kinds of things. Way back somewhere in a psychology book I read like, you know interpretations. But I, you know I can't make an interpretation to the mother because I couldn't, it didn't seem to link up. It wasn't consistent. I don't know. I really don't know what my attitude is toward... I always look at it this way. I don't really think that I empathize that much with most of the kids in my work. Some of them I do. 0:14:28.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I sometimes feel, especially I think maybe the black kids, I feel somewhat uneasy around them. And then I ask myself what causes the strain. You know like what makes me get uptight? And I think that's more, (chuckles) more I'm not doing good but I'm not doing a good job. And then I get lost. Then it's either I don't want to. And I don't know why I don't want to. I'm afraid to. It's like it's, whatever unconscious, it's like it's that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how I can crack that. I, it doesn't seem to... Like in the time I've been in therapy, I think I see things more clearly that I wouldn't have realized before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm still not approaching why in a lot of areas I am the way I am, nor do I know how I can necessarily change that. 0:16:03.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's kind of a dead issue now. The thing like last week I think the last thing we were talking about was this thing with Tara.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The looker in the office I always called her Sylvio. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that was her way, well she hasn't talked to me really this week and I haven't talked to her. So it's like kind of dead. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not even really, I don't think, ticked at her any more. I just don't care about her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there was, it was funny because I think, I think the way you intended your comment. I don't know if this will go anywhere but.. I had mentioned that, you know I said, " Sylvio this, Sylvio that." And then you had asked me, "Do you always refer to women by their last names?" And then I, I don't know how I reacted to that but I think I said something like, "Yeah I usually do." And that's about where we cut off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think my reaction wasn't so much that this helps me understand how I was thinking about Sylvio, what I was thinking about was, how would I say it? That, that I really wonder whether I make a distinction, you know like in referring to people. 0:18:23.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In referring to..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in referring to, like how would my feelings be different in thinking of a girl as thinking of a guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now outwardly I kid around with a girl. And unless, and this is, this is what, you know this is where things kind of you know, things. I couldn't, I stopped thinking at that point. So I've got to, I suspect there's something there. It's few single girls that I'm friends with. Like at the office I'll kid around with them and stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A married girl I could be very good friends with. Like there's no, there's no danger there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Most of the time I'll kind of like flirt with most of the girls in the office. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're safe there too? 0:19:59.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I know I haven't to worry about any kind of involvement. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when I, ok, this is, when I do start dating a girl...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? </p>

<p>PATIENT: If I know she likes me then there's no problem either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who do you date? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right now I'm dating a girl named Susie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where do you meet these girls that you date? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I either meet at the, Susie I met at a bar. She's a schoolteacher. The girl before that that I met, I met at a bar. This is about in the last six months. And the other girls I usually meet at the office. The main places that I've met people in the last two or three years is either the bar, the office or parties. Any one of those three. It's seldom that I date a friend. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Very seldom. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean? That seldom do you date somebody that you're emotionally involved with also or that you like? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I use, yeah, it used to be that way. For four years. Up until last January. Then I dated a girl and I was starting to get involved. And I just about, I couldn't figure it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't figure out why you were getting involved?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because usually I don't. Usually I don't at all. But I think see, I think it's got something to do with how accessible she is. Because if..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She wasn't very accessible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. She was like almost engaged to this other guy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 0:21:56.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: So then that you know. And then the girl I dated after her. I also became emotionally involved. I think because, I don't know if it was emotionally involved. It was like something, I did jealous. She was dating another guy too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she was dating a black guy at the time. She was white. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I didn't, I didn't know if she was.. Well, there were three girls in her unit and they all dated black guys. Three white girls dating three black guys. So I don't know. I don't know what's all behind that. But I was dating her at the same time. And she really was flipped out over this black guy. And the more she became flipped out, the less good it was for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So eventually that broke up. That was with some, some resulting like cold, coldness toward each other for a long time. I was dating a girl toward the end of the summer but she went to Kansas. And we never really got to know each other that well. But now she hasn't written for about a month and a half and now my interest is perking up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's kinda weird like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The more distant they are, the closer you want to get. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, the more they're around, the more I chase. And if it goes the other way invariably, I don't know. It's never really gone anywhere. Like when a girl had kept her distance for a long time and then all of a sudden I wanted to you know, if I was chasing her and she would turn around..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd run away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's never reached the point that I really wanted a girl and that she's, she's come around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I don't know what would happen. That would be unique because it's never happened to me. You know usually it's either one way or the other. I don't know. I don't know if there's like a, if it follows from that you know like to the job thing that I mentioned. It's funny though with a girl, if there's another guy involved and my estimation of the girl is that she's on the ball, (inaudible at 0:24:31.2), whatever you want to call it. Then I'd get, I'm really ambiguous. Like I want to ask her out but I'm really hurt if she's not and I want to know where she is. 0:24:43.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I sometimes I drop out of the picture. I don't understand that at all. It's like two things going at once. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you don't want to get involved in the competition, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you lose out, that means you're not as good a man as the other man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that I, that I wouldn't want to admit really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Is that why you dropped out of the competition with the girl who was flipped out over the black man? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, the reason there, well. that was part of it. But she, she would, she would you know as we went along, she worked in my office and we would talk a lot. She always told me that she thought she was a stronger person than I was. In relationship to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That her, she felt, well she would question me you know at length bout a lot of things. And she felt number one that she was stronger than me. She felt that, well we both had religious backgrounds but she felt she had rejected it and followed through whereas I hadn't. 0:26:08.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She wanted to know why I didn't know, know where I was going. Why I didn't know what I was doing. Why I was content to be that way. She felt I think that I, it was like I would depend on her. For instance we'd get out of a meeting or something and before she could ask a question, I would say, "What did you think about it." It was almost like I would ask for approval or I wanted her to make a decision. Sexually she was more experienced than I was. And it actually came to the point where like she wouldn't want to even go to bed with me anymore. And I says ok, you know. I just, no I said, "We'll try it for a while." But I was only, I only, I think I went along with it for a week. And then I said you know, "I'd prefer not to date anymore." And she said, well, she said ok and all. And that was, that was.. We had one session after that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you have to get her approval for that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah here she is slowly snipping off your scrotum and you ask her, "Is it alright if we don't date any more?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I said something like, it would have come out that way though either way I wanted to do it you know. I'm trying to remember. We had one last date. Because I thought I had this huge fantastic insight into her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah right I need to turn the knife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:28:04.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: And well, we had made this agreement before. You know ok, no sex. We'll just see each other. And that lasted about a week. And then, then I asked her out and I had some loud interpretation about the..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look, did you want to have sex with her? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why the hell did you put up with that? When she said no sex you should have said, "Well,"</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was either no sex or no dating were her conditions. I mean she said, you know she said number one, she didn't know why but she couldn't go to bed with me. Ok my options are either to date her or to quit seeing her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I opted to, you know to see her for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you like her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess, yeah. Yeah, I couldn't see breaking it off. But after a week I was getting, well, see she'd come in on Thursday morning. I guess it was after one Thursday morning. Thursday morning was her, she'd always see this guy on Wednesday night. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she'd come in real late on Thursday mornings. That always used to gripe the hell out of me. So then I would, you know I said after one of those I said oh you know, it's no use. And so then as soon as I said you know it couldn't be this way, she said, "We're going to have to quit dating." So she really called it. I think I, I think the thing was I could never defeat her in an argument. And she knew that. No matter what the subject. She had a very keen mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, there were there were other instances..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess you felt put down by her, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, constantly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 0:30:00.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she, she even admitted to me, she said, most of the time, she normally she'd would constantly confront me. And she gave very little..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She seemed to get some kind of pleasure out of that, did she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't say that, she just said, she'd constantly confront me. She said she was aware that she was doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I reacted by saying something like, that I wasn't really aware that this was a confronting kind of thing. Because I said I'm not a confronting kind of person. I don't know if that holds or not. And, or maybe I was making excuses. I don't know. But she would you know. She really would. Because we would have you know arguments or talks. And I can't remember ever you know having defeated her logically. Her mind was too good. And like she, I guess she was aware of that too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know, I don't know what other thing she felt. My way of striking back at her was just to be, I wouldn't initiate any conversation. I still think..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd withhold yourself from her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I figured if she doesn't want..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't give yourself to her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I figured if she didn't want me, she wasn't going to have me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd show her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I knew, you know I knew when it was going on it was what I call childish. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like pouting or getting moody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:32:00.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I, you know I just..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well after all, you didn't have a chance to pout when you were a kid. You were this obedient kid. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I pout. But not very often. Most people say that meet me that I'm always the same. Always cheerful. Always optimistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Always I don't, you know on the same level. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think when I was a kid..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait a minute. What do you say about that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Externally I always am, yeah?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And inside? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I have low moments they don't seem so low that I'm wiped out by them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except you were ready to quit today. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well yeah. Lately. Lately I have. Since this year began. Before this year I would never be so low that I couldn't do something to make myself feel better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some people have said that I don't smile as much anymore. And I was quite serious with my supervisor, I told her..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it your goal to be happy all the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I have a goal like that. 0:34:04.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never thought about that my goal would be to be happy all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think part of it is, is like I always say I'm never bored. I can't remember a time that I've been, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course you're bored, that's why you've go to the bars. And then you get bored at the bars. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I only get bored at the bars if there's no girls around. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You told me long ago that you got bored at bars. You were bored with going to bars. Unless you made a pick up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah unless..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were bored with doing that. You didn't like doing that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't, well ok. Right now I feel if I, I think I could keep on going to bars as long as you know, as long as there's girls around. As long as you can pick them up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the trouble of it is or what I'm finding is that you know that I don't feel too good about that. I don't feel that in the long run anything's going to come of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess I want something to come of something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. What do you mean want something to come of it? Like you don't feel as though you're going to meet a girl that you'll marry in a bar? 0:36:05.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or that you know, that you'll get fairly close to them. Of course I haven't been too successful at that anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very rare, why but anyway, it's very... Like Susie asked me this week, she says you know, "Do you hold it against me that you met me in a bar?" And I says, "Oh, what do you say that for?" Apparently the other night I was half bombed and I must have said something. Which I, she couldn't remember or wouldn't remember. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know. Maybe I do think I have to be happy all the time. I'm certainly not. I'm certainly not happy today. I'm disgusted with work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really am to the point where you know, I say I, I would like to yell at somebody. I would like to you know or at least..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who would you like to yell at?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know because I mean who the hell?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your supervisor?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In part. In part I think she's a ding a ling. I like her but in part I think she's a ding a ling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean how the hell have I got 50 kids you know and 15 of them are blowing up at one time? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she'd say, "Well maybe we can shift a couple." And then I'd feel bad about that because that will just go to somebody else in my unit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to yell at her a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't feel as though you can? 0:38:01.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I, I wouldn't want to yell at her, I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in the first place it's not primarily her fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's people above her that assign cases and she assigns them to me. I have the lowest case com (ph) in the unit. So I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're better off than anybody else is, is what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In terms of numbers yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in terms of I'd say problem cases.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But everybody gets weeks like that. And most other people apparently can handle it. I'm not sure that I can, I'm not really sure that I can handle the thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it feels like, it feels like I'm going to crack one of these days. Because a couple of times this week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This morning I sat around for I think it was a half an hour reading the news, you know everyone has. Until a quarter of nine, that's when you're supposed to be there. And finally I got enough strength to go in there. 0:39:01.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think you'd feel better if you yelled at her? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because she's not the kind, I could never yell at Mrs. Easter. Honest to God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nice lady.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh she is. She's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Real sweet. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Honest to God I could not get mad at Mrs. Easter. At this office there's nobody really I can yell at. At the other office..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nobody who is nasty enough to you that you could yell at them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there's a few workers, yeah. I wouldn't mind yelling at Tara and a couple of the other bitties down there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you want to yell at Tara?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because of what she did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what did she do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just existing I guess. Just because she exists. 0:39:52.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Suppose I told you she was sitting in that chair right now. Do you want to yell at her? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think I would be pretty much contemptuous of her if she was here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know though. She scares me in person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In person I can not look at her eyes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Well look, you don't have to look at her eyes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now she's facing me dead on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't mean you have to look her in her eyes. What do you want to tell her? Tell her how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just thinking how I feel about her right now. Because I don't really feel any way right now. But if that's her, I'd ask her first of all what's she doing here, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I put her there. She had nothing to say about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why is she, I'd ask her why she's just sitting there then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell her how you feel about her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: This is probably what would happen, I mean... If my imagination is working right, then she really is there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:42:10.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never said a serious word to Tara.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaning what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'd ask her why she's so removed, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well Alector, I'll tell you what I think of you. You're only half a man. You don't know what you're doing. You have no goals in your life. You're lousy in bed. I've got somebody else who does much better with me. You're not motivated to do anything. You know, you're like a shit. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow. All right I would, number one, how do you know? I mean what, you know what..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look even when I say these provocative things to you all you do is ask me how I know. You don't tell me how you think about me. Don't go playing intellectual games with me. I'm telling you how I feel. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I would say number one I don't think you probably know how you are in bed because I think you probably haven't been in bed for a long time. Number two, I'm not really sure whether you're male or female anyway from the way you act around here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that why you call me Sylvio all the time instead of Susie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partly, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right it's you who's mixed up in your mind. Sometimes I really get the feeling you'd much rather be with the guys than you would with a girl. I wonder about you Alector. 0:44:05.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah she (inaudible at 0:44:11.1). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well clobber me back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that you don't want to or you don't know how or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I've, you know I don't think I've ever been, I don't think I've ever clobbered anybody back directly head on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She said, you know with Sylvio could say stuff. That could be Sylvio. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or the way I understand her. And which, if she did that I'd sit there like a little kid with a half a grin on my face. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being scolded by his mother. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I'd get a little red and I wouldn't know what to day. I'd just sit there. Like I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd think about it but I could not react. I could not respond. And then you know, then I could sit and think about it later. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd say, I should have said such and, this is exactly what I did. And so that went..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know Sylvio, well it wasn't like that but she said, "You know Alector I'm not putting up with your, I'm not going to finance your weekend." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I told Wesley I wish I would have said such and such and such.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I get immobilized by a think like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, well you have from now until next week to think of retorts to Sylvio. See what happens during the week about what Sylvio just said to you. 0:46:04.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh boy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh boy what? What does that mean, oh boy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That kind of stuff is really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of difficult. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So who said it was easy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does everything in your life have to be easy and happy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Apparently so. Well, ok. It's time to sleep. 0:47:24.8</p>

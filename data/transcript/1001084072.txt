<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how have you been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good, so what's new?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not a whole lot, I've been actively engaging and conditioning my body and running a lot</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How many miles are you getting in a week?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not doing it to the extreme that I used to but definitely getting in some good mileage, finding new places to explore, new places to adventure around -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Finding new trails.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how many days a week are you running about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, every day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So about seven days a week?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you doing three miles, five miles?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably about between five and seven, five to eight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes upwards of twelve to thirteen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you doing any races anytime soon?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have done a race, one was at [DEIDENTIFIED] park and that was a quite interesting race.  Some people might describe it as a little different but it was fun because I had to climb a rope at the end.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was it kind of like an obstacle course?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was weird, you know, it was just, you know, kind of climbing a huge embankment.  It's kind of a mini adventure race.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That they do in like [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow, was it fun?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know, it's pretty cool, you know, I was glad that, I got stung by five bees.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the middle of the race but it didn't seem to effect me, I was really fortunate to, because I know some people can go into respiratory depression after being stung and I don't have anaphylactic shock to bees.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So yeah, and I, there's been some people that I have had some serious problems if they get stung by a bee where they actually can stop breathing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but, you know, it didn't seem to effect me at all, they were just, but you know, it's good that I have a pretty good cardiovascular system so I didn't necessarily stop, you know, I had a big welt on my back and a big welt on my leg but it was just fine, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It didn't really seem to affect me at all but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you doing any other races coming up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm looking at the rescue run.  It's a nice organization.  If you look on the web site they have done some pretty incredible saves in the field and I like the, you know, search and rescue is really cool and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long a race is that one?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just a ten K.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, I was looking at it and we'll see if, how I feel that day and whether, I like the organization, I think they've had close to three hundred saves in the field.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which is good and one kid had actually, from the academy, he got stuck within a mile of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With his girlfriend or something and they had to evac him out with a chopper.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But yeah, it's stuff like that and stuff like the guy [NAME OTHER] or whatever down in [DEIDENTIFIED], he went missing, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, it takes a whole community to rally around.  They had like fifty ATVs, horses, just everyone was searching for him because I think with dementia and Alzheimer's, sometimes people feel the need to wander and it's pretty tragic on the family members because they want that person back, they want the old person that, I thought it was fascinating, you know, if the more people you can reach to stop that from happening the better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well good, so you're staying busy running.  Are you still working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Actually I'm in transition right now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm kind of, I came to the point where I was getting somewhat frustrated with my coworkers and so I just said, you know, I'm going to, you know, put in my notice here and wait for another job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, any particular kind of job you're looking for [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I've been looking around, there's quite a few out there and I looked somewhere in, you know, I'm keeping my options open right now.  There's a few places I've applied that are, you know, hopefully going to give me some source of income.  I still have some money to fall back on right now, which is nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But so, you know, for the most part, tough times call for tough measures so you just kind of watch your financial spending to a certain degree and then once you get that source of income back then you just kind of, but yeah it was frustrating dealing with some of the situations at work.  You know, it was a good job and I learned a lot about, you know, how to interact with difficult situations and stuff like that but, you know, it's just kind of like I wanted to move on and find something else to do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that sounds reasonable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How are your spirits doing overall?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh for the most part I'm staying up, you know, there's time when, you know, when I feel tired or whatever but other than that, you know, it's not too incredibly exhausting.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good and are you sleeping okay at night [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For the most part, you know, I don't have a problem, you know, sometimes I will be awake for an hour and a half just thinking over the, mulling over the situations of the day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, feeling lucky that nothing worse came about because I see, when I'm out there, I see a lot of accidents with the snow and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> People are, you know, choosing to put themselves in harms way I think and situations where, you know, that could have been anybody but, you know, situations where they pull out and get nailed but, you know, and certainly I see a lot of situations with, I don't know, it's just, I have a lot of people that discuss personal problems and I definitely do listen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  And how's your weight doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh for the most part it's staying consistent.  There's times when it will fluctuate 1 to 2 to 5 pounds but that's not a big deal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much do you weigh now, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I weighed myself yesterday, I was 175 on a doctor's scale which is perfect weight.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I could can 5 to 10 pounds and then lose it pretty quickly, depending upon the exercise level that I'm doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And regardless of the exercise, trying to stay safe and healthy so that I don't, you know, rip a knee or tear a shoulder or mess up an ankle or something like that in an accident but, for the most part, I haven't had too many problems.  I've been pretty tough.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean it's just, I had one, I was going around a corner once and my tires flipped out on my bike and I landed on my hip but it didn't phase me, I was like wow I got lucky.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There was a strawberry right here but I picked up my bike and kept going.  I made it another twenty six miles after that but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That happens to a lot of, it can happen to anybody but sharp turns.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With street tires and gravel on the side of the roads, if you're not careful, this was just kind of when I was just out for a ride, going around a sharp turn and the tires slipped like this and I fell out this way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But yeah, it was fine, it was, you know, it taught me how tough I was.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well good, I'm glad you're all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME], are you enjoying yourself when you're out running or out riding?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, all the time man, it's always beneficial when I exercise.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's better than not to.  I mean there's, it was, you know, it wasn't too bad, like I've seen, there's one guy on the tour de France named, I forget his name but he had a similar crash, it's the curves that sometimes get people but he landed on his wrist and fractured it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I got really lucky because I didn't mess anything up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, there's a strawberry but that wasn't too bad, it was going around a turn, it was a hairpin turn and stuff like that but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And [PATIENT NAME], are you having any trouble with the Zyprexa at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, you know, I don't notice the side effects.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing would be whether it's making me tired or not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your energy level most days, do you have enough or are you tired?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's pretty steady.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's times when I really feel, I mean that would be the only thing, either working and keeping my energy high, you know, that's definitely one of my goals but there's times when I don't have full a hundred percent energy and I can understand, you know, that I wouldn't have full energy, maybe I had worked really hard or the situation where, where you help somebody out to the point where you're kind of tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, like, people have bad days sometimes and at work if you help them out, you know, you kind of make yourself, put yourself in a situation where you're working really hard to help them get through their day too but, you know, for the most part my energy is pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good and have you had any problems with hearing voices recently?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't necessarily hear, you know, it's just, you know, your conscience tells you right from wrong, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But there's no, necessarily not like an inner voice that just tells you, you know, what the right thing to do is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes and [PATIENT NAME] have there been any situations you've been in where you didn't feel safe?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, you know, I understand that people's frustration levels get, but I, you know, there's been times where I've been around people who are pretty violent and I've never felt one threat at all, I mean it's amazing how -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I don't necessarily, you know, I get along, I may not agree with how they are but I don't necessarily feel threatened by them at all -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just pretty much that they, you know, they state their case and I listen to it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And once someone gets their point across, I definitely understand the point of the situation, so I mean, it's cool, it's nice that people are able to talk about things, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it sounds like you're staying pretty busy between the running, workouts, and then looking for a job.  Anything else you're doing with your spare time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I read a lot, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I stay involved in, I do a lot of the figuring out math solutions and I do a lot of reading, you know, I keep my mind sharp so that it doesn't, so I stay head strong and body strong, both, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, okay, good.  So you enjoy reading fiction, non fiction, or both?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I just, you know, I'll read, I read a lot of, a variety of things, you know, I'm definitely, books about just any subject I'll ready pretty much but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's times when I definitely read stuff from the American Psychological Society and I read stuff from psychiatric care books and there's times when I read, like my favorite novel was one about into thin air by [NAME OTHER], talking about survival on [DEIDENTIFIED] and the struggles that they've gone through and seeing some of the, how some people have survived through extreme cold and stuff like that and kind of interesting stuff how it kind of broke up friendships after people have died and people have gone their separate ways, stuff like that, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Definitely, I started reading a book by, who was it, oh man, it's called, oh it's a book about the southwest and the indian tribes down there and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was talking about how people would protect themselves in the heat, you know, going to extreme measures about carrying guns with them and it was just, it was an interesting book, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And stuff like that and then I started reading one about flags of our father which is a really neat book and for the most part it was talking about how people don't understand the realities of what war does to people and stuff like that.  It was more towards the japanese war, it's not directed towards what's going on with Iraq and Afganistan right now but it's talking more about, you know, how people dealt with the situation of coming home after the Korean war and how a lot of people that survived, the PTSD they were going through made them think, you know, that people didn't really respect what they did over there or whatever and they came back, I mean it was interesting to see the japanese side versus the American side and stuff like that and it was, you know, it was definitely a brutal war.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the history of all that, you know, it was and Vietnam was really hard on people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] is hard on people and, you know, I mean it makes you think, it makes you feel lucky that we do have our freedom right now, I think, you know, but anyway.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're reading a variety of topics.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, and I'm still staying current with my fitness stuff, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm training people, you know, or training my own body, it's, you know, talking about stretching and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yoga, Pilates, so you're staying limber but I don't do, you know, I do that every once in a while and do it like on a regular basis but, you know, then also reading about exercise leadership, you know, in terms of staying, things that people encounter in terms of keeping the body healthy and opposing muscle groups, working the biceps and triceps, the quadriceps, the hamstrings and keeping them in balance because I think that's what's hurting people is if your quadriceps are getting too strong, your hamstrings are neglected, if your calves are getting not as much attention, you're not, sometimes people get pain in their calves and stuff like that -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME], it sounds like you're taking good care of yourself -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like you're both mentally and physically, you're doing a lot of things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, I'm trying to stay sharp.   There's times when you, you see some horrific, you know, stuff but, you know, like you said you just try and barrel through and make sure your mind and your body stay strong.  I think, for the most part, if you make a minor mistake, don't dwell on it and realize that everyone makes mistakes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right. -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not less than other people get, like people get really weird about if things are going really really smooth and then if that ninety nine at a boys and the one mistake that people fall on -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it really brings me down when someone dwells on that constantly, it kind of, and it can be in any situation on any job -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If they continually dwell on that then there's a serious problem there with that person because we do strive for perfection in life but we never, no one every quite totally gets there and it's, unless, I mean there's times when, you know, you can be perfect and there's times when I am perfect but there's, you know, in any situation on any job when a little minor detail is overlooked, you know, and that's the thing that I really get, the micro managers who are, you know, oh just don't sweat the small  stuff but you didn't have those kind of managers all the time, you have people that sometimes get, if a screw dropped on the floor they would make a big deal out of it, you know, that was pretty much my frustration was the fact that when I was working, and it could be, it was any job I've had up to this point, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a minor detail about safety of everyone, it's not healthy to dwell on such negativity and there was a downward spiral, you know, like when I was working at the ski shop, for the most part I have got to surround myself with optimistic people, not pessimistic people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's a very good choice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, I can't, you know, the pessimism becomes very, I just, I don't like it, I don't like pessimism by anybody.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's very important to surround yourself with good people.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], are you getting low on Zyprexa, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm down to a week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let me get you some more.  And it sounds like you're doing pretty well, do you want to just come back in six months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There you go.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is this 10.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the 10's, uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, cool.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let me grab my book for next year.  Was there anything else today that you wanted to talk about that we didn't?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean there's, you know, I like that book over there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I read that and it gives you a little bit of insight into voices.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That people can hear and it can happen to anybody.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, in fact, everybody does hear voices, different kinds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes, like you said, it's the voice of our conscience.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes there are different kinds of voices.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So yeah, there are a lot of different kinds of voices that people can and do hear.  Sometimes they can be helpful, sometimes they're not helpful.  Excuse me one second, let me see who's paging me.  That can wait till we're done.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, cool.  And you know, another thing about spirits, there's books out there too that can tell you a whole lot about the spiritual side of people and how to heal the spirit because it's, it's not always easy to, when your spirit is damaged over whatever, you know, to try and really look into your spirit and heal, I mean for me it requires some effort to try.  If the human is spirit is, say you saw what happened at [DEIDENTIFIED], that was kind of, that was damaging even though I wasn't there watching it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was damaging to my spirit to know that happened, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so, for the most part, you know, I had to heal my spirit and there's other situations too where you look around and your spirit can be damaged by what other people are doing and you've really got to reach really down inside yourself and heal your own spirit and help other people heal your spirit while they're healing theirs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right [PATIENT NAME].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it does, for the most part, that's a big thing, looking around and seeing spiritual spirals that are going down and keeping your spirit high when everyone else's spirit is getting low.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, that's right [PATIENT NAME].  I'm looking at June, that would be six months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to do an eight thirty time again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that a good time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, how does Tuesday, [DATE] at eight thirty sound?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Let me look.  Okay, what's the month?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> June.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, the [DATE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [DATE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh the [DATE], sorry.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, there's nothing going on that day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And if I have, we'll see what's going on in terms of the job search and we'll evaluate it but I bet you I can, you know, make it up here and talk to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, if it's a problem, if there's a conflict with work, just call me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then father's day is on the [DATE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Summer begins on the [DATE], so</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah.  Do you want a card then too [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that will work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's cool.  Okay, that'll remind me and I can put it on my calender here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want a pen or pencil?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably both.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Thanks [PATIENT NAME].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean it's, it's amazing to see, oh and I've got to run out to my car and grab my check for you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, is that cool?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine, sure, if you want to that's okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not a problem at all if you don't mind.  I've just got to get it.  Do you want me to slip it under your door?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Actually, I'll leave this door unlocked and you can just come back in this door, you don't have to go through the waiting room, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You've helped out a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm glad you're doing well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean for the most part.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll leave this door open. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe you can [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh thanks [PATIENT NAME].  All right, I'll leave this open then for you, okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's use the time we have. Take some deep breaths. It sounds like you rushed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I had known, I would have not dropped off my prescription ahead of time, but today is the last day of health insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so you used that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but still. This past week was kind of bad, and I never actually got to start running or anything. I did a little bit of walking. And Sydney's uncle died really really suddenly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was like 65 or something. Mid-to-late 60s, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Young.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was a question about whether or not Sydney was going to go down for the funeral, and some friends were coming to stay with me this weekend. He ended up not going to the funeral because it was going to be like such short notice that he wouldn't have time to like — like the tickets were too expensive, even though his parents were paying for them.</p>

<p>[01:06.4]</p>

<p>He wanted me to come with him, and his parents didn't want me to come along. I was just like "Whatever. I will do whatever you want." Also it was going to be on Friday morning, so we would have had to travel back on Saturday. So basically, lots and lots of craziness and we didn't end up going.</p>

<p>But then he was depressed for the next few days which meant that we didn't get anything done. I had to stay home from work to take care of him and keep him company, but then we didn't get any IKEA furniture assembled. It's like the 13<sup>th</sup> now and halfway through the month, and he's still not actually living in his new room yet, even though his stuff is like mostly there. But he still has things in my room. I feel like it's sort of chaotic.</p>

<p>[01:56.9]</p>

<p>Then I finally went and saw the gynecologist on Friday since I wanted to see one before my insurance ran out. I found out that I might — well, she doesn't know and she referred me to a specialist, so I have to call. But she suspects that I might not be able to have sex. Like she did an examination, like not even going in all the way or anything, and she pressed down on one area towards the opening and it hurt. She was like "You shouldn't be feeling any pain there at all." And she was like "Well, you can have a successful or satisfying sex life without intercourse," and I'm like "Okay, I can but I don't think Sydney can." Then I panicked and thought that Sydney was going to leave me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Based on because he said he would leave you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. But I know that he likes sex and that's really the only way for him to get off, like with a partner. Like I was looking forward to us having sex and stuff, and I didn't want to make him give up sex for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>[03:07.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He says he's willing to compromise, like he's totally okay with — like we shouldn't give up yet and should talk to the doctor. He'll pay for the out-of-pocket stuff when I don't have insurance. But like it's really —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really surprising information for both of you to sort of be faced with that possibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like he thinks it's a small possibility, like he doesn't think it's impossible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "He" the doctor or "he" Sydney?</p>

<p>CLIENT: "He" Sydney. The doctor was female. I don't want to see a male gynecologist. Sydney thinks like — because I asked her "Wait, does this mean I will never have sex?" She said "I don't want to say never, but you know." She said it was fine if we still worked with the dildos.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And have you guys been doing that? I mean, I know we haven't talked about that much at all.</p>

<p>[04:02.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that much recently. Like not this past week but the week before, we worked with them once maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's been painful for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I could only get up to the third one out of five, and I cannot get the fourth one in. I need to be able to get the fourth one in before we can get Sydney in. If I insert it, it's okay. If he inserts it, like I can only get it from a certain angle and I guess that angle is not pressing down on that spot that has pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it feels like one spot that has pain, not the entire circumference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly, yeah. And it's just — (pause) I'm just afraid that he'll think it's okay now, and then many years later decide that it isn't okay anymore, and then what will happen?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's not jump that many years ahead. It sounds like the next step is to see a specialist. Who did she refer you to?</p>

<p>[05:02.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This woman named Kyra Johnson.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know Kyra.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Is she good?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She is the person to see in this area for any kind of sexual difficulties whatsoever. She has a sexual health institute and has a lot of people she trains to work with these issues in particular, whether it be an emotional fear of sexuality or particular sexual things or physical problems with sexuality. So you got referred to the exact person that I would have referred you to. I know a lot of people who have used her or have used one of the therapists that she's trained who work in her institute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like what if it's a neurological thing because it was actual physical pain, not just me tensing up or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[06:00.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just that I was feeling pain in a place where I should not be feeling pain. (pause) Which makes sense why all my gynecological exams have been very very painful. It's not just me being crazy, and it's not just because of no reason. Like I thought it was some sort of psychological issue. So, yeah.</p>

<p>But she'll be expensive and whoever she refers me to. I mean, what if I have to go to doctor after doctor after doctor? I can't have my parents pay for it because I don't want to have to tell them "Hey, we're trying to have premarital sex." Sydney is like "You could tell them you need to see a gynecologist because you have vaginal pain."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a tough topic to bring up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The reason I'm in pain is because we're trying to have sex. It's not like I'm in constant pain all the time. I'm afraid insurance won't cover it because it's like elective.</p>

<p>[07:04.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't — I don't have — I got a letter last week that was like "We still need this piece of information from you from StateHealth." I sent them the piece of information, and it got out on Saturday. They might have gotten it today. I don't know how long it will take them to process me. They said I had up until September 28<sup>th</sup> to give them the piece of information, and I'm hoping that they'll process my stuff before then. But I'm about to lose my insurance, and this is really scary. I can't do anything about the sex thing until I see the next doctor. What if it's something that — like I have so many physical problems that are weird and don't have any known cause and don't have any known solution. This is just another one.</p>

<p>[08:01.5]</p>

<p>I just wish I had a functional body because I don't. I really don't. Like the vocal (inaudible at 08:09.2) and the wrist and everything else that's wrong with me. It's not fair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem fair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want Sydney to decide five years from now that he misses sex. (crying) He thinks it's fine now, but he might not think it's fine (inaudible at 08:34.8). If I broke up with him, it's not like any other guy would be okay with not having sex either. I would specifically have to find some guy who can't have intercourse instead of someone who I actually love, and I can't have both.</p>

<p>[09:05.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It definitely seems to add some complication to figuring out how do you make your relationship satisfying for both of you, and how do you work around this pain issue if it's not something there is a treatment for. But at this stage, all you know is that this gynecologist was surprised at you having pain in this particular spot and has referred you onto somebody else who may be able to understand it, treat it, explain it, give you ways for working around it. I think it's encouraging to hear that there is — if you are in control of how you insert something into your vagina that you can avoid this spot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it will still hurt somewhat, but like I can avoid that spot. I don't know if I could avoid that spot having sex.</p>

<p>[09:57.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but you don't know yet, and this is sort of new information to you. So I think before we jump down the road to five years from now and try to find a particular person who can't or doesn't want to have intercourse, let's see if there are some steps in between that. Maybe there are ways to make intercourse possible. Maybe there is a way to treat this spot so that if it is confined to one spot where there is pain, maybe there is something that can be done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to get so expensive and —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't justify the cost. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, but we don't know that. Maybe it will be covered. Maybe it's not as tricky as you're imagining. I don't know. This is beyond my area of expertise, but I'm not willing to jump down one particular path with you when there is so much that you don't know yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah. I just don't know. I don't want to have to see doctor after doctor. I really really don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand that.</p>

<p>[11:01.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so sick of seeing doctors. I have to wait at least until I hear back from StateHealth I think, or something. So they might not even be able to do anything about it for several weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. You might be on hold for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll have to like — (pause) You know, I didn't quite time my meds right, so I filled my birth control today and I filled my Seroquel today. But like the Wellbutrin, it's too close. Like I should have filled them sooner so I should be able to get them again. I mean, I have a stash but I'm going to have to start — like at some point I'm probably going to have to start refilling them when I don't have insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many weeks do you think you have on those?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of my Wellbutrin? Well, I probably do have a month's worth of Wellbutrin between the different bottles I have, though I really don't like using my stash of it.</p>

<p>[12:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. But it's possible that you'll have your insurance within a month's time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, but we don't know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We don't know that. We also don't know that you won't. I think it's really important to keep an eye on that so you don't have withdrawal from meds.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll have to pay for them no matter — like, I can't not take my meds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You have to take your meds. So hopefully the insurance will kick in in time for you to be able to renew it with insurance. But if not, then you've got to pay for your meds.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And my parents are already on me to get a job. It's not like I could have done anything sooner. Like I got on StateHealth as quickly as I — maybe I should have written to them a month in advance, but I thought I was applying for September 1<sup>st</sup> based on their website. Even though, I guess, it's sort of more rolling than that and they just don't phrase it like that on their website. You know, like "Apply July 15<sup>th</sup> for August 1<sup>st</sup>."</p>

<p>[13:08.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you got confirmation that they would pick up mid-month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All I know is they were like "We need this piece of information" — the W2 from Work that I earned that much money — "in order to continue." So then I gave them my W2 from Work, and I had to wait for that to be sent out. So I guess that means there's a chance they'll cover me because otherwise they could have just denied me. Maybe by the time they start processing me, I will have lost my other insurance so they could like get it through right away. But I don't even know who I would call there or anything. (pause)</p>

<p>[13:58.8]</p>

<p>And I haven't applied to any jobs because I've been helping Sydney. (crying) And I don't want to do the networking thing, but I have to do the networking thing because if I don't, I'll just send out cover letters and none of the cover letters have worked before, so I don't know why that would change now. Like I don't know what about that would possibly change that would make it so that I would get the job this time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The networking thing gives you a little bit of an edge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't ask my professors, not for the professional school I'm in where all these other people also live in the same area. If it was like a college professor or something, or even someone from the divinity school where I'm like "Hey, I went into archives and I'm the one student who went into archives, or maybe like one of five students or something. Do you know of anyone looking for an archivist?" That would be one thing, but like asking my archives professors, everybody would be like "Do it yourself."</p>

<p>[15:02.1]</p>

<p>I just feel so presumptuous. And I wasn't an especially good student in any of my classes anyway, so it's not like I was the best person ever. Like "Oh, of course, you're the best person ever. We will totally find you a job." Like I didn't do badly in any of my classes, but I didn't try my hardest necessarily all the time because library school is easy. I just sort of coasted by and I got mostly As and a couple of B<sup>+</sup>s and one B. (pause)</p>

<p>And if anything, also because those professors will like post jobs to the listserv and be like "Okay, there's this job" and then everyone who is on the listserv will be able to see that post. So it's not like then — you know? So asking my Librarian professors is a really bad idea because everybody is doing it and I have no right to do so.</p>

<p>[16:01.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know that everybody is doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but it seems like it. Or if no one else is, then they'll just be like — there's no reason for them to give me special consideration over anyone else. And now it's like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I wonder if they would do for you what they are doing for everyone else that asks. Not necessarily special consideration but equal treatment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I don't know what equal treatment would be. Maybe they don't recommend anybody. Maybe they're willing to recommend everyone equally. I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's been so long, and like I don't feel like I was really close with any of my professors or anything, so it's not like I could ask them. Not in the way when I was close with my professors in college or div (ph) school, you know? I never went to office hours or anything. I just — they had all the other students in there.</p>

<p>[17:01.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if that feels completely out of range for you, are there other maybe more creative avenues —</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 17:10.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: — if you feel somewhat ready to do this? Do you feel ready to do this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, but I have to do something. (crying) I should have done something months ago but I didn't, and now it's my own fault that I'm not going to have insurance. I should just go uninsured forever because I don't deserve insurance. If I did, I would have found a job by now. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't go uninsured, so that's not an option.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no punishment here. You don't not deserve, but it sounds like you're recognizing that you didn't do this before. Now it's crunch time, so now it's time to do something even though you don't feel comfortable doing it.</p>

<p>[17:58.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [But there's only one I would consider asking that would work, but I hesitate on asking that one person.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are you comfortable asking for help, regardless of whether you think they are connected to something. Is there anyone you feel comfortable asking for help looking for jobs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) (sniffling) Not really. I don't think so, because people my age wouldn't be much help because they're my age and not very established in their fields and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anyone your age that you would consider asking for help? Let's forget about what you think they can do. I'm just looking at who you feel close enough to or comfortable enough with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe people in like (inaudible at 18:56.3) or something like that.</p>

<p>[19:01.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so that's your first step. Because part of networking is that you don't really know exactly who everybody else knows. So if you feel comfortable talking to (inaudible at 19:13.0) and letting them know that —</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not actually going to work. Like Lucy is already the one who sent me the editing thing and so in doing that, I don't think she also — she knows that I'm looking for a job, so it's not like I have that much further —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And where are you on the editing thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've edited one thing so far. I could have done something last week, but it would have been like on Tuesday when I was doing all the other things, so I didn't try to do it. I didn't take that job, and there hasn't been one since. And then I didn't hear anything for the rest of the week, I was like oh no, maybe the one thing I edited was a really really bad job or something. I've since gotten another e-mail where they were like "We are looking for editors" — well, not editors — typesetters and graphic designers and stuff. So it's like I'm still in there, it's just that there haven't been any jobs since then.</p>

<p>[20:04.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you're in the pipeline for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm in the pipeline for that, but it won't pick up for another couple of weeks, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When school starts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When school starts. Once school starts, then maybe. But they're not a job with health insurance, and they're not in my field. I guess I also feel comfortable asking Tara, but I've already — like she said she would set me up with whoever she knows, but she doesn't know — like she knows some people, but so far that hasn't actually helped me get a job. She knew the person at Ebsco, and I talked to the person at Ebsco which was all well and good, but the job went to someone else because I'm not a student and it was a student job. There aren't any non-student jobs at Ebsco that I could apply for right now. (pause)</p>

<p>[21:01.9]</p>

<p>So maybe Tara and maybe maybe maybe I could ask like Marge over at the div (ph) school since I did volunteer for her a while ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe that could be the one new person you ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe Barbara?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe Barbara, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I think — I know you're really uncomfortable with the idea of asking people for help and networking, but maybe you could baby step your way into it, starting with the people you are the most comfortable with. And you don't know exactly who they know. Maybe professionally somebody is not connected in your field, but maybe their next door neighbor who they happen to be really close to is an archivist. You don't know. Maybe the person who walks their dog knows somebody who works in a library. And that's part of networking, the unexpected connections that people might have. And sometimes a personal connection is closer than a professional connection.</p>

<p>[22:03.6]</p>

<p>If someone's next door neighbor works someplace and they feel really close to them, they might be willing to say "Hey, a student who did this for me is looking for this, and don't you know people in that area?" Part of this is going to be up to chance. So starting with who you feel comfortable and letting them know you've been looking in this field and you're having trouble and could they think of anything because you really trust their opinion. Just seeing where that goes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And possibly, I guess, the people I used to work with in planned giving, assuming they're still there and I can still contact them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because those are people that you worked with that you did a good job for, and you're not sure — you don't know —</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was three years ago, so I don't even know if they still remember me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not going to forget you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I guess. I worked for them for like over a year.</p>

<p>[22:57.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's unlikely that they're not going to remember who you are. Are you the first person they think of in the morning when they get up? Probably not. But when you touch base with them and remind them of your name and that you worked there three years ago, they're most likely going to be like "Of course we remember who you are."</p>

<p>So maybe being active in the things you can be active in. You have to wait on the health insurance thing. Following up with Kyra is going to be waiting on the health insurance thing. But the thing you can do this week to start feeling like you're taking care of yourself is to start making little inroads to networking. I think you will start to feel a little bit better when you start being active in the things you can be active in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've just spent a lot of time taking care of Sydney and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been doing a lot to take care of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My parents think I sit around and do nothing all day [I'm thinking]. It's not that I do nothing.</p>

<p>[24:00.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been doing other things, and now it's time to take care of you a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still have to finish the IKEA furniture. We're not done yet, even now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not going to — people can live without all their furniture being completely assembled. So if that needs to take a slower pace —</p>

<p>CLIENT: A bed?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's been doing okay since.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, only because people around the house — we've been ignoring the "you can only have significant others over for half the week" thing. We've completely ignored that, and now that Lee is back I think we have to start paying attention to it again. So we really do need a bed, even if nothing else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If he has to sleep on a mattress for one night, he can survive that. And instead of assembling all of the furniture, it can be a priority to get the bed assembled. That does not preclude you from making a phone call. You can do that.</p>

<p>[25:03.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to make phone calls? I can't just write e-mails?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do an e-mail. That's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I can at least write out what I'm going to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, you can do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then they can take their time responding and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I wasn't being specific. When I said phone call, that was not thoughtful. You can reach out in the way that you're going to reach out. So rather than make it something that you're less likely to do, if you are likely to write an e-mail and send it off, then you do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We do have to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad we did get to talk for the time that we had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I know I moved your time on you and we just didn't —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we're back to normal next week, correct?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I guess since you're going to do the billing for all of the sessions, [will you send] the billing for all the previous sessions to Blue Cross?</p>

<p>[26:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your Blue Cross officially ends today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tomorrow. So I send everything up until tomorrow to Blue Cross.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they'll pay for it even if they get to it a few days later?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, because they pay for anything while you had their insurance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When they process it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't have to worry about that at all. Do you want to schedule for next week, thinking that you're going to have your parents pay for some sessions in between?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I will and have it sent to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what I can do is — usually I do all my billing at the end of the month, so I will hold onto the bills until the end of August. Maybe we will have heard from StateHealth by then. If not, then I will give you a bill to send onto your parents and you can give me their address or whatever feels comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will StateHealth cover someone out-of-network? Like will they cover all of it or 80 percent of it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know the details of that. That's a question they would be able to answer correctly.</p>

<p>[27:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, if you had patients with StateHealth —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It depends on the plan. So within StateHealth there is more than one plan. If I give you a number, it's most likely going to be incorrect and I don't want to do that. They're not all the same. I think once you get StateHealth, you choose whether you want to be on Network Health or not or there's a bunch of them in there. Alright? So I'll see you next week at 1:30.</p>

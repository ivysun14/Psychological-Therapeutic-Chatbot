</p><p>Client 0426-002 Tape #105 (inaudible) 

</p><p>(starts out talking about the time and changing clocks - did not transcribe) 

</p><p>PATIENT: We went to a dinner party last night and I came away thinking, boy, I...you really have a lot of self confidence. Every time someone would ask me something, did I...even if I did have thought s on it, I just...I really would back away. I just can't trust myself to answer. That maybe my answer won't be what they're thinking and I'll really be torn apart. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like they would pounce on you if what you say doesn't agree with them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, even if they didn't even pounce on me, you know...and just...they just plain didn't agree and they expected me to defend the way I was thinking...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) like I was thinking.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would...I would (inaudible) very flustered and then, say, oh, yeah, well...and change the subject. (inaudible) I do...I even wanted to say that...with all these learned people around, I just (inaudible) want to open my mouth. You know? I'll admit, yes, I did read the book and...but when they asked me what (inaudible) a black rider, I don't even know what they mean. Was he a negro, yes, but...that isn't exactly what he wanted to hear, you know? 00:03:22

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) something like feeling like every...well, just to use that example...it's like everyone else knows what he's talking about (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I didn't know what he meant. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) it's sounded like (inaudible) inferences but (inaudible) ask somebody because everyone knows that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I did. I said What do you mean? And he said is he a black rider? I thought for god's sakes, woman, that's a simple question. Answer it. Luckily, someone came in at that time and we shifted the conversation. And, you know, it's very easy for me to sit around and say very trivial, light things. (inaudible) to knock me down, if I don't have to support it. Like he said, we were talking about Marla Campbell (ph) and he said oh, you mean, James New's (ph) wife and I said, we don't call her that. We call her Mrs. Campbell or Mrs. Marla Campbell and he said oh, why is that? Expecting me to really go into women's liberation and I wanted to but I don't know all that much about it. I said just out of respect for her as a human being. She's not somebody's wife, you know. 00:05:07

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like...like being afraid of...oh, I don't know exactly what the term is. Serving (inaudible) yourself or...

</p><p>PATIENT: I just can't. I just can't...you know, even if I have a spot (ph) on it, I can't bring it up because the parts I have has been wrong. (inaudible) it's been proved to me to be wrong. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I tried...even practice it with...which is probably wrong but anymore, I don't even do that. I just let it pass by. And I'm also a great one for interrupting people if I have a thought that passes through my mind. And last night my husband poked me and I just could have called him hole (ph) right after I hit him. You know? Because like it was obvious to everybody else that I did interrupt but I don't think he needed to make such a big thing out of it. I was trying to tell a joke one time and he kicked me under the table. You know, like he doesn't even want me to talk because I'm going to embarrass him. 00:06:48

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You think you should (inaudible) maybe he isn't patient enough (inaudible) if he's not going to expect all those other people.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, they would be more patient than he would be but I don't want them to know that I'm really stupid. You know, keep them in the dark. He already knows me. Nothing I can do...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, then it sort of sounds like when he pokes you, he's sort of saving you...saving you from their knowing. It's like saying hey, listen, Jessica, you're about to screw up.

</p><p>PATIENT: You're ignorant.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I always thought it was because he didn't want to be embarrassed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, that may be so, but I...I don't know...(inaudible) That may be his (inaudible) for doing this and I...I would think, in some way, given what you just said that you'd welcome this because that way he's saving you from being really stupid in front of all these people. 00:08:00

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't because I feel more like an idiot when he's, you know, kicking me. It's like what you do to your kids so... children are to be seen and not heard. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But he wouldn't treat his children like that. Everybody has to gather around and listen to what they have to say. But if I start to talk, then you better watch out because you're going to get sore ribs. 00:08:34 (noises to 00:08:42) I can see you're a (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kill them or cure them. Oh, lord, now I'm (inaudible) I guess...I can't find where I was exactly but I (inaudible) in the area of feeling you sense...you must sense yourself as being more chastised and humiliated and made child-like than the children with him. 

</p><p>PATIENT: When he's there, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But he lavishes...the children exist for him, when he's interested, to lavish love and affection on and by virtue of being children, they get the love and affection but by virtue of being a child, you...you just get tromped on and squashed and made to feel inadequate and worthless and like you better keep your mouth shut. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible) And I can have such a good time at a party without him, you know, like nobody's hitting me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you don't feel that way just naturally or... 00:10:16

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, in a way...you know, like I wouldn't...everybody else would listen patiently but when you have your husband there, it really...it draws more attention to what you're saying when he's sitting there banging you. Anybody else would just say oh well, that's her opinion and go on with it but then they really sit up and listen because here's her husband, you know....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He really singles you out (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. In a way...you know, it's a tiny group. It just felt like I was raised to...you know, and you don't want to stop and just say nothing (inaudible) in the middle of a sentence but you don't dare go on in that...in what you were going to say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why not? 00:11:11

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, because you (inaudible) he poked you. It's going to turn out really stupid but once you finally finish the sentence, it makes no sense at all (overlapping voices) really stupid. You can't even remember what you were going to say. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So, it sounds like when he pokes you, it winds up being even worse. I mean you wind up sounding dumber.

</p><p>PATIENT: I really am. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Which...how you look at yourself is really (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean you look at yourself as being pretty dumb to begin with...

</p><p>PATIENT: To begin with and then he really flattens me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Literally and figuratively. 00:11:54

</p><p>PATIENT: Plus it hurts a lot. The last time I got kicked under the table, I hurt. I just stopped the story, you know, and I said well, I'll tell you guys sometime when he's not around. You know? And then we were all dying to hear this story and I said what was this (inaudible) (background noises) I'm usually humiliated once or twice when I'm out with him, at least, in an evening. That's not a bad average. If you were really working towards...I just can't believe that anybody that's kind to animals and children can be that way on purpose (inaudible) and still like, even from last Tuesday, he's slipping back into his own self again and I know, you know, I say to myself this, is because he's really overworked at school and I'm dragging him out to a party that he doesn't have time to go to. But he's dragging me out Sunday night to a party that is just going to be a complete bomb that I don't want to go to. So I feel like I owe him, you know? Or he's getting me back or.... It's all going to work out, I guess. I can try and be understanding. This, is why he's gruff to me because he doesn't want to go to this party with my friends. 00:13:48

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But he won't even let me...like I was saying, this party Sunday night is going to be so bad because we've been to these people's houses and it's this big group of people and there are two people talking all night long and you don't interrupt to say...you don't interrupt to ask a question or anything and he's saying oh, and you start talking about people again. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I'm telling these friends of ours last night. You know, will you baby sit...I don't really want to go. But if I have to go, I thought I'd tell them I'm not going to have a good time so they wouldn't expect me to be bubbly and happy about going. I sit around and complain about it and (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. And you...and he slapped you down when you did that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're going to start talking about people? Yeah. Imagine it makes these people feel like I run upstairs and start talking about them because that's the only thing I know how to do. I mean, he just as good as told them that. 00:15:03

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he humiliates you in front of them too?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He doesn't really pick and choose, no. I mean, he (inaudible) humiliates you in front of anybody who happens to be there and he didn't used to do that either. It's just since we've been here. I really think that he is a little bit...a little bit...about that much...embarrassed that I'm, you know, that I am not in school; that I don't have a degree. No matter if you know anything at all. 00:15:35 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's not the issue. The issue is more like you don't have the concrete accomplishments or something and he's sort of ashamed of that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so. But he has...he has put down other men who he thought were forcing them...their wives to go on to school to build their own egos and I think he's really doing the same thing only he's not forcing me to go on. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) it's not that he's forcing you to go on....it's he's saying alright...you know, don't go on if you don't want to go on or don't go on and then punishing you for the (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he's told me I'm too dumb to go. So he really wouldn't expect me to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he's saying you'll never...you'd never make it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You'll never go...well, yeah. He said that. You can't even have an undergraduate, how could you go on? How could you even take a course? You can't even handle the family? How could you go out to work?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) the brains to come (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: What a case (inaudible) 00:16:50 I then, you know, things that I try to do and that I do well, I don't get any praise or even thank you. It's that you haven't done something else. I mean, he's not really this bad but when you put all of these things together...well, it doesn't go on all that...all day long, just one thing after another because he doesn't talk to me. (laughter) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the sum total of what goes on...I guess, you're saying I'm constantly told or told enough that I'm inadequate. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. And even if you aren't talking to your wife, that's, in a sense, telling them they're not worth talking to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So either he talks to me or he doesn't talk to me or he pokes me in the ribs or kicks me under the table. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah...means the same thing. Anything he does. He can't do anything right for (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry what did you say?

</p><p>PATIENT: I said he can't do anything right. If he talks to me, you know, I get mad. If he doesn't talk to me, I get mad. If he pokes me, I get mad. If he kicks me, I get mad. I said he can't do anything right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I understand but I don't know where you're coming from. You say that's what I'm thinking? (overlapping voices) Or that's what you....

</p><p>PATIENT: I (inaudible) what he's thinking. I never do anything right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, (inaudible) looking at it from his position. 00:18:31

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Get griped at anything he does. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So from where he sits, you're a pretty grouchy pair. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not really. I'm grouchy when he's grouchy. You know, which doesn't work out to our advantage. But...usually I'm very happy when he's not around. Or even if I can ignore him....then it's alright too. But he came home in a bad mood last night and I...just like when you go to a dinner party, you don't even want to visit with him. I mean, I don't anyway because I can see him other times. There are other people I'd rather talk to but if...you know, like he kind of grates on my nerves to even be in the same room when he thinks so little of me. 00:19:45

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like he doesn't even have to say anything at all; knowing what he thinks of you and what he's feeling about you when you're talking or about to talk. That's enough right there; like a constant disapproving presence.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, I was thinking too that if the people that we are with and...they're so opposite of him. I mean, anything you do, anything you make for them and bring to their house, they go on and on and on and you know darn well they can't be that crazy about it. But I wish that he would have a happy medium. You know, like, you would not say anything but he wouldn't just go overboard because I have accused him of being insincere when he's raved about something. I can't even remember what it would have been but it... you know, just something very ordinary that I do. 00:20:58

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you wouldn't mind a little bit of that praise...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit of it. But it's so sporadic, you know? Maybe every six months I do something right; or he's in the good mood and it looks right and I've been doing the same thing for years and it's never impressed him then. But now it does. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's sort of unjust or something (inaudible) what you do.

</p><p>PATIENT: Than how you feel. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Make you feel (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think...just trying to make up for...he's very insincere, I think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it's very insincere. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm confused. 

</p><p>PATIENT: He is when he's saying these...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought you were saying he feels good. He said that because he feels good. But I'm...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he's still not sincere if...I mean...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's not...

</p><p>PATIENT: He's not lying but he's not (overlapping, chuckling) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) you're saying it's not really...I don't know but I don't want to argue this because I'm not (inaudible) hearing. But insincere means like lying or something, you know, like, he's lying or he's...I thought you were saying he gets carried away with his good mood and so he praises indiscriminately or lavishly and it has nothing to do with what I'm doing but has to do with the fact that he's in a good mood. 00:22:49

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I try to...like I can't even remember some of the instances that he has praised me which says something, doesn't it? The last time was when I painted the ceiling in the living room and he thought I really did a...just a terrific job and I think, at that time, it really kind of offended me because yes, I did do a terrific job but he was laying in bed sleeping all this time when I was, you know, getting sick to my stomach and gagging and if I would just wait two years, he would help me. You know? You know and it's like he has...like he really had to build that...that job up because he felt guilty about not helping. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't want to be... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of manipulative praise. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, it makes you feel good and yes, you do want to go on to room after room but when you're up there nine feet in the air and you're just so sick, you don't think you can handle another room and he's in there sacked out. It's really kind of...then I think he's insincere when he says that, so...and he's not really because it is a good job but I don't think that's the reason he's saying...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. He's saying...doing it for two things; doing it (a) to cover up the fact that he was in there sacked out and (b) to get you to (inaudible) to go do another ceiling. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe hire me out. That's something I could do. 00:24:45

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Non-union painter. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right and he could be my manager because I couldn't handle the money or figure out the fees. I think if we had money I could really be happy working around the house with my hands and he could come in and feel guilty. That would make me happy. Make him feel guilty because he's so lazy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That really gripes you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: It does but you know, he was like that when I married him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not new. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not new but you know, you think oh, surely, he will pick up the hammer when it's his own house...his own ceiling is falling down and I'll be darned, all the plaster falls on your head and he's in there with his book.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really want to shake him or yell at him or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Or what he usually does is let me start a job that I really can't handle and then when I've just ruined it then he'll come in and say well, why didn't you call me? And I had been hollering for two weeks. Please let's do this together. It'll be done in a minute but he always waits. 00:26:25

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Waits for you to mess it up.

</p><p>PATIENT: Mess it up. So he can be the big he man and waltz in there and straighten it out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm so mad at him about the bathroom carpeting which has been down for almost a year. I had to cut the strips and lift the tub, you know, and he could...it took me all night and he did it in fifteen minutes with my. It's ruined and I mean the carpeting is ruined because I cut it where it shouldn't have been cut because he was in bed. But there's no way to cure laziness. And then, you know, then he takes me...his friends threw the house and says...and they say was this carpeting here? No, Jessica did that and she painted the wall and look at this wall she painted and isn't that great? And I just, you now...I'd like to hit him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What does that do to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: It just aggravates me because like, your wife can teach but mine can sure paint. This, is all he has to show people that I can do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand. 00:28:11

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not sure that I do either. But it really...it really...it's like I can't do anything intellectual when everybody else is but I can do the manual tasks and this, is all he has to show...to brag about .

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I understand now. All there is of you that he finds worthwhile to be able to talk about to his friends is stupid manual tasks like every other wife does something intelligent that their husbands can talk about (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're a servant (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Servant. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Beast of burden...servant...dumb beast. Good for this stupid thing. (inaudible) stick-to-itiveness (ph) some low level task. Low level (inaudible) is that it? It's like you're very ashamed. Ashamed because that's all there is. (inaudible) ashamed (inaudible) in his eyes or that's all there is (inaudible) 00:30:05

</p><p>PATIENT: That's all there is period. (quiet, crying until 00:31:13) I've even learned to cry softly because it doesn't do any good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) let go and cry but you can't?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, because it offends him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to let go and cry right now, but you can't?

</p><p>PATIENT: I probably could if I were alone.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sort of sits inside you (inaudible) your tears. 

</p><p>PATIENT: They say a good cry is good for you but (inaudible) there just isn't any place to do it or any time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you feel very strange right now?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right now?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. No place and no time...right now.

</p><p>PATIENT: I do. (inaudible) headache too. (quiet 00:32:41 to 00:33:15) I really don't want to cry though. I'd like to not ever have to cry. So, I could really take what was coming to me or, you know, really realize what I am and accepted it instead of crying about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like say to yourself...

</p><p>PATIENT: That's all I can do is paint. So what. All he can do is read his damn books. He can't paint. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like to be able to...I guess you're saying feel some sort of pride in what you're able to do. 00:34:10

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sure there must be happy painters around and they're not ashamed that they paint. I do a much better job than those that are contracted for the university. That says something for my ability. I'm not getting paid by the hour, maybe that's it. (overlapping voices, laughing) But it's not much when you live here. If you lived in the suburbs, where all the women painted their houses and took great pride in it, it would be much better. But when you live here and they don't have time to paint because they're reading this new book and you don't have time to read the new book because you're the only one in the house that knows how to paint...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying your (inaudible) in an alien land? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The suburbs are (inaudible) (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I would fit in possibly better there but I don't want to live there. Because when I get through painting, I don't want to talk about it the rest of the day. 00:35:49

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want to be reading the books?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, much rather. A lot more fun and I don't even have any great...Jim said well, if you do it yourself then you'll have this great pride in what you do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you're ashamed of what you do.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I am so how can I ever have any pride in it. I mean, I'm not really...like I, you know, I refinish things. And I just said help me...give me a little help. But if you do it all yourself, which is a cop out for a lazy man (laughter) (overlapping voices) get yourself some pride, you now?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) You would get the chance to refinish the (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: So, you know, it's just...and people do come over and say oh, did you do that all by yourself? Well, I can't even do that. My husband has to do all my work and I think oh, you lucky stiff. You know, that is a man's job.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You resent having to have to do it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I do. Even if we could do it together, it would be some kind of mutual thing. You know, we could talk about the chair you were working on if all other...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but with using that, I guess...(inaudible) I guess you feel like subjugated (ph) or something like that. 00:37:38

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's not like he makes me do it. It's just that if it gets done, I do it. Unless some...unless his friends are coming. That's...friends is kind of a loose terms because he doesn't have any. He has acquaintances. You know, like when we were in Springfield, somebody you really...no, he didn't even really particularly care for them but they came from a lot of money and their apartment was really beautiful and it was beautifully furnished and so when they came over to our little dump, he was up on the ceiling cleaning and carrying on. You know, like he didn't even want to come play bridge when it's my friends. He does a lot...he didn't like my friends because they were really dummies. They were nice, kind dummies though. That's kind of aggravating. When you ask him to take down the light so you can clean it and he's too busy except when they come to visit and he's got to have that light clean in case they would happen to glance up. Wonder what he is trying to impress them with? 00:39:37

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Was he trying to impress them saying well, my wife is sure a good cleaning lady or...look I really keep her on the ball. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Look I keep her at the end of the leash. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. She does all of these things. She's so clever with her (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wait a minute. What he's saying is see how I make her jump through the hoop... she's really subjugated by me. I'm really in control here. Look at this. Look how she (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) cleans my life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe that's that he's saying. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. He was obviously trying to impress them in some way...by a light?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't make sense.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't. It's kind of silly. But then everything he does doesn't necessarily make sense. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So, he used that as a criteria and you (inaudible) love.

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) Right. That really, I guess, does kind of aggravate me when...when I have to get my pride of workmanship out of refinishing some old chairs, when all I want to do is get them down so we're going to have something to sit on. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It gripes you that a survival task becomes the only thing you can point to, to show your craftsmanship. 00:41:30

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I just don't have a...one thing it sounded like you're saying is...these are things I don't even want to be doing, for god's sake.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. These are things my mother does and she loves. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And, you know, like I always feel like I...like my mother does everything. She paints; she writes stories; she refinishes furniture; she's got a lot of things going for her and I don't even like it...I don't want to be compared to my mother because I always come out on the short end. I can't even write a letter. You know? And I can paint flat surfaces but I don't even like to refinish furniture but it's sort of, you know, if you're her daughter then you must like doing this. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) And my mother in law paints pictures also and so I'm really stuck. My mother in law does everything my mother doesn't do and I can't do any of these things. Like I make it...you know, like if I sew and my mother in law comes up and she goes...on the seams, you know, and I grab it out of her hands because I know the seams are crooked and the...it's not good. I don't like to do that either. I mean all these things that they take pleasure in and my husband says well, why don't you sew? Why don't you knit? Why don't you refinish the furniture...give you great pride in your work because you must just be dying to do this, when I'd much rather buy something that's already done. 00:43:38

</p><p>COUNSELOR: One thing I was wondering (inaudible) somehow feeling trapped into some of these things by virtue of your mother's being able to do them...enjoy them. Like somehow people or somehow there's an expectation that you do...do these things because she loved (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not an expectation from other people though. It's the way I think because I've always thought my mother could do no wrong and that everything she did was just really excellent and it is. But there's no reason why I should do these things and that they should, in turn, be excellent because I don't...it doesn't necessarily follow. It's not a logical argument. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But I guess you're saying (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I want to be like my mother. She's perfectly happy...I think. 00:44:59

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) thought you were also saying that (inaudible) a game that I can't win. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She does these things for enjoyment.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I do these things and (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: So what am I doing them for? Because we have to have furniture and as long as we have to have this junk it might as well look okay. You know, and people come to our house and say, oh, did you do this antiquing? In the first instance you say yeah and they say oh, I can't do that. And that is so....really that is very demeaning, I guess. Because all you do is slap some paint on it and here...are they trying to build you up?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're like, catering to you like you would a child.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, that's such a beautiful picture. Tell me what it is. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, it's just...I just can't...no maybe there are people that cannot paint, you know, wood. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) But you know, for myself, I'd much rather be able...I'd much rather be an artist and not paint furniture and walls and things. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought...yeah, I thought you were saying regardless of what, in some sense what the truth is, it might even be true that some people can't paint ceilings or paint antique chairs or whatever. That's not the point. The point is something like if feels to you, when someone says that to you, like anybody can do that and you're being put off; you're being humored, right? Like (inaudible) picture...what is it? 00:47:05

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I could stand it if I, you know, were an artist and painted this picture which, you know, like I...even I had doubts about whether it was any good or not but if they said they liked it...I think I could believe that but I can't believe it about a rotten piece of furniture. It's just....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Stretches your belief too much. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not worth it because that does not take any talent to do that kind of...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, what do you do? I mean, what do you do with people telling you that it...that...

</p><p>PATIENT: I say oh, it's easy. What you do is get a kit. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now wait a minute...wait a minute, Jessica. That's not my question. My question is what do you do with...not with them inside...when people say things like boy, that looks hard. How do you do it? It sounds like your response is something like they're humoring me. 00:48:14

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, at first, you know, you're very happy that somebody has noticed that you've even done something in your house besides clean it. And then you get to thinking about it and it's just so...it's just so unbelievable that there are people around in this day and age that haven't heard about antiquing...haven't even done some. Like I don't believe there's anybody's house that I've ever been in that I haven't seen something that they have antiqued including the people who tell me what a beautiful thing I've got going...how do I do it? Well, you do it just like you did your chest, Dumbo. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know they're lying. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I see. I wasn't (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, some of the things they do are pretty ugly, granted, but it's their taste, not their ability. Now if they would say that is beautiful paint that you picked out and weren't you clever. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now wait a minute, Jessica, I just had another insight here. The only thing that makes you furious is they're thinking you're so ***damn stupid that you're not (inaudible) You've been in their house. You (inaudible) check or whatever it is (inaudible) you're so stupid (inaudible) 00:49:45

</p><p>PATIENT: Some people are like that. They go through their lives bothering people. And you never know where you stand with them. These people we had up for dinner. I made this very ordinary potato salad and country ribs. They just raved. I mean, I...you know, I felt like saying well, taste it, for god's sakes before you tell me how delicious it is. And that's the second couple that we've ever had to our...no, the third couple and all of these couples...the man and wife together...they don't even taste the food and they're just (inaudible. You know, like if they say it looks so good. Okay, granted it looks good but then taste it and then say it tastes good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you get very angry about people that (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: That lie. I mean, they're...I think they really...maybe that's the way you're supposed to be but if I don't like something, or what somebody has on and they ask me, I won't say god, that's horrid. Where did you get that hideous material but I certainly won't say that is the most dreamy thing I've ever seen and aren't you smart. The lady I baby sit for her child calls and says oh, isn't she a nice Mrs. Daniels (ph). Yeah, it sounds like I'm some sort of dog. Can you imagine? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I'm not...she says isn't that a nice...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I do...yeah, I made them some cookies and she said oh, Tom, isn't that a nice Mrs. Daniels...like you would say isn't that a nice job (ph) (dog?). (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, great job (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I really do get griped at people. They're so...I mean, obviously I'm not a (inaudible) because I'm the only one that does this. 00:51:54

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You may or may not be a (inaudible) but again what gripes you is that you feel patronized. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You do, really. I mean, if things...you know, if indeed, I did make good cookies which they hadn't even tasted, say thank you. That was thoughtful of you. But I'm not a good dog. I'm not a good Mrs. Daniels because I made cookies. That doesn't logically follow either. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wait a minute now. You're also hearing a (inaudible) of events what all there is to you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, if you could make cookies (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're a good Mrs. Daniels because you make those cookies. Good dog because you roll over. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's what my husband (inaudible) I had to say that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But joking aside (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, it is. But that is not like, one person; that's like almost everybody we know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like how many do you know likes you for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: And nobody will ever tell you the truth. And you could be the worst crook in the world and you would never know it because people lie. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if you sometimes have a...an image of your going through a day or a party (inaudible) only horrible things (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>IN UNISON: Isn't that clever. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess you could. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You knocked over those three (overlapping voices, laughter) 00:53:43 You never know what (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: You don't. You know, if your taste buds are dead from smoking too many cigarettes, you might poison your friends and not even know it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They'd be too nice to tell you. (laughter) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, they would. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: My husband isn't hat way. He'll gladly spit it out. I don't even like that. I can't be satisfied. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. One thing also...you should (inaudible) kind of like...your husband is the one exception to all of this.

</p><p>PATIENT: And he goes so far the other way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really don't know what to believe. Do you believe him?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Yeah, I guess I do. I surely don't believe those people and I would if they'd give me a chance, you know, like if they would eat the...the country ribs before they make their statement. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess but I had a fantasy of your saying it to a few simple (inaudible) even if they ate it first.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) here we go. These are the best country ribs I ever had. 

</p><p>PATIENT: They never had any before. Anybody that (inaudible) say who are you kidding? But that...you're just not allowed to say those things. 

</p><p>(phone rings, talks) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: See you Tuesday. (00:55:38 to end)

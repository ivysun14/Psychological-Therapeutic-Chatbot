<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well—known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy. </p>

<p>The recording of this session begins already in progress.  The therapist is a Dr. Bocchini.  No other information is available about the therapist.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>EDWARD:  — and then, I said "Oh, the hell with it" and I said it and the whole roof came down when I did that. But right now, they're convinced that old (bleep) is worthless and he has to go, and nothing but trouble. And actually, my whole family is really screwed up and I'm getting angrier and angrier. I get the feeling that — I still love my mother, but I also hate her now too because she's selfish and conceited and maybe human, but — and everything about, certainly my home life, is — it's tragic. You know, here I have a mother who's 45 and what does she want to do? She wants to get married, and she wants to get married to a rich guy and she's using all sorts of cosmetics to try and take out the wrinkles and to fight the double chin, and that's like selling yourself for money — like being a whore. (0:01:26.4)</p>

<p>And the same thing with my sister — a conversation between my brother and my sister. My sister said, "Well don't you have any eligible boyfriends?" and right now she's searching — she's looking for a guy with cash. And then my brother said "Well, you know, nobody wants a girl that has a kid" and that's — and you know how I think my brother is screwed up. And besides that, in other ways, the fact that he has — he still has temper tantrums and he's always hammering in my ear, you know, "You do one thing wrong and I'll beat the shit out of you" and, you know, always beating me up. And so, now it is unanimously agreed upon by all that I'm going to leave at the end of the summer and I'll put all my stuff at a friend's house and after — and when the summer's over, I can do two things. I can either try and get back to (bleep) or go in the Army. I have a lot of things in my way. The fact that, you know, the money will be hard to get and I'm worried about whether I really have what it takes, because I always wanted to be intelligent, you know, and — well, maybe I just don't have enough intelligence to get As and Bs in my school work. It's, you know, a feeling of inadequacy and since this has been one of my major things is drive and motivation, as long as I can remember, either (bleep) is intelligent or (bleep) is the scholar and now the idea that I just might not be is very hard to take. And in that way it would be nice to know my IQ, except it might be low. (0:03:41.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, this frightening too.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because  — </p>

<p>EDWARD: And I don't know where I stand. And, as result, I don't know what I'm going to do when I get out of college. You know, what am I — what am I fit for? At first, you know, I thought, well, if I was really intelligent, well, then, I could very conceivably take — you know, either become a teacher or go into law — some practice that takes intelligence. But if I'm not and — you know, what can I do? But these are pragmatic problems that I have. But  — </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me part of what you're saying, though, is that all of these may be pragmatic, now that everything else seems to be resolved, this is coming to the — (0:04:47.9)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Mm—hmm. Well, before, what I went over last time, that was what? An obsessive—compulsive trait, but — for that time, it was uppermost. But, I think I can remember that it was only a recent development, maybe starting right before I came here, or even during the time that I came here. And now I feel myself at that state that I was right before this started  — </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm—hmm.</p>

<p>EDWARD: — and took up all of my time. The fact that I'm mixed up — and, of course, now other things come to the surface which might have been more in my thinking before, in the beginning, or are just coming new to the surface. But, of course, I still have a lousy sex life and what happened yesterday is, there's a pretty girl that sits in the library and, you know, I say hello to her and she says hello to me, so I'm going out and ask to — going to over and ask her to go out with me and, you know, I was sitting there — you know, "should I do it?" (0:06:06.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm—hmm.</p>

<p>EDWARD: "Shouldn't I do it?" and I had all sorts of anxiety reactions. You know, my — I could feel the blood, you know, pulsing through my heart and the acid swirling around in my stomach acting up. And so, finally, I got up and went around and she wasn't there. She had left and I felt so happy, you know, because then I could put it off until the day to do it. But what seems impossible is that I'm afraid of that maybe the girls that I choose, that I like, are ones that I know before hand that couldn't possibly like me, or that my chances of getting to know are almost nil. Because that way it would work as, you know, a safety and I wouldn't have to worry about, you know, getting involved. And I would be safe. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not quite sure how I understand how you could choose these before you really know them, though. I mean, how do you — (0:07:11.9)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well just by the kinds that come into my mind. For one thing, as I said, I hardly know her. I — she's pretty, which means, you know, what does she need with me and who am I? And I don't know anybody else that knows her. In other words, it seems to me, before you can get to know the girl — well, it's always easier if you're in the same crowd — you know, you go around with the same clique. And I don't — and just the odds and the impossibility of coming up right out of the blue, so to speak, and say "Look, how would you like to go downstairs and get a cup of coffee with me and talk?", it — it's just inconceivable that, you know, she would say yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me like you might be saying it's not so much that it's inconceivable that she would be saying yes, but because of what she is — she's pretty, she looks good, what does she want with me — might you not be self—structuring the situation that it's almost bound to fail before you even — (0:08:34.3)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Yeah. That's what I mean. In fact, I would have these thoughts so much before that I would go up and I would fumble, you know, my words and what I would say, and at the first sign of backing off, I would break off and just about run away. In this process I've been shot down by some of the prettiest girls in the school. I've tried them all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, isn't the real question, have you been shot down by them, or have you really been shot down by yourself?</p>

<p>EDWARD: I've thought of that, but I don't want to say I'm shooting down myself, because then, that again brings up, you know, the idea that I'm neurotic depressive, so I'd much rather put it on their shoulders. But, it's — it's partly my fault that I worry so much, but — I wish was much handsomer. You know, I don't want somebody else's face, but, you know, I'd just like mine to look better because I couldn't picture myself behind a mask of somebody else. What did you say — that boys like that have it so easy. (0:09:48.9)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Initially. I'm not quite sure I can see a relation.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, between — a good like guy initially comes up and says "How would you like to go out and get a coffee — a cup of coffee with me?" to a girl? I think that the chances are better that she would say yes, just because he's handsome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm—hmm. But, what happens then. I mean, he's still, within himself, something other than  — </p>

<p>EDWARD: Yeah, I know but — and that's what seems to be unfair about the world, that you aren't — well, obviously, you just aren't always judged by what's inside of yourself. You're judged by other things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Initially. (0:10:31.9)</p>

<p>EDWARD: And maybe even after that. What would kill me was when the girl I met down the shore said, you know — I was sure that she liked John, you know, much more — simply because he was much handsomer than I was. And though you might say, initially, if this was the only thing, it lasted through three months, and maybe three more and I heard that they'd finally broken up. But, she thought he was wonderful and I think he was a rat, you know, the lowest forms of reptiles that God ever so put to the face of the earth. And not only that, it's the problem of the type of relation that you're entering into. For instance, perhaps a relationship between a boy and girl is superficial to a great extent. For one, each would be afraid to let the other know what they were really feeling, and the boy is always, you know, trying to act cool and say the right things, as is the girl. So, I think we can go along for a very long time — it's superficial. Because, there are girls that like (inaudible at 0:11:53.7). In fact, one girl said to me the other day "You know, (bleep), the more I get to know you, the more I like you." And she doesn't know me at all. Just — it's just that, you know, we walk to classes together and she doesn't know me at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what you're saying — if she did know you, she'd find out that she really didn't like you.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, only because — I don't — I've certainly had no experience in this. I — I just don't know what — what sort of interpersonal relations are with other boys or with girls or with anybody. It seems — it seems very strange. Maybe it's because I was always alone and it's just a problem with experience, but it's not very — many relations just aren't satisfying. For instance I could — I can be very — I can be relatively pleased with my position at (bleep) now — the fact that I would always wish to have a lot of friends, you know, and smiled at everybody and have everybody smile at me. But, now I only have a couple, you know — a kid by the name Jim and Bob. But, as I said, they like each other better than they like me. And certainly their relationship with each other is much better than either of them have with me. And they are virtually my closest friends here at (bleep) and the only other person outside of that is Carl (sp?), who I see very rarely. And, although I could exist without talking too much with anybody else, I would find it very hard without them. And, yet — and yet, I'm using them, perhaps for the same reason that I used Betty, the other girl, as an ego incorporated, tension reduction system. Although, I found that now I'm much less self—conscious around them. I can join in on the conversation and, you know, taken up with part of the group. But, right now, I'm just not satisfied with the things were going. I want to form a relationship with somebody, and also, I want to find something within myself that I can say is of value. </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:14:46.2)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Because it seems to me that (long pause) — that a person just has to have something to live for. I mean, up to now, I can't say that (long pause) — why — I can't say my life has been anything. I haven't done anything with it, and I haven't found anything in it. It's just been a matter of existing. </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:16:06.8)</p>

<p>EDWARD: And up to one point in my life, it was the fact that — well (bleep), you know, is the most intelligent member of the family. </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:16:56.1)</p>

<p>EDWARD: And, well, now that that's gone, or, at least I feel it slipping away, what else is there? </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:17:48.7)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "In spite of the situation with my family, I had some status. But, now that I'm going to make the break, even that's gone", is that what you're feeling? And that's kind of frightening. </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:18:32.7)</p>

<p>EDWARD: I never expected to get this upset this time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you thought you had it all out of your system.</p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:19:33.1)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, maybe it was because last time — it was just something that I was deathly afraid of, and — and — </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:20:15.4)</p>

<p>EDWARD: — and — well, this time, maybe it's just more closely associated with — (pause) — my value of myself. </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:20:55.2)</p>

<p>EDWARD: My value was — of myself as a person.</p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:21:28.4)</p>

<p>EDWARD: And, well — </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:22:25.4)</p>

<p>EDWARD: And I don't think I'm upset about just the fact that I might not be intelligent, but simply that I, myself, at this point have nothing. Plus the fact that I feel that my family situation, with or without myself, is tragic. And, also — </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I'm kind of tragic too".</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, that, and — but, the fact that, since I am this way, what does the future have to offer me. It's very frightening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it's that old feeling — "Who am I? Where am I going? What am I going to do?", and I guess, partly too "Can I do it alone?"</p>

<p>EDWARD: But, not so much who am I, because I, you know, I feel that — well here I am, poor, screwed—up, tragic human being. You know — and I'd almost rather stay in the present situation than try to break out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Present situation?</p>

<p>EDWARD: You know, you know — being (inaudible at 0:25:30.6) to my family and having no friends outside of that, and staying here in (bleep) and, you know, making excuses and trying to figure out why I'm not getting the marks or — to be protected against the outside world, whether I feel now that maybe this is what life is in my own environ — in the situation that I find myself. That, well, maybe this is what life really is. Maybe my milieu is what real life is. And, maybe, outside of it, beyond the barrier, that there's a different world. Or, that — beyond the — there's a different world and a better world and a more enjoyable world. And, what I'm afraid of is that, instead of staying here, that situations will force me to leave and further will force me to join the Army and that, again, I'll be forced to finally do something after that — either do nothing for a few years, or finally start as some clerk or something in a department store. And, the fact that if I — if I don't get out now, my whole life will be just like walking down a corridor — a rather dark and dingy corridor with walls on both sides. And keep on walking and being unhappy until you finally get to the end and die. And I don't want this enclosed (inaudible at 0:29:42.1). What I want is to be able to range and widen far. Like on — maybe an open field on a sunny day. But, certainly, I wouldn't want to continue, in different situations, my life as it is now. But, I'd want to change. But, whether change is possible, I don't know. Perhaps this is the way life really is. Perhaps I can change — I'd always be me. Or, perhaps for external reasons, the change is impossible. But — </p>

<p>(Long pause at 0:31:02.6)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Except that I — I feel very depressed and everything I would touch or would be — a very depressing subject now — when a family — perhaps we started out as a (inaudible0:32:10.2) class family when my sister was alive, and now we hardly have anything, which means I wouldn't have enough money to join any of the fraternities if I wanted to, or meet any of the girls that I wanted to. And the fact that, here I am, 19 years old and I've never been out of (bleep), I've never been to see New York, I'll probably never get to see Europe or Asia or — I'm just so limited, so enclosed, and every summer I go down to the shore, and I work for my father and I can't break out. It's just a matter of existing. It's horrible. The fact that even if I move out from my family, maybe I really haven't moved out at all. Maybe they'll stay with me. But, I'm not quite sure exactly what it is I'm trying to say, but, these are some of my feelings on the subject. In fact, I would like to take a vocational test to see what I was — Isn't it great? They have tests that tell you how smart you are, what you can do — </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you really believe a test can do that?</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, if I took an IQ test and it said I had an IQ of 145 or 150, I would believe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm—hmm. But if it showed less than that? (0:34:16.8)</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, I'd say a test can't read — how can you measure a person with a bunch of numbers. What I'm really fishing around for is somebody to say "You're a great guy, (bleep), don't let it bug you. And even that won't be enough, because the doubt is still here. And, no — and now, like, what I'm going to do at the end of this semester? Wonder — well, the summers never bothering me much because that's always a very nice fantasy world that I can lose myself. All the bartenders are my friends, and we're all, you know, the type of — and there's nothing wrong with that. I like it. And this is the type of friendship that I seek up here to a certain extent. With these men, I can — we can like each other and we can pal around, and most of our talk can be trivial and sometimes we can get serious. And we can get serious about different subjects. And this is what I would like up here, to a certain extent. And, so — so, that's during summer. But, next year, what do I do if I don't go back to (bleep)? And all of — all these things I — you know, I'm so afraid that — you know, I just want to stay in my bed and listen to the radio, or do something like that, because — I haven't even signed up for the draft board. And if I'm going to go in the Army next year, it would be nice to do. But somehow I'm afraid to do that, and also afraid of the fact that most of the time I let a year go by and since I haven't done it — you know, I don't know what the laws of the government are. They might be (inaudible at 0:37:18.0), but — I'm afraid of that, and I'm also afraid for the other reason, I'm afraid to do things. And afraid that when I do something, people might think that I did it for a reason other than that which I did it for. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds rather involved.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, it's just doing something that — you know, or asking — if I ask a girl for a match, I would have the idea that, well, she would be thinking that "He's only asking for that match because he wants to make me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what you're thinking.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Yeah. And in a sense, they might be right. So probably (inaudible at 0:38:21.8). That's what I think they're thinking, and to a certain extent that is what I'm thinking. But, I'm afraid they know it. I guess, to a certain extent this makes me, you know, stand off from talking to girls and other people because, well, when I do something, they might think I had, you know, another reason — a bad reason for doing it. For asking them a question, or doing this or that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A bad reason.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Mm—hmm. Mainly because I probably still believe that trying to make a girl is bad. I should do it. And, certainly, if I find a girl, I want it to be sex, but I think I really need also something more, you know — maybe somebody to have faith in me, you know? But, then again, maybe that's not right because I'd maybe never really be satisfied with it, because if I couldn't think by myself that I was a worthwhile individual, nobody telling me that I am is going to make it so. And the fact that the — that I can, at times, think back on a situation in that way, saying well, what you're really doing is that, you know, you're just trying to have somebody, you know, say that you're a great guy, (bleep). It — just the inter—relationship between, you know, the drive for sex and dependency and that secondary process — you know, thinking back on — that's what really screws up the whole thing and, you know, any relationship with people. It just makes it almost so sickening and complicated that — and depressing. It's (inaudible at 0:41:18.2) and just, you know, shove it and say goodbye to the girl and forget about it and just stay by yourself. It's not the best thing — well, you know, at least you won't have that problem (bleep). </p>

<p>And another thing that I'm afraid of is that — the fact that the things that I want, and I would like to have, are very unrealistic. So the striving for them is unrealistic. The fact that a dependency need is unrealistic — of course, I'm just never going to get it and if there was just some way I could wipe it out and want something that possible to be obtainable, but — </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not quite sure what you mean by saying a dependency need is unrealistic. </p>

<p>EDWARD: Well, the fact that I'm looking for a mother, for the same kind of protective and, you know, love and secure love that a mother would give in boyfriends and girlfriends. This is unrealistic. It's a fantasy and I'd never be able to have it satisfied and, therefore, I wish there were some way that I could forget about it — repress it and have in my value system a need that could be fulfilled realistically. And the fact that maybe this feeling that I have that I don't like to be constricted and that I said I like to range far and wide, like a sunny day in an open field, maybe is just fantasies of a little child that could never be fulfilled. It sounds — it sounds too like — too much like "Well, I want to be the captain of a battleship", or "I want to be a fireman". (0:44:18.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's this feeling of going from one extreme dependency — an unrealistic dependency relationship to the other extreme of no dependency relationship.</p>

<p>EDWARD: Yeah, you know, to be the leader and the head — and this is what I need to be, maybe. And, as I said, it feels like the imaginations of, well, say, a 10 year old child who happens to be playing with his toy soldiers at the time. And the fact that, maybe the wish to get out and see the whole world and, you know, travel up and down the United States and Canada, and to do exotic things, rather than, you know, be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 and taking (bleep) home. I don't really want that, but maybe — maybe that's the only thing there can be since — since the other just does sound realistic. But, that I would ever be able to buy a motorcycle and be able to bum around the United States and meet people and be very satisfied, because I would be afraid was that — alright, I could possible get a motorcycle and maybe save up enough money to cycle around the United States, but I wouldn't have any — meet the interesting people or have any, say, exciting sorts of adventures, or even interesting adventures, or happiness, or adventures, because I'd just be — (0:46:06.1)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Afraid.</p>

<p>EDWARD: I'd be — I'd still be myself as I am now — afraid and I'd — as I said, it would just be like walking along with a hallway. You know, with a wall on either side — with — over your head. And so, you're right. On the one hand, I have a fear of being stuck right — you know, a little box. I mean — and having a dependency, and yet, on the other hand — just as unrealistic to have a whole range of things and not be unlimited to anything I wanted to do — and things that are impractical — fanciful — impossible. Although, in reality, you can say that, you know, well, if I really wanted to, I could become a ship captain and join the Merchant Marines. What it might be is that anything outside of my present situation seems unrealistic. I could conceive of myself of doing something else and being someplace else, but only in a very fanciful way. It was just a fantasy. Maybe this has become too real. Maybe I really could break out and do (inaudible at 0:47:47.2). And it would be a real thing. But at the moment I can't conceive realistically of life being any other way than what it is now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Might that be because you never really tried to see it any other way than you can see it right now?</p>

<p>EDWARD: I know — I know I have never seen it any other way. My family's done the same thing. It's been down the shore every year for the past 10 years, we stay in (bleep), we stay as (bleep), we go to 2nd Street Beach, we come home, every once in a while we go over to (bleep), we do that. During the winter, (bleep) goes to school, he comes back, he does his homework in the late afternoon, he watches television, he goes to bed, he gets up and he goes to school. And once in a while he goes to the movies. You know, he always takes the same bus, always sits in about the same seat. And — and now, even since I changed when I — I guess about 17 and I moved out of the house with my family and I moved upstairs. Even this, for the past — I guess it's been 2 years or three years now — even this becomes like a cycle of doing the same thing over again, and being constricted, and not seeing anything else. Although, it's very much — it's bigger and outside of the bar down there in (bleep), there isn't very much else to see. But, still, it's the same thing over again. It's — it just repeats itself. (0:49:41.5)</p>

<p>And maybe that's fine once in a while — repetition in life — the next day seems like the first. Or, the next day seems like the one before it. The fact that, when I got up today, I knew that it would, you know, the same as it was yesterday. I'd get up, I'd go to school, I'd see a few people that I knew, I'd say hello to some of them, others I would talk with for a couple minutes. You know, I would go to classes and then — well, for dinner I'd go out with Bob and we'd eat. And then I'd go to the (bleep) and I'd practice. But, I wouldn't be happy there either. You know, I want more excitement. That's why if there was a war, at least I could be sure that each day would probably be different from the next — or interesting. Maybe I could get task—involved or something, which might carry through with my — that could pay off, to be become task—involved in my work that I chose to do. That could pay off. I'd make each new day different and maybe even, you know, my — the whole conception of what it is to be happy is unrealistic. These — you know, it's hard to decide exactly what reality is. What it seems to be and what it is. Whether it is anything but what it seems to be. (0:51:59.1)</p>

<p>(Audio becomes very distorted)</p>

<p>I mean, maybe that's why I decided to go into philosophy, because I knew there was a lot that I didn't know and I wanted to find some answers. And (inaudible at 0:51:59.1), but I find there are (inaudible at 0:52:27.8) questions involved in philosophy. You know, the (inaudible at 0:52:32.5). And that's another thing, when — which is very disconcerting now. Right when I thought I was so intelligent, now I have now no knowledge of art and no knowledge of current affairs. My vocabulary is lacking and I'm ignorant in so many fields, and yet I seem to be too lazy to (inaudible at 0:53:09.7), or even that interested in art. Although, if there was some way that I could have knowledge fed into me by (inaudible at 0:53:21.1), I would take every (inaudible at 0:53:22.6) they ever put out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess part of what you "re saying is not so much because I really want to know, but because of how other people then be able to — would think of me if I (inaudible at 0:53:41.4).</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything alright?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything alright?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I just - I came from downtown. I didn't time my trip very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's OK. Well, we might have to end a little bit early.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We might have to end a little bit earlier than - I mean because of - you know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's alright. (chuckles) How's your week going?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Better. I did the - I don't know what you ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your list?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I did a list but also I did the ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Practicing your rational ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Practicing my ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your rational belief, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My belief, yeah. And I do that a lot. I try to do it all the time. I forgot, obviously, sometimes but I think it helps ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So which one are you practicing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually, I modified it a lot because I needed it to change and (inaudible at 0:00:46.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's OK. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was the one that we made that was like even though I would prefer for people to do things the way that I would like them to do them, if they don't, I can accept it. And I changed it. So like even if people don't behave, act, do, say (Therapist laughs) - and then I was like if things don't go the way I prefer them to go - I had to change it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. So you're becoming more rational.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope so. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this week I felt a lot more rational. Obviously, I mean I made some mistakes but I tried also not to beat myself up about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried - well ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're human?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I'm - you can call me more human. I'm not sure. Yeah, I don't know. I can't think of any specific examples. Well, actually, this doesn't have to do with me but Fernï¿½o had like a meltdown over something and went crazy and was like - not that he went crazy but it was kind of like when I act irrational; it was like the equivalent. So then I was kind of like, OK, so maybe I'm not that abnormal because other people do it. You know? So I felt good about that. It sounds really bad because - whatever.</p>

<p>But just in the sense that he seems more human to me. You know what I mean? Like - because he's so good at - he notices when I'm being irrational. Like the same things we talk about, he points them out. I don't know - first of all, I know that he's gone to therapy before and I have a feeling if it wasn't the same type of psychotherapy it must have been very similar; like the therapist had some relationship to REBT.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. That'd be really interesting. In Portugal I don't know about ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know but what he says, it's like he's reading (Therapist laughs, inaudible at 0:02:31.1). I mean you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So sometimes I think like, "God, this guy has it all together." He never gets annoyed or irrational about anything. So this is an example. So - not that it made me feel good but I was just like, "OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It means you realize that other people have the same issues that you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not like - right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you didn't go screaming and running away from him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I was kind of just like, "OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you weren't like, "I'm breaking up with you because you're so irrational."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Uh-uh. Yeah, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he might not do that to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think - well, I wouldn't say that I've completely accepted that that isn't a possibility but, yeah, I mean ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may never fully accept that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But as long as you can dispute it and challenge it and not get yourself upset about it every time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it would be healthy to just have an attitude, "I can do whatever the hell I want and my boyfriend is always going to be there for me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And then today, actually, we were supposed to meet at Target at like 5:00 and he was late - which it doesn't bother me because I'm always late; like for normal things. But then he calls and he calls from a classmate's phone. So that was 20 minutes later than we were supposed to meet, so I just assumed he was still at school and then I got really annoyed because I was like, "I'm fucking sitting here for 20 minutes waiting." It's half-raining, whatever. So I got a little snippy. And then he told me - he's like, "No, actually I'm just outside of the train," and I was like, "Well, fuck." You know? I just assumed this stupid thing. [0:04:08.8]</p>

<p>And at first I was like, "You're such an idiot. Why did you get annoyed? You should have asked him." And then I was like, "You know what? Whatever. Whatever."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's not the biggest deal. It's not awful, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And lesson learned. So now you can say, "Oh, maybe I was overreacting and I can kind of control that in the future."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would have been more helpful? Sorry, I'm going to just get some ChapStick on my lips.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that, when they're like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be something more helpful to think; you know, next time he calls and says he's running late?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the problem, actually, is that I don't know why ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it wasn't that he was running late; it was that he was running late and didn't have a good excuse for it, I guess at that point, because he was still at school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there are a couple of issues that I would like to bring up today but one of them is that - oh, I didn't tell you this. So today I subbed; I was a substitute teacher for the first time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so the job worked out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that job hasn't - it's definite. That job ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, this is the subbing that you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that job is definite and should come up right after Thanksgiving. But yeah, I subbed at this other school. It's a woman I've known since I was really young and they had opening today, so I did that. And it was interesting. I - the good thing is - OK, it was really - it wasn't the worse thing in the world, by any means. They told me it was a pretty good class. I mean I had several but the classes in general were good. But some of the kids were so bad that I can't ...[0:05:36.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What grade is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were seniors in high school - that I can't even imagine what a bad class is like at a public school. I really can't. Like, "Fuck you, suck my dick." Not to me but to each other. Like nonstop. And I know that this is a possibility but it's just like once you're in this situation and you kind of don't know the best way to handle it, you start to feel like, "OK, I don't know what ..." You know? So it was interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is that kind of changing your mind about teaching?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not changing my mind but I really need to - it's not the teaching that I'm worried about. I think I'm a pretty good teacher just from the experience that I have. I think that it's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Classroom management skills.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's that. It's like I know I can improve the teaching with Finn if I get in or another university or practice, whatever. But the disciplining, the classroom management, the control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that not something you can learn?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, totally but it's scarier to me. Because I just feel like how do you control 30 wild kids? Some classes are fine; there's one that once in a while acts out. But one of the classes, they were all bad and there was just really ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, do you think that your inability to kind of do that with this class today is a reflection of your classroom management skills or perhaps the classroom management skills that were going on before? [0:07:03.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean? You were kind of walking into a lion's den but it wasn't your class.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and to be honest with you, I was really lucky because today I filled in for an English teacher and he had one ESL class, which I was really excited about, and it was the only class I really liked out of all of them. So I felt better about that. I actually helped the kids with something. They seemed a little bit more eager to learn. I don't know. Maybe it's just because I'm biased and I - whatever. But I felt good about that.</p>

<p>But yeah, I don't think it's impossible. And anyway, my mom actually works in a really bad school and she says there are some really excellent teachers there that are really good at classroom management and she said she'd ask them if I could observe them one day, just to see. I'm just curious how they do it without being, "Fuck you," you know, and going crazy and throwing chairs. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a whole skill set. I'm a school psychologist, as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I do work in a school for children who are emotionally disturbed. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You told me. Yeah, and that's like a - that's special ed, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, yeah. But even the teachers there, which they don't all have great training in behavioral management but I think it is something that you can learn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perhaps schools don't spend enough time on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you sound like you're willing to go out there and observe and watch and they have trainings and they even do - they probably all have some [kind of trainings here] (ph) at some point for more professionals on ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe not here - this is more IBT - but behavioral and classroom management is - lot of psychologists, that's their whole focus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah, I'd really like to learn some tactics, you know? Because - and again, they were not, by any means, the worst class that they could have been but it's just the behavior is like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what stopped you from ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had two girls kissing each other; like making out. (chuckles) Like come on, it's a classroom. It's like they have no respect. (Therapist laughs) Whatever. But anyway, it was a good experience and the school was a decent school and - I don't know. I mean I think I have more positive feelings than negative. The negative are just more like surprise; like something I'm not used to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But do you think you could get used to it? [0:09:11.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean [I'm fine] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you will learn the skills?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I could. Definitely. But anyway, I don't know what I was saying.</p>

<p>Oh, so I went home after that and Fernï¿½o was at school and I saw he left his cell phone at home. So I don't know why I got twisted and I was just like, "Now he left his cell phone home. He's not going to be able to call me when he leaves the train." And it's not the fact that he needs to call me all the time but it was that - then I started thinking, "Well now, what if he's running late and he can't call me or what if he can't come or what if his friend tells him, ï¿½No, go to this store.'" It's really stupid. This guy is not going to tell me to meet at 5:00 and then just ditch me. He's not some random guy. (Therapist chuckles) You know what I mean? And it's like this is - so that's why I think I got more annoyed. Then he called me at 5:15 instead of 5:00 or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you assumed he was just leaving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You assumed he was just leaving [because he was able to make the call] (ph). He was ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah, and I was like, "Well, he doesn't have a cell phone, so ..." - and I was thinking all before that that something bad was going to happen. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you annoyed once you already saw the phone left behind or were you just anxious?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think anxious. I wasn't annoyed. I was just like, "Oh, OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were like, "What a fucking idiot"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was just - and then when I got there, it was exactly at 5:00; it was exactly on time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think one of the reasons why I'm making an excuse for myself why I'm late all the time - not today; not for this or anything - but for meetings, I don't like to wait for people but somehow I think it's OK when people wait for me. I don't know how that - you know what I mean? It makes me so uncomfortable to wait on a street corner for someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's uncomfortable about the waiting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I start thinking, "What if they don't come? What if I'm waiting here 45 minutes? What if this guy over here talks to me?" It's weird. I guess it's like a social anxiety type of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can't stand - is it more the awfulizing; like "What if they never come? I'll be here forever. That weirdo might talk to me" or is it more like "This is so annoying and frustrating. I can't stand it"? Probably both. [0:11:20.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both, yeah. I think both. A little bit of both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is one stronger than the other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Trying to think of what I think. I think I think more, "This is really annoying." I don't know. I think it's equal. I think it's equal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they're both what we could work on in the future. It's like frustration tolerance and catastrophizing, which is always kind of (inaudible at 0:11:47.4) in your nature.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah, frustration tolerance. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Well, did anything major happen to you or do you want to get to work on the list?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing major happened. I was actually really - I felt really good about the week, especially in comparison to the week before (Therapist chuckles) where I felt like I was just a mess. I felt like it was good and I kept trying to repeat the beliefs. Even when I went to sleep at night, I would try to repeat them, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Great. You're an excellent student.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really tried. I mean of course it wasn't possible all the time but I think the little bit I did do it, it helped a little. I don't know. And I felt a little bit ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is the book going? Are you done with it or ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I haven't been reading it, actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That might be something - just like repeating the things before bed, it might be good to just read a chapter before bed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It's in the bottom of my closet and every time I open it I see it and I'm like "Fuck." But I do like it. I don't know why I'm not reading it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not punishment. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know what's the problem. But I will. But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially in the week off that we have in between. Because next week, remember, is Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we're closed Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [It's already] (ph) Thanksgiving already.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. Freaks me out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Already.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but - and I didn't do anything with Fernï¿½o; anything that ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The running or the ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just that in - I actually think - the more that I think about it, I don't think there's anything that - I don't know. Maybe I'm just trying ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get out of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. But I don't think - I can't think of anything that would make me feel - I think running would actually be a good one. I think I would feel ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be the most, but it would be a challenge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It would be a little. A little, yeah. A little challenge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'm not trying - there's the difference, whatever they call, like graduate exposure in psychology and then there's flooding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gradual exposure is like if someone has a phobia of dogs or like - first show a little picture of a dog. You know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you feel what a dog would feel like and then you bring in like - the last one is like bring in a big mastiff, you know, (inaudible at 0:13:44.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And flooding would just be open the door and there are like 20 dogs (laughing, inaudible) or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think it would be like a little thing that ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be gradual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't seem like much when I think about it but I think, in the end, it would be a little bit challenging. So, yeah. The other thing I was thinking of is ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah, maybe putting you two in a marathon together or a competitive iron man challenge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why this is embarrassing to me but I'm a little concerned - I think I'm concerned about his judgments of my writing in English, which is interesting because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has he seen your writing yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but when I wrote my essay for Finn, which I actually thought was pretty good - it was decent; I mean it was OK - he wanted to see it and I put it off and put it off and I put it off. And I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he ever see it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He didn't. Well, actually, he didn't because my dad locked me out of his computer and that's the one I had been writing on, so I couldn't give it to him. But it was also just another good excuse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you still locked out of that computer? [0:14:38.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I have to write this essay for the teaching fellows ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I'm kind of like every time I leave it out, like my notes, when I'm doing my rough draft or whatever, I take it back. I leave it out because I'm like, "Maybe if I just leave it out ..." whatever, and then I take it back because I'm like - it's really weird. I don't know why ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is that something that you would like to be able to feel comfortable ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's another thing like the running; it would be like a small step. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be a better one because that's something that you're actually worried about him judging your level of confidence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you're much more protective of than probably your skills at running.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's probably higher on your list of things that you need to do well and things that you don't care to do well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Let me tell you my list. I actually did one earlier in the week and then I did another today just to see ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if they matched up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a good exercise. Because definitely ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm really working hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) I know, I see. Showing off now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Probably but ...] (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I need to (inaudible at 0:15:35.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So first I - yeah, so "Things I'm not ..." - no, this is my second one. "Things I'm Not Successful At."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, can I take a look? Or you want to read them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You want to look at it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes I'm more visual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright, so this is my first. Do you want to see the first one and then - this is the first one. There's probably like "Buy toilet paper," whatever and then (inaudible at 0:15:55.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think they're very different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think you should look.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, let me take a look.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I doodle a lot, by the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's OK, I don't judge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, "Things That Would Challenge Me" and "Things That ..." So the first two is that and then ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've got that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So hold it like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that. OK. So "Things That ..." So this is "Things That I Don't Really Care About Doing That Well" or "Things That I Should Do Well"? Because I think we had ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the first one - the first list on the other page, where your finger is, are things I don't think I'm good at. And then the other one is things that - no wait. Oh, oh, that was the list for - sorry (inaudible at 0:16:34.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, sorry I'm [confusing you] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wrote a lot of lists.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) You can read it to me if you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, I like doing lists. OK, fine. (Therapist laughs) Ooh, sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's OK. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Things I'm Not Successful At." So I have Portuguese - practicing Portuguese.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this is something ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wrote "practicing" ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is - well, you wrote - your list is actually a little different from what I had assigned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had thought that we were working on - and I'm sure we can work it out [while here] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But "Things That I Must Be Successful At" ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was the second part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was not - I'm not successful and then things that I must be successful. Do you want to hear must be successful? I have that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, I thought it was going to be "Things That I Must Be Successful At" and "Things That I Don't Care as Much to Be Successful At."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright, so do you want me to read "I Must Be Successful At"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, I have that. I have relationships with people - including sister, friends, boyfriend, parents, whatever; school work; work and jobs in general; having people like me - but that goes with relationships; making people happy also goes with relationships to me; dancing - I don't know why. I don't know why I wrote this at the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like club dancing or like ballet dancing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think I'm confident about my club dancing but it's the more structured dancing, like salsa or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Do you do that? Oh, like - OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like those kinds of ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ballroom dancing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't do that. No. [0:17:57.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But Fernï¿½o suggested we go and I got really anxious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is he good at it because he's Portuguese?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know why he suggested it. It's really weird but whatever. Going out and socializing - like meeting new people, social. I guess that's kind of related to relationships. Speaking Portuguese; writing; being healthy - like I'm not ever. I feel like I'm never concentrating on that, whatever. And that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So that's a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And let me see if I have a new list that's different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing - oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's more - oh, I do have a new one. So it's the same: career; school; relationships; friendships; my appearance. That's a new one that wasn't on the other list. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Do you thing that's not as strong as the other ones or ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that I've learned, this week, that it's just as strong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting that that's not - first, I'd say a lot of women would have that like - that maybe ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if he didn't think about it because it's a more naturalized ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I think maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, that I'm (inaudible at 0:19:07.9) all the time and that's just like, "Oh, of course. That's how ..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think it's probably that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And that's something that - that's probably going to be very difficult to dispute because that's - I'm sure I have that, too. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No. But the thing is that what I feel is like - I feel sometimes like, especially lately, is that I don't have the same resources that I did before. I don't have the same clothes, I don't have the same - because I had to get rid of so much stuff when I, whatever, was deported and whatever. So I don't feel like I'm able to look the way I want to look, at least with clothes. And then ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, what happened when you were deported; to your clothes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I only brought back, in August, the stuff that I needed for summer. And then, since I wasn't able to go back, Fernï¿½o had to throw out ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it's all in Portugal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fernï¿½o had to throw out all of my stuff, basically. I mean not all but a really - I mean (inaudible at 0:20:01.9) wearing hats.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Why didn't he keep it and send it to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's so expensive ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I was like - and I mean the stuff isn't that nice, so I was like it's not worth it. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's like cheap crap. So, because I'm not - I don't have the ability - and I really like clothes and fashion, to a certain extent. I like putting things together. I like - and the fact that I don't have the ability to do that makes me feel shitty. And then just the fact that I told you I gained a little bit of weight - it's not even that much but it's enough to make me feel like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Different, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm not exercising. I don't have a gym membership or anything. A lot of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. So there's a lot - there are a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what are the things that are not important for you? Because there were the other things that you're not successful at, which was like the running. Are those things - and cooking; you said that's not important to you. [0:20:53.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, let me look at that list because there are probably a lot of things on that list that aren't important to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The cooking; like cooking, for example. Driving. I don't drive. I don't know how to drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't care about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not feeling embarrassed about not being able to drive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cooking, the same. Organizing; it's like something I've accepted I'm not good at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably still try to be organized; like you have a list right here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's about as organized as it gets. The rest is not organized.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you still come to your appointments on time - or generally on time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Generally speaking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you make your appointments. You must be writing some things down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just are not like crazy anal about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't beat yourself up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is, I'm clean; I'm just not organized; whereas Fernï¿½o, for example, is organized but not clean. You know what I mean? So there's that. I put finance jobs because I think I've accepted the fact that it's just not my thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though - whatever. Running - because I'm not a great runner. I might like to once in a while but I'm not really good at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK. So what do you think the differences in both of these lists are? I mean I think we get the basic gist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that - OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just because ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) In case you want to know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you tell yourself, as opposed to the ones that you must be successful at? What do you say about that? And what do you say to yourself for the ones that you're not successful at and you've accepted it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, let me think about that. Like cooking, for example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still try? Or like if you had to cook something; like if you wanted to make Fernï¿½o dinner, you wouldn't make Hamburger Helper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might? OK. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'd probably make pasta; that's easy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you'd try. You'd try and do something that you can do. [0:22:47.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, maybe I should put cooking on the list of things that I must be successful at. (chuckling) I don't know. And the thing is that I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a shitty cook but I also don't - I don't know. It's like the Portuguese thing. I don't practice, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But here's something that I've actually just noticed just now. The difference between the things that you must be good at and the things that you said you accepted that you're not good at, the difference is if you stop trying and you say, "Aw, it doesn't matter. I'm not going to even try," but if you're going to exert any effort at all, then you have to be perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's more like it, I think. It's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the running, "Whatever, I never do it. It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The cooking, "I can just - I live in Chicago. I can get takeout every night. It's not a big issue."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or "I'll find someone to cook for me." But if you had to cook a little bit and it came out really shitty, I bet you'd start practicing cooking a lot more and starting getting ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You even started to get annoyed just thinking about it, "Maybe I should be good at cooking."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what if you're just half-assed? Why is that so hard for you? If you just - not half-ass it. Put in a substantial amount of effort and, if you're not successful, just say, "I'm a work in progress." [0:24:01.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. That's really weird. It's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what would it be like to say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is I don't think it's me that I have to convince. I can accept that - I think, I think. But it's then that I start thinking about what do you think about me because of that. And because I can't control the way you think about it, I start feeling bad about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what if I think ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, I'm not that great at cooking but now you think I'm really shitty a cook and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think you're lazy and I judged you for saying you cook Hamburger Helper. So what if ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like - yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, I'm kidding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if I think you're a lazy cook? You're lazy. You don't take care of your boyfriend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He flew all the way here to be with you and you can't even cook him a nice dish?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can't you put a little effort in? More than pasta?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what you think that I think; that ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or the things that I'm saying are things that you think to yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or like, "Oh, you made ..." - yeah, that or like, "Oh, you made him pasta and that's all you could do? That's the best you could do?" You know, like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if I thought that of you? What if I thought badly about you? Why does that ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I know it doesn't matter but it matters somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why does it matter? What are you saying to yourself? Are you saying, "Aw, whatever. Christy can think whatever I want with the cooking. Cooking is not that important to my overall happiness in life"? Or you're saying, "Christy should think that I'm good at everything?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Christy needs to know that I can do anything that I want and she shouldn't judge me"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think, "How dare she judge me?" ever or is it more like, "She shouldn't judge me. If she judged me, that's awful and I'm terrible"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think "How dare she?" is in certain situations. It's not as general as like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's more like, "If Christy thinks badly of me, then I'm such a piece of shit."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why does me thinking badly about your cooking make you a piece of shit? [0:26:15.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cooking, as of five, ten minutes ago was something you didn't even care about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But now that I tell you it's important to me, you care. Are you life desires so flimsy that they are affected by my every breath? You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know. It's weird. I think it's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aren't you important?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like a weird confidence issue I think that I have; a huge confidence issue, I think. And it's related to this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why - OK. Maybe we should reverse this. OK? I feel like if you're judging me about my food, then I'm a piece of shit. Dispute it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs, pause) I mean what does it matter what I think about your cooking?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I respect you and you should think good things about me and not think that I'm lazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) This is so (inaudible at 0:27:31.1). That's exactly the way that I think. But so what if I think that you're lazy or not a good cook?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you think that I'm lazy, then I feel really shitty about myself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Oh, God. Well, why do you feel shitty about yourself? Why do I make you feel shitty?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you have to think that I do things well or I can't stand it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices, inaudible at 0:27:56.5)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't stand it if you don't think that I can do everything well. I want you to think that - you have to think that I can do everything well. (pause, whispering) Dispute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I'm thinking of myself thinking this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You must think that I do everything right, Laura.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But why must I think that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you have to and that's what I want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But just because you want that, does that mean that I have to think that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I want it and if you don't, then I feel like shit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Oh, God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you were on the right track.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But - I'm getting really confused.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want it. I demand that ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But why do you want it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because if you don't think that I'm good, then I'm nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to say to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I think that was a little hard but - I was getting off track. (Client chuckles) But here's the thing, I think you were really good. Just because you want it that way, why must it be so? And can you please everyone, Laura?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, if you can't please everyone, why are you trying so hard to please just each individual person? I'm not even pleased. You don't even know that me thinking you're a good cook is pleasing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why must everyone think good things? Can everyone in the world think that you're wonderful at everything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's not what you tell yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everyone has to see me as I want to be seen; just perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if everyone saw your imperfections all the time? What if you had to walk around with a big sign that says, "I'm terrible at cooking?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I'm a terrible cook."</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is that I do think this way and there's no excuses for it. It's true. But I think what I do is if I say, "OK, so now you think I'm a bad cook," and say everyone thinks I'm bad at cooking, then it's like, "Well, what else am I bad at that everybody else is going to notice?" and it's like piling on of all these things that I'm not good at; that it's like, "OK, well you're shitty."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why can't it just be that one thing? [0:30:42.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why can't it ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then I have running or driving or ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this is the only thing that I have just noticed. Do you think it's healthy for you to say ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not healthy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And first of all, very few people are going to be like, "Laura, you're a really shit cook." (Client chuckles) Right? They might ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the truth is, again, like the Portuguese, my cooking is probably competent. You know? But for me, it's not enough. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not (inaudible at 0:31:11.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) It was as of today. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I miss cooking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it was OK with you as of two hours ago when you came in because it was on your other list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well that's because I never do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But are you going to let what's important to me dictate what's important to you? Like even if I did think that everyone should be good at cooking and you aren't good at cooking, why would that feel bad to you? Why do you care so much what I think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you could say something like, "It would be nice if everyone saw me positively at everything I do. But that's probably not going to happen."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. That's not realistic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That can't - that's not realistic. "I need to accept myself."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how about, "I'm the only one who can judge me"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or "I'm the only one whose judgments really matter about me"? "Be nice if everyone judged me positively but, in the end, I'm the only one that matters."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes I think it's - like I judge people and it's not because - like I don't want to be like that. And I don't even consciously do it. But I think because I'm so judgmental sometimes towards others, that there's no other way to be towards myself. You know? It's not like I say, "Oh, Christy's a piece of shit. She can't cook." It's not like that. It's other things; you know, like - I don't know. [0:32:59.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More like, "She really should have straightened her hair this morning" and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No. I don't know. Like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone is on the subway and they're reading a really shitty book. Are you like, "Oh, what an idiot?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think honestly - to be honest, there are things like that; it's constant judgments. And there are times when I catch myself and I'm like, "What are you saying?" I feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To me, that statement isn't good because your judgments aren't the only ones that matter. Maybe that's the opposite of what you should be thinking. I mean you are the only one who can really judge yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, of course. But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or the only one whose judgments of yourself should matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe we need to stop appraising everybody by one thing or a few things. (inaudible at 0:33:43.9) a Glamour magazine. I'll tell you something. When I fly I always buy like really - I got them in the mail. It's not my own. (chuckles) I totally read it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you got it. That's really cool. That's fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. (inaudible at 0:33:53.8) (chuckles) I was like, "Oh."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Free magazine." But when I fly, I buy really shitty magazines and really cheesy stuff because I'm reading psychology stuff all the time and it kills my brain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when I fly, I do actually have that "I wonder who's judging me that I'm reading this Cosmo about 20 sexy things you can do in bed."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And the truth is, someone could be judging me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? But I'd rather read the magazine than worry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I don't care. But you know, you see someone on the train - again, you might be like, "Ugh, why is she reading that crap? That girl is such an idiot." But you don't really know anything about her. You just know that she's reading that magazine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. No. And that's why when I catch myself, I immediately say that. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you appraise yourself on a few things, too; not looking at yourself holistically either and ignoring all the things that you do well or do competently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not satisfied with competence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to be perfect in everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So before you can accept people holistically, I mean I think you need to accept yourself holistically; that "I'm not a bad cook. I'm a person who is not great at cooking but I have a lot of other skills."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right, yeah. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I'm OK at cooking but not really good at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Or my Portuguese isn't flawless but I have a lot of other things that I'm good at and if I keep working at it, it could get better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But how does telling yourself, "This person is ..." - when you tell yourself, "Oh, what an idiot for not calling me on time or for not coming here on time," how does that help your relationship with that person? And does that make you feel better about yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, does it on the train? It might.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Because like I said, sometimes it's so - like it's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just automatic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I don't even realize it sometimes I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe your homework for this week could be to start noticing yourself when you're judging people ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and then change it to something more rational like, "Yeah, they might be reading a stupid book but there's a lot of things I don't know about them and they could be a decent person." [0:36:14.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "And everyone is entitled to their own opinion."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, totally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "My judgment is not the only judgment that matters."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "And I can accept people who have different values and opinions."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you accept - are you liberal? Are you conservative? What would you say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very liberal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very liberal? What if you had to go to a Republican convention or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you get infuriated reading the Chicago Tribune?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the Tribune but I get infuriated by some things, yeah. Sometimes, actually, the Tribune. But not really infuriated but just annoyed because I think it's stupid. You know, I think some things are stupid. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And OK, but people should kind of have the same opinions you hold and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think a lot of people get infuriated reading the Tribune.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, it's true, it's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But does it make you so mad that you would go through your day - what if - you know, would you get so mad that it would bother you all day, thinking about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think it would be good to notice the judgments that you make on other people and kind of argue and dispute them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the more you argue with that, maybe you can see that these things extend to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know? If this person is OK and they can be bad at speaking Portuguese in the classroom, then I'm OK for doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're any closer to speaking Portuguese to Fernï¿½o? [0:38:00.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. I've said words in front of him, which is - I never - the thing is I've also gotten to the point where I've held out on it for so long that once I do say something, it's going to be like a big event, like (gasps) and I hate that feeling; for anything - surprise parties, whenever I'm the center of attention. So I also dread that aspect of it. But I said some words and I tried to - I don't know. And that's like - it's not difficult but - it is a little difficult because I'm a little worried if he's going to be like, "What? I didn't understand your accent." You know? Obviously he's not but - so a little, little, little, little bit I think. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, making steps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think steps for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I feel like we were a bit all over the place today, this session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you feel like we got anything accomplished? (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I felt really all over the place today, in the past few days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, maybe when you come into session, we'll have something specific that you want to talk about so that we can be more productive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or else I'm easily distracted as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that - yeah, I'm going to look for my judging other people this week because I think that could be helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then see - you know, try to relate it back to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then when you - after you've made the dispute, see if that dispute holds true in your life as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also think I'm going to try the writing the essay and having Fernï¿½o read it because I'm actually - even saying it makes me nervous. [0:39:33.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But how do you think it's going to feel after you finally show it to him? Do you think you'll still have that anxiety and the self-loathing or do you think you'll feel like, "Whatever, that wasn't actually that bad"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know because I feel like I need, I require a lot of praise and whatever when I do these things; like in a certain way, too. And he's not very demonstrative. He's - well, he is. He shows how he feels in the way he acts but he's not very verbal with it; like "Oh, baby, [oh what]." He's not like that. So I feel like if even he liked it, he wouldn't necessarily say, "This is great."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think that's something very interesting, too, that you need so much praise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Therapist laughs) I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I almost always (inaudible at 0:40:23.6) and be like, "Hmm."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, right? But that's the thing is - I think the thing is he very well could just be like, "I think you should describe this more," or very just - not "It's good," not "It's bad"; just like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Giving you feedback.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's not the type of person, even if he thought it was the best thing he's ever read, to say that or to really go on about it. He's just not like that. So I think ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what if he doesn't give you the positive feedback?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'll feel shitty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't know how he would actually appraise it. You just said he's not the type of person to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but - I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I bet you're not even likely to hear him be like "Oh, it's good" and then he'll give the criticism because all you're hear is the criticism.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I won't hear, "It's good."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he didn't say, "Oh, it's good, it was wonderful."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be like he was just saying that because he wants to say the criticism and he needs something to ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what if it wasn't perfect and he actually gave you some help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. Yeah. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's why I think it would be difficult.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you say to yourself - if he was just like, "I think it's good but you should do this and this and this," what could you think instead of getting upset? Well, you're probably thinking - are you thinking the "How dare he?" or are you thinking "I'm such a piece of shit?" Which one comes first?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe like "How dare he? He doesn't even speak English." Not really. But maybe a little bit, probably; a little bit like "How dare he?" But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, then what can you say instead? [0:42:12.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I would like for him to have loved and think that my essay is the best essay he's ever read, that if he doesn't, it's OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even if he doesn't shower you with praise, he's probably just trying to be helpful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "He has my best interest at heart"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that help you not get angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I don't know if I'd get angry. I wouldn't get angry with him, at least. I would just more be like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should have never showed it to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like "Yeah, I'm a shitty writer. See, I'm a shitty writer" or "Look ..." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more like inward anger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Even if Fernï¿½o has some feedback for me, I don't have to feel shitty about myself. He's trying to help me and make me the best writer I can be"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it doesn't even mean I'm a bad - I mean it doesn't mean anything. For example - I don't know what time it is but quickly, if we have to go - my friend Maria, who we were in Portugal together, she's applying to this program in Lisbon. She's in Chicago now but she's applying to a program in Lisbon. She had to write an essay in Portuguese. Her Portuguese is great. I mean it's like perfect. And she wrote an essay and sent it to him and I was nervous for Maria, for his feedback, because he's a native speaker; so obviously - and maybe they write differently. You don't know. [0:43:51.3]</p>

<p>So he's basically - he literally is rewriting the essay and sending it back to her. And he never said to me, "It's badly written. It's really well-written," anything. He just said, "Oh, I'm rewriting it in my own words to maybe help her." And that's the way he is. He could have easily said to me, "This is really not that good" or "It's not the way we write" or "I really like it but ..." But he doesn't - he's like that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And anything he has to say, you can say, "OK, you're entitled to your opinion," but if you still like yours better, you don't have to listen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. Yeah. And she actually sent the same essay to her ex-boyfriend who's in Lisbon and the ex-boyfriend did the exact same thing, which leads me to believe it's a writing style issue. And she just said, "Yeah, I'd like to see Fernï¿½o's (ph) comments, too, because then I can decide which I like the best and then ..." and I just feel like I would be like (breathes hard). You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she's taking the advice as something helpful and not as a criticism of her entire being.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a specific criticism of a specific writing piece that she once wrote once. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead of it being a grand criticism of Laura's writing as a whole and her whole person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe when you hear criticism and a judgment, if it's specific; if you can understand it as - just again, like "That girl is reading a bad book. Perhaps she has poor taste in trashy novels."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? "Fernï¿½o is giving me advice on this essay; this one essay that perhaps I did not do to the best of my ability" or "He has better ability to help me." [0:45:35.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that be helpful if it was a more specific criticism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. And I think, actually, it would be helpful for me to discuss this in-depth, like further, because now that I'm thinking about it, any time Fernï¿½o criticizes me for something, I get really upset about it; as if he's criticizing my entire being.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being. Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's a problem because I should be able to differentiate between criticizing someone as a person and criticizing a specific thing that's irrelevant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don't - this is what you're going to practice for the week, right? Just criticizing an exact thing and then saying, "OK, that's their right," but not judging them as a whole person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Of other people, you mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:46:24.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can write down in your book when you notice and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me write this down, actually, because I know I'm going to forget. I didn't sleep last night because I was too nervous about the teaching today, so thank you. OK. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And notice when you're making judgments around you and try not to make them holistically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And notice your irrational demands and try to make the connection to how that can help you stop criticizing yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so it'll be like a three-step process, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, sorry. OK, notice when making judgments of others ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So first be like, "Oh, shit, I'm judging them." Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and not make them holistically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, try to be like "Oh, OK" and change it to a specific criticism. And what was the second part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Specific criticism. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know either. Kind of like notice your irrational demand. That's what it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Notice your irrational demand in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Irrational?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Hopefully try to change it to rational.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And try to relate it to your life. You know? I know that's a lot but I think you'd probably do it real fast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But now we are definitely out of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK? So have a wonderful - oh, this is two weeks, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

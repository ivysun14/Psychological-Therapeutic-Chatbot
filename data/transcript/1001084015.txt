<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right [PATIENT NAME] how are you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm doing okay, I had little spells where I got depressed and stuff but, um, not as bad as I was.  I had had my two days to where I was just so down, my legs were cramping and hurting, depressed about my weight and everything, but uh as the days went by they have got, seemed to get better and since I've went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and we started going through what we're going through and test results and stuff and getting tests I'm starting to feel okay about it and everything about that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] saw you today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, so I'm excited, she did blood work and x-rays and then I come back on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah uh-huh, yeah and so, uh, I ended up getting x-rays and blood work and I come back and then she's checking my thyroids and cholesterol and all that.  My blood pressure is up a little, but she said that she's not going to treat it right now because she thinks it's due to my weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And Effexor too probably, you are on high doses of Effexor, that probably could have warned.  You used to have that problem before or no?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much was the blood pressure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh one something over eighty-eight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll check with her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay and, uh, and then she is going to get paperwork from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] about my vascular disease because it's been giving me lots of trouble.  So she's wanting to figure out that.  Uh, she told me to make sure I bring my medicines the next time I come and everything.  Uh, the only thing that hasn't, I'm on 10 mg Restoril.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thirty mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh 30 mg yeah I'm sorry, 30 mg and stuff and it's, when I get to sleep, I mean it, it really makes you go to sleep fast, but then I wake up still in the middle of the night and then I'm, it's hard for me to get back to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many hours of sleep you get?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Last night I got about four and a half, but I think a lot to do is if I can get my legs and knees to ease up cause that wakes me up in pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Pain wakes you up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, and I try to take Ibuprofen it doesn't help.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are your mood swings?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lamictal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wonderful, my husband said that's a miracle drug.   Um, I handle it, especially with my daughter and her situation and everything and stuff and her trying to figure out if she's bipolar or not, um, with her situation I've been very calm with her and my husband said it's like a 360 degree turn.  He said you usually get ill, cannot handle it and stuff and anything she does it would just irritate me and get on my nerves so bad I can't stand it and I'd start yelling and this way I don't.  Anything I say, I been saying a lot she says to hurt her feelings and I go, I didn't know I said something to hurt your feelings or whatever I say and he said it was just, he said [PATIENT NAME] you've done amazing.  Usually I'd be saying I didn't do nothing and stuff, I haven't, I really have, I've even noticed a difference.  Everybody I hang around has noticed a difference.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it has been, I mean, it's like I'm a new person.  I feel so much better.  The only thing that gets me down like I said is my leg that hurt and my weight, but we working on it so I'm kind of excited now after seeing her.  So but I got depressed at that just for like two days and stuff and I'm like ugh, but as of anything tearing my nerves up or anything like that or my daughter getting on my nerves or anybody that has a problem with me, it's like it blows over my head and usually I blow off and stuff, but no I have actually been doing wonderful.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you take only 100 mg of Lamictal right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And 300 mg of Effexor XR?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  So I, I mean it's amazing and then I take only my nerve pills when needed and I haven't been needing them that much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much you average before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A week maybe three.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe three a week and that's when I really feel like I need it or I feel like I'm getting, my nerves are getting shot I'll start, I'll take one, but I'm down to about three a week and that's on a bad week.  I haven't took, today's what Thursday?  I hadn't even took one this week.  I hadn't even took one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I, it's been very good.  Now we having company coming over this weekend, so my husband said you might want to take one for cause I just panic about my house and stuff so he's like if you feel like you're gonna start panicking before they get here I want you to go on and take one, but so far I haven't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That somebody, you okay with them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I'm very okay with them, it's just they have kids, um, they have two and then another friend of ours has two more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so there are two families coming?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, and so I'm just the kids running around is going to drive me nuts, but where it usually drives me nuts.  So far I haven't panicked knowing that their coming over yet, but when they get there we'll see, but I've laid back and I just told my kids what you mess up your clean up.  So, and they've been very helpful too, very helpful in helping me so I haven't been so much panicky over my house cleaning and stuff because they've been helping keep their rooms clean to where all we have to do is go in and do the basic cleaning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you have your daughter's room, she still stays at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah she stays at the [DEIDENTIFIED], um, they put her, she was on Lexapro and he wanted to put her in the hospital and stuff because she was still having real bad problems and her dad didn't want to see her and this, that and the other, her real dad, so he upped her Lexapro and he wanted to put her in the hospital just to keep an eye on her.  He said because if it's bipolar this Lexapro will make it worse and she begged him not to and so she went off the deep end and was going crazy.  I took her off her Valium, her Lexapro and everything until we went back to him and do you know she has been doing good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She was on Valium?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh 0.5.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Xanax.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean Xanax I'm sorry.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is she?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [AGE].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And she has been off all medicine since how long?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She doing good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doing good.   Doing good and when I went to him and I told him, I said, I took her off her medicine, I said cause she flipped out and this is not like my daughter even before I brought her to you.  She was having issues, but she wasn't this bad and he said, okay he said that's fine he said I think that now we need to start looking into bipolar.  Well the point is I think she just needs to be able to talk to somebody.  Just a therapist and stuff right now because she's not on meds and if she's doing good because I'm doing good it seems like she's not has as much worries worrying about me because she's a worry-wart, so with her worrying about me I think it downs her and depresses her and she's all the time worrying.  When now since I'm doing good and we get along she seems to be doing great.  Now she has some issues, I mean that bothers her and so she'll come to me, but she says mom I don't want to put it on you, I think she just needs to talk, just have a therapist and talk to her because I really, with her not having her medicine she's been doing good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe she doesn't want to bring issues to you because of your illness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly and that's why she says mom I don't want to put this on you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now remember what happened at the school with your -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, with my neighbor, yeah and that's, that's over with but I went to the school district before it was closed and asked them can we start fresh over.  It's not because my kids are going in it, one's going to a different school since that happened and they won't let me.  I have to call every time I show up.  So on teacher's day to meet the teachers I gotta call ahead of time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah they won't let me on the property unless I call ahead of time so when my daughter meets her teachers and stuff I can't go in there unless they say it's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how long it will be like on probation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No it's ongoing till I never have to set foot on that property again till my kids graduate.  So I mean my daughter, my youngest daughter's in fourth grade, going in fourth grade so I gotta all wait until she gets out of high school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not in that particular school or any school?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All the district five schools in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With that physical altercation with the -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, with the principal, yep and I mean the sad thing is I mean, the weird thing, not the bad, the weird thing is since this happened when my daughter was in that school this past year I can contact, they're having this, can I come?  Sure and the principal, the one, the principal that I hit is all letting me coming in there.  C'mon, can I come up there, they won't, they haven't this and stuff and I'd like set, yeah c'mon.  I'd like to eat with, yeah c'mon.  He's fine with it, it's just the district now.  Now my oldest daughter's school they make her, if I have to get her for early dismissal she has to meet me on the side of the street and I ain't doing, come a showdown with that school, but they won't let me in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The one you hit has no problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Has no problem with it.  The one that I never been into that school, except for meeting the teachers and stuff before this happened, they won't even let me in that school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They have a record of what happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, they have my picture on record.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No kidding.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, and they had like a bomb threat and I called and I said listen I need my daughter out of school.  I'm not leaving her here, they said ma'am you've got to come in to sign her out.  I said I'm not allowed on your property, I said let me speak to the principal see if I could, he's on duty and stuff, on look out and everything and stuff to try and keep safety.  I said well then you better let them know I'm coming in.  The next day the cops showed up at my door and wanted to know why I was in the school.  I said listen, you all had a bomb threat.  I called up there, they said I had to come in and show my license to get my daughter out.  I said, I told them I needed to speak to the principal because I'm not allowed on, they said that he was on duty so I couldn't and I wouldn't leave my daughter here so, but they said okay thank you for telling us and they asked me who I talked to and luckily I heard the woman's name and remembered it and everything but, the next day they called me because they had my picture saying I shouldn't be in the school and they turned me in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some things get out of proportion though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They do, they do and I told them, I said people do, I mean people make mistakes and I said I learned by my mistakes, I had to pay the price and stuff and I said I said I see a psychiatrist, I said they're getting my medicines under control.  I admit I was in the wrong, but they said I'm sorry we don't overrule this stuff.  You're not allowed back on that property unless I call ahead of time and they okay it.  I never got to go to my daughter's awards day, my oldest daughter, even though that's not the principal and then she had a banquet, at the school on a Saturday now for her swim team, school's not open, they would not let me go.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On a Saturday?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, and it was just the swim team, but they would not let me go.  Now I can go to her swim competitions because they're not on school property.  They're at a YMCA.  Is that not crazy?  I can't go to football games or nothing.  That's real sad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's sad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know, I can make it through it.  That to me that's no big deal now.  It used to bother me, but it don't.  I've got to the point where I'm taking one day at a time.  If I can make it through that day and feel good, great, we'll start tomorrow.  I just, and I actually left my supper dishes from last night and I got up and didn't panic cause it was a late dinner.  And my husband called me just a few minutes ago, he's like do you know you left supper dishes, yeah I'll get them in a little bit when I get home, he says and you didn't forget?  I said no not tonight, but it wasn't a big mess either.  So he started laughing and we've been getting along good and I don't know if any of the medicine works but our sex drive is a lot better than what it used to be.  I don't know if its just me feeling better and stuff, but we have and doing a lot better with that.  So I don't know, it's wonderful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great now what about your prescription, do you need any?  Do you have enough?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have enough right now.  Everything's filled and doing good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You get three months supply or how did we do this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but I didn't get a three month supply on my Restoril?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Restoril they won't give for [DEIDENTIFIED] that law.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We cannot use the supply for ninety days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so, well, is there, yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If they don't, they don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where's the microphone?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's in the [INAUDIBLE] and then they download, and, man, it's really cool stuff.  It downloads on the computer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know, Pennsylvania, wherever they are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So long and short of it is, I mean, they would beat the shit out of, the cops they would have taken a gun out and shot him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, no, they wouldn't beat him up, they're not that bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They couldn't beat him up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but these two cops couldn't have beat them up, believe me.  He would have, this kid's a monster.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they would have called for backup.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But backup was coming, but the bottom line is by the time the backup came they would—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They would have shot him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, it would have been the father, me, [NAME OTHER], and the two cops against the kid who was totally out of control, totally out of control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And a [INAUDIBLE].  And the father could have taken them down, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, father's [AGE], two knee replacements, two hip replacements.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lot of drama.  Um, does this kid's life, is it dramatic in this way in general?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he have a lot of drama?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So something's charged up, what happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would assume that, um, listen, he just, he just got worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, you know what, I'll tell you exactly what happened.  He wanted to quit the [DEIDENTIFIED] and his father took him out for lunch and said, you know what, my grandfather taught my father you never quit and my father taught me you never quit.  And you have five more weeks and you don't quit.  And three days before we had a conversation with him and said to the father, you can't put pressure.  The last thing the kid needs is pressure.  Father turns around and says, I had a great lunch, we really communicated, the kid [INAUDIBLE] two days later and says this is my father's lunch.  He put pressure on him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The lunch made him unravel.  Well, they have standards for him that he just can't seem to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, anyhow, the bottom line is they flew, the mother flew with him to a place called [DEIDENTIFIED] in California.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good, so he's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay?  He's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, twenty eight days for whatever twenty eight days is going to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For a nominal fee.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, whatever the hell, college tuition.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like sixty thousand dollars.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, something like that.  And, uh, and you know what, and hopefully he will, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Straighten out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's not going to happen because he's going to come back to the environments of the parents who built him a beautiful home and at one end of the living room is a bar.  The house revolves around the bar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's a drinker too, the kid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yes, and, and, and, when he was [AGE], [AGE], it was nothing to him to have all his friends there, drinking at the bar, hard liquor, and his parents in the house.  And, and, you know, his father smokes grass and the kid knows he smokes grass.  And when the mother's nervous she says, she says, um, I'm nervous, I've got to take a Valium.  I got to take a Valium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Better living through chemistry.  All right, let's take care of you, 'cause we're, you know, that's our job here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is it really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I saw you [DATE], so three months ago.  Your mood was good, you were not sad or anxious or irritable.  Your appetite was fine.  You hadn't had any weight changes, your sleep was a bit delayed and fitful and you felt rested.  Your energy was good.  You're not exercising.  Self esteem was fine, not guilty, not suicidal, not hopeless or helpless.  Your concentration was sharp.  You were able to think clearly and get things done.  Been a lot of deaths in your life.  You know, you were a little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

PT:	Got one more going and that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the worst.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's dying now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is my employee who is now at [DEIDENTIFIED] and who looks, make an Auschwitz victim look heavy and just the nicest guy in the world, and it just breaks your heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of cancer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pancreatic.  Father died at [AGE], uncle died, cousin died.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It goes fast, pancreatic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not fast enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good answer.  Um, you know.  All right, how has your mood been these three months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everything has been fantastic, except—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wait a minute, you were in the throes of business, uh, unsettling business issues.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, because basically I got wiped out by a scumbag who, when I saw wiped out I mean, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You lost that huge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Quarter of a million dollar research and I walked away from a contract.  They wound up paying us fifty thousand, it cost me two hundred and fifty.  You know, kind of not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The work, the work you did cost?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, not the work, the actual paychecks to my people and all the stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Out of pocket [INAUDIBLE].  You forget about the fact that we work from eight in the morning to ten at night, six, seven days a week and it was a nightmare.  And the guy running it was a putz.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you could only squeeze fifty out of him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's all they would give us, take it or leave it, and, you know, it was like we'll take it and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lawyers would have cost too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would never sue him for that.  I'm not going to get, have a reputation of suing the guy.  It wasn't worth it.  Two hundred grand, you know, we're making it up now.  You know, business is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's good to be finished with this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  And so have you got more business and you're putting your people to work and things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, business is good and things are good.  And my problem was that night that the incident, the day that this happened the Saturday that this happened I came home from a party at the club, didn't fall asleep 'til four o'clock that morning.  I have not fallen asleep before three or four o'clock in the morning on 10 mg Ambien and a, and of course Seroquel and a Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you revved, were your thoughts racing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my thoughts are racing, but I figured, I figured out what it was and last night I had my first decent night sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I rented the houseboat out on the water to these two guys, gay guys, they're not a couple, um, and that Saturday that the kid had the [INAUDIBLE], during the day I had my stereo guys over and we were working on the outside system and I've got six pairs of speakers that are around my pool and [INAUDIBLE] and the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is the house you're renting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is the house that I own, which is next door to the house that I rent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and I wanted to get [INAUDIBLE] and they had the music blasting.  I mean, quality of the system, the speakers, it was great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of speakers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, these are rock speakers and then there's, you know, I don't know [INAUDIBLE], they're better than Bose and PBS or whatever the case may be.  But just the way it works, it's incredible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what do you do, three and three, and then you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, six pair of speakers that are now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] not a surround, but a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, right left, and now that are all on a remote control that will allow me to control each pair of speakers independently.  And I probably have fourteen pair of speakers in my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I like, and I can hit the system and the whole place is gone and I love it.  I love music and I love it.  Anyhow, one of the guys comes running over, listen now, I'm doing work, you know, and I said, well, I'm just testing my system.  He said all right, all right.  And that coupled with the fact that I've never had an argument with any neighbor.  My neighbor next to me, I know they poisoned my tree.  I had five people tell me the tree was poisoned.  It's, it blocks one of his windows.  I accused him.  My wife said don't accuse him, forget about it.  I accused him.  She beat me up for a month.  I went over and I apologized, he's been an asshole.  And I want to twist his fucking face.  Okay?  And so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're confusing your stories though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So then I got—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So this is the neighbor from the two, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, this is on either side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take it that direction, I don't know these.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, it is because when I get in bed I think of the neighbor on this side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The interaction you had.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, because, listen, sometime my stereo system's on.  I mean, we're in the pool.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your worried that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But this side's going to start complaining and that's why, you know what, I don't need his fucking complaints.  And the other guy on the other side, I'm going to break his neck because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're surrounded by—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Surrounded, I want to fucking, I want to kill him, I want to kill them both.  So that's how much the guy who's renting the house, you know, I mainly [INAUDIBLE] conversation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you can always get rid of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he's got a two year lease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'll basically say to him listen to me, if you guys can't live with this, no hard feelings, leave the house the way you found it, you can get out of the lease.  That'd be my end thing to them.  But my kids are not going to be uncomfortable in my house.  I am not going to be uncomfortable.  I rent you the house, I don't rent you the land.  They play badminton, they play Frisbee, and they're not mimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On their property.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On that property, right.  And they're not mimes.  In other words, from the back of my house I look straight down to the water.  I'm right on the water.  I go right down to the water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] I've got two hundred and fifty feet straight down to the water and it is spectacular.  The sun setting on the water, on the property.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have two houses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have two houses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's great.  You know, if I had the money truthfully, what I would do is I would take that house and make it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Boat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got rid of the boat.  I would take the house and I would make it into a like, um, you know, like a men's club or something like that.  You know, I'd put a gym in, I wouldn't work out in it, but I'd put a gym in, you know.  I'd do all sorts of crap like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Talk about speakers, you're really cranking up there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would really do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So anyhow last night I went out to dinner with my friends whose son is now in this place, and I said, you know, it happened that day, I said, but here's what it was and I got it off my chest and last night I fell asleep for the first time.  But after asking, I mean, this like nine days, ten days that I was on four hours of sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, it sounds like you're revved up, that your mood cycled to the high rev.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, but I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now you're coming down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean, on the, on Tylenol PM.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, that's what happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On 10 mg of Ambien, on 200 mg of Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And 150 of Lamictal and the Emsam, you're slapping on the Emsam, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  I mean, I should fall asleep at a certain time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let's talk a little bit.  How's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, other than I've been dragging my ass and then I go to the hospital to visit my employee every day or every other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood's been good, meaning most of the time you're not sad, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most of the time you're not anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at all.  Not anxious at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most of the time you're not irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at all.  Not even most of the time, all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  You don't get those things at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you're super normal, you're better than normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm better than normal, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most people get some of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just don't think, you're allowed to get those things, you just can't stay that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I mean, I was so tired yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hold on.  Let me also ask, have you been elated in any way?  [INAUDIBLE] feeling like you're on drugs in any way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you talk too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It depends if I have a couple of drinks and I smoke a little, yeah, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Past the point?  Well, without substances?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you talk past the point?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are your thoughts racing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you do anything that shows bad judgment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gambling, spending, sexual indiscretion?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only sexual indiscretions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's stable, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have impulses sexually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That doesn't cycle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it doesn't count.  You know, that's your personality I guess.  You know, uh, and you're not gambling or spending?  You're doing things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So no bad judgment.  Um, the beginning of the night it takes hours to get to sleep or you just don't feel tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can feel tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or you don't go to sleep until—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I can feel tired lying in my bed I feel tired.  I'm ready to go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've taken my meds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They should be pulling you down some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And then I get in bed, that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When do you slap on the Emsam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the morning, and when do you take it off, the next day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Next day, when I put the next one on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you might want to pull it off at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if it's interfering with your sleep [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the last thing I want is will it come back, 'cause I'm controlling [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] mood to go down.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want my mood to go down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we don't want to take that risk, but, uh, maybe we can get away with it without losing mood effect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, it's not worth cutting the, the patch in half and putting half on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could, you could.  You mean in the morning, or at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Instead of putting 6 mg on a day, putting 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could try.  I'd be more worried about your mood dropping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On a lower dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I want your brain seeing a decent dose during the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your concentration?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now we do think you have attention deficit, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's, but has the Emsam helped it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It has?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's not a treatment for it, but we would predict that because dopamine medicines, dopamine norepinephrine medicines help ADD like Ritalin, dexedrine, the dopa medicines, and Emsam is that also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That it should work, although—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not officially for that.  Well, good, that's nice to know.  So you can stay on task then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You distract easily still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I like distractions while I work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pleasurable distractions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, if you have work to get done, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get it done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Put your head, I mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you find that you're efficient?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you enjoying things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got a Hungarian worker that's been working at my house seven days a week for the last two weeks doing things that, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like handyman stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  [INAUDIBLE], you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] do this, do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All the things that you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everything that makes my house look like it's what it's worth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Tightens up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tightens up the, yeah, it's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hard to find guys like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where'd you find him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My housekeeper's Hungarian and, uh, she has a friend who came over.  He's a licensed electrician, but you know what?  He doesn't speak English and, you know, so right now I pay him ten bucks an hour.  I always, up until this house got in shape, I had guys six days a week, five six years at a time, you know, just doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just details.  Just the little, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doing things, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Shine it up and spray paint it so it's clear and the brass is supposed to be perfect, the brass is perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very nice.  For everyone else it's kind of a hassle to find someone and pay, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pain in the ass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not to me.  I've got a list of people you couldn't believe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are you working hard, you go into work every day and, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, except for this, kind of this week I kind of took off and worked with him a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now how did you get all the new business, it just came to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you kind of lucked out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The economy's collapsing now.  The economy's collapsing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's good for business.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's good for business.  I just passed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As long as they pay their bills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] one of those areas, that's why I come in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Four fifty nine for high test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's separate from economy.  Your economy [INAUDIBLE] business all foreclosures, right, people can't pay their bill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Businesses can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're mostly commercial?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm all commercial, only commercial.  Businesses [INAUDIBLE].  My clients are calling me in to analyze this and they're committing fraud left and right.  I mean, I'm covered and the bank says [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Banks are tough but they've gone so far the other direction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, for sure, they can't afford this.  Can't afford these losses anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're not giving out any money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're not making money, they'll give me money if I want it, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, against your house or against something that's real.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But they'll undervalue the house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They can undervalue it all they want [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, it's a rough market, but it'll turn soon.  You don't think so.  When do you think it's going to turn?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The whole business environment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I don't know, we'll see.  It's depressing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, for you, I guess.  Kids are all doing great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Hedge fund makes it on the up and the down, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You listen to me, the kids are all doing great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're getting along with your wife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Always.  I married a saint.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You work with her every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Of course the only thing I did was about a month ago there's a [INAUDIBLE] you have to walk down to get to my office, I put a tape on the floor.  And I said there's only three people allowed to pass that tape, she's not one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you got away with it?  I'm going to try that in my house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not allowed past this point.  Only three people, all my secretaries.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No one else, just your secretaries.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All my secretaries.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she really doesn't pass it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She passed it once, I called her in her room, I said, don't do it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't do it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] cut your balls off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No way [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what my Jewish friends, their second marriages, they don't marry shiksas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.  Who knows [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] they said I don't believe it, somebody who puts somebody else in front of themselves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who knows on round one, who knows on round one.  Live and learn.  I'm still on that one though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How many kids do you have?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nice, how old?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're having a bar mitzvah in three weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nice, where?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In Israel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's great.  [INAUDIBLE] you have relatives in Israel?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My wife's Israeli.  So we're over there a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Okay, so, so you'll have a lot of people.  'Cause we had two destination weddings and we had about a hundred and ten and the truth is that all the people who come are the people that really matter, you know.  All the relatives that you see at weddings and funerals don't come.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, they're in the neighborhood so they come, but if they have to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But all the people who really matter, go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They'll get on a flight.  And Israel's a cool place to [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hope, you know, it stays safe and it's safe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so my son's [AGE], I have a daughter [AGE], and a daughter [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Private school?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, Jewish [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, Jewish [INAUDIBLE].  Jewish [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So, uh, anyway, you're doing beautifully.  I mean, from where you came from.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I was a wreck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is, uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did you see a picture of [NAME OTHER] in the?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You didn't see a picture of [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's in which paper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was in the [DEIDENTIFIED] a big picture of [NAME OTHER] holding a baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, he had a baby recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is there a picture of him holding a baby?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it was single older men who, single, a single older men who, um, it said he broke up with his girlfriend.  They were planning on having, adopting a child, and he decided he would continue with it and he's [AGE] and has a two month old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my god.  What a weird story.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Had a big picture of him holding the kid, looking, you know, and holding the kid, and I'm saying to myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When was it in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was, oh, it was maybe about a month ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I got to find it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I never met the guy, I just know him on the phone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just know him on the phone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I didn't he was [AGE], I didn't know he was single, so he's gay?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  My take, I [INAUDIBLE].  Nothing, not, you know, there wasn't any innuendoes, not at all like that.  [INAUDIBLE].  It's just my speculations.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But [INAUDIBLE] embarrass the guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's a kind of socially inappropriate, I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE] wow, single.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's inconceivable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At [AGE] your kid is a year in college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] baby.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], the old story [NAME OTHER].  Followed a gorilla, a mother gorilla from when she was had her first [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not [NAME OTHER].  They just nicknamed the gorilla [NAME OTHER].  And they followed this gorilla from when she was first able to have an offspring and how she could discipline and rear because she had the energy and how it became independent at an early age and how her last child she was really too old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She was burnt out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She didn't have the energy and she died at a time when the child.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It killed her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she died, she died at the time when this child should have been able to fend for itself, and it didn't, and it subsequently died.  And it misbehaved and it was, you know, a problem.  It was all these things because you don't have the energy to do it.  When my wife was pregnant with her fourth and I said to her, when they're all in private school we can't afford another twenty grand a year, um, and more than that, we don't, I don't have the energy.  And she said we've raised our kids the right way and what we will lack our children, we'll put in.  She said, you will see.  And she was right.  Right on the money.  The kids, my kids are all very close.  And they see each other two times a week in the city, easily, for dinner two times a week.  And very close with each other.  Um, and she was right.  But he's a single parent with no other, what do you call it, you know, this kid's going to be on the couch for the rest of their life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  No, you did a great way and especially given your circumstances.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You really got the best ones.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got the best ones, I do, man.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For some reason I have a bunch of folks like you.  At least five, who grandparents and yet, you know, and the wives were okay with it.  Actually, no, most of them don't stay with the wives.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But they very amicably, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Split.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Split and then the guy, but, you know, I get to hear all the grandfather, you know, joy, envy kind of world, uh, very highly charged, uh, you know, going out for, it's very interesting.  It's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So, uh, so I think this cocktail is perfect except for your sleep problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so how are we going to fix the sleep problem?  You're on, are you take the second Klonopin also?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get two Klonopin, one in the morning, one at night.  So you are on Ambien, Klonopin, Seroquel and Lamictal at night, all of which—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I take the Lamictal in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I told you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could be a little sedating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At night, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I'll take it at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It probably is not that sedating for you, but take it at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and you've taken Tylenol PM?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have for the last ten days because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What if we crank up the Seroquel a touch?  You know, knock you out a little more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, if you think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel groggy in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, today I was groggy, I said to my wife, you know what, I feel like water in my ears, do you have a Benadryl?  So she gave me a Benadryl.  I took only a Benadryl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'll knock you out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what do you call it, and the Ambien and this morning I had a hard time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, Benadryl's the worst.  And the Tylenol PM is Benadryl by the way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's Tylenol with some Benadryl.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  But not as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not as much, 25, instead of 50.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I don't like Benadryl.  You know, personally also when I take it I'm all groggy in the morning and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that's exactly how I was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Unless you're allergic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't have to, I had the guys come in to do the trees today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The problem with the second Ambien, if you would take a second Ambien, is you can hallucinate.  I mean, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you take two of Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't take two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't take two, but trying to find something for, to knock you out better.  You could take a second Klonopin at night if you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would be 2 mg?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two mg at night.  You can take one and a half see if that works, and then two.  But to be laying up until three or four in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To tell you the truth, I am just waiting for the analysis of one of my companies to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're thinking about business.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, no, no.  No, not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what are you up doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm thinking about killing [INAUDIBLE].  That's what I was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, that's something you really don't want to put on tape.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] duty to warn.  I've got to pick up this phone and call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the neighbors, call them, I'll give you their numbers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There is a court case about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, if a shrink hears a threat like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He has a duty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Listen, I can tell you, when I was at [INAUDIBLE] I'll give you another one.  On Tuesday night when I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  If you don't mind, your phone number and your address.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] and when my employee said I'm dying a tortuous slow agonizing death, if I had the balls, I would have taken a pillow and I would have smothered him or I would have, if I could get my hands on stuff, but it's not my style.  I'm not a violent person.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why would you have to, uh, kill him violently?  Just give him enough opium, like you have a nice connection to the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] of those and.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, that's what the docs do in the hospital, they slow down the breathing enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] slowly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  And that's not a horrible way to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It isn't.  It's a wonderful way to go.  I mean, but yet last night when I was there with my wife and the president of one of the companies that I own was in Chicago and I've flown up a couple times 'cause he's been with them for twenty three years and he said, ah, you know, I'm not doing good.  I'm just hoping things will turn around.  [INAUDIBLE].  He makes an Auschwitz victim look fat.  He can't move.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, but he's got that little bit of hope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's got a little bit of hope.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little bit of hope.  So, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't wish it on your worst enemy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  It's very terrible.  Very terrible.  And the whole place is, they're all the same.  The head back, the eyes sunken, the mouth open, the breathing, the way they breathe, you know, although he's not in labored breathing like my mother was.  He's, his breathing is very fine.  You know, on Tuesday night I sat with him for two hours.  I just held his hand.  He was maybe for two hours he was awake for five minutes, then he'd squeeze my hand every so often, I'd squeeze his hand.  And I took some cloth with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We should all probably do a living will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pull the plug?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I wouldn't want to put my family through this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you guys are Catholic, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that an issue?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You think really that if there is a God and you kill yourself or you eat meat during Lent, you're going to hell?  I mean, give me a break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More of it it's just really the pig stuff, but [INAUDIBLE], but, you know, some Catholics are, uh, quite firm about these types of issues.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My wife's attitude is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it really is your wife, not you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My wife said to me, I said to her, if I was ever like this and I knew I was going, I would kill myself.  She said I would never let you.  You wouldn't have a chance.  I said, but I wouldn't put my kids through it.  She said, your kids live through your mother for eight months in a slow and tortuous death, that is life.  That is life.  That's what it's about.  It's life.  It's not all good, there's bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but, uh, what you need to make clear to your wife, and I've done this on the doctor's side when I was in training, you know, it's really not the wife's attitude that matters.  Because he can't talk anymore, the guy who's sitting and miserable, we only ask the family what would he want, not what do you want for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What would he want.  And you've got to make it clear to your wife, this is what I want.  I understand what you want, but this is what I want.  I wouldn't want to be suffering like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well, you know her answer is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're not god, you're not god.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, so it is a Catholic thing.  I mean, that's the Catholic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, it's not just Catholic.  The religious perspective about there being something sacred about life and self, no matter how miserable the quality of life is, there is life percolating and you don't have the right to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, the argument would be, what o you mean I don't have the right, it's my life, if I want to live in a way, who are you to tell me that I can't, you know, check out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The worst thing ever I saw was putting [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, if you saw the tape of that guy who he administered whatever he administered to kill him, and the guy says I can't stand [INAUDIBLE] and you saw what he was like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was an act of compassion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, let's, so are you claiming that you've reached a, you reach or about to reach an even keel in the evenings and you don't want me to hit you up with any more medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I will call, not on your emergency phone, I will call and I will tell you if I'm having a problem with sleeping and if you've got something that good, give it to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let's see.  Well, why don't I just you a little more Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, Seroquel now has sustained release.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So see, that's an 100 mg for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So try this and now of course take the 200.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, exactly.  Or you could, uh, here's some extra 50s of the regular ones if you want to inch your regular one up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then, uh, you have the 200s, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  No, I mean, listen, I'm feeling great and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The truth is I would like to, um, I would, I'm just waiting for my analysis to pan out the way I want them to and then I'll see you, I'd like to thank you, I'd like to try and start to slow down.  You know, I'll talk to you how to do it on the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean to back off on some of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we have plenty of time because there's no urgency to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  That's the first one we want to pull back on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you go to one and three quarters a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or one and a half, you know, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I just want it because, you know, I want to see if I'm just a nervous person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The one I'd like to back off on first is the morning one, 'cause the morning can schlog you a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can make your thinking a little more sluggish than we want it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you want to start toying with it, break the morning one in half, see how that goes.  Um, all right, so Lamictal 150, Seroquel, let's say 200 to 300, Klonopin one and one, Ambien 10, and Emsam 6 per twenty four hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  You need prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're great.  You're the poster child for remission.</p>

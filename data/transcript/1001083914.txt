<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it’s just uh, lower in the fatigue, sort of motivational sense I guess. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you tired all day every day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yep, yes. Yes an uh -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You drag?</P>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, how many hours are you sleeping?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, eight, well, not a solid eight cause I get up early. And I go back to sleep. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you exercise?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not as much as I should but you know, I’m walking around.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, how much is that? Do you do walking?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you do walking?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, twenty minutes a day or something.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, that’s, that counts.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And, are you tired starting in the morning or do you, do you peter out early?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, my tiredness peters out in the towards the evening, in other words I feel more lively.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Almost like breaking through the clouds?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Burning of the uh, </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, breaking yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, the fog burns off by what time?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, about bedtime. Well actually early evening some time. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, let’s say six to eight p.m.?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your self esteem?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh - could be better but it’s not, it’s not in the dumper or anything</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, somewhat because it, its sort of fatigue you know, and that sometimes makes it - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And the fatigue makes it hard to enjoy things?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You have to push yourself? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. It’s exactly like you say, until I get a breakthrough or it goes away even you know, I just push myself to do things.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. And are you a bit better from last time or not really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’m relieved that I’m, you know, Christmas season’s over and I’m always relieved in January.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just to be getting, kind of getting back to basics then you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, so you’re on Zoloft three hundred,</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Klonopin one to two per day.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And Provigil four hundred?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And Mianserin was a bust?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And so, we need to find something else - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. I need some juice.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And stimulants have never helped except the Provigil</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, stimulants, they had this weird thing happen, when I first get on them I feel really good but then, crashing part, you know, gives me that kind of nervous/sadness-sadness/anxiety.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What if, what if we give you long active stimulants - that, where you wouldn’t crash? Have you tried Concerta? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not, what’s that one, is that a blood pressure uh - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No. Well, they all do, all except [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, but I’m concerned about that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We uh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What is Concerta, I haven’t heard of it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In the past, I’ve had you on Cylert.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s not available anymore. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it isn’t?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, liver problems.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, Adderall [INAUDIBLE] - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, Dexedrine and Adderall, but again those have blood pressure problems. And Ritalin, which has blood pressure problems, but not necessarily blood pressure problems and we could always, I mean blood pressure is easier to treat than uh, than fatigue - and your level of fatigue.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, fatigue is physically based or you know, it’s from the allergies, it’s like kind of mysterious, I don’t really - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You - any sense it might be from the uh, medication?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I am on a regular blood pressure and stuff and uh, that beta-blocker um, Atena -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Atenolol? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Atenolol and then uh, the um, Nec, Nifedipine? That how you say it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nifedipine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Nifedipine and hydrochlorothiazide and then also, um, is it V uh, Vytorin? Is it? For cholesterol [INAUDIBLE]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Vytorin uh, I don’t know how that -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you know you had more energy before all that, it always - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’ve always been -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Dragging. Well, and uh, Wellbutrin doesn’t do it for us.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you should have, I had a really bad time last time, uh, chest palpitations and -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, let’s keep you -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My wife says I act horrible when I’m on it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes so. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you crying at all?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you just feel down, that’s it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I’m not sad, I feel that kind of lumpy, you know, just a, just fatigue you know, like a bump on a log feeling. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Slack.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s been a while since we have tried, uh, Thyroid or Lithium. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I don’t think I’ve ever tried - some thyroid drug and I don’t think I was ever on Lithium, I was on some other mood stabilizers. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, you never tried Lithium?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Isn’t that like if you have uh, what was it, kidney problems or -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, generally not. But we have to keep an eye on your kidneys, um, you really - you’re not that depressed you’re mostly low energy, more, more than -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah that’s what I would, you know, yeah, that’s sort of uh -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, do you think we’re mostly covering your mood with the uh, Zoloft?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s why I was wondering if this is something more for my internist, is this more something really to be guessed more by my internist, or by you -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, your internist doesn’t seem to be doing it. You did try Lithium in [DATE]. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh really? I -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I’ve had you on, uh, Ritalin -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Ritalin and Dexedrine also.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> This has been your standard complaint from day one.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> This just put together in this low energy kind of way.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you’re hard wiring is such, how is your blood pressure?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s generally pretty good, I’ve been good about my meds and - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, what do you think of all the things we’ve tried?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, uh, certainly the MAOI’s the other one, I forget what I was taken off of the first one you put me on?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The Marplan?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Before the Marplan.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Parnate?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Parnate. What was the problem on that? Cause I remember I was working great and uh, it was like, I think I became a night bird, which didn’t, well I don’t know - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Parnate we used in [DATE]. And stopped in [DATE]. Okay, you were getting uh, side effects, your mood was much better.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What were the side effects, I remember that uh - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you took the Parnate at night. Cause it made you tired. Your wife thought you were much better. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The other thing I remember of things I’ve taken, is uh, that might possibly be [INAUDIBLE], plus I’d have to go off the Zoloft today.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You need to be off for a whole week and it’s not going to be pretty getting you off the Zoloft and switching you over. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] - say that in consideration when I act out yet -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. And we, you know, to transition you, we don’t have anything, and if you don’t want Levitra again, there’s nothing you can be on [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s not that I don’t want it - it was terrible.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Last time I don’t know why, uh. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There’s no chance that the Zoloft might be zapping you? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Zapping me what?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Zapping your energy?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Could be. I mean, I don’t, you know I take all this stuff I don’t know whether it’s, you know, compliments all of it, you know. Um, is it Nifedipine or [INAUDIBLE]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nifedipine, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That I think has some but - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Who has you on Nifedipine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My internist.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They usually don’t use that for blood pressure these days.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know, it works. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, no it’s good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, cause I had um, this uh, it worked so well that I took it, you know, and the Marplan, the liquefied version. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s the one I gave you -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> For Hypertensive Crisis. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, what did you tell your internist that this stuff works?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, cause [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They find that it works too well and too fast that they don’t use it so much. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You get that, get that vertigo, you mean, when you uh, stand up that kind of?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I, I think we should try some thyroid augmentation.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Thyroid can, now we’ve checked your thyroid recently, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had a, uh, ultrasound, that you can certainly uh, want me to get it to you or something.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, I don’t mean your thyroid gland, your thyroid hormones - in your bloodstream.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, oh, yeah that was checked recently too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That was normal -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that was a hand examination where it felt slightly enlarged, but I did the -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but the blood exam was normal -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I believe so, yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Thyroid test was normal. The internists aren’t crazy about it when we do it but we uh, we in psychiatry routinely use thyroid to augment for mood disorders. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s like um, turf [INAUDIBLE] that kind of thing?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> A little bit, yeah, we worried that uh, there’s a small chance, long term on thyroid that you get a little more osteoporosis.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you’re on it for years. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Like the Cortisone and, well Cortisone causes that too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, but you know, we don’t worry about that as much and if were going to worry about it, lets worry about it after your moods are better.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And uh, when we have the luxury to worry about it. Short term, it’s safe, I mean we have to keep a little bit of an eye on your heart rate and blood pressure.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But other than that, you know, just make sure you don’t get hyper-thyroid symptoms over hot, fast heart rate, things like that. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I sort of get that, uh, heart rate I guess has slowed down but before that, I was getting pretty fast heart rate, you, it was happening and I didn’t even think about it - </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When was that happening?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you noticed my heart rate has been, I don’t know what it is now but it seems to be running around a hundred beats per minute. And I get - so hot easily. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But actually you, you took it, um, last summer I think [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it was running, it was running high?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And what did your internist say about that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, she said, you told me I should get a beta-blocker and she said sure. That was, that was, she said yes that was actually a good suggestion and she was thinking about it so -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And so she put you on one?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The problem with that is that it masks signs of hyper-thyroid. But that’s okay as long as uh, that were keeping an eye on it. That’s alright. Your pulse is okay now? Let me check. Oh yeah, you’re great. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What is it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> About sixty.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Sixty? Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Cool. Cool.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] the Atenolol?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. The Atenolol is a beta-blocker, it’s fine. Good, so um, I mean that’s the best I can offer the uh, you are a good dose of Provigil double the usual dose.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If we gave you speed, if we gave you, you know, amphetamine or Ritalin, we’d have to worry more about your heart rate and blood pressure.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And they’re not anti-depressant treatments where as thyroid is a classic augmenter framed by depression, you know.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And you can do it with the present medication?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, exactly we just add it and we’ll know in a week or two.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mm-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And so we’ll give it, you know, a couple weeks, hopefully you’ll feel, you know, better in that amount of time.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean the other things you need to do, you need to do is exercise more.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Get out of bed earlier in the morning, get into the sunlight, you know, basic um - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Common sense.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Energy hygiene, kind of a hygiene -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> For your energy system. You know you have a dysregulated energy system -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you have to do your best. Do you drink coffee?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How much?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, about two cups in the morning. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Mmm. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t drink it all day, I enjoy it and on rare occasions I’ll drink it some in the afternoon but not normal. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, I hope your internist’s not mad at me for doing this but I’m going to put you on the thyroid, alright?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t think she’ll be mad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, so we’re going to give you, I’ll write out how to do it, we’ll give you the dose, we’ll raise it and then we’ll give it about three weeks at fifty.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, start out at twenty five for a week and then fifty for three weeks and by then, by three weeks, ah, we’ll do this sloped. We’ll do two weeks at twenty five and then fifty for two weeks. And -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And by that time, after a month, give me a call -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We’ll decide over the phone what to [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I’ll be actually in Canada for the last week in -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Call me [INAUDIBLE] when you get back. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can call anywhere in the world, actually.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right. Um, if we decide that it’s not, if it’s not doing it for us, and you’re ready for Parnate for another trial of Parnate, then just start tapering back on your Zoloft.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I can’t think of anywhere else to go.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’ve been on everything.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well part, I forget what the side effects were.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, We can go into that if you’re, if you’re going to go back on them.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I meant the side effects I had.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, your heart rate was going fast, I mean, I have them listed, but </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s been a while. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Alright.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, we’re going to get you Cytomel, twenty five micrograms. Prescription will say take two a day, take it in the morning. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you take one a day for two weeks and then two a day.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And give me a call in a month and we’ll know by then.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Should I talk to you sooner, or -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nah. About two months, come back in two months and we’ll -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Unless you want to come sooner, you know, it’s always nice to see you. People come back when it’s time to, to do something different.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think if we’re going to do the MAO inhibitor next -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You should just start cutting back on the Zoloft before coming in next.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay. So, if it doesn’t, I’ll come in sooner if it, yeah, I’ll come in early March and then possibly in sooner, if there’s uh, when I start on that other thing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That would be the thyroid prescription. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, anything else uh?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, any side effects on this or things I shouldn’t do?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just too much juice.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Too much what?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If, uh, it, thyroid is the hormone of metabolism.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, if you have too much of it, too hot, internally hot</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You feel hotter than other people, your heart rate and, and you know, blood pressure, everything starts cranking up. You get flushed, you get skin problems, hair, hair thinness and like that. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not going to happen on this.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not going to happen on this. Um, okay, but give me a call in a few weeks, let me know how it’s going.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Alright.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Okay great.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Other prescriptions, any other prescriptions?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, no, those were refilled.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The Klonopin?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Klonopin? That was refilled.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Alright.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> About a month or so, okay. </P>

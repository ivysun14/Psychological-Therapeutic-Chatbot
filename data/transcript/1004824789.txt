<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Looks good, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It looks a lot better than, as I said, what it has been. But I took a shower this morning and the whole hand got soaking wet, even though I had it wrapped up in two baggies. So I had to have the whole complete bandage taken off and another one put on. So, this is how I go (inaudible at 00:38) (laughter). And my finger is fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you get the surgery?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Last Wednesday, a week tomorrow. And I get the stitches out the following week, next week on Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how long of a recovery is it? [00:01:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The guy said six weeks, but I don't know. I mean, (inaudible at 01:10) fine, but the stitches are actually in the palm of your hand, so whatever it takes for me to, you know. I just hope it's soon because I really can't pick up a fork with my left hand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, because it's just—you got the same problem, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. So I've been up shit's creek lately. Eat a lot of oatmeal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you can use a spoon better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can actually suck it down better. Or Cream of Wheat, you know. So, that's been working. Soups. Anything with the—or I can use a straw.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or a straw, right. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know, maybe I'll lose a few pounds, hopefully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The hard way. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 02:18) (laughter) Everything else is still wacked out as usual. Mark's been back in the picture for, I don't know. The last time I had a session with you, he was over that afternoon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Doesn't remember what he said, so of course I kind of just, you know. I said, "Well, let's just say we'll never be back in the bedroom again." "Are you sure?" "Absolutely positive." "Well, what did I"—I just came out and said, you know, "You told me you didn't find me attractive. There was no passion there or anything." I said, "So, you know, that's the end of that." But still keeps on trying to get in there, in that bedroom. I'll just keep—nope. Nope nope nope. [00:03:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're telling him that he had an impact on you, that you're not going to deny or forget about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said no, I said, "Because if I went into the bedroom with you," I says, "I don't think I could respect myself," you know. And he still just can't—no, as of yesterday afternoon, he was still trying. He still wasn't getting nowhere, you know. So, I don't see him once a day—he's there four and five times a day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mark doesn't do anything halfway, does he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He'll come over. He gets out of work at 11, gets home, showers. At 11:30 he's at the door. He'll stay for about half hour, leave because he has to go check on Keisha, then he comes back with the dog. After about an hour at the house he'll leave again, and he'll be back again. And some days he's there six times in the course of a day. I don't know why he just doesn't make a goddamn day of it, instead of—but, you know, he has to go home, he has to walk the dog, he has to check on Keisha because she's not been going to school, then he has to take Keisha one day for her appointments. But he's either there before he takes her and then he's there after he takes her. He just drops her off and heads right back. [00:05:10]</p>

<p>Some days he doesn't show up, you know, but he's right there the next day. If he doesn't show up a Friday, he'll be there Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What has it meant for him to be back? What have you felt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I can't deny that I don't care for him, because I do. (pause) I don't know, I just—I would love to go the same route that he wants to go, back into the bedroom, but I, you know, it's going to take a long time, you know. "Oh, well you know I love you." I said, "No, I don't know that anymore." I said so, you know, it's not working. He'll make out with me, try to change my mind. I said, "Nope, still not going there." [00:06:32]</p>

<p>You know, the days of surgery he was there the moment I got home, he was there. Make sure we keep my hand up, make sure I have on the ice packs. Been real, you know, really been a real pain in my ass (inaudible at 06:53)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Taking care of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. "How's the hand?" "It's fine." "No, tell me truthfully, how's the hand? I can tell you're in pain. How is it doing?" I says, "I'm doing fine," you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is like for him to, you know, to ask you that? You sound like you kind of—you bristle at it. What is it? What do you notice] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It aggravates me that he keeps asking me about it, you know. I don't know if he's pretending to care or if he really does care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like how you're feeling about the going to the bedroom. What does he really feel? Like, it might feel better than if you knew for sure that he felt...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, you know. So, [as of] (ph) lately, he'll call and he'll say, "Whom am I speaking to?" And I'll say, "It's Louise." "Oh well, is Deborah home?" I say, "Why don't you call her on her phone?" Because he wants to come over and smoke with her, you know. So, (inaudible at 08:19) I'm not home. So if I'm not home and Deborah's home, he'll still come over and, you know, have his smoke and his beer and his shot, you know. So, I really don't know anymore who he's coming to see, you know. [I don't know] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you kind of get the sense that if you know he's coming over for just the pot or just the booze, it kind of undermines your sense of, what is he giving me here? Does he really mean this stuff about my hand? Does he really feel this way towards me in the bedroom? As you said, you've pointed out in the past he's even said, you know—maybe he hasn't said it, but you just wondered if it's just about you being a kind of convenience store for him or something. [00:09:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, oh yeah. You know, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even though I think you know, like, on some level there's that feeling that he's really working hard. Well, how do you—yeah, you just don't know to trust that, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no. I don't trust him as far as I can throw him, not at all. Like, Sunday he came over and (pause) I think he bought pot with him because Deborah said she didn't have any. So, they smoked that and then he went home and he said he might be back. So, he called and said he was—I said, "Well I'm going to the movies with my girlfriend Rebecca." He said, "OK, fine." Well, I left with Rebecca. He called Deborah's phone and he came over and he smoked with Deborah, knowing that I was at the movies, you know. So, I mean, I know he'll be there today while I'm here, you know. Oh hey, fine. And Deborah has pot, but she's not going to admit it to him.</p>

<p>She's been making him go and buy it himself with his money. I says, "Yeah, his money—that's my money." [00:11:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that how he gets it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I says, "Because he borrowed 40 dollars from me." I said, "So Deborah, where do you think he's been getting the pot?" you know. So yesterday, he was supposed to give me 40 dollars back. I got 20 out of the 40, which isn't bad. Generally, I'm lucky if I get five out of the 40, you know. So, I just don't give a shit, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it really confronts you with the question of, you start to wonder with all the giving that you do for him and the kind of the really going out of your way for him, you kind of wonder, is that why he wants to be with me? Or is it because he really loves me and he wants to be with me? What if it's somehow both that he feels some—I mean, it's very confusing for you (ph). [00:12:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, oh yeah. I will go outside out the front and he'll have to sit down and it'll be, say, Deborah, myself, Mark and this girl Tanya, and then when this couple that lives out on the first floor, they can see us sitting on the benches. Jeremy and Willa, they'll come out and stand there and go, "But Mark, he's so loud. Sometimes he's so obnoxious." I get up and leave. I go in the house and Deborah will call me on the phone, "Don't leave him out here with us." I says, "Hey, what can I tell you Deborah? He doesn't want to be in the house. He wants to be outside." So I just leave him out there. I mean, he'll sit out there for an hour aggravating the hell out of the everybody else but me. (laughter) You know, if you're not smart enough to get up and leave then sit there and stay there and let him aggravate you, you know. I says, eventually he'll get the hint, you know. I said, "But I'm just not going to sit out there and get aggravated and tell him to lower his voice and to stop with the dirty language, the swearing," you know. "You mean"—yes. You know. So I said, "Nope, have fun." [00:13:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just walk away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. This is something new with him, you know, with the sitting outside with everybody, because he doesn't want anybody knowing he's there. I said, "How could you not want to—and here you are sitting here for an hour."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Announcing to the world that he's there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'll say to Deborah, I says, you know, yesterday he's in the house and he says, "I really have to tell you something." And I'll say, "Yeah, go ahead." He says, "Remember when"—he says, "That Erin upstairs"—the one he's been friends with for so many years—"blocked my phone number?" I says, "Yeah." He says, "Well, she still has it blocked," he says, "And I really don't care that she has it blocked. But when you blocked my number"—well, yeah. "You don't know how bad that made me feel." He says, "You know, I've got feelings and that really hurt me that you did that." And I'm like, "Oh yeah." [00:14:54]</p>

<p>So, I mean, he's just trying—he plays the line of bullshit so much that he believes it himself. And I'll just say, "No, Mark, it just doesn't work." I says, "I'm over the fact that you and Erin were next door drinking." I says, "It's something else all together different." And he'll say to me, "Well, you know, I think I really need the Viagra." I says, "Oh my god." I says, "You're going to give me a heart attack. You're finally admitting to the fact that I've known all along." I said, "But, hey, what can I tell you? I'm still not going that route with you Mark, so forget the room." In fact, I need to shut the bedroom door before he gets there. (laughter) Off  limits. I have to put a sign up, "Off limits."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do not enter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, do not enter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No Mark's (inaudible at 16:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) That's a good idea. Soon as I can use this hand I'll do that. Oh, I tell you. Unbelievable, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not letting him back in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, not yet. It'll be a while. Maybe another couple months, you know. I don't know, I think my feelings are—I mean, (pause) I still love him, but I don't know, he's just killed a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he did damage to them. He did damage to them. I mean, it's like a broken hand. I mean, a surgical—you know, it takes a while to recover and it's never quite going to be the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I don't think I could feel the same in the bedroom with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he apologize?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. [00:17:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, he does every day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does he say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. I said, "It doesn't work." "Well, I really apologize for things that I say." He says, "But you should know that when I'm drunk I say things that I shouldn't say." I say, "Mark, you say things that you shouldn't say when you're sober, so I don't want to hear that liquor was the excuse," you know. "You don't know how much you mean to me," you know, the routine. "I love you. You're my friend. I don't have anywhere else that I can go and sit and talk to people and tell people things that are bothering me." I says, "Well, fine. You want to be friends like that? Fine, we'll be friends with no benefits," you know. "What do you mean with no benefits?" I says, "You know, no making out, no going in the bedroom, no me doing this and that for you, all those things Mark." "Well, I don't want that." I says, "Well, that's what you're going to have to get," you know. [00:18:38]</p>

<p>He's been good with—he hasn't asked me for anymore until last week, was the first time he had asked for money. So, you know, he came up with, well, 20 out of 40, so I can't complain there, but then he'll probably get 60 this week, you know. But you're not getting any money this week. I can buy him a big bottle of vodka and I say, maybe the largest bottle that they have going. And he's like Smirnoff and he likes the different flavored ones. So, I spent 35 dollars for a bottle once (ph). I'm lucky if that will last him two weeks. Lucky. When he says he wants a shot, he fills, like, a cup like you have there. That's maybe, what, 12 ounces? 16 ounces?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably 12. That's no shot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's a shot to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. And then the beer. "You know I don't (inaudible at 20:01)." I don't know how he can drink that like that, just straight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He'll straight drink it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then (ph) he's a hardcore drinker (inaudible at 20:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. The other night, he had left a glass half full, and Deborah thought it was my tonic. I said, "No." She said, "It smells like your tonic." I says, "Well, you know, that's because he likes the fruit flavors." I said, "I think that one was watermelon or something."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The vodka.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So she put it up to her mouth and took her sip and she goes, "Oh my god, you're (inaudible at 20:41)" I mean, that burns your throat. I've even tried it, you know. (inaudible at 20:49) if you want to put it in orange juice? Fine. Or tomato juice? Fine. But straight? No. No no no no, that's (pause) I don't know. And he does it with no flinch. Right down. So to one beer, I will say he might have two things of vodka, for one can of beer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He'll drink a couple of these and then one beer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of booze. I mean, yeah, that's probably, what, eight to ten shots in this thing, if not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. He'd think nothing of drinking the whole bottle in one day. I mean, he's really got problems. So, like, yesterday he was there and he came back and he said, "I really have to talk to you." I said, "Yeah, go ahead." And he says, "No, I can't tell you." I says, "Oh, you're having problems with Keisha? You don't even have to tell me. I know it, I've told you, but you don't want to listen to me." I said, "So, don't even tell me, because then you, you know, I give you my opinion and then you get more upset and u don't act on it." I said, "I told you to begin with, the dog that was supposed to be Keisha's dog and she was going to get out and get exercise," I says, "What happened to that? Who walks the dog?" He's the only one that walks the dog and he takes the dog out for an hour, two hours. Goes in the back, plays Frisbee with him. While Keisha's home, playing on the computer or taking a nap, because that's all Keisha does. She might go to school one day out of the week, if they're lucky.</p>

<p>So, I guess she's having problems again. Well, he doesn't want to tell me about it. And she went to school one day and she keep home with her girlfriends, so he thought everything had changed and Keisha wanted to stay being a girl, she didn't want to have the sex, the transgender thing. I said, "Mark, forget it. They're not going to go away. They're not going to go away. This has been in her mind since what, Mark, 12, 11?" I says, "When she was starting to get her breasts and having her period." I says, "Since then," you know. I said, "So, what do you do?" you know. Brings a lot of, you know, arguments between him and Deborah. [00:24:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did you stand in all this, you know, with her and him and his feelings with her? Where do you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) he tells me these things that, you know, he's going through with Keisha. And, I mean, he's asking for my advice, but yet he's not taking my advice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, with the dog, how he always has the dog with him. He says, "You know, this is the only place he goes to." And he says, "They don't take him anywhere. This is the only other house he's ever been in," because now we let him in the house, the dog. I just shut the room so the cats don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You let the dog into your place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in the place, you know. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everybody's welcome (inaudible at 25:20) (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh please, you should see my Facebook picture. We take care of a [big, large] (ph) bulldog. And her picture is on my Facebook page. So we babysit her—well, I should say Deborah does most of it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. We get her overnight, she's an overnight guest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, is it Mark's dog?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this is another friend of mines' dog. So sometimes we'll have both in the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well boy, you finally expanded from stray humans to stray dogs. It was about time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. We are now running a doggy daycare [dear Abby] (ph), and god always knows what else will be popping up next. So I know something's bothering Mark, you know. He wants to tell me about it. He will eventually, because it will get to be too much for him to keep bottled up in his mind. He's finally, you know. [00:26:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he'll find himself faced with the fact that he really needs your help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, he'll say, "Oh yeah, she don't want the dog." And he'll say to me, "Don't even open up your mouth, because I know what you're going to say," which is, "Told you, you'd be walking it, you'd be taking care of it, because, you know, Mark, I was not going to do it." They walk into the—they live right next to a school, so they walk into the schoolyard after school's closed and they just let the dog go to the bathroom and, you know, and then they bring the dog in. That's not a walk. I mean, this dog is, like, 11 months old. He's still a puppy. He wants to go. Mark says, "What's going to ever happen if Deborah or Keisha are walking the dog and the dog spots you?" He'll come to my apartment house and soon as he hits the driveway of the house, he books it right to my end of the building, because he knows he's coming over to see Deborah and me. He goes crazy when he sees us. I says, "Well, let's just face it—Deborah and Keisha will get dragged across the street," and he'll say, "How do you know Jack?" [00:27:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, what I—I guess Louise, I'm thinking about how complicated it is for you to deal with a guy that is so Jekyll and Hyde. And what I was thinking about is that in some ways he never wants you to—you know, it would be the last thing for him to say, "I never want Deborah to know about you," and yet, what does he do? He practically parades you all around town at the same time. He tells you he's not attracted to you and he tries to get you in bed, you know, with unrelenting effort. He tells you he doesn't want your help, but then he'll break down and tell you how badly he needs it. He doesn't need your friendship and he wants your friendship. And I have to tell you, I don't know how you deal with all those feelings, the back and forth, because it is a lot. Because it's not just like, you know, you feel (pause) he enlisted so many different feelings, contradicting feelings and, you know, one good, bad, hurt on top of the, you know, on top of the world. You know, I can't imagine how the difference between going from the low of him telling you that he didn't feel attracted to you to, "I want"—he's spending, you know, the last couple weeks trying to get you in bed. [00:29:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's, you know, unreal (ph). Like, the other day I was coming back from the store and I had some bundles. And I was really having a tough time carrying them. He spotted me with Jack, he came and took the bundles and bought them back to the house for me, carried them all, you know. Because he's got the dog that wants to, you know, just jump all over the place. But he carried them right up to the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Worrying about your hand, you know, making sure you're OK. At other times he'll disappear and never, you know, you'll feel like, "Wow, how could he forget all this?" you know. It's such wide, you know, change of feelings that he has that you have in response to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, you know. He's—I don't know. I kind of (inaudible at 30:40)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think about that, you know that game people play with the flower with the petals? He loves me, he loves me not, he loves me, he loves—that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, that's Mark, you know. We'll be sitting out front with everybody and he'll say, "Give me a kiss." So it's like everybody knows. You're kissing me, you know. They automatically think that every time he comes over we're having sex, you know, and it's not like, you know, Mark, you don't want people knowing, but here you are, making out with me in front of everybody in the building, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he's wanting to at one minute keep you hidden and secretive, the other wants to announce it off the roof, you know, scream it from the rooftops.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I wouldn't mind but most of—well, I would say maybe ten out of 100 know Mark's mother-in-law because they play bingo all at the same place, you know. And they know that her daughter Keisha is married (inaudible at 31:53) Deborah is married to Mark. So, you know, like, they see him outside or, you know, coming in the door and they're like, you know, "OK. That's Margie's son-in-law," you know. You know, does he think something is not going to pop up all of sudden, you know. I don't know.</p>

<p>And then there's this Black lady. I don't know if she lives in the building, I don't know if she's a homemaker or what, but she's (pause)—I don't know, I'd say she's in her 60s. And she looks like she drinks quite a bit. (laughter) Well one day she's out in the parking lot and she says to Mark, "You got a cigarette?" He gave her a cigarette. "Well, you got a match?" (inaudible at 32:57) She goes, "I'm Dolores." He says, "Well my name's Mark," and then he came over and sat with me on the bench. (laughter) Well, every time Dolores sees Mark, she asks for a cigarette. So last week she was looking for Mark, so she asked one of the girls, "Are you the one that sits with Mark all the time?" So they said, "No, Mark who?" you know. And she said, "OK." (phone rings) (inaudible at 33:41) hello.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Deborah. So, I go to Mark, "Hey, your girlfriend's looking for you lately." He goes, "Who?" I says, "Dolores. She's been asking where you are and who's the girl that you come and see all the time." I says, "Should I just go out and, you know, tell her, hey, you know, listen, he's got a wife and he's got me. He doesn't need anymore." (laughter) I mean, you know, the guy is so friendly it's pitiful, you know. He just has one of those personalities...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He'll talk to anybody, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, you know. So he'll (inaudible at 34:30) saying to Deborah, "Oh yeah, you know, I got all these chicks that want me down at the (pause) the work, you know, workout world." And he was like, then Deborah will say, "Mark, you sit there but they're not Mark. They don't want anything to do with you Mark. They would not put up with your shit Mark." She says, "I guess the only two that put up with him (ph) is Deborah and my mother, you know. What's that to say Mark?"</p>

<p>The night before surgery, Mary came over at seven o'clock, lovely cousin Mary, because she's going to drive me in the morning. I have to be there by 6:30. So when she came in she was already two sheets to the wind. She drinks now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sheeze (inaudible at 35:37)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the big bottles of beer and their nips. As I said, seven o'clock, she's already intoxicated. She's standing and she's asleep. So, I mean, Deborah and I just piss out our pants laughing because she's so wacked out. And I mean wacked out. So, we get into—I'm sitting in my room because I'm watching TV in my room. So of course, she's going to sit on the bed and, you know, she's going to watch TV too. So, fine. I don't know what time we finally stopped laughing, maybe midnight. Oh, I had to give her ten dollars for gas to drive me in the morning. So, we get up, she's going to drive me. Well, she puts on the thing in the car that tells her how many miles she's driven. So, she says to me when we get to the hospital, "You know, that was nine miles I drove." That was another hint for more money. But she was going to come back and pick me up. [00:36:55]</p>

<p>So, I says, "OK, just drop me off." Oh no, she's going to come in to registration with me, she has to come upstairs to the third floor where the surgical daycare is, and it's just like, I don't even want people knowing she's with me. This is how bad she looked. So she's going to the nurse, "Well, when will she be done? She's here now at seven o'clock. So when will she be done, 7:30? What's with this two hour wait?" The lady says, "She'll be done when she's done and we'll give you a call." The nurse was getting pissed. I said, "OK, bye Mary. See you later. The car's running outside."</p>

<p>So when it came time for me to get picked up, the nurse says, "You want me to call Deborah?" And I said, "Yeah." So I says and, "OH, tell Deborah to give Mary another ten dollars for gas." The nurse says, "Who's Mary?" I says, "That's my cousin." She goes, "You have to pay her money?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "I had to give her ten to take me here." I says, "Now it's another ten for her to come back and get me." The lady says, "I don't believe that cannot be your cousin] (ph)." She's awful. [00:38:26]</p>

<p>So she gets to the house, drops me off and leaves, which I don't mind because she aggravates the fuck out of me. So she came over Friday night to visit. I'm in bed. I have to keep the arm elevated and, you know, I had the pillows all propped up, got my ice pack on. She's going to sit on the bed and use the pillows that I (inaudible at 38:54) to put her head on to watch TV. So by ten o'clock, I had had enough of listening to Mary. I had to say I was going to bed because other than that she wouldn't have left. Deborah was already out like a light on the couch. But if I didn't say I was going to sleep, she would've been there longer, because she doesn't want to go back to her room that she rents. I say, "Oh well, what can I tell you Mary?" you know.</p>

<p>I mean, here and I am dying in pain and she's going to sit there on the bed and tell me about this person and this person, people I don't even, you know, know. I'm like, yeah OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She just wants to have—she was (ph) taking that. [00:40:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Well, as I say, she doesn't want to go back to her apartment, so she wants to stay with someone till, like, 11 or 12 o'clock at night and then she'll go back to her apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you should charge her. You should charge her rent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. I should charge you to sit here Mary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Babysitting is ten dollars an hour.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you eat, you know, and all this. I have to feed you while you're here. Oh yeah, bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got a big heart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I don't know. Big heart but no brain it. You know, as I say, who's there to take care of me, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you got the big heart for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I said to Deborah, the first night I came home, I said, "You think you could make me some supper?" She gave me a bowl of cereal and cold cereal, gave me the spoon, and she said to me on her way out the door, "Don't choke on it." Do you think I could get a lot of that cereal up to my mouth? No, it spilled, the milk spilled, you know. I says, "Well, this is lovely." So that's when I learned to pick up the bowl and, you know. But it was kind of awkward with cold cereal, you know, instead of the Cream of Wheat that just goes down nice and smooth. No, this was chunks of, you know, flakes with nuts on it, which I don't mind eating when I have two hands and I can eat with the spoon, you know. this crap here, no. I says, oh well, she's so helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and they just don't give it, do they? They just don't have the heart. [00:42:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I say, you know, "Deborah, can you wrap up the hand so I can go in the shower?" Well, not only is the hand all wrapped up, then I need the bars to hold on to. She goes out the door and leaves me in the house to take a shower. Well, I'm afraid of falling, you know. Does that enter into Deborah's mind. "Oh, well I didn't know you wanted me to stay with you." "Well Deborah, what if I fall in the shower, you know? By the time you came back in, I would've bled to death, you know. You know, I can't get my bra on, I can't get this on. But, where's Deborah? She's outside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Listen, you really are coming up against their limitations, their inability to really take care of you and it's frustrating and it makes you mad. [00:43:05] Hurts your feelings and it frustrates you. [00:43:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Tell them they have] (ph) nothing to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They do not give you what you need. They are not there in that way [for you] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No no no no no. What the hell. All right, I guess my times up. I'll go get my door-to-door service. I got rid of my car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. What, just too much—yeah, what was the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Too much</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What led you to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Needed a lot of work done on it. And I had to insure it and the insurance was just too much from that one accident that I got into and two that Todd got into.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and they wanted it all up front—2,000 and something odd dollars.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For the insurance? [00:44:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I said forget that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Fourth one in the cars] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. That's the end of that car. Are you still talking the (inaudible at 44:26) because she's eligible, but she won't' do it. I said, the girl Tanya wanted to go to the Square on the bus, to go to McDonald's. She says, "Come on Deborah." Deborah says, "I'm not getting on a bus, because I'll wind up getting into a fight with someone on the bus."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She'll lose her temper and somebody will bump her, yeah. She does not like—that one is not good with frustration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. I says, it's lucky—she's now walking up there with Tanya, and they'll go into Dunkin Donuts and sit there and have a coffee, you know. She's found a new friend in Tanya. [00:45:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old is Tanya?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tanya is 49 or 48, I think. But mentally, she's probably about (pause) maybe 30, you know. She's a little slow. But yeah. So, that's the good. The two of them, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somebody, that companion, yeah (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's got more friends in there than I do, you know. (inaudible at 45:52)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah, let me know for that Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Yeah, I'll call them when I get home. [00:46:00]</p>

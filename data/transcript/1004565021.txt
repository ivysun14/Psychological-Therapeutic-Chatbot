<p>CLIENT: Good morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's warm in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to turn it down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's fine. I'll adjust. I think it's just from walking. I just need a minute to calm down. I was in Chicago over the weekend with our friends Emma and James, Emma's best friend Kim was there. My best friend, Chrissie, lives there so we all went out. Chris finished school. That was really exciting last week and we had been looking for so long for a gift for him. He said he wanted a watch almost since he started school so for a gift I thought I'd get him a watch when he graduated. We'd been looking and looking and I asked his friend James and then his best friend Adam to help. I was so nervous. He's really difficult. (laughs) And he loved it. That was a big relief. We went out to dinner on Friday and took off early Saturday morning. 00:02:27</p>

<p>A couple things happened this week where I'm in situations where I feel frustrated by other peoples' behavior and I feel wronged and I can't get over it in the moment. In the moment I'm so almost furious and the other people aren't addressing it and it makes me livid and I can't get over it. I'm so pissed. One of them happened at work and one of them happened this weekend with Emma. I guess I'll start with last week at work. Last week was just a rainy Thursday and I stomped to work in the rain thinking how can I ever walk there and I walk in the door and the kids are all talking to me and they're yelling, "We're going to the dentist. We're going to the dentist." I was like, "Oh, okay." I'm just a little irritated. Usually I get there at 8:15 so that they can rush out the door to get Sadie to school by 8:30, so that's why I get there at 8:15. They're most of the time just putzing around, just sitting down for breakfast, a lot of times like, "Oh, woke up real late today." Most of the time I can kind of swallow it and find laundry to do or something, but sometimes [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:51) if you texted me that you're running a half hour late, I would have gladly stayed at home for half an hour and done something. [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:00) I get there and they're just sitting down and Andrea says, "Oh, yeah, we're going to [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:13) at 9:30. I totally forgot about it until last night." I was like, "Okay, so we'll all go together then." I'm still standing in the door with my boots on because the kids are on top of me. She was like, "No, I think I can handle it. I think I can manage it." I was like, "Okay, so what's going to happen right now?" and she was like, "I need to do some work upstairs for a little bit and I need you to watch the kids and then you're going to be off from 9:30 to 11." Unpaid. I just felt that's fine. It's frustrating. I equate it to coming here. I would never schedule an appointment with you from 8:30 to 9:15, walk in here at 8:30 and be like, "Hi, I only have 15 minutes actually." I'm going to show up at 8:45, come here for 15 minutes and that's all I'm going to pay you for? "But thanks for your time. See you later." I get there and she's like, "Okay, we're going to eat breakfast and then I'm going to do some work upstairs. You're off from 9:30 to 11. You can do whatever you want." And that's great, but you couldn't have e-mailed me last night or even this morning and I could have brought my running shoes or a book or knitting or something? I felt like her time was so much more valuable than mine and I was totally disregarded. I just felt like [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:45) in just the way it was brought up to me. No apology or where you say "I'm sorry, I wish I had told you earlier." No "Sorry, I forgot to mention that to you." It was just really factual, really straightforward and it just pissed me off. In the moment, I'm irritated and I can't get through it. So they all sat down for breakfast for the next half hour. Fifty percent of the time I'll find chores to do or I'll sit at the table with them and chat, but it was like I can't sit here and chat with you. I'm so irritated. I'm finding laundry to do and I'm finding dishes to do. I'm clearly irritated and I was irritated the whole rest of the day every time I saw her. For me, I felt like, "I'm only here for six more weeks. There's no point in me bringing this up." If I'm honest with myself, I'm still pissed about the Chicago trip that I was like my choice is either come with them and stay in a one-bedroom apartment or take a week off unpaid. I just felt like, "And you're just kind of walking all over me again." I just felt annoyed, but I just didn't bring it up. It was like, "I have six more weeks of this. What's the point? And you're not hiring a nanny after me so it's not like I'm doing someone after me any service by saying 'Heads up. You should really give someone a little bit of a heads up in that [ ]. (inaudible at 00:07:24)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are they doing after you leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The girls are going to go to school full time. So this weekend Emma and I made these plans for this trip. We'd all talked about going to Chicago together, the four of us, for a really long time before we even moved. Emma and James took off late Friday night to stay with her best friend Kim. I booked the ticket with Susan early Saturday morning and we were going to get in at 11. Emma and I talked about how great that was, because 11 AM is still late enough for them to sleep in, because they really like to sleep in, but early enough for us to get started and have a full day. We would meet at [inaudible], this restaurant that my best friend, Chrissie, used to work at and we would have a quick bite of lunch and then go on with the day. She knew we were getting in to (inaudible at 00:08:16) the whole time. At nine I texted everybody and I say, "We're on the bus. Everything looks on time. Chris and I are going to go to the hotel and check in, then we're going to go to the restaurant." I gave them the address of the hotel, told them where it was like, "Let me know where you want to meet and we'll go from there." Emma then says, "Well, we're just making breakfast, so I don't know if we'll really be ready when you're coming so why don't you guys grab a bagel?" I don't like talking on the phone on the bus. I think it's totally rude, so I just text her back, "We probably won't be able to eat at the restaurant until noonish." It's a big thing, too. It's not like it's a restaurant; it's like a market. You walk around. I was like, "We've already eaten breakfast. We won't be there until noonish, so if you want to come then that's fine." 00:09:18</p>

<p>We check into the hotel. I go and wait for my best friend, Chrissie, and Chris stays back at the hotel to wait for them. It's nice because Chrissie and I get to hang out together, have our own time, chat. We're chatting and waiting and chatting and waiting and they don't show up until one. (chuckles) That's two hours later than we had originally said, and I had gone with the original plan. I woke up at 5 AM from my house, packed myself a little breakfast, ate it on the bus because we talked about the plan being we would meet at 11, walk around a bit and eat lunch. I had been awake and I'm cranky and that's a whole other thing. (chuckles) It's like, "You're not holding up your end of the bargain," first of all, and second of all — two hours later when we only have two days? It really just bothers me. So they show up a little after one and I'm clearly irritated. I'm just like, "Hi," and I don't really say anything and I haven't seen her best friend, Kim, and I was rude. I was really rude. It was just like, "Hey, everybody." No hugs and whatever. Emma's like, "What's up?" a few minutes in. And I said, "We planned to meet at 11 and it's one, and I'm annoyed. I'm hungry. I get really grouchy when I need food." (chuckles) She's like, "I thought it was a loose plan." And she makes [ ]. (inaudible at 00:10:50) I was like, "Whatever. It's fine. It's fine. Let's just move on with the day. Let's just go on with the day." So we go on with the day and we do a food festival, we go on a long walk and we're going through this park and we make a plan to go onto the ferry. At that point we're on the subway, which is a ferry, and I'm talking to Chrissie on one side of the train and they're on the other side of the train. Chrissie's a foodie. She's really into restaurants. She's into the new hip restaurant, and every time we've gone we've waited over two hours to get in to eat somewhere. I'm saying it's five o'clock now, we're going to do this ferry, we're going to get to the hotel, we're going to have to go back to the hotel, everybody's going to have to shower. We're in this one giant room. By the time we get to a restaurant it's going to be eight or nine. I'm telling Chrissie, "I just want to give you the heads up. It takes them a long time to get ready, especially Emma. It takes her awhile to get ready, so maybe we should try to schedule dinner — because we're all okay eating anywhere. I'm okay grabbing a slice of pizza, but Chrissie wants to eat at "the place". I'm trying to tell her that so everybody has the pieces of the puzzle. We're walking up to the ferry and I say to Emma, "Alright, so it's five o'clock now and we're going to do this and by the time we get back it's going to be pretty late." I don't even finish getting the words out of my mouth. I'm not just saying that I was saying it that way because, trust me, I know that sometimes I come across harshly. I asked Chrissie who was sitting there, "Was I saying it aggressively?" because I need to know for myself. (chuckles) [00:12:35] She was like, "No, that wasn't aggressive." So Emma — I don't even finish what I'm saying - and she just launches into, "I know. I get it. I take too long," and starts yelling at me in this ferry station. She says, "It's my vacation and I'm going to do what I want. I don't want to be rushed. If I want to take an hour and a half to get ready, you guys can go on without me. Just go on without me." I just start saying, "Okay, okay. Relax. I'm just saying we don't have enough time so I want to be conscious." I just kind of walk away to get some space, but afterwards it was the same thing. I was pissed. I was super pissed. I just wanted her to say, "I'm sorry. That was kind of an overreaction. I apologize for that," because in the past when I have overreactions like that, I would try to right after say, "I'm sorry I just jumped down your throat," but there was nothing. We went on the ferry ride, and then she doesn't talk about it and she just tries to pretend it didn't happen and go on with everything and I can't. [00:13:46] I have no ability to do that. I can't do that. It doesn't serve me well. In those situations, that doesn't serve me well because what I either need to do is I need to pull Emma aside and say, "That was really harsh. That really hurt my feelings. It's not just about you. There are five other people you need to think about and that's all I was pointing out," and that's what I needed to say. But instead, she's off with her best friend and I'm off with my best friend and Chris and James are in their own world, and there's just this layer of tension that exists. Eventually a few hours later I can get over it and pretend everything is okay, but it still takes me awhile. There's still then she'll get a jab in; I'll get a jab in. The next morning we both woke up and I had gone out to do something. I came back to the room and said I was going to check out and she asked to come with me. She just said, "Is there something you need to say to me?" I said, "I don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean? What do I need to say to you?" She said, "You're pissed at me, clearly. Honestly, I feel there's something I'm waiting for you to say to me. I was really waiting for an apology because you jumped down my throat. I just don't think I deserved it because I felt like the way that I said that was factual and I wasn't trying to be aggressive. I was just trying to point out that we were kind of on a time crunch and I know that you generally take longer to get ready." She pointed out that she takes it as a criticism because earlier in the day her taking a long time had been a criticism and then I guess she overheard me on the subway saying to Chrissie that she takes a long time to get ready. So when I started to say the thing at the ferry to her about the time, she took it all as a criticism. And I can relate to that. I'm the same way and I said that to her. I said, "Yes, I understand that because if I had been in your shoes that's how I would have felt." I would have felt like it was a criticism and I understand that. That being said, in the situation I think you overreacted." [00:16:05] It took her awhile. We went around in circles for a while. Eventually she came to the point where she apologized and I apologized for not taking her aside and saying it to her alone — saying it to her in front of Chrissie and Kim — but I just kick myself in these situations because I'm on the ferry and talking to Chrissie and she said, "Just don't let it get to you. Just move on. Just suck it up. Ignore it. Let's move on to have a good time right now," and I can't do that. I can't do that. I'm upset because — we had a great day yesterday. We talked yesterday morning and the whole day was great. But Saturday, Chris was upset and I take my frustration out on Chris. Chris and James knew there was something going on. That sucks for them when their wives are mad at each other. It's awkward for Chrissie and Kim, who are both our respective best friends so they feel like they need to — it adds to everybody's mood and it creates this level of . . . I don't know. The things I'm able to do — I'm able to say, "I'm sorry," to Kim. Say I was in the shower at the hotel and it was just Kim and I in the room and I say, "Hey, I'm sorry. This has been kind of an awkward day. I apologize for [ ]. (inaudible at 00:17:33) I'm sorry. Things get weird sometimes." But that's what I'm able to do. I'm not able to address the real thing. It's not practical. (chuckles) It really frustrates me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The real thing is that Emma and I were mad at each other and I couldn't just pull her aside and have that moment out. What needed to happen was that she needed to tell me how she was hurt. I needed to tell her how I was hurt. We needed to both apologize for those things and move on with it; but instead what happened was we just acted mad at each other the whole day. I get defensive because I know that a part of the thing that made her late — I didn't know this is what made her late — but she told me yesterday morning that they were two hours late because she had to try on five [ ], (inaudible at 00:18:53) which I know is what Emma does. She said, "I had to try on five different outfits because you and Chrissie are so intimidating when you are together." She told me before she feels intimidated by Chrissie and I when we're together. I knew that going into it and I knew that was the situation the whole day. I felt like I was being portrayed as the bad guy, so I tried to bring the four of us together. I'd make conversation that the four of us were included in but, naturally, what would happen is we would break off into pairs, especially when you're walking through a city. Nobody walks together in a six-person clump so, naturally, the pairs that break off are Chris and James, Emma and Kim, me and Chrissie. Emma brought it up again. She said, "You and Chrissie were off in your own little world." I was like, "You know, you're seeing it that way and that really bothers me because I don't think I'm the bad guy here. That's just what happened. That's just what happens in those situations. I can't be the bad guy after the fact that everybody kind of pairs off in those situations. I think you have to admit, Emma, that I tried to make conversation happen between the four of us at any given opportunity." 00:20:10</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure how what she said made you the bad guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she said, "You and Chrissie were off in your own little world doing your little thing," because she said before that when me and Chrissie are together she feels excluded. It's saying that I'm excluding her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean that's what she said to me. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She said you're excluding her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what she said to me before. She said, "When you and Chrissie are around I feel like you don't include me and all you do is pay attention to Chrissie."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not getting it. I'm getting what you're saying. It sounds like you — I guess I see why you feel like the bad guy. Yeah. 00:21:02</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know what to do because I just felt like the whole day I don't know how I could win. Emma is really into [Judy] (inaudible at 00:21:22), and so she'll hover with them. She'll stay with Kim because that's her best friend. That's who she'll feel secure with, so she stays with her. I would try to engage the two of them, but then they wouldn't be as good about including Chrissie and I would feel like, "Chrissie's left out now." I just felt this weird . . . so what ended up happening . . . I don't know . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling accused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I was right. Because she said it to me Sunday morning. She said, "You're off doing your own thing." Well, that's kind of impossible because we're going as a group doing all these things together. We're all taking a walk through the park together. We're all on the ferry together. We're all at dinner together. In the same breath, earlier in the night she had said, "If I'm taking too long, just go on without me. Just leave." 00:22:32</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're taking this all very personally. I think that's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it is personal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No it isn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How is it not?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's coming from a place of feeling really insecure, and I guess she's sort of blaming people for that. She's not taking that on herself, but it's not really about you. You're feeling like you need to defend yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I get blamed. (chuckles) I mean, yeah, I do need to defend myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who cares if she's blaming you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then she's complaining to James about it, her husband, because then I'm the bad guy. Who wants to be the bad guy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what's really striking — that you feel like the bad guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just . . . I don't know. (pause) Because she says, "You're the bad guy because . . ."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who cares what she says?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's my friend. Shouldn't I care? 00:23:48</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she's feeling really insecure. She's going to see you that way. She's going to see you that way. I don't know. I guess people feel insecure. I guess she's expressing it in a particular way. You're getting sucked into that particular way. I think defending yourself isn't very practical. It's not going to do anything, but you're sort of coming ready-made to feel like the bad guy — that you need to defend your actions. You don't feel like you could say to her, "I'm really sorry you feel left out."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because what she'll say to that is, "You're making me feel left out. You're over there with Chrissie." What do I say to that, because I am? I'm having a conversation with Chrissie, you know? But in the way that the group breaks down, I tend to be the one that sort of falls into — I don't want to say leadership because that sounds really stupid — kind of the one in those situations . . . When it's just the four of us, Emma's usually running the show. We all just kind of fall in line with Emma. When it's a bigger group, I'm kind of the one coordinating all the pieces to the puzzle . . . I don't know where I was going with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, where were you going? 00:25:36</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like then, by default, if anything goes wrong it's my fault. If I'm the one saying, "Let's go do this," I feel responsible if it doesn't go well but it doesn't, then it fell on me because I was the one suggesting it. And then I feel this responsibility for everyone to have a good time. Yesterday Chrissie was the one who [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:19) of the restaurant, the first place we went. Chrissie somehow just sort of knows the area better even though Emma's best friend, Kim, lives there, too, and so we'd rely on Chrissie a lot to get us from point A to point B. Chrissie is my best friend so I was like the lifeline between Chrissie and the rest of the group. She knows everybody but it's like wrangling. If I'm in that role I know it makes Emma uncomfortable because she's usually the one in charge. I know that she immediately gets her defenses up because she is used to running the show. 00:27:06</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you feel uncomfortable if you just let her run the show?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing about that situation, too, is that she wouldn't even feel comfortable running the show because she is intimidated by Chrissie. She wouldn't want that either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why do you need to run the show? I guess I don't understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because everyone is standing there saying, "Alright, what are we doing next?" I feel like a decision needs to be made.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we can't just stand there twiddling our thumbs. That bugs me. It's like, "Alright, let's do something. Come on. Let's go. I'm ready to go. I'm not saying I'm running the show. The park we went to — it was James's idea to go to that park. I was just the one, since I knew Chrissie knew how to get there, I felt like it was my job because I'm James's friend and I'm Chrissie's friend. "James was thinking about going to this (inaudible at 00:28:17) Park. How do we get there and what do we do?" I felt this need to take control in that way. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel that everything is up to you and no one else is capable or willing to do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, mostly nobody else is really willing to do anything in that situation. I know for sure about Hudson park because they would happily just — like it was the middle of the day (chuckles) and we saw a bar where people are having a dance party and they're like, "Let's go there." Not. Let's not go sit inside at 4 PM on this gorgeous day. And they would honestly be happy to just sit and not do anything. (laughs) Isn't it sick? That's just not good. We just spent $40 on the bus tickets and $100 each on a hotel room. Let's not just sit and do the same thing we could do at home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They couldn't go do that? 00:29:25</p>

<p>CLIENT: They could. And we said that. We said, "You guys can go do that. We're going to go do this," because we had plans to go to the ferry. "You guys go ahead. We'll meet you back at the hotel if you want."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm trying to help us understand is why you're taking these roles.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm a control maniac.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what that means.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It bothers me if people aren't falling in line.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With what.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With the plan. I don't care if I'm the one planning it. If there's a plan, I need it to be followed through with. I need things to go how they were going to go. I wasn't the one that made the plan that we would meet at the restaurant. I mean I was. I was a part of that. Emma and I sat down together and chatted about what everybody wanted. She had talked to James about it and Chris and I had talked about it. Then Emma and I got together to talk about that. She and I together made this plan and I felt like . . . 00:30:48</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stick to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But also, you can't see how frustrating it would be to not get started until one in the afternoon? I was literally sitting there twiddling my thumbs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not if you don't care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I spent all the money to get there and to . . I mean . . I don't know. I do care because why would I do that? What's the point of doing something if you just don't care about it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying you shouldn't care about that, but it seems that you really care about the plan. 00:31:27</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I was hemmed in. (laughs) If you know you're going into a city and you only have 36 hours, then it's like you kind of have to go into it with a plan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not everybody feels that way. That's important to you, but it seems like you're frustrated it's not important to anybody else. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it being important to you, but you're frustrated to know people weren't falling in line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So how do I get what I need without . . ? Because there are times that I just . . . like the dinner thing. The other thing is that I get really cranky if I'm hungry. Part of me knows that. I know that if we go to a restaurant at 9 PM and we have to wait two hours to get sat, I'm going to be really hungry and more than likely I'm going to be cranky. That's what I was trying to do with coordinating everybody's time. I was trying to get what I need. I know there's a middle ground somewhere. 00:32:35</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can go get pizza ahead of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not going to go eat pizza and then sit and watch everybody eat dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but you really want everybody to take on your agenda.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't need it to be . . . I don't know. (pause) Yeah, I just need people to take on AN agenda. (chuckles) Somebody else can write the plan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were other people upset about eating late? Were they complaining?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My husband has complained a lot in the past. It's a big . . that's the thing of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he complaining then? 00:33:21</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I knew he would have. Absolutely. No, he would have. I just know him. Emma also gets really cranky when she's hungry. She hadn't eaten all day because she has this weird eating style. So when we were all at the food festival eating, she just sat there and watched us all eat. And that's fine. That's her choice, but I felt like another part of it is she's not getting it and she was starving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not your responsibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that, but it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're the only one that wants to do something and groups are tough, you can go do it on your own or you could go with the group. And if it's really important for other people, too, they'll help execute a plan. You're the only one trying to execute a plan. It's clearly not important to anybody else. 00:34:11</p>

<p>CLIENT: But everybody was trying to go to dinner and nobody wanted to eat dinner . . . I feel like nobody had all the pieces to the puzzle. Nobody would have said, "Yeah, I'm okay with eating dinner at eleven." I promise you that no one in our group would have said that, absolutely no one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you getting support in your agenda?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like were other people supporting the idea of going early and so forth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, nobody knew that we'd gotten there at five. We're in the city, so nobody knows that since we're at the bottom of the city right now we have to go . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're going to keep at this. 00:34:59</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really am. Yes, I was getting support in the fact that people wanted to eat dinner earlier than 11 PM. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were they doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Asking Chrissie and I where we should eat dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then why were you frustrated?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it was put onto us like, "Where should we go? Where should we go? Should we make a reservation? What's the hot shit? Where's the best spot? Where's [ ]" (inaudible at 00:35:34) If you want to go to the best place, then we need to get a move on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because otherwise we're going to have to wait until 9 PM to eat dinner. I just like feel everybody . . . I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to let what will happen happen. It will get late. If other people are upset about it they could do something about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But I just don't see it that way. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't see it that way. Because when that's happened before, Chris will take it like, "Oh, Chrissie's obsessed with going to the best, coolest restaurant."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not your problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes that is because she's my best friend and he's my husband and I don't want him to be making fun of her behind her back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In those situations I try to make sure everybody gets ready, we can get out the door by 7 PM to get to a restaurant at 7:30 and eat dinner at a reasonable hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that role — it doesn't seem like you're happy about that. It doesn't seem like that brings you comfort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it is. When it works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When everybody falls in line?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. (pause) I have no problems with that. (laughs) I know I'm not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I just know in that situation when people are looking to you to say like, "What should we do?" then what do I say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if they ask what to do and then they don't listen to you then, "Well if you don't want to listen to me, then I'm not really sure."</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's so infuriating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's like this list of ideas and demands that people have for the day and it's like, "Alright, I'm going to try to help you execute that and get that done. Then you need to kind of like follow along." No? that's not how that works? (chuckles) It's a give and take, don't you think?</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some people don't want their weekend that structured. They may say things but they don't really want their weekend that structured. 00:38:47</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if they do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if they do, they go along with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They go along with it, just really slowly. It's really annoying. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they're doing it at their own pace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahh I hate their pace.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really hate waiting for other people. It's so infuriating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think upsets you so much about it? 00:39:17</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know — just why are you taking so long? (chuckles) It's so annoying. I just don't know what takes people so long. I truly don't understand. I have no idea, but I just find it kind of rude. I feel like it's completely rude. You don't have respect for other people. You're keeping everybody else waiting so you can dawdle around and try on five outfits and I literally don't know what people do. I just feel like it's really disrespectful and just rude. I guess I'm also a person who doesn't take a lot of time to do things. I just don't. It just wouldn't take me an hour and a half to get ready. That's just another part of it. I just don't understand how it takes you an hour and a half to get ready. 00:40:31</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're intolerant that other people might take that long?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if you're making me wait for you. Don't you think that's rude? I'm sorry. If I have a plan to meet you at 8:00 and you show up at 8:30 just because you didn't budget your time well . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So my job is to help understand what upsets you so much and why you take roles that you do. What my personal feeling is — if you don't like to wait, don't do things in groups. Do not do things in groups. Groups take — add two hours to any task (chuckles) — a group of six people? 00:41:09</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And I needed to go into it. The night before I didn't get any sleep and I woke up at 5:30 to take the bus. It was bad planning on my part. I knew when the day started this was such fore-planning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess some people just don't care and they don't want a structured weekend and maybe they throw out a lot of ideas, but it's so important to you and that's what I want to look at. I'm not saying you're wrong. I want to understand your investment in these things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like people are not being polite. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems like that's a big piece. You feel like you're not being considered.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that like I can't believe I'm friends with such a rude person. You're incredibly rude and I don't want to be friends with a really rude person. 00:42:06</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my husband is married to their best friend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People's spouses have friends all the time that they don't hang out with. It seems like that's a big piece. You feel like you have no choice. You're stuck with these people. You're worried you're not going to get what you need, so you have to really try to force your agenda on them to get what you need because you're stuck with them. And my sense is that there's something — I hate to sort of be cliché. I don't think the things have one-to-one correlation, but there is something about your family that's getting stimulated in these situations, like you're stuck with these people, no choice, no one is paying any attention to you, and your basic needs are being neglected - like eating. You have no options. You're stuck with them, and you're trying to rally them, corral them, so that maybe you can get what you need. You feel you don't have any options, whereas I guess all along you didn't like the suggestions of the many, but I'm simply putting out that you do have options. If you need to eat, you could go ahead of time. 00:43:32</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I found an apple. I ate an apple.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could do all sorts of things. You could have a pretzel in the park. You could get a slice of pizza and then have it at dinner, there are so many options that you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want to be the outlier. And that's my other thing, then I'm the outlier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're the outlier for having a piece of pizza and then having an appetizer at dinner? You're very, very sensitive to ways in which you [are going to be perceived] (inaudible at 00:44:03) so you get stuck in these two positions. Either you have to get everyone together and get them on a plan or you're this weirdo outsider and you feel those are your only two options. This is what gets stimulated in a group of people for you. I mean, don't get me wrong. Groups can be stressful for lots of people for exactly that reason. The other thing is that you really deeply personalize it. I mean, groups are just unwieldy. I mean, it takes forever. Add two hours onto dinnertime with groups, but it feels so personal to you. I'm not saying that people aren't being disrespectful in particular instances, but you have a particular set of expectations of a group being on a schedule, which is like — basically my take-home message about that is good luck. (chuckles) 00:44:50</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. And it's all very logical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it is logical. In some ways I'm not being fair to you because I'm pointing out the logic and not getting into your feelings; but I feel like your feelings are you're trying to put them into practice. I'm trying to create a space for you to reflect on them and not invalidate you. It's not that I don't see your point of view. I'm simply communicating that there are a lot of feelings that we need to look at in your point of view. You know, we're going to need to actually stop. I'll see you on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Sounds great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. You, too. Bye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye.</p>

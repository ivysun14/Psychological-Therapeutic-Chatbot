<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, we had our last session on, wow, [DATE] so the very first order of business will be Happy New Year, better late than never.  How is this new year treating you ma'am.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hm.  It's there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't sound - you look very tired.  Is that correct?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm tired, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What is this tiredness from?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The same old stuff, the house, the job, the kids, financial, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is your new home going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What four years?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  I remember when you bought the house you were enjoying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a mess.  I don't feel like cleaning it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why are you not cleaning it?  Are you running out of physical energy or emotionally you are not up to it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Both.  I um told you they were gonna do the surgery where they, I didn't know if they were gonna, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] didn't tell me they were gonna, what is it deflate the lungs. Is that what they do?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Collapse the lungs.  Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Collapse, collapse the lungs, I didn't know that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not collapse the lung, why because of fluid collection?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, they were going to go in and cut the nerves for the fingers.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And why they do it is, I didn't know that, he didn't tell me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He just said they go here and go under and cut the nerves in my neck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I didn't know how they do it is they go through the lungs and collapse them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So they couldn't do it because the lungs were too scarred.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your lungs are scarred from what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, they didn't know and um, I went to see a different doctor, [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he wanted me to go see a rheumatologist -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they sent me to [PHYSICIAN NAME] in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh he said I had what is it, starts with an s, it's not Lupus, it's not rheumatoid arthritis, where your body hardens and scars, scardema, something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Scleroderma.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Scleroderma.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that what they're saying?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Anyhow they went in to do the surgery and they couldn't do it and um, I had to spend the night in the hospital with a chest tube.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then I got two of those scars and like a thousand dollars later in insurance, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that was your full pay without much of a return huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and you know, like you get back something like eight hundred dollars in income tax, it's like okay, a little bit to work with.  [INAUDIBLE] hospital bill.  Wow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is your daughter doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah a teenager, a lot of teenage stuff, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  You know there will be some difficulties in terms of behavior from a teenager but in the same token because she is growing up she might change the role from being the daughter to a friend.  Is that happening?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No uh, like I said, her dad probably fooled her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she was also having problems with the step mom, was she not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well just the past year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like I said, he said he always fooled her then the stepmom comes and he doesn't, I mean, every time she asks who the three will be he's like, you know then uh in our settlement he was supposed to pay three hundred dollars a month plus shared custody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which was we would share the other expenses you know also -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or else it would be double the child support.  Instead we just [INAUDIBLE] and ask her dad for seven dollars to go fishing with her grandma.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For fishing license.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the stepmother's sittin there and she goes, well what does your mom do with the three hundred dollar a month we pay her?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she is not having a good relationship with her stepmom, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or her dad either no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not dad either?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is your daughter now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's [AGE], she'll be [AGE] in September.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At least she has grown up pretty much, matured more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's a good kid.  I mean she has a 4.0 grade average and she's worried about college, what she's gonna do, she's in the National Honor Society.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Whew.  So she's, she's from a study standpoint she's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I keep telling her, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Encourage her on that because you know -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do and she keeps trying to see this little boy.  I keep trying to tell her you know I kinda did that, you know, I had to support, you know, and don't be stupid and end up like me, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's all I wanted to say, it's gonna be okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Unfortunately your life can be a teaching example for her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, when I went in the [DEIDENTIFIED] I had like a one forty eight I Q and I uh only went to the eighth grade and took my G E D when I turned eighteen and matched all the scores and it's like how did I end up here.  You know?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Physically how are you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fingers hurt. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if it's summertime it would it not be a little bit easier on you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's still.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Winters are more difficult, aren't they?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I think they're just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you do [DEIDENTIFIED] work, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it all right to do the computer work typing and all that stuff or is it difficult?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have to [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Having talked to your rheumatologist, have you had the consult that you might be a candidate for the surgery?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but it's the same thing I'm getting now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's the same thing I'm getting now, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well what happens is that because of the nature of your physical illness, if you expose yourself to a very demanding environment, 'cause most of the hospital work that you do are demanding, then it will have a negative impact on your physical health, but if you generate just about the same kind of money and get some time to relax then your physical health might get better.  Obviously you understand that I'm not an expert on that area, but having seen some of the [INAUDIBLE] what we used to call psychosomatic illness.  If you [INAUDIBLE] that in the long run that might be better for you.  You should seriously consider that.  You can actually do your part time work on top of that to meet certain, keep your income at certain low levels.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think too it has to do with medical 'cause  I'm paying like a hundred dollars a month insurance -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they have all the deductibles then everything else, just like I'm paying for it though [INAUDIBLE] and everything else, I can't afford that, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Talk to them, I'm sure they'll be able to find out or negotiate something, because uh, as young as you are ma'am, uh it's absolutely unacceptable to write yourself off.  Your life is not over, physically or emotionally speaking.  In any sense of the word.  You have to find and you have to believe that you may not be back waiting to anticipate function but your quality of life can be a comfort if you play the cards right.  Because if you had just a broken hip or high blood pressure or something, then work stress might not be as much relevant, but because of either rheumatoid arthritis or Lupus or scleroderma, all these diseases - emotional stress, either from work or from home or finals or what, and all these, they leave you more stressed.  You may not be actually giving yourself enough time to recover, physically.  If you make some turn around physically, your emotional health will improve too and will make my job easier.  You know what I mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm smiling but there is truth to it.  Overall quality might improve, so talk to your rheumatologist about this, don't shield it.  The worst thing that can happen is they say no.  You don't quit the job before, if you have proof, then tell them that I want to work part time.  That will give you a little bit more time to relax and relaxation can have a long lasting releasing occur for time because of the nature of the physical illness.  [INAUDIBLE] as young as you are, but because I have known you over five years now, I have seen how gradually things have gotten downhill mainly physically, so look into that, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And from our last visit in December you are on Cymbalta 60 mg in the morning. Are you taking it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I want to increase it to 90 mg.  You take it in the morning or at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it make you sleepy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Adderall 10 mg twice a day.  What is it doing for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Adderall?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It helps get me out of bed and get going in the morning to where I can at least get up and function, whereas if I don't take it I just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Flexeril 10 mg, 20?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think it's Flexeril, is it?  It's Trazadine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh [PHYSICIAN NAME] gave you the Flexeril, the other name being Cyclobenzaprine at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that what you're taking or you are taking -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking that, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you are taking 20 mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's writing you the prescription right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it was good until uh I think May, he wrote it for a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and you said you are also taking Trazadone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh I think it's Trazadine?  Is that the same thing? I don't know if that's Flexeril.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Flexeril's other name is Cyclobenzaprine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No this starts with T I Z.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tizanidine is that for the bladder?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he said it's a muscle relaxer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, Tizanidine can be that too.  Usually it's called muscle relaxer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE], whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he's giving you the Flexeril prescription, I'm writing Cymbalta and Adderall right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not Flexeril though, it's Trizine -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you are not taking the Flexeril?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm sorry.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have the exact name?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know its T I Z I D I N E. He said it's a muscle relaxer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought I had it but this is something else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't use Tizanidine that much but I think it's for bladder spasm, I might be wrong.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Why would they give me a muscle relaxer to help me sleep?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what bladder spasm is muscle relaxer for. There are two types of muscles, one is a skeletal muscle which Flexeril is for and there is smooth muscles, some people have stomach cramps or bladder spasms that they have to urinate more often and sometimes they cannot control it so they can use muscle relaxant which is a smooth muscle relaxer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why he gave me it to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It can help you sleep.  Okay.  I'll get the - check it with him for sure what it is.  I'm not -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't go to him anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because uh I asked him to lower the patch, cause it was like 75 -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What the [INAUDIBLE] patch -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No - yeah and it was 75 and I think lowered it to 25 and he didn't feel like it would be enough so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you stopped going there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I haven't been there on the patch in a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is the pain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It hurts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So who has - who is providing that service to -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To lower that, [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like, like I take half one in the morning and half one at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 7.5</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Chloratab.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh okay.  So I will increase the Cymbalta to 90 mg.  I'll leave the Adderall the way that it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what it's always been.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The last Adderall written was, it's time because we wrote it in [DATE], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me check if we faxed anything.  No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And now with the Cymbalta, I lost that script in the [INAUDIBLE], and what was it the Adderall, they said it musta went somewhere else because I never got it.  It's like, my God.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cymbalta that's not common 90 mg.  So to make your copay one of them I will write 30 mg, three of them in the morning.  That will make one prescription so you don't have to pay two copays.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you take all three of them, if it does make you sleepy you can easily change it to nighttime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As long as you take once a day you should be fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  The rheumatologist, he's starting me on some kind of drug, I think it starts with a P, I can't get the injections because of the breast infections.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it starts with P, I can't think of it - says it could take up to six months to start workin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm not sure I know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying to think.  Anyhow it's for -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long ago you started it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Only the thirteenth of this month.  It could take up to six months to start working.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You have a beautiful view from here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank you.  The view has not changed ever since you've been coming to this office.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe it's just the clouds.  How many miles can you see?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't have any time to see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You don't have any time to look out the window?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm always chasing the goose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's terrible you have such a beautiful view and never have time to enjoy it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any questions for me?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here is your Adderall 10 mg, one twice a day, I gave you a month's supply you cannot get a refill on that.  And the Cymbalta I wrote 30 mg, three of them in the morning, the total will be 90 - a month's supply with two refills on that.  And I'll see you back about what, six to eight weeks seems reasonable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you seeing anybody in counseling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How come?  Why not [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that and lashing out, like I said.  It'd be good to, just get through each day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I can suggest, I'll find out there's a program here called [DEIDENTIFIED] where they have a program to train the social workers and they look for volunteers for counseling purpose and they will provide it free.  These are students but they are supervised.  That will be something you can get free and will be something better than nothing because trust me you are relying on medication only and you have many issues you are dealing with.  Medication alone is not going to cure it.  You need to have counseling.  Financially if you cannot afford it, I can talk to somebody who is a teacher there to see if he is willing to do that or not.  You need a counselor much, much more than you need me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Trust me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been there, it's just the same old - you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you need to [INAUDIBLE] ma'am.  I do medication management, I do not offer therapy.   Sitting down and talking, if need be crying, that helps your emotion you cannot bottling them, and lot going on in your life.  You need to get them out.  Should I talk with this person or not?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let me see if the medicine is gonna start working and I'll start going -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not going to do it, I'm telling you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm talking about the medication he has me on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And then when you are ready, let me know.  Because treatment of major depression is recommended to have a combination of medication and therapy for you to get best results, and in your case takes it so long to get it because of your physical health, your marriage situation, teenage child, work pressure, things are adding up.  We need to be as aggressive as we can, otherwise our chances of winning this game will be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Think about it - I really, really mean it.  All right?  See you in about six to eight weeks.  If you need me, call me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Drive safe.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I appreciate ya.  Don't leave this. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good bye. </p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So when did you get back?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When did I?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Last Wednesday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you got a week off at least.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how's it going out there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's going really good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, you're liking it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I like it a lot, it just gets pretty stressful not having friends out there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you've got one friend out there is all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just one other guy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You plus one other guy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's who I live with.  I mean we really haven't met anyone else out there or anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And where are you now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Santa Fe, Santa Clara.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh that's a nice area.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get much time off to go sightseeing and stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I've been to San Francisco once and to Santa Cruz a couple times</p>
<p><b>DR:</b>  Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't get to the beach much or anything</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No surfing yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm only like a half an hour away too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it going to be like that always, are you going to get some breaks you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's starting to get slower.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We're starting to have like 2 day weekends now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which is nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have a car?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I bought a car.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good, so you'll be able to do some stuff, even just go to the ocean and stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  And how long are you doing this job for, how long is your contract?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This was supposed to get done sometime before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So pretty quick here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and are you able to save much money or is it kind of all going to expenses?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just paid off all my bills, all my, you know, credit cards and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I have some money saved up in the bank too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Great and you're buying a car, are you making payments or were you able to pay cash.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just bought it straight out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent, that helps too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're actually going to start having some money.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what are you going to do with it, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to put it in savings, are you going to go back to school?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just sitting in my savings right now, what I have.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think you want to go back to school eventually?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do want to go eventually, I just might want to do one more of these jobs because they're just so, the money is just so awesome.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, how much are they paying you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fifteen an hour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's very good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Plus, well, they're paying expenses and I get a per diem and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For food and stuff?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> $100 a week for food.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My apartment is paid for.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's very good.  Good and what are you doing most of the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's construction, it's hotel renovation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you have to go in and like rip out carpets and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, we're not like a demolition thing, we're more of, we put like cabinets back in, we put granite on the cabinets; we do that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh these are nice hotels if you're putting granite in.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a nice, it's a pretty big Marriott.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh it's a Marriott.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They do Marriott, they do Marriott's and [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, very nice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ones in the nicer cities and stuff</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I see, well that's cool.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's a little bit nicer work settings too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good.  So you're going to be out there at least, you think, till the end of the year or so or do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm hoping to be back by, I mean once the job starts to slow down, I think they'll start to let people kind of trickle off, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], I'm hoping to move back before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So, I have 1 month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's only like what, 5 or 6 weeks or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> October would be my last full month</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then what do you want to do, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hopefully, hop on another job here quick and then start looking at doing something else after that job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It wouldn't be a long job, it would just be like a month or 2.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, yeah, something seasonal for the holidays.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then after the holidays just find something longer term?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then, hopefully, look into getting back in school for next year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe next, what, next fall.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it would be kind of too rushed at this point, coming back late November and trying to get into school by January.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah and do you think you want to go back to [INAUDIBLE] or do you want to go somewhere else do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I'm thinking about doing more of like a community college type, getting all my gen/ed done cheaper.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of people are doing that, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah it does.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Saves a lot of money.  It really doesn't matter where you do your classes the first couple years, you know</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So yeah it makes a lot of sense, okay, well, good, good, so how have your spirits been holding up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, I mean it's rough like, it's really rough not having friends or family out there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That makes it hard.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It sucks after a while.  I mean I've had some pretty low weeks sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you meet people just on the job site even?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I have like friends at the job site, you know, different companies.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's not like, we don't usually like hang out or anything out of work.  It's me and my other friend because we live together. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you said you guy go do stuff together much or not too much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not too much, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I thinking, yeah, what could you do, I mean</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean we work like 10-11 hours a day</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then, you know, 6 days a week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, so you're pretty exhausted.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's pretty much just go home, take a shower, veg out for an hour or 2 and go to bed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, wow, that's pretty exhausting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what do you do on your day off usually?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, sometimes we'll try to get to the beach, sometimes I'll just sleep all day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It just depends.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just try to catch up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and the guy you work with, is he going to be coming back around the same time do you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and he lives in [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who is it, what's his name?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, I don't know [NAME OTHER], his younger sister is</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] is my son's age</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay, so is he liking it too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he actually kind of got me the job.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He had done a couple other jobs with them.  He did one like in [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE] and San Diego with them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is the company based out of here?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's based actually just down, well the office is other by [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean they're kind of all over the place.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's wild, a company like that in [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and they have like, you know, they have jobs going on in like 4 different cities right now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that sounds cool.  Good.  Sleeping okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm sleeping good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?  And how's your energy level holding up, you doing okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's all right.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How about appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Appetite, it changes, I don't know, usually I eat, like when I'm working I'll eat breakfast, I'll eat lunch, I usually won't eat dinner, I'm usually too tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just not hungry, you're just exhausted.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Too tired.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you eat a snack or something or you just crash?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll eat like maybe some chips or something but that's about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know if you're losing weight then or have you checked?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've actually lost about 20 pounds.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, how much do you weigh now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was like 194 before I left, I'm like 172.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that's all that hard work</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I wish it showed a little more but I lost it so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's a lot.  What about, are you able to focus pretty well when you're on the job site or is this hard?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like when I started using my Adderall again, like that really helped a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, yeah, so that helps a lot and then I mean there have been times it's just like hard in general.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It gets pretty tedious after a while.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So before the Adderall, what would happen, would you start doing something and then just get distracted and go do something else?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and now with the Adderall, you can just stay on task more - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For a longer period of time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what about any problems with anxiety lately, nervousness?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and does it seem like it's related to things that are going on like on the job site or does it just come out of the blue?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just kind of just stressed out about family and friends</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Back home, you know, stuff like that, what I'm going to do after this job, not so much on the job type stress but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, are you going to move back home or do you stay with friends when you move back?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I, I know I can stay with friends for a while until I know where I'm going next.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know I have some friends that have already offered places in [INAUDIBLE] and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To hang out for a couple weeks or a month or 2 if I need it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and I don't, in [INAUDIBLE] you said?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, in other words, I mean if I do decide to stay around here, I have, I'll look for an apartment.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  I'm just thinking, do you know what the job situation is in [INAUDIBLE], is it easy or hard to find jobs?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's hard but I mean if I went up there, it'd only be waiting for another job to take with this company.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh I see.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So it really wouldn't, I don't think I'd have to wait too long.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh I see, so you're thinking about taking like a month off, trying to find a job here and then taking another job with this company?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they have like a couple jobs coming up already and they're already like scheduled and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like in January or something?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they have some that are already starting now that I can hop on to - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or some that start in January and February.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  Now like if you fly home, do they pay for a trip home or do you have to pay for it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they pay for it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh that' good, good, good, good, so they're decent to work for.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they've been treating me pretty well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good and what about, are you enjoying yourself or are you just kind of going through the motions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just kind of going through the motions - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Honestly at this point.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Working, okay.  And [PATIENT NAME], when did you start with this company?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In May, late May.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's been July, August, a little over 4 months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what about when you get down, do you ever get so down that you get to the point of having suicidal thoughts out there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  And I was thinking, is there anything you're looking forward to right now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of putting in your time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know when I was in [INAUDIBLE] I was really looking forward to coming home but now I'm kind of, I don't know, I guess overstayed my, you know</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's weird when you come home isn't it, after you've been away for a while.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's like you're super excited and then you come into it and it's cool for like a night or 2 and then it's just, you don't really want to go back but you don't want to be here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's weird because like are many of your friends here still or a lot of them left?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, a lot of them are gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of friends leave and the ones that are here usually have stuff going on, they have a little bit of time but not much time and - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like I went up to [INAUDIBLE] when I first got in 2 -  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And that was awesome, I mean I had fun up there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it was nice seeing some of my friends, some of who I'm like, wow I can't believe I was in this crowd I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, why is that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just because they, you know, they really don't do much of anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just party a lot then they go to their classes but it just seems like they're wasting a lot of time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, not putting much energy into it huh?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, that's the truth for some people, you know, they don't put a lot of effort into it but, unfortunately, they don't usually get much out of it then either, so.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like that was fine, I mean I saw my brother, hung out with him and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, how's he doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's doing good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good.  All right, so it sounds like you come back for a month, live and work somewhere here, then maybe go back to another job site.  Any ideas where it's going to be?  Will it be in California again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, he has one, actually, it would be awesome because all the next ones are pretty local.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> One's in Beaver Creek, one's in Aspen, one's in Vale.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And one he's trying to bid out is actually just in [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A big hotel there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so that would be ideal for me because I can be around close friends and family again.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that'd be nice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we'll see.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And these jobs usually last a few months at least?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They go anywhere from like a couple weeks to like a year and a half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, it just depends on how big a hotel and how big a renovation they're doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oops, let me turn that ringer off.  Well, that sounds good.  Yeah, it would be nice if it was somewhere a little closer so you could.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> See friends and family and be more involved with family stuff.  Okay, good, so did you have a chance to see your family much or are they pretty busy too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I stayed at their house 2 nights ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean they are all busy all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's weird because the kids are in school, your mom is probably running all over.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just weird.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So usually me just sitting around at the house by myself so I'm just kind of like why am I trying to make time, I mean they're all doing their own thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's strange when you come back.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's like everybody else is on this other schedule I guess or something, it doesn't fit yours because you're kind of off - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have time but they don't but medication wise, you doing okay you feel like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know, it seems like something needs to tweak, I just don't know what.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I kind of need help with that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't get it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In what way, what kind of problems are you having?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's like sometimes I get way too anxious.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's like even when I'm getting anxious, sometimes I'll get super anxious when I'm not even, you know the Adderall can kind of, you know, speed up your heart and stuff -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And kind of, you know, give you a little more energy - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or whatever It'll be even days that like I'm not on my Adderall - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel kind of</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Revved up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I don't take my Adderall like on weekends or anything - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I'm not working and stuff and sometimes I'll just feel super anxious and even home, I didn't even bring my Adderall home with me and I've been feeling really anxious and that could just be because I haven't seen a lot of people but at certain times it's just kind of like a really uncomfortable kind of - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Physical anxious.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're still using the Xanax every day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's not maybe enough.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what I'm almost thinking because I know, isn't the Xanax supposed to kind of slow, doesn't it slow your heart rate down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It can, I mean it has antianxiety properties but also general calming effect is the way it's supposed to work.  Now the thing to be careful about is if you take too much, it'll calm you so much that you'll feel tired or sleepy, we don't want that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel sleepy now after taking it or tired?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not at all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, can you even feel it working when you take it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I did at first but I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not as much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  It may be that you've developed a little bit of what's called tolerance which means over time, sometimes it doesn't work quite as well so you need a little bit more and you're on a pretty low dose so we certainly can go up on it, I'm just thinking how much.  We can either go up to 2 or we can go up in 0.5mg increments.  I know you're taking 1, we could go to 1.5.  Do you know with your insurance, do you just pay a flat copay for a prescription do you know, like $30?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think it's like 20 or 40.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, what we have to do then is probably go to 0.5, it'll give you more flexibility in dosing and what you could do is, you could try like 3 of the 0.5's which would be 1.5 mg, right now you're taking 1.  If that's not enough, then you could go up to 4 of them which would be 2mg</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then you can kind of adjust it and see what works for you.  Do you want to try that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we can try that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and if you have questions, just call me.  So the anxiety is the biggest thing that you're kind of noticing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. And do you just wake up with it some days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the weird, like when I get up, the part of the day when I feel it the most.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Mostly in the mornings?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right when I wake up, it's like, I don't know, I just feel really like anxious at first and then I'll calm down depending on what I'm doing but then like when I'm just sitting around like watching TV or something, I'll get a really anxious feeling again and it's mostly like a physical thing, it's not so much a mental thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it's the racing heart?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and just feeling uncomfortable, feeling like I can't get comfortable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of a restless feeling?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and you said in the mornings it's worse and then sometimes in the evenings too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because I've felt it, it's pretty much when I'm not working because when I'm working, I mean my mind is off of everything and I'm just kind of going, going, going, you know, but when I'm just sitting around or whatever -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's when I feel it</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like yesterday I was sitting at my mom's house all day by myself, I was like really, you know, uncomfortable- </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you sitting by myself?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was today because my mom had to run errands and I was waiting for a buddy to pick me up but he never called for like 5 hours because he had to work so - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, okay and did you say on the weekends, do you still take the Xanax or do you skip it on the weekends?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I still take it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You skip the Adderall you said, okay, which is fine, okay and is it working out, is your mom filling the prescriptions here and then sending them out to you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and that's working okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, okay</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't really like, like that she has to, I keep telling her that the only way she can get the Adderall is you writing it out, you know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Physically.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she keeps like forgetting that, she's like how come I have to go and I'm like mom, I've told you this like 20 times.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's the nature of the medicine. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want me to go ahead and write you a prescription for the Adderall too now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because since I'm here if you can do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That would be nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can drop it of, even if you don't need to get it filled quite yet, at least it'll be at the pharmacy then.  Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a controlled substance where they require a written prescription every single time.  They're old laws that I wish they would change but they haven't yet.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is it just with Adderall or is it with everything?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's any controlled substances in that schedule, so it's any stimulant like Ritalin, Adderall, Dexedrine, what else, so just certain medicines.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Stuff for ADD, ADHD.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, those have to be, that's the only psychiatric medicines I can think of that have to be written and signed.  So did you learn anything from this job that'll help you - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Either in terms of skills?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or just life experience or anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I have a work ethic like I've never had.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I wake up at 5:45 every day,</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I go to work, you know, I've worked 13 hours in a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean where the sun is starting, when the sun is coming up till the sun is going down</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I work pretty much 6 days a week, I mean at the beginning of the job I was working 7 days a week.  I mean my work ethic; I mean I used to, you know, complain about 30 hours a week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And just, you know, want to quit or whatever and now I'm working 60 hours a week and I mean if I work under 40, I feel like I'm not getting paid enough - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For the week, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's good, I mean</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'm really proud of that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Aspect and like even a couple weeks ago, I had really bad pink eye - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had it for like 2weeks and I still worked every day like with the pink eye so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Before I finally could go see a doctor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, how'd you find a doctor out there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just called my insurance company and they just told me doctors that were covered by the insurance.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just went to some random one.  I was kind of weird because it was this Asian dude.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's a lot of Asian people out there, a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but he gave you some drops or something</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he gave me some drops.  He was a really nice guy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, I've heard that California, culturally it's so different; it's like Asians, Hispanics.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean all the buildings like around where I live, it's all like all the lettering is in Asian.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Some sort of, you know, I don't know what it is, Chinese, Vietnamese, whatever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then it's like small print in English.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's so weird.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But San Francisco, I love San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's fun</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's awesome.  That's like an hour drive from where I'm at.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's not too bad.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what do you like to do in San Franciso?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, we went and saw a concert there.  I've only been there once.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who'd you see?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it was downtown.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's so pretty there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, did you like get up to the Golden Gate Bridge or anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh we went over the Bay Bridge because the concert was on this island that connected on the Bay Bridge.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was pretty cool because there was like downtown San Francisco in the background, that was cool.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who was the concert?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was Modest House.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if you've heard of them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'm getting old.  I don't keep track of the new groups, some of them but cool, so yeah, hopefully, you get back to San Francisco or just have you been down to like Fisherman's Warf or -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, we never got anywhere there, just down, we went to, my buddy, he's kind of like a hippie, so we went to [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we just went to the shops and stuff around there.  There's a lot of cool shops.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you get a chance too, you can go across the Golden Gate Bridge, just a little ways up is the [NAME OTHER] woods, did you hear about those?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Beautiful redwoods and stuff too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not far away at all.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And Chinatown, have you been to Chinatown yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, it may be a bit of what you're in but there's just so many neat things to do in California.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, there's so many cool things to do in California.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just I don't have time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's hard I guess but, hopefully, you start getting some breaks.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not working quite so hard.  Let's see, now the Neurontin looks like we're okay with refills on that one and you feel like it's doing okay still?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, actually, I split them in half again.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're taking one and a half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You bumped me up to the one and a half</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I split the one and a half in half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're taking - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm actually doing three fourths.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and that seems to be working okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because, it's weird, like the one was fine - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I felt like I needed a little more but then the one and a half just has made me too groggy and maybe I'm just not used to it - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe I just didn't give it enough of a chance but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how are you taking them again, you're taking three quarters of a tablet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, a half a tablet which would be like three quarters of what I was taking before.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So are you taking one, I'm still confused, 1 tablet, do you take 1plus some more?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or less than one.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Less than one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it's like three quarters of a tablet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and that seems to be working?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That works fine, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Great.  Okay, yeah, it sounds like you're doing well.  You sound like you're getting a lot out of this experience.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's good.  Yeah, it's hard [PATIENT NAME], you know, working like this but it's a good experience.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's awesome.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just like you come back and you miss a lot of people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You do but, you know, even that, as hard as it is, I had a couple summers where I did the same thing, I was gone for like several months- </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No kids around at all, worked, you know, 6 hour days, I hated it at the time - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But really now, you know, years later, I can see that it was a really good experience.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll get a lot out of this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think so too.  Well good, all right, so here's the Adderall and Xanax prescriptions.  Do you need anything going on that you want to talk about or questions or concerns?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's pretty much it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, why don't we just stick with this then and then maybe if you do come back like before Thanksgiving, maybe we can get together some time in that month you'll be home just to check in again and make sure things are going well.  Who knows, maybe you'll be around after that too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That'd be great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cool.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, like I said, if there's anything you need before then, just give me a call.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nice seeing you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good seeing you too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So good luck with the work out there.  So you said you don't know for sure when you're going back, do you think it'll be sometime this week though?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because my boss, well I scheduled a plane, well he did for today.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But then he called me yesterday and he was just like I hear it's really slow, I think I'm going to give most of the guys, you know, most of the week off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You're more than welcome to stay and save me money and stuff.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like okay, I wouldn't mind a couple more days out here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then he just said to call my foreman because he's really the one that makes the, you know, on the job site calls.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so I'm just waiting for my foreman to text me back because we use text.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's a really cool guy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We're actually pretty good friends.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That makes a big difference to like who you're working with.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take it easy, you bet, bye bye.</p>

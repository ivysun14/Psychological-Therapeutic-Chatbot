<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just going to (inaudible). I think I'm having a [laser vision] (ph) day. (inaudible 00:00:15)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you, like, passed them in the waiting room or the bathroom. Or do you mean like you see them - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I see them on the street.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean not a lot. Like I've seen three total.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's (inaudible 00:00:34).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's unlikely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uncanny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Because people are really] not paying attention. (pause) There's something weird going on here. (long pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean in reference to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean in reference to us. Was it very awkward knowing (inaudible 00:01:36) that I called the (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was surprised, but no I don't think it would be awkward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it very awkward to have to sit together?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. (pause) That did not surprise me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't very often (inaudible at 00:02:08)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I mean. No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know what it is then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I seem [turned off]? (ph) (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. We've seen some things. (pause) [I'd like to walk] (ph) around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know anything about it? (pause) I guess that that's what comes to mind to me are like what it would be like to work with you when you were in a different phase of your career. [00:03:33] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My Dad mentioned before, "I wonder how much you guys are getting." (pause) And, I don't know, I wonder how much you're holding back and why. [00:04:15]</p>

<p>(long pause) (sound that could be a zipper being opened)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (long pause) (sounds like footsteps) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you wonder why I came here and started badgering you with questions? [00:05:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm wondering what's up, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what's up. There's something up. I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. I know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely, I guess I feel on the offensive. I think you're not having replied to my last two e-mails has affected me. Or my last e-mail, my second, my other one. (pause) Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh. I wonder if you're feeling like I'm not quite here in some way. [00:06:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You've said that too many times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to, um - But it was my first reaction to that question. My second reaction is, is that true? (pause) Yeah, I guess you, I guess it feels like you are in a different phase or something. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like. (pause) I see, like that I'm doing things a little differently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like you could be doing things differently. I mean you keep choosing the one that feels less connected. Why? (pause) You're encouraging or (pause) Enthusiastic or (pause) (inaudible at 00:08:40).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I see more of (inaudible) like emotionally immediate or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or you seem to be negative or serious emotionally. (pause) Hm. Right. (inaudible at 00:09:17). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. (pause) This kind of sucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You've also said that too many times, and I don't know that it's doing good. (pause) It does suck and it doesn't suck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And I've said it too many times. Yeah. it sounds like you feel as though you're not getting something. Like what you're getting feels too filtered or processed, and not [coming out] (ph) spontaneously. And nothing is different from before. [00:10:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, "What the hell is going on?" Like, I don't know, "I wonder if [that's connecting to patients outside of here]." (ph) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'm feeling - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like, are you feeling like you irked me or shaken me up in some way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then I'm then, I may be pulling away is what it feels like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I guess I could imagine that a little bit earlier you would have responded to both of the e-mails that you didn't respond to. The one about wanting to talk to you more. The one on Tuesday. And then the second one last night. And (pause) I think it's fine that you didn't respond. I think I'm not reacting to that. I think I'm reacting to maybe how you would have earlier. [00:11:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like a change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like I could imagine your response and how it would be in the normal things that you've done before. (pause) [It seems like a lack of communication.] (ph) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have not upset me or put me off. Or I don't feel like I'm (inaudible at 00:12:16). I'm not saying like I'm trying just to see what you [observe]. I'm just saying that I'm not aware of any (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause) This does seem different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you seem pretty sure it's me. And maybe it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I started off, I think, (inaudible at 00:13:27)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I don't feel a lot of, I mean with different things.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm currently recovering [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:11). On Tuesday Sydney got sick in the afternoon. We had been loading things up in the morning. We had gotten the U-Haul and he ended up staying at my place and I ended up having to oversee all the moving, which was really, really nerve-wracking because a) Sydney has a lot of stuff, way more stuff than I have and b) it is not my stuff so I don't know where things go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who were you overseeing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ended up Margetically calling a bunch of my friends. [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:56) friend, Shauna, who was visiting, all came, because I was too small to haul [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:07). We ended up getting a large portion of it and everything that required the U-Haul so we disassembled the desks, which ended up being finished with the whole ordeal and dropping off the U-Haul at one o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had already said I was going to skip rehearsal because we were going to have a house meeting, and then we didn't have a house meeting because he was gone. Rehearsal would have been from eight to ten and the U-Haul was originally reserved until six but then I called and asked how long we could reserve it for. They said if I got it back by 10:30 AM the next morning I could get it for that rate. 00:01:49</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did a lot of work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did a lot of work. And then Wednesday he was going to finish it up and we still had his closet. I ended up sleeping in and he ended up going over but not getting much done because he kept on overheating. I came over and helped him with it and on Tuesday I was like, "That's it. I've done all of the things I'm going to do," but I still helped him. Aaron said we could use his car for moving, so we got everything in the car and back and were out of the building by 7:30. We didn't get to see the fireworks, which he said we were going to go to and then we didn't. It was also incredibly hot out and we were both exhausted from moving, so it was probably better that we didn't go. I guess everyone had to go under the storage rack or overpass or something when it started raining. (chuckles) Then yesterday we still had to unload the van because we needed to pick up a piece of furniture today, which he had never told me. 00:03:06</p>

<p>Also yesterday morning I had my first day of work and we got in a fight because [Prod] (ph) had run out of cat food and you can only get her cat food at the vet. Tuesday was the last day we had the full amount of food for her. We were going to do it on Tuesday, but then all the crazy moving taking way longer than it was supposed to meant that we didn't. Wednesday it was closed, so Thursday Sydney wanted me to get it before work. Originally I thought it was okay but then it was like, "Wait, I'm going to have to drive up there, drive back, drive around to school so I can get myself breakfast, and then drive back up." It just seemed like too much of a roaming thing. I ended up, even after we bought it and stuff, I did end up just throwing the bag of cat food in the house when I had it dropped off, and got to work at eleven, which ended up being fine. I ended up leaving at 2:30 anyway instead of 3:00 because my hand started hurting. My schedule is now 11:00 until my hand starts hurting on the days that I'm coming in. (chuckles) That way if I did the full five hours a day, that would actually be a bad idea. It worked out but also I had to unload the car. [00:04:39] He did most of the unloading yesterday, but I was still helping him because I didn't want him to panic. On Tuesday we had put all the fragile electronic things on these carts. We had unloaded those on Tuesday, but we unloaded those to the front hall living room and it all has to be out of the front hall by tonight before Shabbat dinner, which is like 7:30. So now I'm like, "You're doing the rest of it." It's not that much. It's like a computer and two monitors and some speakers and some other speakers. I'm just so beyond . . . 00:05:27</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "So beyond" — what are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just never want to help anyone ever again. It would be one thing if it was my move, but it wasn't my move. I did way more than my fair share.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's grateful, but I was kind of like, "I did a lot for you. I kind of want you to make it up to me somehow. I don't know how," which maybe isn't fair of me to say. It would be one thing if he hadn't been depressed this entire day. If he hadn't been depressed this entire time we probably would have done the packing a lot earlier because we would have either a) done the move on Sunday or b) at least gotten most things in boxes so it wouldn't have taken as long as it did. On Friday, I was doing all the packing. On Monday, I was still doing a lot of the packing. I think I did more than he did in the end. 00:06:40</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you probably did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not that I mind helping him; it's just that I mind always doing everything for him and not getting anything in return. (voice waivers) I'm always the one who has to deal with all the work and all the sacrifices and everything and it's just driving me insane. If I get upset about things, he gets upset and I feel like I can't get upset around him. It doesn't help that his libido is still really bad. We made out on Monday except I got him off because he wanted to go first but then we were doing things for me he started coughing and wasn't able to. That, after waiting and waiting and waiting and hardly ever making out or anything, he was like, "We'll do things tomorrow after we're done with all the moving." Of course, we weren't done with the move on Tuesday. We weren't done with all the moving. Yesterday he wasn't even up for things yesterday evening and I have just done everything in the world for him and I just can't. (sobs) I don't want to do things. There's part of me that feels bad. That I'm nice and I'm supposed to do things. I want to do nice things, but I feel like I shouldn't have to anymore because I've done everything and it's not fair. It's so completely not fair. (sniffles) 00:08:19</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is one-sided?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's not fair. I mean he can't help being depressed, but it's still not fair to me. I don't want to break up with him, especially now that he's living at my place for a month; but even if he wasn't I wouldn't want to break up with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want him to have his libido back and make out with me and want to and not me always asking and getting turned down. (sniffling) Like the way it's supposed to be. When he's not depressed his libido is about as high, like we have the same amount of libido. (breathing heavily) 00:09:06</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what it's about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of it. I'm making him dinner, too many things. (sniffles) I'm usually the one taking care of him. I want to be taken care of sometimes. If he were better and he would want to take care of me — no one is taking care of me now except me. I have to take care of me and I have to take care of him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot of responsibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't done a single productive thing this week because I spent the entire time moving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did lots of productive things, just none of the things on your list. 00:09:57</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (small voice) Every single day I just [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:06).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like it's been this way for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was thinking maybe he thought he was going to be less stressed out. He is a little bit less stressed out. He got out of his housing situation with passive-aggressive roommates. The second move isn't going to be as bad because everything is staying in boxes for the month. I'm not helping out with the second move, especially because the second move is going to be hauling heavy things anyway. It's not like there is much I can do. We're not putting things into boxes. I feel like I've already used up my friends' ability to move and I don't want to make them help me again. They're my friends. I was the one who had to call my friends because I guess my friends were freer than his were, but none of his friends . . . 00:11:14</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he call his friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Maybe he called one of his friends. He put something out on Facebook but no one actually responded and no one was able to help him. Maybe with the second move if he asks enough in advance he'll have people who can help him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like he's really relying on you a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know what he would be doing without me. Even today — he started a new drug and he's on Lexapro. I guess it's 5mg pills and he was starting off on half a pill every day. At some point he's supposed to go up to a full pill, but either his psychiatrist had been vague or Sydney missed it. He was feeling like it was helping him feel better and there were no side effects, but it didn't feel like it was enough. I'm like, "There's no way that he could possibly have told you to stay on this half pill for the whole month until the next appointment. That's not how it ever works." He did call the psychiatrist today because I made him. I was like, "You have to. I'm not going to sit here and watch you self-destruct," so he did and left a message. It will probably take the whole weekend for the psychiatrist to get back to him anyways. Today is day five on the half-pill, so I don't know whether or not he's going to end up stay on half longer than he needed to because he couldn't call the psychiatrist sooner. 00:13:00</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound really frustrated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I had questions about my medications I would ask right away. If the instructions had been vague I would have asked at the appointment. It seems odd that he would have been given such vague "eventually you'll go up to a full pill." Usually it's like the first seven days you do this half dose and then you go up to a full dose. Then you possibly go up to a bigger dose than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not being at the appointment you don't know what was said and what was heard. You're clearly concerned about him and you're clearly frustrated with the lack of progress and the amount of time that he's been so dependent on you, without feeling like you're getting much support in return.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to do something that will help him he then gets mad at me. He still hasn't e-mailed back the dude from school. They were supposed to schedule a second round interview in May. The last time he had asked them, the guy was like, "Oh, people in the office have been in and out of town, vacations, summer, etc. so we haven't been able to get everybody together to schedule an interview." That was like two weeks ago. I feel at this point it would be totally reasonable to send another e-mail and he hasn't yet. If he had been rejected from the job he would have gotten the rejection e-mail because he got all those other rejection e-mails when he wasn't rejected from the job, so it's not like they're bad at sending rejection e-mails. They're very good. 00:14:52</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're bad at being clear, though, for being correct.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sure if he did get rejected (chuckles) he would get a rejection e-mail the second he got rejected. He hasn't gotten a rejection e-mail from them, either. If you say you're going to set up a second interview, you do. Part of the reason why Sydney is depressed is because he doesn't have a job. This is the only job he's applied to. He hasn't even applied to other jobs, so it's not like he can say, "Oh, I've applied to all the jobs ever and no one is hiring me." He's applied to one job and he's gotten invited for a second round interview. The second round interview just hasn't happened yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It must be really frustrating from your perspective. You've put out many more applications [ ] (crosstalk at 00:15:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though not this week, because I was so involved in moving everything that I haven't been able to send out more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't change your frustration. You found the process and are really trying and you have put out many more than one application, maybe not this week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it's just been so long ago since I've been severely depressed that I don't remember if I was unable to do these things, too. I was never applying to jobs because I was in college, so I didn't have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to compare your depression. It may have felt similar, may have been the same, may have been different. One of the things about being depressed is that it creates this sense of tunnel vision. It's really hard to get perspective and when you're not depressed, it's very hard to know exactly what it felt like when you were in that place because there are such different places. There is a big difference between depression and normal sadness, normal frustration, which you're feeling lots of, and you can't know exactly what he's feeling right now and it's really hard to watch someone be that unhappy and not do the things you feel would be helpful to them — to watch him not get phone calls and get clarification on the meds, to watch him exacerbate an altered sleep schedule. It's hard to sit there and see that. 00:17:45</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean he's getting better about the sleep schedule but, yeah, he's like, "I'll clean up things, but can I watch one more episode of Stargate?" and I'm like, "No." He keeps wanting to do more things beforehand and I'm like, "The longer you wait, the more you're going to panic about not having this thing done; and yet you keep putting it off and not doing it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so clear to see from the outside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will get worse. He had to get these things done but he wanted to rest for it, and I let him rest. Last night I was like, "No, I'm going to panic and not be able to rest. I will feel anxious about it if we don't get it done right now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What puts you in a difficult position is being that enforcer. "No, you can't watch one more episode of the show. We have to do this right now." Rather than feeling like you're in a relationship, it sounds like you're the parent or the boss. 00:19:00</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's lost all ability to make reasonable decisions for himself. (voice breaks) (sobs) Or maybe not all ability, but a lot of his ability. If he can't be reasonable, either I have to help him be reasonable or I have to watch him not be reasonable and watch everything not work. I wasn't going to watch him not get moved out of his old place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just a difficult position for you to be in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't going to haul all the things out of the van last night because they're all too heavy for me. Most of the things that we put in the van and the hauling I did was putting things into the van and taking out all the trash. Taking out all the trash it wasn't like we were hauling trash, so most of the things in that van were too heavy for me to carry. I carried one box upstairs and the rest of the time just sat in the van so we could keep it open so people wouldn't steal things. (sniffles) Part of me feels like maybe I should just let him do whatever he wants. If I had done that then he wouldn't have gotten moved out. 00:20:23</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would have happened if he didn't get moved out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. A few days of July were pro-rated but if he hadn't gotten out when he did, maybe he would have had to pay for being there longer. I don't know what would have happened. There definitely would have been more interacting with passive-aggressive former housemates.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's hard to decide what to do, whether to protect him from consequences or whether to let him make choices that are different from what you would make and feel the consequences of his choices. I don't think it's a matter of there being a right thing to do and a wrong thing to do. It's figuring out what you want your role to be, what the consequences for you are of playing a particular role. 00:21:31</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are consequences for me if I let him sit back and not do things. If, say, the drug he is supposed to maybe for a week or whatever take the half pill and then move up to the full pill — if I hadn't told him to call his psychiatrist, then he would have spent the whole month on that half pill and I would be dealing with him not being properly medicated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. There is a consequence for both of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's only so much I can do. I can't call his psychiatrist. I can't write — actually I probably could write the e-mail. I would have to like . . . yeah, I could, theoretically, but I'm not going to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to. I want him to. Sometimes I'm like, "Maybe it's easier if I just do things." It's easier to do everything myself than to try to make someone else do things, even if they're supposed to do things. It's not my place to write that e-mail. He's freaking out about all the things that he has to do and, really, there aren't that many things he has to do. He's freaking out about every single e-mail is apparently the worst thing ever. If he keeps on waiting and doesn't send the e-mail maybe they will realize, "Wait, there is that position we were supposed to fill. We haven't done anything about that, have we? There was supposed to be a second round interview. Maybe we'll eventually get back to him." I don't know. So I don't even know. 00:23:27</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't control that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Writing that e-mail might not make a difference at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where can you get some support? You said you feel like you're taking so much care of him. Nobody's taking care of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (small voice) I don't think I can. I think I just have to do it all myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you need?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't need anything. I can exist like this. (breathes heavily)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it mean to have someone take care of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Maybe not having to do all things, like I shouldn't have to [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:34). It's always like me making him dinner, me going out and getting things for him, me doing this and that. When it's little things it doesn't really matter that much. I don't mind operating the pill cutter for him because, apparently, you need really small fingers to get the pill out of the thing once it's been cut and that's something I don't even notice because I've never not had tiny fingers. It's harder for him so that I'm fine doing. Even if he didn't have big fingers I wouldn't mind doing something like that because it's no effort for me. And I don't mind filling up the water bottle for him and getting him water. If I'm always the one who has to cook dinner and do the dishes from dinner and make all the phone calls and do all the driving . . . 00:25:39</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the list gets long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There are probably not that many things, except then when I ask him to do things he gets upset. Yesterday after we had that fight and I was taking his car to work and I had to call him when I got to the car because he keeps yanking the parking brake all the way up. You're not supposed to do that. I mean a) we're on a flat street. He doesn't need the parking brake. He always — it's his habit — he yanks the parking brake up. If you just pull it up halfway or not as far as it can possibly go, it will still act as a parking brake, and then you can get it just fine. But he does it all the way. I don't have the hand strength to undo it, so I had to call him to do that. I actually had to call him today, too, which was one of the reasons why I was late. I had to wait for him to come out to the car. He's like, "Oh, yeah. I think I only pulled it up halfway." That's not it. When we were retrieving his car after we had dropped off the van, he had pulled up the parking brake and there it was me in part because I was too short to drive the van so Marge drove the van back. Even Marge had trouble with the parking brake, so it's not just me apparently. Even people with normal hands that are not giant like Sydney's have trouble with the parking brake. Marge got it eventually because we were able to get the car back. It was just hard. Maybe I need my own car. I can't ask my parents for a car when I don't have a job that requires it — or "a" job, really. 00:27:39</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like the car is really the problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's part of the problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a frustration, but it's a frustration coming out of feeling like you're kind of operating on your own here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I had my own car then I wouldn't have to ever call Sydney about the parking brake because I would never use the parking brake except on a hill. I didn't even really know what a parking brake was for because I never used the parking brake on my car when I was in high school and had a car and drove places. In Driver's Ed it was never like, "Oh, by the way, you should also use the parking brake." Maybe it was mentioned that you use it on a hill. 00:28:23</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like getting a car would be a rather big solution to a different problem. The parking brake is an indirect problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, getting your own car would fix that little piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would also fix the piece of once he goes back to living in his own place, if he's too depressed to get in the car and drive over to my place, I could get in my car and drive over to his place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you would feel upset that you were the one doing all the driving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm projecting into the future here, but it seems like what you really feel upset about is that you are having to take on responsibility for more than what feels like your share. He's not able to keep in mind and follow through on things to make it easier for you, like remembering not to pull up the parking brake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess it's a habit that's been entrenched in him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. It would require a lot of thought to remember to do it differently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's been driving for the past nine years. I guess he's 25, so if he got his license when he was 16, that's nine years of pulling up the parking brake. 00:29:55</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. He would have to be conscious of doing something differently to make life easier for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If we're in the car together and he parks it I can tell him, "Fix the parking brake now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But isn't that part of a relationship — being thoughtful about what the other person wants and needs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but it's not like he knows for a fact that the next time I'm going to be the one using the car. It is his car and if I'm using it it's because he's letting me use it. In theory, he has every right to pull the parking brake up all the way though it's possibly not the best thing to do. He doesn't mind me using his car when he doesn't need it. If I had gone out earlier or something I wouldn't have had to drive at all or use the parking brake. I don't actually need a car, I just want a car. I'm not ready to get a car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want the independence?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want the independence because I know it would be really annoying trying to find a place to park in all the time. I would get the smallest car I could possibly get, I think. If I could get a Mini Cooper, I would totally get a Mini Cooper because it's tiny. I'm really not good at parking. It would give me a lot of independence and it would feel really nice. I feel like I don't deserve one unless I get a job, and I don't have a job. 00:31:50</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't feel like a necessity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it would be. If music keeps on having rehearsals that end at 11:00 . . . I'm not sure. It would take a lot of cab rides to add up to the cost of buying a car, like a lot, a lot of cab rides.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine that's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a thousand cab rides. I'm definitely not taking a thousand cab rides, or even 500. If I were to take a $5,000 car and it was $10 . . . yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have a job that requires it for the job. It would also be better for my back because then I'm not carrying heavy things places because I'd be putting them in the car. Like I was able to bring my laptop to work yesterday because I drove there and I wasn't carrying it on my back the entire time. Maybe if I added in the cost of getting massages or something I still don't think it would work, that it would be financially worth it to get a car. I just really want one. 00:33:35</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand wanting that freedom and independence that a car would bring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not being reliant on the schedule of the T or the busses and stuff. Maybe I could, in theory, bike places but that only works some of the time and I don't have the back light that I need. I would have to get lights for biking at night. It would be like biking from rehearsal at 11:00 PM. At least I would be going faster than I would if I was on foot, but it's still not ideal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you've started to think through details and I wonder if they're important details or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I don't think ultimately getting a car would solve all my problems. It would at least solve some of my problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's the real problem?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That Sydney is depressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not the parking brake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Start to think several steps out, like the frustration of the parking brake leads to the frustration of this thing and that thing and really the problem is that your boyfriend is really depressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's getting better. At first he was getting better and then he wasn't and now he's kind of getting better maybe. But like it's still not . . . and I don't know what to . . . and I have to do everything . . . and I can't . . . (breaking voice) If I get upset then he'll get upset so I can't . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't feel like you have the freedom to express your feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He doesn't want me to not express my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you talked with him about his depression and the impact it's having on the relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think he knows it's hard for me. Like if he sees me crying, then he gets sad because it hurts him seeing me be sad about him. (sniffles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay for him to be upset about you being upset. 00:35:58</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but then it's my fault that I made him upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not your fault. It's depression's fault.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If he were not depressed, we would expect that he would be able to cope with feeling sad that you're sad about something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's probably true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's one of the things that happens in a relationship because we do feel empathy for our partners; and it's because of the depression that it feels like it's asking him to go above and beyond. You're protecting him from his feelings because he's depressed, not because it's an inherently wrong thing for him to feel empathy when his girlfriend is sad. I don't know what the proper balance is between you supporting him and trying to protect him as he's working through this and how much room there needs to be for you to be able to express your own needs and wants and feelings, too. There needs to be some space for that even though he's depressed. I don't know what the right balance is, but clearly I think your frustration and your sadness show that there is not enough room for you right now. Maybe there can't be in the relationship. I don't know. 00:37:30</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least until he gets better. Now at least he's not feeling anxious anymore because he's back on something that deals with the anxiety because he couldn't really do the whole "taking an anti-anxiety pill when he was feeling anxious" thing because he wouldn't want to. We have made a pact that if one of us starts feeling anxious and the other one thought that they should take an anti-anxiety pill that we would.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He couldn't do it like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Oh, it's not that bad," or whatever. Sometimes I could convince him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want that to be your job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So now he's not feeling as anxious because he's on medicine that cares for the anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad that his treatment is starting to work for him and you're seeing a little bit of progress.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just sort of afraid that this will be like the other times where I thought there was progress and then it ended up back . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're skeptical about it being forward progress?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm afraid when he goes up to the full dose he'll start feeling side effects or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand your skepticism. You've been through this before yourself and you've been through it before with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just so afraid there won't be a drug that actually works for him. Aren't there some people who are depressed and they try all the drugs ever and none of them work? They have depression that's resistant to medications?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. That's true. Some people are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What percentage is it? I assume it's a really small percentage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would like to say that I know the numbers off the top of my head, but I don't. I'd have to look that up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:34) There are so many different drugs or even combinations of drugs that he hasn't tried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's in therapy as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's in therapy as well. He's in therapy twice a week. But not this past week because I guess his therapist was on vacation, which I guess was good because we spent the entire time moving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's very hard to watch someone struggle and not only are you having to watch someone you really care about struggle, it also means that he's not there for you in the same ways; and it's scary to think that, yes, there are some people who have medication-resistant depression. There are some people for whom therapy works really well and some people for whom it doesn't work as well. You don't know what the course of his depression is going to be. There is no magic test to figure out what's going to work and what's not. It's a really hard process to sit and watch and wait through. I urge you to think about — I know we scheduled more sessions to get you more support in here, I also urge you to think about are there ways your friends can be supportive to you? Are there people you can ask for help with for some of the little logistics things that he might help with otherwise? You have a good group of friends that are, obviously, willing to help. They all pitched in for the move. Whether it's someone to do something fun with just to have more camaraderie or someone to ask for some help with something with, you have some friends that really care about you and have been around for a long time. 00:41:24</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even if five are moving in August?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't mean you cut yourself off from them this month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With things like the parking brake it's not like it would be reasonable to call my friend and be like, "Hey, can you come over to my place and fix this parking brake?" None of my friends actually have cars. (sniffles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe someone to help cook a meal. Get some help with that, or just go out and have some time to spend with people that aren't [fat] (ph). Those things can feel supportive. It might not be doing a particular thing, but letting yourself be motivated by your friends to do things that feel productive to you — getting a hug, watching a show.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He can give me hugs, at least. That is something he can always do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good. 00:42:20</p>

<p>CLIENT: We can watch shows. The problem is that I'm watching shows with him that it's also him wanting to watch Internet shows.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes it might feel nice not to feel like you're having to be the watchdog.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We do need to stop for today. We're on for our regular time on Monday. I'll see you then.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi George.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got here so early. (Laughs) were around, or did you just get here early?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I always get out of class on Thursdays at four, and then I just have an hour and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, because it doesn't make sense to get here—like I would put you in at four, but then you wouldn't get here on time anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So. Oh well, we don't mind having you sit around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's fine. I get to read and do homework, actually. That's what I was just doing. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So, how did the homework go this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It went pretty well, actually. This was probably my most productive week at Chicago State I'd say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I did more work now than I have in the past. I did not succeed in what we talked about in the goal of getting my homework for next Monday, I did not get my homework done for the weekend, but that is because I had a quiz today on Thursday that went pretty well, actually. I think I [Interposing]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Did you know that that was coming or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I knew that it was coming. And there was a lot of reading that I had not been consistent with before that I was catching up on. But I was really good about—I think I actually caught up on every single reading that I had missed in that class for this quiz, even though it did not really cover all of that, but I sort of went the extra mile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. How did that feel to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt pretty good, actually. It was hard at times to really stay focused, and I found that I have this whole other problem where—well, it is not a whole other problem, but it is tied into the same problem where after I have done a little bit of work, I am like oh, well that is more than I have ever done before. So, maybe I am—maybe I can [Interposing]. And I had to keep on like reminding myself that now I had to finish this last article. And I managed to do that for that class. And also in another in another class I had—there was not a quiz, but there was just like a book that we are supposed to be reading but we never talk about in class ever, and we were talking about it in class for the first time and he told us last week if you have not been doing the reading, catch up on that, and it was like 300 pages of reading.</p>

<p>And I did—I did not do all of it, but I only skipped one chapter, I think. And so, I did a lot of homework for those two things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is great. So, to be all caught up for Monday, how much more do you have to do over the weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To be all caught up for Monday, I just have my homework for Monday. And I guess that chapter I should do at some point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, it is just like one chapter of reading?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then my regular homework for Monday—actually, I do not have anything for Monday, because Chicago State does not have class on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. So actually, Monday could be a good study day for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or if you managed do it over the wee—I guess because I know how you want to reward yourself if you want to spend the weekend doing something fun, or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I already—well, I did not plan it out as reward for doing work this week, but a few weeks ago, I bought a ticket to this concert at U. Chicago, and so I am going to go up there. And I have some friends up there that I am going to go see also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool. At what (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Weakerthans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is music?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Music.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of music is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Indie rock, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not know how else to categorize it. But yeah, I am excited for that, I will be up there on Friday and I will probably come back on Saturday, and then I can get back into the swing of doing work then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds really good. How did it feel, like, to get all this done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt good. I definitely had the sense that I was doing something I have not done in forever. And that felt sort of interesting and new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you have worked this hard before, would you say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely worked this hard years and years ago. But I have not since like middle school, maybe I want to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think—because last week we talked about and you were saying oh, I guess I will try it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh wait. There was another big motivating factor that I have not mentioned in having this happen, which is that I got an awful grade in my math test that I had the week before that I found out about on Monday of this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that is before we started seeing each other or—?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was—it was the second week that I saw you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it was the test that you were in fact studying—</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was one of those two tests that I was studying for, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it did not go so well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did not go so well, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really bad, like 60 out of 100.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so not—I mean it was not like a 30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was not a 30, but it was a D, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have hope of passing the class still?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. And I definitely have hope of passing the class, because in that math class, they dropped the lowest of the test grades, so it could not affect me at all if I get good grades.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Interposing) so perhaps it gave you a kick in the butt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It totally gave me a kick in the butt, because the class is called basic structures of math. It is like Chicago State's dumb, lowest level math class, and I took it because I thought it was going to really easy, and I am not really good at math, it is not like my strong suit, I am much more of a humanities kid in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to get a D on the first test of this, which I thought was going really well, because in the beginning, it was stuff that I had done in high school, and that was vaguely familiar to me, and then I guess I did not really continue to try very much, because I thought it was easy. And then getting that grade really made me reconsider how much I could coast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. I mean, maybe that was—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was shitty when it happened, but it was definitely really helpful. I do not think I would have worked that hard if it had not happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that you are capable of doing well in that class? Like is it something that you are worried about? Or you really just put nothing into that test?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I put—I did study for that one, but I put more effort into my psych test, even when I was—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that was the one we had talked about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because I had two tests in the same day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you find out how you did on that test?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are taking forever to grade it, so I have no idea. But hopefully, that one went better—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Because you said that you did put a good amount of work in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like a little more last-minute than you had planned, but—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had a schedule that I had come up with after we met, and then I did not totally stick to it, but I did some work on the last like day and a half. But I did sort of prioritize my psych test in a way that I guess in retrospect did not make sense or work out very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And these are all lessons that you learn, and I think maybe it is a good lesson, because you know, we talked about the idea that Chicago State in your head a little more of a slacker school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you will have to work hard. And I think—I do not know if this is influencing the way you are acting, but we had talked about how initially your goal was kind of to get a B-plus or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was sort of unclear, that was just was I said when you asked me. Because I had not really thought about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you think that with the new effort that you are putting in is somewhat due to the idea that now you are aiming for something higher?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is definitely tied into that, and that notion has become a lot appealing to me ever since you mentioned that why do I not try to do really well, because it is not going to be that hard for me. And I do not really have that much else going on to distract me. And I have not like firmly committed to that goal yet, but it is appealing to me a lot more, it is something that I am looking to work towards more.</p>

<p>But really, I think getting a bad grade on my math test was like the main motivator for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What is the—like the negative of working hard and reaping the reward? Like, is there something that is a negative in there? Or can you see the positives in what that would bring? Like the sense of achievement?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can definitely see the positives, but I think that it is hard for me to feel the positives when I am confronting that choice. And it is easy for me to feel the short-term avoidance of responsibility and say oh, I can ignore this and do something fun that I would rather do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And in the past when you got like a 60 before—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you say I do not really care, like, I will squeak by? And now you care?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. In the past, I would say oh shit, and then I would feel bad about it, but it would not really motivate me to apply that energy towards my next task.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever had something that you worked really hard on and you did well, and it kind of—you felt good afterwards?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me think if there is something I worked really hard on, I do not know about that. Maybe—actually, one of my photo projects when I was in high school. My high school had like a senior project and you could do whatever you wanted to, and like you get off of one class for the last semester of school. And I made these—sort of like a complicated technical process that I will not explain, because it will totally waste our time. But it was basically like late paintings, you sort of get a really bold, like, large format camera in a dark room, and you set up a scene and there is no light, it is totally dark, and you have a flashlight. And then you leave it open—the lens open for like a minute or two minutes or five minutes and you shine the light illuminate things in the way you want them to. And it was like super-involved, and it was basically guess work, because you did not know how it was going to turn out. And I spent a lot of time on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool. (Interposing) and you did well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, they did not really grade—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you were happy with the results?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was happy with how it turned out, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Since you are a literature major, do you like literature?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I do. I have a weird hatred of lit criticism sometimes, because it can be really obnoxious and self-centered and totally ignoring the point of actual books. But I love novels and other forms of books, and I love reading, I always have—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you find that you enjoy the reading part, it is just not the writing of the papers?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess more than that really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Phone ringing) did this happen the last time you were here too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it did.</p>

<p>(Interposing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway—wait, what was I just talking about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were saying something—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Literature. Literature, okay. Yeah, the papers are sort of a drag, and I think really what is hard for me in that is that it is not that I hate analyzing things, because I like analyzing things and I like in other fields, I guess not in other fields, because I am not really an academic person. But in just talking with people, I will analyze situations and like talk about things, and I will look away, and I have heard people say that about me that I have an analytical mind. So, I do not think that it is that I am unwilling to like describe things or come up with conclusions about stuff.</p>

<p>It is more that—I guess there is some—like, I am hesitant to do it, because I think that I am going to be wrong in some respect and that actually. But only within the specific issue of coming up with opinions about literature, because I always—I am always suspicious of other people's opinions about literature, I guess that informed me to be suspicious of my of own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, are you taking any literature courses at Chicago State?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I am. I am taking one there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you see that also getting in your way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It has not really so far, because I have not had to write a paper, I have only had like the class is like a tiny, little, like one-week—once a week block of (Interposing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay. And you are okay with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever—I mean, some people with their blog posts and things like that, some people blog, you know, that is their main form of—it is like progressive communication and things like that. Could you ever see writing your blog post, you know, as like if you were going to have to put it on the web?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I totally could. I used to have a blog in real life, like a writing blog, I guess. I did not really talk about anything, I just put writing that I had done onto it. But then I sort of abandoned it after a few months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But—you know what I mean, as if you could see these papers as something to take pride instead of something oh, this is what they want from me. Instead of taking it as an opportunity to learn something really well and to present it, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some—I could, yeah. About some things. (Interposing) I do not think like 100-percent all the time, I could see that, but I do not expect that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But for the bigger ones, like if you could at a paper differently instead of saying oh, this is like something annoying that I have to learn, or something that I have to do. Instead of saying like this is like a real opportunity to write something really cool, like I could actually take a really interesting topic with it, I do not have to just do the bare minimum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think I could see how it is boring when you are just doing the bare minimum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is really boring, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, like you are a smart guy, you like literature, you like analyzing, you know, put some effort in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think the idea of—because you are saying that it does not affect you in other areas of being wrong in writing. Like, kind of prevents you from getting (inaudible) oh, you are worried that your opinion is wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I am simplifying it too much when I said that, but that is definitely one of the things that happens for me. And...what was I just going to say? I just thought of something intelligent I wanted to mention when you said that, and it totally slipped my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is okay. But it does not happen in other areas or you were saying you simplified it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It happens, I guess, yeah, it does not really happen in other areas, because in most other papers or writing, you are not really expressing your own opinion that much. You are really like summarizing. You know, like in most other disciplines, it is not that your creative energy is not being involved, but you are more talking about other people's work and relating it to someone else's work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has anyone ever said like that is a shit opinion? Like written on your paper, like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not really. Actually, I guess, I mean, I have definitely gotten bad comments from papers or something that I have written. But I have never heard anyone tell me like no, you are totally wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It is probably more like grammar or like taking your time with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sloppily written or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like your general point is right, but you said this incident happened in the book, which did not, because maybe you did not read the book.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So nothing really that—would actually—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing that would—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Attacked your ego, you know, like (Interposing) of your opinion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, this is just kind of a substantiated fear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I just instinctually, I feel like it has something to do with the fact that both of my parents are like super into literature, and they were both literature majors in college. And were in grad school, and were both English teachers before they abandoned that particular career.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But it is not—so what class are you taking now? You are taking math—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am taking math, the basic structure (Interposing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That does not look good, it is like math for English majors does not look (Interposing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Interposing) psych and then political science. And my lit class—it was so weird, this has never happened to me before, on the course listing like when I signed up for the classes, 20th century American drama, and I thought it was going to be like Death of Salesman and like all those classic American plays, and I was excited for it. And then, it actually turned out to be 20th century—not even 20th century, like in general, African-American drama. Which I was a little bit confused about it at first, but it has been really interesting, and I did not know anything about African-American drama or really African-American—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So, what plays are you—?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So far we have read Big White Fog and (inaudible). We have not really gotten into like the modern period yet, we are saving it for (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great. So, that will be something then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it has been—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is new for you and you cannot even complain that this is boring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And actually like the readings that I have been doing for that, that was one of the two things I was catching up on this week, have been really interesting overall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you have been making your—setting schedules for when deadlines when you are going to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you been keeping with that? Have you started highlighting or doing the other—(Interposing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am still underlining, I guess I am sort of stuck in my underlining system.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And if you think that helps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have been a little more consistent with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is your next—for psychology, I know it is it is a lot of fact-based as opposed to—I mean, maybe it could help with literature too, with the idea of writing up—like typing up what you underlined and then putting—you know, (Interposing) and printing them out.</p>

<p>Have you thought about doing that so that when the tests come it is not that big of a deal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have thought about doing that, it is still—I was considering that actually like today in my psych class, because the class doesn't really stick to the textbook that much though, like it has a lot of—it is a really weird class. There is 800 kids in it, it is like the biggest class I have ever been in (Interposing). And we had these clickers, it is like you are on Who Wants to be a Millionaire, and every now and then they are like what is the answer to this question and it flashes on the screen and it is like A, B, C or D and you click it in and they can pick out who you are and what your answer was from the computer, it is really crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is so scary, but kind of fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. It is kind of fun, but the strangest thing I have ever done in an educational setting for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is like empirically shown to increase student participation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Interposing) I wonder if they have done all sorts of (Interposing). But there are four different teachers and there is a different one every day, it is like a rotating system. And they all approach it totally different, and one of them is very textbook centered, and it would work for his part of the test to do that. But some of them do not have any textbook readings on their days and they have individual readings. But I guess I could have like a weird composite system.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. It does not have to (Interposing) the outlines of—you know, because I have had to this before. You know, you do the outlines of the chapters, and then outlines of articles. You know, summary of articles (Interposing) abstract or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just have (Interposing) comprehensive system. But I could do that, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Because it just makes studying a lot easier and I think a lot less (sighs) how the hell am I going to do this when you know, covered in papers and like you just feeling very lost. And like what is the point? I am never going to—you know, like that feeling what the hell? I am (inaudible) anyways, so I might as well not do anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this way, it is something easy that you—have you been taking the train or are you driving still?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am driving, so most of the time I took the—well, I did not take the train, I took the bus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That is right. That is right. And that was a good time to get some studying done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Because you can get like a good two hours in there. You got an hour in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am glad it is working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I went to the library at Chicago State for the first time also, and spent like a few hours there on Tuesday and Wednesday, which was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you feeling successful?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I am feeling pretty successful so far.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do think that the success that you have had this week—because I mean, sometimes people find that when they have a setback like that math test, then there is that okay, I am going to work really hard, and then it does not last.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it has lasted a bit longer, because that was two weeks ago, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that was—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you got the grade this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got the grade this week. So, it is still pretty—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, you were still were working last week too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you can sustain this, you know, pattern that you have—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I can right now, yeah, but I am not really sure, because I have never sustained it for very long. But even now, this is way more progress than I have ever made, because usually in the past, like, in college, every time I would get a bad grade, and most of the time my reaction was not oh, how can I be super energetic and committed to my next assignment? It was oh shit, I just messed up, and I just—what am I going to do and just waffling about it forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Do you think that this is something, because we talked about, you know, the last time we were doing the motivational interview, like, what are we going to do about like graduating college? Is this something that you really want? Now that you are finding some success and taking some pride in what you are doing, at least these past couple weeks, can you see how getting your degree is something that you are going to feel—but I feel like you just seem even proud of—I do not know if you are just like (inaudible). Give me a sticker. But you know, like, I (inaudible). I will give you a little sticker.</p>

<p>There is something that you can take pride in for working hard and getting what you wanted to get done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is. I still do not see all the way to like graduation and college yet, because it is still like a year (Interposing) away from me. And it still seems pretty far.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But seeing what that could mean to you, just to have accomplished all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that is what I am starting to see how doing stuff that does not see worthwhile at all can be worthwhile in the end.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you know, like just having a lot of opportunities to learn a lot of different things that most people do not. And I know that the (inaudible) temporarily probably, you know, is something that you can look up at, something that you regret. But also you are getting this great opportunity to study somewhere else to get a different university experience. You did not go abroad at all or anything did you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I did not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is kind of your experience getting—I think it is interesting how different universities do different things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is really interesting and no, it is totally an eye opener for me, because as I said, I have been to (inaudible) and Oberlin in my life, and this really weird also private lower school before that. So, it is my first public school ever, which is pretty crazy. And definitely, I feel like not that I thought that public school was dumb and everyone who went there like did not care and it was not (inaudible), but I just did not know what it was really was like before at all, and it is nice to see that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably a lot more diversity in the student body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So, I think I had something else to say. Do you feel like the advice I am giving you is good advice or do you feel like I am babying you (inaudible) (Interposing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like it is good advice, but it is hard not feel like you are babying me, because I am at like this baby step point where it is like study skills, come on, like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know—</p>

<p>CLIENT: —motivation, things matter, (Interposing) looking at it right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you could tell me enough, when it is enough. But if it is helpful, I am happy to continue. I think that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it is definitely helpful, and I am trying to struggle not to get into that resentful mode where I say oh, I should be above this, because I am 23 and I have been to all these great schools, and I should know about study skills. Because I know that I do not really know about study skills.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is kind of funny, because you get into this pattern, you are like oh, I can do so well without any of this, but maybe all along if you had the skills—</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would have been a lot less of a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And everything would—like I can imagine studying for an exam without a plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, I think it would take a really, you know, like one of those memory savants to do that. Like there is too much to know when you get to a certain point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is not—I think a lot of times, it is not that college and courses become so hard, it is that it is a lot of work. And eventually, you cannot really rely on your intellect as much and more to get by.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think really what it is, is that like the structure of it gets built a lot more, whereas in high school it was easier to do things in—I guess it is not really true, but it is sort of easier to do things on the short-term, but college is way more building on things you were supposed to have done before. And if you did not get the building blocks, then your tower is falling apart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But as long as you stay on top of it, and stay (inaudible) and hopefully, I think things are going well, and you will see how you did on the psych test coming up. And I guess you will just work really hard on the math. Do you feel worried about the next test or do you feel like it will be okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been doing the homework before the class for the one math class I have had since I got the test back. And it was surprisingly easy when I actually did that in class, like, everyone was asking questions about things, and I was like oh wait, I could totally answer that (Interposing) because I did the homework.</p>

<p>And I am not worried about it now, but I might be later on if the—because we are starting this new, apparently, far more challenging topic that we have ever done before, and math really is not my strong point, so I am not ready to say I am totally confident, but I am feeling pretty confident.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Good. And I feel like, you know, just say all that and as much as this is for your long-term goal, this a relatively short period, like, classes are over by like December 14th or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the 17th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it is already mid-October. It is like you have two months left of this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you are done. So, I think if you can keep this up, you know, you are going to be set.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I think, you know, aim for the stars, like why not think of this as an experiment of can I get an A-plus? You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you not trying for that? It could pull up your whole GPA from Oberlin, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which is also good. Does it work like that? Do the GPAs get combined? I have no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think so. But I do not know. I see they accept these courses, or else they would not let you—</p>

<p>CLIENT: They accept at least three out of the four, I am not sure about my lit class, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, but maybe not for your major.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know what you mean. Well, you know what I mean, it is good practice. And then you will have those skills and you will take other—(Interposing) start school again, but hopefully it will be in there somewhere for Oberlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that they will. And GPA regardless, I think it would be pretty eye-opening for me to get an A-plus in a class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you mean? Would you be proud? Would you be like mom, dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I made it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would probably be proud and almost like weirdly unused to that feeling, because I have not really been proud in that many things in the academic realm any time soon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a comfortable feeling to be proud? Or is that something that you avoid? I remember you were saying that other therapist said that before in the past to you and you were like no, that was stupid. (Interposing) I am not going to say that you are wrong, but I am just curious about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I am wrong, but I have the feeling more that—well wait—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you not saying that the other therapists were saying like oh are you really just scared? Oh, that you could not succeed? And then you said to me that you were scared that maybe you were just scared to succeed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is not that I am—I think I am totally scared to succeed, but a lot of therapists have been like are you scared of failing? Because I think that is like a common thing, more people are anxious about like, oh I am not really going to do well enough on this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What it you mean if you succeeded?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it is succeeded, it would mean I would have to figure out what that meant and where I was going from there and what being successful at academics meant for me as a person, and how to integrate that into my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it mean at all like—that you were kind of like a douche in the past? Like would you feel stupid about your performance in the past or no? I am not thinking you are a douche, I was just (Interposing) kind of thinking of other things (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it is a fair question. And I might, I have not really thought about that at all. I do not think I would that much though, because even though I fucked up a lot four years in a row, part of it was really necessary for me to grow in other ways as a person, because part of why I was the way I was in high school, is that I was super intellectually and I guess intellectually developed. And I was really awfully socially developed, like, I just had not really gotten out there and like been a social person at all. I was like very shy, I'm like an only child, and I had like a few friends that I was close with, and like did not really put myself out there at all. And then I sort of launched myself into that world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, within high school or just once you got to college?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, within high school, I definitely started in high school. And that is when I started to really have problems with academics, that sort of cast me aside in the interest of the other. I said well, I am already so hyper-developed at this, I can just ignore it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And it kind of caught—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did not really say that at the time, but in retrospect, that is what it seemed like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think that maybe you know, instead of study skills, you were working on social skills?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In high school, that was my priority for sure. I was not—I did not feel like it was that important, because I felt like I had already got into a certain level at that that I did not have to worry as much. And that I was worried about the fact that I like did not really know how to interact with other people, because it seemed pretty important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I know that you said you wanted to talk about social anxiety and things like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This week. So, this is a good segway into that topic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But how is it when you went to Oberlin, was it easy to make friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was easier than it was at (inaudible), definitely. But still, it was not like a carefree process or any of that. Because I just think about things like that a lot, and I am very prone to anticipating or imagining how other people are thinking of me, even when they are probably not considering that at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, worried about judgments of others?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And things like that? How does that make you feel? Does that make you feel like if others judge you, what would that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am not really sure what it would mean, but it is more that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would it be awful to have other people judge you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess on some level, it would not be awful, but it would be bad, and I would not really know how to deal with it, because—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it is uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —confrontation. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If someone was judging you, you would be uncomfortable? And you would feel like—is that like a feeling like you cannot stand? Like to be judged?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is hard, yeah. I cannot think of that many examples of people actually judging me, except for like my parents and people that I am like really close to. And I guess it is hard for—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, when you meet a new person, like, that is—because I was trying to look at some of the answers you gave to when you meet a new person, are you kind of worried like what are they thinking about me? Is that mostly the social anxiety? Do you feel the social anxiety with people that you are close with already?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or it is more with new people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is more with new people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are they thinking about me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And more—it is more that I—it is not that I am worried about what they are thinking about me, I sort of take it two steps further and that is what makes it really complicated. I am thinking what are they thinking of me given these three different various ways I can approach the situation. And so then which should I choose to sort of anticipate how they might react.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it is kind of like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I am sort of being overly calculating about it, and not just letting myself be myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I must not make that wrong choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I must present myself in the right way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if I did not, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I did not, then, I will probably fumble it and never (inaudible) this person. And it depends on like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, maybe it is kind of catastrophic thinking, like, if I do not say the right thing, then they— (Interposing) and if they do not want to be friends with me, then how am I ever going to ever get any friends if I cannot even make friends with this person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it gets a little out of control?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sort of—I hate to say this, but it is sort of selective in a weird way, I guess. Like I do not feel this 100-percent of the time about everyone that I have ever spoken to at all. But when I am—for some reason, like, interested in someone, or I think that they seem like someone that I might get along with or think that I might want to be friends with them—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone's opinion you might actually respect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Interposing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I am sure everybody is like that, you know? When they are in (inaudible) group of people that they want to present themselves—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, if I acted like that with everyone, then I would be totally crazy, and never know how to represent myself. But no, when there is someone that I think I might want to get to know more, I totally end up thinking about things like that a lot. And it makes it harder to one, not seem nervous and then two, actually like enjoy myself and be myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you are always thinking I have got to say the right thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. That must be hard. Do you also think if I do not say the right thing, I am an asshole? Like I am worthless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, yeah, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is more the catastrophic thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is more the catastrophic thing, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Because remember we talked about the different types of irrational thoughts on that sheet, which you—I think you were supposed to fill out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was supposed to fill it out—(Interposing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now I remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You totally remember, I totally forgot to bring it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But was it working?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was working, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was working, I did not—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were filling it out and it helped?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good. You do not have to do that. I just thought it would be a good idea when you have a chance, bring it in so I can see (Interposing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I definitely want to bring it in next time, because I think that everything went well, but it is the first time I have ever done it. So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And we can work on it together. (Interposing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need some photocopies of it before I (Interposing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are like a star student (Interposing) they were like whose (inaudible). Where was I? So it is more of the catastrophic thinking and there is some self-doubting as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you know the kind of the four rational—there is the demands—</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have them (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There is the demands that other people must like me or I guess in your case it would be people that I respect must like me. I must present myself well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there is a demand. (inaudible) a demand. And there is the - if this person that I respect does not like me, that would be terrible, and that I may never make any friends, and he will tell everyone he knows that I am a weirdo.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically, yeah. Yeah. I do not think of it that way anymore, but like thinking back to how I felt when I was younger, that is totally how I thought about it, and I guess I have like abstracted it and made it more complicated for myself since then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And then there is the - if he does not like me or she does not, if the person I respect does not like me then, I am just a piece of shit, because I cannot present myself the way that I want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might be a little bit of that too, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why cannot I just say—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait, I totally thought of something. I guess I am sort of uncomfortable with people that I am friends with afterwards. In some respects, like, but just thinking about how I got kicked out of Oberlin or (inaudible) first semester from Oberlin. The dumbest thing that I did by far was not talk to my friends about how I was struggling and my girlfriend about how I was struggling with the paper that I did not turn in and the other things that I was having problems with, because I did have this feeling that I cannot really talk to them about that, because they think I am such a like smart and responsible person. And they come to like ask me about that sentence, they cannot figure out how to make it grammatically correct in that paper.</p>

<p>And like, what if I admit that like I have no motivation and like do not have any basic study skills, and I did not know how to talk about that with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it was kind of you want to present yourself—</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the best possible way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the best possible light—that you perceive is the best possible light. Obviously, it is not always—not everybody has the same aspirations. But you really want people to see you kind of as your ideal of perfect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if they do not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they do not, then—I am trying to recap the four things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is I feel like I am worthless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is pretty much I am worthless, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. Something that you can get a feel for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In that situation, so maybe it comes down to presenting yourself well, or else it is all or nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that is definitely true. And I think that going back to my past, not that I have to do that. I think that—(Interposing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have got to go find a new therapist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that it goes back to the way that I felt in eighth grade or ninth grade, whenever I started to really think about how I related to other people, because I had not really thought it about that much before. I was sort of immune to like the inevitable, like, middle school, like, taunting and like social groups and like forming little cliques, because—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were immune to it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much, yeah. It did not really bother me, because I did not really care, like, it did not really affect me in some basic way, like what other people thought about social groups. It bothered me a little bit though, and it started to bother me more and then I started to really care, and that is when I sort of tossed academics out the window and went for social life. And when I started to feel a lot more anxiety about meeting people.</p>

<p>Because in the past, I was not even thinking about how other people were considering me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is kind of a lesson?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably had an easier time (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I totally did. (Interposing) was not really—well, I guess it was not because I was not looking for that much. But while I was not thinking about it, I was like only looking for like two or three like close like friends that I could like hang out with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then once you became very preoccupied with presenting yourself well all the time, it became harder to actually make those relationships?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It became a lot harder, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And why do you think that you have to present yourself like ideally all the time? (Interposing) friends? Or not make friends? Which one do you want to work on? Like the working—I mean, I am sure they are related, but like the fact that you could not tell this to your close friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely want to work on that, because like in general, I do not want to be like hiding the things I should be asking for advice, (inaudible) people I kept getting advice from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it seems like you have overcome the, like, you can meet people now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even though you are probably still having those thoughts like what should I say next?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I want to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most people have that too, a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do not expect that to go away, because I do not think that I am one of those really amazing (inaudible) people who like walk into a room and like chit-chat with everyone, like, have this amazing (inaudible) grace. Like that is just not who I am on some level. But I want to reduce that a little bit. And I do want to work on that with the friendships I already have as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So what was the thought of why you could not tell it to your girlfriend? And you said that you are not together right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is—I will talk about that. But I could—(Interposing). I did not talk to her about it because it is hard to really say, but I think that one, I did not want to disappoint her, two, I was scared that she would not want to be with me if she knew how bad things were, because in the past, we had been dating since freshmen year of college for two years. And we were together pretty much consistently except for this one time that we broke up for like a month in sophomore year. And it was about me being totally directionless and not sure what I was doing at school.</p>

<p>My girlfriend said like that is not who I am and I do not want to have to be responsible for that. And it feels like you have so much confusion that it is inevitable you are going to put that on me in this relationship. And I said well, shit, like, you are right. I do not really know how to contest that. And we broke up for a while, but then she said maybe I take it back, and I think that you can figure it out on your own if you go to therapy and work on that, which I was not really (inaudible) about doing.</p>

<p>And so then after that, I sort of had this pressure in my mind, like, I have to make things seem okay with Sasha otherwise, she will break up with me again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must be very stressful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think thirdly, there was like a little bit of self-destructive element, because like in retrospect, like, it is obvious that if I talk to her about it, she would have sat down and been like whoa, you are being crazy. Like what is going on, like, sit down and work really hard on this until you finish it right now, and do not do anything else. And I probably would not have been kicked out of Oberlin if I talked to her about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What was her response when you had to tell her what had happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really complicated, because I basically told her right before I found out that I had got kicked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You told her that you did not finish the paper and then you got kicked out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So, what was her response to all this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her response was—she was angry at first, and then that passed like remarkably quickly, I expected her to be angry at me for way longer. And then it was mostly—I guess disbelief really, because like two days after I told her, I found out that I was not going to be at Oberlin next semester, and my parents gave me this ultimatum, you have to move out of the house you just moved into with her. And so, it was basically just trying to come to terms with all of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So it was hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, in that situation, that is pretty hard, because I think most people would be like well, I probably should talk about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But eventually, they probably would have. Did you break up with Sasha or did Sasha break up with you? Why do you not get into this a little—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So, we were not really sure what was going on at first. At first she was angry and she thought I am going to break up with you because you are leaving, you sort of abandoned me. So, it is not even that I am breaking up with you, it is that you fucked up and you are going to be off doing something else for like the next year. And that passed pretty quickly, and then it was well, I do not want to break up with you, but you are leaving, and what is really going to happen when you leave?</p>

<p>And then we just—we were together and we were—we spent like all of our time together before I actually left, and we were really sad about that. I am like—and then we sort of oscillated ever since then about what we were really doing. And basically, we are—it has made it a lot more complicated, because we were already in an open relationship before all this happened, but it was like a weird—I guess a gay open relationship, I hook up with guys, and Sasha could hook up with girls, because she had already admitted she was interested in other women, and had been with a girl before she dated me.</p>

<p>And I had not really explored that about myself, it is something that I have known for a while. And I did not really do much with, except for like kiss a boy once. And then, I said well—and I said it, but we both sort of were thinking about the same gender and really did not know what to do about it because we were in this really long-term like committed relationship and did not really loved each other.</p>

<p>And we said well, this is really crazy, but maybe we can sort of explore that while we are also together, and surprisingly, it actually worked out. I have had dismal track record amongst other open relationships I have ever been in, or any that I have heard of from anyone I have ever known. It does not really seem to work out very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it seems to be working...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It worked out pretty well for us. In the like three months that we were doing it before I got kicked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is interesting though, because a school like Oberlin, you are probably like—do you tell each other about the hook ups?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you probably know like all the people that you are—(Interposing) hooking up with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that is really funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (Interposing) really jealous of you or anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was not really that much jealousy, no. Like actually, Sasha was more jealous than I was and I think that in general, doing it with people of the same gender, somehow made it easier. Like, it—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It probably felt less like cheating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It probably felt less threatening or somehow—even though that does not really make sense at all, but there really was not that much jealousy. And what there was, we really like talked through really hard, and worked through pretty successfully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then when we broke up—we did not break up, but when I left to live at home and then go to Chicago State, we said well, even if we stay together, we would still be in this open relationship that we were having before, unless we suddenly become monogamous while we are not together, which does not really make sense.</p>

<p>So, our choices were should we still be in an open relationship and still like talk all the time and visit whenever or should we have some sort of weird not quite relationship, but we still talk all the time? And like sometimes I visit and we are sort of together when I am there but not really? And we sort of wavered between those different options. I have only been up to visit once so far. And it was really hard, because there was all that ambiguity about what was really going on, and we fought a lot, there was also (inaudible) money issues about the rent for the house that I was going to be living in, and I had signed a lease on. That made it even more complicated.</p>

<p>And we still have not really resolved that at all. But here is the—like the fact sheet of what is going on right now. We still talk on the phone a lot—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like every day or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not quite every day, but like every two days, for sure. And I have only seen her that one time when I went up for the weekend, but when I was there it was—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was not good, but we did not act as though anything was different when we were there. Except that we fought a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Alright. So, and since you were open before, I guess you are still open now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I know that Sasha has hooked up with other people, because she told me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Other guys as well or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I have not hooked up with anyone else since then, because I have had a lot else going on and I did not feel like it was really my first priority anyway. But it is just hard, because especially I want to go and visit everyone else that I know at Oberlin. Some of them are living in the same house with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So now it is like a weird—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I—what I sort of want to figure out, and I have been trying to do this with her, but it is really hard because both of our opinions about what we want changes a lot over time. I am just trying to figure out a way to still be in touch but not have all of that confusion and uncertainty. But I do not know what that would really be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, thank you for filling me in. I guess that is a lot to think about and you have to think about what you want from this relationship. But it does make it hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does make it really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Going back to Oberlin, but not impossible, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, that is sort of the reason that I decided that I probably should not go back to Oberlin in the spring, because it would have been already really hard to see all of my friends graduate while I am like just starting my senior year. But also, it would have been really hard to be there with Sasha and to have that strange newness to whatever was going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you see yourself as getting—going back together at some point? Or no, you kind of think that was the beginning of the end?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do not really know, honestly. In some ways, I guess I do see it as the beginning of the end, but it is weird for me to say that, because we talked about, like, we were not really sure what was going to happen after college, and we talked about maybe meeting to go and be in different places and do different things, and we were already in a relationship, so we were okay with the possibility of wanting to be with other people.</p>

<p>But we were both sort of—I mean, we were both really in love with each other, and I still am, and it is hard for me not to think about that at the same time that it also seems really unrealistic to think that we would be together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it is not that unrealistic, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are like two hours away, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it is two hours away. But more in the long-term, because we are two hours away for right now. But then I am going to be at some other location in the spring, I am not sure where. And then when I go back to Oberlin, Sasha might not be two hours away from me, she might be like traveling through India, Morocco, Spain and some other countries she is trying to go do for her grant that she is trying to get.</p>

<p>And she has all sorts of other crazy plans, so—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe it will be hard, so this could be a good time on your own. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am not really sure like what I really want out of that though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like the way that this has all gone has kind of affected your self-worth a bit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. But not as much as it easily could have, given what happened. I definitely felt like an awful human being at first in the dealing with the fact that I was going to have to move out, and I felt like I was definitely, like, breaking this girl's heart really hard and that was hard to deal with. And not that I have like resolved all those feelings, but I guess that I have sort of resolved them, because I know that it was not really about her, it was really about what was going on with me. And the problems that I have been having for longer than I have known her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well sorry, I feel like we got a little off topic. But I feel like it was important for me to understand all this stuff. And we can work on, you know, disputing the irrational thoughts that you have about revealing—I think in that situation, I do not know (inaudible), like I can understand why you would not want to say that, but if it is a reoccurring pattern, on not wanting to open up about your faults, and do you think it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do you think it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So we can easily work on this being that, and then work on strangers—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I take it back, it definitely is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs) okay. So, we can definitely work on that. Next week as well as the studying, but do you feel like you have the studying stuff—I think just keep up on the schedules like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —for homework on bringing the sheet next time and work on it. And every time you have like one of those irrational thoughts like I (inaudible) really do not have to do it. You know, write it down and challenge it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I am going to give myself homework. This is crazy, I have never given myself homework ever. But I think my homework for next week should be do what I was trying to do for this week, but I did not really get around to it, because I had so much catch up work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh to do it all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Interposing) to do the homework. So next Thursday, I should have all the work done for next, next Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So I will see you on Thursday and you can tell me if that is really what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I like that homework. Okay, George. Oh wait, I am seeing you Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you are right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Remember? At 9:30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, at 9:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think you can do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rush hour is going to be awful, but I will do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. If you are a few minutes late—it will be okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will try not to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that and I will let the front desk know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Let me write that down, because otherwise I will totally forget.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Definitely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that is—wait, today is the 8th, so that is Wednesday the 14th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A.m. Sweet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 9:30. Maybe I am going to write this down the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a piece of paper? (inaudible) confidential (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually have—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that is the 14th. Right?</p>

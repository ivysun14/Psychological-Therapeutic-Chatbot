<p>COUNSELOR: Client Grogan. Interview 10. Client Grogan. Interview 10. (inaudible at 1:04:04.6) [1:04:04.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:04:32.5) with my glasses at all. (inaudible at 1:04:37.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you think there's a —</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:04:42.4) and stuff like that. And, I use them so seldom that my eyes hurt when I don't wear them. They hurt when they wear them. (inaudible at 1:04:51.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have nothing to say today. (Laughs) I've been thinking — I'm feeling really frustrated about that. I don't know. I keep saying to myself that in approximately a month I'm supposed to understand myself better and I just I think oh, that's not going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You say to yourself in approximately a month, I'm going to understand myself and it seems to you right now that that's absolutely impossible. [1:06:04.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yes. It does. And it's — I think it's (inaudible at 1:06:11.7) what can I do? I don't know what to do. And, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes — it sounds like it makes you feel desperate or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not desperate. No. Not desperate. I (inaudible at 1:06:31.0) I — lazy. No, not lazy. Apathetic. Maybe apathetic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes it sound a little (inaudible at 1:06:47.7) your fault that you don't understand yourself. That you're — this is going to fail and it's your fault.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, it probably would be my fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you just weren't so apathetic then things would fall apart. [1:07:08.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Yeah. No. I'm letting myself become apathetic because I think that I'm not doing anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like no. No. No. I thought you were (inaudible at 1:07:24.1) become apathetic because it doesn't seem like anything is going to work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, so it's like as long as I don't have a chance, why try?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And if I try and fail, that's worse than if I don't try. I think. Yeah. And, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's sort of better to go down without a fight than —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. For the past week, I've been telling myself that I — there's nothing to understand about myself at all. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to sell yourself a bill of goods (ph). [1:08:04.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. And I've been telling myself that for all I know, this very well could (inaudible at 1:08:12.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I don't have any problems. I make them up and I'm — and the only problem that I have is that I'm very spoiled. That's my thought. That was my thought last week and it's my thought this week only stronger. And I don't know why. Maybe that's true but —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:08:34.2) and I don't (inaudible at 1:08:36.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying it may be true but —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't buy it really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I don't want to accept it. Yeah. I mean I —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That maybe you don't buy it yet. You don't buy it because it's not a nice thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I can say that I act certain ways not because of anything else except not getting my own way. I mean I can look at it like that. [1:09:10.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it all sort of makes sense that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It does. So I — maybe that's the truth. I don't want to accept it. I don't want (Laughs) (inaudible at 1:09:20.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're rather it be — there would be something to understand you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But — yeah. But I'm — I really — what I'm really wondering about that now. Yeah. I mean I'm sure that to a certain extent I am like that. And I'm thinking that maybe the reason I act all different kinds of ways is because a lot of times I'm bored. I want to be entertained or I want to (inaudible at 1:09:57.4) I don't know. Maybe it's not because I feel inadequate maybe it's just (inaudible at 1:10:03.9) I don't know. Like why not do something else? Probably that's not true. (inaudible at 1:10:17.0) I probably want to do something else for a different reason. Boy, I'm really rambling. Are you understanding (inaudible at 1:10:26.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know what it is you think I'm not understanding.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well it just seemed like I was jumping around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:10:36.8) these kinds of feeling that I'm having about this is part only here (inaudible at 1:10:45.4) that other places too. Like on the one hand, it feels like there's something wrong with me but not — well, yeah, I guess. (inaudible at 1:10:55.2) not liking this (inaudible at 1:10:57.8) don't like this or something. [1:11:01.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't referring to therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No. But I thought you were saying your feelings were the same like of not knowing what's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't really have any trouble I don't think now. I mean like and I'm stuck. And I am floundering on (inaudible at 1:11:30.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are you floundering?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's that I don't seem to be getting anything (ph). Maybe I am and don't know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I sure don't know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. If you are, it's a monumental surprise. What do you want to get? [1:12:04.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to understand why I do some things or why I react to some things in the way that I do. And I think about that a lot now. Now I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Meaning since therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, before I just sort of accepted it. Now I'm thinking maybe that's just better. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you said I shouldn't try to psychoanalyze these things but just sort of forget about why.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't feel I'm going to find out why. (inaudible at 1:12:48.9) I feel (inaudible at 1:12:50.5) at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well now — now wait, wait, wait. It sounds like the issues for you is so not whether you just — it's like if you could really know why, you'd like that. But the issue is like you want to (inaudible at 1:13:12.0) out. [1:13:12.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how to (inaudible at 1:13:14.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it. I think I don't know what — I come in here and I talk about things. And I don't really say anything that I haven't already thought about. And sometimes you make things clearer to me which you do but it's like there's no (inaudible at 1:13:34.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I guess (inaudible at 1:13:38.1) I really (inaudible at 1:13:40.6) And, I suppose that's wrong but —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right or wrong, it's like you're (inaudible at 1:13:53.0) find out if you're like (inaudible at 1:13:57.9) in terms of anything really important or really large — [1:14:05.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Maybe there's nothing wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 1:14:13.5) I don't know what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If there's nothing large, how come therapy? You know like it because it sounds like why do you need therapy if there's nothing wrong?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I really don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:15:03.0) every time I come here what am I going to talk about? And I never know. So, sometimes I try and think of something. And sometimes I feel I don't (inaudible at 1:15:14.4) at all because I couldn't think of anything. [1:15:17.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:15:17.7) Yeah. (inaudible at 1:15:27.1) to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:15:29.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. But probably things happen that I forget about that. I mean some things bother me. But I think well I've always talked about something like that. Like I (inaudible at 1:15:53.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I've always talked about something and I — and so what? [1:16:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:16:05.3) like — it's like that's say James is talking to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like (inaudible at 1:16:15.3) if you talked about that once and something (inaudible at 1:16:20.5) why talk about it again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:16:26.9) I just don't understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:16:29.0) I don't know if it makes any difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean (inaudible at 1:16:42.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. If it makes any difference that I talked about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:16:48.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:16:53.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. I understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:16:56.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:17:03.0) [1:17:03.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I only do that when I'm (inaudible at 1:17:07.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible at 1:17:23.4) it's like if you talk about it once and it doesn't work then you don't want to talk about again because you feel it's not going to work. Oh. So, it must really feel like (inaudible at 1:17:36.4) kind of think about the kinds of things you've talked about (inaudible at 1:17:40.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes. Yeah. I guess (inaudible at 1:17:45.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess like that's (inaudible at 1:17:49.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:17:54.7) talk about (inaudible at 1:17:58.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If it's something that is — something (inaudible at 1:18:01.5) Some things are just the same and I know that I — [1:18:06.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:18:07.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: There seems to be a problem (inaudible at 1:18:10.3) or really I don't know think about them anymore. (inaudible at 1:18:15.0) And, I didn't want to talk about this when I came in here (inaudible at 1:18:28.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is like one — something you've talked about before or —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) I feel like I'm always talking about this. And because I'm always talking about this, I don't seem to be getting anywhere (inaudible at 1:18:47.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you're so locked in on it that you can't move anywhere else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't talk to you about (inaudible at 1:19:00.3) it doesn't get anywhere for me. [1:19:02.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep hoping it will if I talked about it (inaudible at 1:19:09.9) Plus sometimes when I talk like I start telling you one new point like in therapy and then I (inaudible at 1:19:27.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:19:31.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like I say to you nothing's happening yet. I think well, no that's not really true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's sort of like whatever you say in here many times (inaudible at 1:19:44.0) there's another side of it too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Like there's nothing really (inaudible at 1:19:51.9) at all. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to — you sometimes (inaudible at 1:19:55.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe that's (inaudible at 1:20:04.0) I'm not thinking about (inaudible at 1:20:16.4) think about those (inaudible at 1:20:19.1)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I'm (inaudible at 1:20:33.2) One of them is I don't have anger. When I get angry or then I'm feeling (inaudible at 1:20:45.3) but I'm also thinking that — I'm thinking of what the other person is — trying to think of what the other person is feeling. And I really end up putting myself in the wrong (inaudible at 1:21:00.3) or — it's like I never feel I'm all — [1:21:07.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:21:07.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:21:09.8) it's like (inaudible at 1:21:11.1) but like feeling angry, all of the sudden, you feel guilty (inaudible at 1:21:19.8) another person's feelings. And you just can't (inaudible at 1:21:26.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible at 1:21:42.7)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of the time, I think (inaudible at 1:22:16.0) Maybe that's not (inaudible at 1:22:18.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:22:22.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe. Like a lot of times (inaudible at 1:22:29.2) before anybody else no matter what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:22:41.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But without having anything else to do (inaudible at 1:22:51.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm always waiting for something to happen (inaudible at 1:22:59.9) And I find it very hard to (inaudible at 1:23:11.6) [1:23:12.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:23:15.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're here and you have to be active instead of (inaudible at 1:23:27.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that is hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:23:31.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:23:37.3) What happens (inaudible at 1:23:47.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It just happens that on Mondays I always — that's the only day that I (inaudible at 1:23:54.3) for some reason.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't even know what I'm (inaudible at 1:24:33.5) sometimes I do but (inaudible at 1:24:36.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:24:44.1) some sort of (inaudible at 1:24:47.8) And you don't know what (inaudible at 1:24:52.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Nothing — yeah, nothing really is important most of the time. I'm trying to think if I make it that way. I don't know. [1:25:22.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you what? When you (inaudible at 1:25:34.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe nothing is important. See. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want you to (inaudible at 1:25:57.8) I want you to (inaudible at 1:26:04.1) I'm not sure about all (inaudible at 1:26:09.5) It's like a part of you that sort of says I have some sort of problems or things about me that (inaudible at 1:26:21.5) things that are important to me. And then it sounds like the other part of you (inaudible at 1:26:31.6) like nothing is very important (inaudible at 1:26:35.7) So what I'd like you to do (inaudible at 1:26:46.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:26:54.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 1:26:56.3) talk about that. Talk about (inaudible at 1:27:05.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. [1:27:09.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:27:10.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is hard. I knew what you were going to say while — before you said it. And I'm still (inaudible at 1:27:14.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 1:27:16.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I'll do it. But I'm — I think that —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:27:20.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I telegram my lines. And then (inaudible at 1:27:27.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:27:34.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm going to have to ask you to sit in that chair and talk to me anyway. (inaudible at 1:27:50.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:28:04.4) recently it's (inaudible at 1:28:09.4) and all of this (inaudible at 1:28:11.1) And I don't think I have anything (inaudible at 1:28:18.5) And I think I feel (inaudible at 1:28:23.1) too much. And there was no reason for me to be bored or upset, I was (inaudible at 1:28:28.6) I was (inaudible at 1:28:30.0) And I wanted something to do and I didn't do anything. (inaudible at 1:28:39.7) And, any of the feelings that I felt were just because I think I didn't want to go. I didn't know what else I wanted to do but I wanted to do something else or do something exciting that I (inaudible at 1:29:12.2) and I didn't do anything at all. And I was just waiting for somebody to do something for me (inaudible at 1:29:21.6) [1:29:21.7]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's the way I feel a lot of times. Like even when I (inaudible at 1:29:56.0) I think that I'm just looking for attention. (inaudible at 1:30:03.4) I must have been —</p>

<p>(inaudible from 1:30:11.5 to 1:30:56.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If some — if somebody else doesn't want to do the things, I usually (inaudible at 1:31:01.3) anything I want to do especially. And I go along with whatever anybody suggests. (inaudible at 1:31:07.0) when I do, I'm resentful. Because (inaudible at 1:31:17.4) I want all the attention centered on me. But mostly why I'm like (inaudible at 1:31:32.7) [1:31:34.6]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think (inaudible at 1:32:07.7) if I don't get my own way. And I know I (inaudible at 1:32:11.8) And I start depending on (inaudible at 1:32:17.9) [1:32:17.9]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:33:10.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:33:12.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:33:22.8)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:34:41.6) I'm not (inaudible at 1:34:50.8) that I am (inaudible at 1:35:00.9) But I stop myself and I think (inaudible at 1:35:18.1) I don't know what it is but I know what I (inaudible at 1:35:24.1) But I do have feelings about some (inaudible at 1:35:50.7) but I just (inaudible at 1:35:53.9) [1:35:55.2]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:36:13.7)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to say (inaudible at 1:36:44.5) Even when I'm thinking (inaudible at 1:36:49.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:36:51.8)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:37:39.1) I don't know what to say. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:37:45.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the things that I was thinking of before, I completely (inaudible at 1:37:47.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible at 1:37:51.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am. I don't know why. (inaudible at 1:37:56.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you (inaudible at 1:38:00.5) It sounds like you got out of (inaudible at 1:38:06.6) [1:38:08.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come — can you get a handle on what's bothering you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not that I didn't want to (inaudible at 1:38:19.1) When I was first (inaudible at 1:38:27.1) but they are. I've completely gone through my head. And everything I was thinking of it's like you know that's not true. Because of — because you really feel — and (inaudible at 1:38:56.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like you're sure that you want (inaudible at 1:39:05.2) [1:39:07.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. It's too good, isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds as though (inaudible at 1:39:11.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) (inaudible at 1:39:13.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was (inaudible at 1:39:22.7) and I couldn't stay here. I couldn't stay here when I was over there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's easy to say I'm a spoiled brat and like pout. And I like men to pay attention to me. Like that stuff is easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact a lot of times I'm conscious of thinking boy, I couldn't take that on another day. Or I'll be able to think boy, what's wrong with me? But you can't take that. And I'm (inaudible at 1:40:07.1) both times and I'm different. But I like the first way better. [1:40:12.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you experience the second way as being kind of weak.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you shouldn't (inaudible at 1:40:21.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take those things and really be hurt by them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they really hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think they really hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this thing is that I try not to like them and I think to myself that it's ridiculous even if it's (inaudible at 1:40:50.4) We were going to this picnic that I'm planning on Saturday morning. I'm usually kind of (inaudible at 1:41:02.2) And I started off (inaudible at 1:41:06.5) and getting depressed because I didn't want to go to this (inaudible at 1:41:11.4) And we were riding out there. I don't remember. There were a bunch of people. And I think it was like (inaudible at 1:41:48.1) James was making fun of my singing. (inaudible at 1:41:51.6) But that day, it wasn't okay at all. And I forgot what I was going to say about it. Oh, even at the time I thought that it was wrong for me to feel like that because I was letting myself do that. I was letting myself react. [1:42:16.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were like (inaudible at 1:42:16.7) yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it. That's the word. (inaudible at 1:42:19.7) yourself.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then it occurred like you having no (inaudible at 1:42:32.0) when I don't really — I don't really want to — letting myself enjoy the luxury of what it tastes like (inaudible at 1:42:42.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: We don't talk about (inaudible at 1:42:45.6) (Laughs) And I'm really hungry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like - it seemed like you had no right to your reactions (inaudible at 1:43:02.3) Like — well no, it's not even that. It's more like they're not your (inaudible at 1:43:09.8) they're not even — yeah (inaudible at 1:43:11.7) to my reactions. The reason is because they're not really reactions. They're like something I'm doing to myself. [1:43:17.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's exactly right. Both things are exactly right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 1:43:26.4) yourself by doing (inaudible at 1:43:28.2) like there's strings on you (inaudible at 1:43:35.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess so.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way. On the way down here, I was thinking that I — whatever (inaudible at 1:43:54.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:44:05.4) you're saying now like you're shallow and that leads to (inaudible at 1:44:10.0) from the inside. [1:44:12.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's what I was —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you were thinking then? And now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes it's — yeah. It's like strange or something. But it's because I feel like the way I should do usually — not —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Always.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not — yeah, not always.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like sometimes it feels like you want to be (inaudible at 1:44:40.6) so you are (inaudible at 1:44:41.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. No. I didn't mean that. That's what I meant not always.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like I don't feel happy or something. And I'm trying real hard to do it like that. That's what I meant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So that sounds really like the opposite of like the things James (inaudible at 1:45:00.1) Sometimes you've got to make yourself feel (inaudible at</p>

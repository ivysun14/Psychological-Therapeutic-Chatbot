<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Sniff, Pause)  While I was coming today, ½ things occurred to me.  And when I think of them both right now, I feel sort of nervous about it.  One was that, I was late starting from home today, because I've set a certain number of reports that I want to do before I come here after I hurry home from school.  And I'm afraid if I don't keep up to that number, that then I'll sort of lose my whole drive to get anything done.  And I knew that it would be very close, when I was working on the last one.  But I kept thinking, if I have any part of it to do when I get back, it might just throw me off for the rest of the evening.  And so it was kind of a like a prop. </p>
 
<p>And then, the other thing that occurred to me was, it's a little incident that occurred at school.  And I knew it bothered me at the time, but I didn't think about it afterwards until I was on the train.  Uh, th—, this was in connection with FHYZ.  I had wanted to see her to ask her ½ question about the reports.  And just before she had, was coming out from lunch in the elevator, and just before I saw her, another teacher was looking for her to ask if she were coming to their meeting, which she usually does. </p>
 
<p>And so when I saw FHYZ my thought was, she's going to be in a hurry to get to the meeting, and I'll just ask the question quickly.  And I, in effect said that, I said something about, I know you're going to this meeting, but I just wanted to ask you this on your way up, or some such thing.  And she then said, "Well I want to see you.  And would you go get FBS?"  And then she got out of the elevator on that floor, which was not the floor she was going to.  But she turned a key which will keep the elevator there. </p>
 
<p>And so, instead of saying, do you want me to hold the elevator and wait for you, I started saying, "Well, shall I go up right now and get FBS?"  Or, I don't know, but I was thinking, uhm, are you coming back into the elevator?  But I didn't really ask it that way, and it was more as if I were completely uncertain about exactly the direction that she was giving to me.  And I wanted to follow them precisely.  And both FYLR and FBS's assistant were in the elevator.  So I think, it might have bothered me anyway that I'd gotten sort of confused over how to express myself to FHYZ.  But the fact they were there made me feel worse. </p>
 
<p>And it just, when I was thinking about it on the train (Sigh), I don't know, it was, it was this way I'll change completely when there's somebody, who's, has authority over me.  Uhm, uh, I don't know, what I mean is uhm, more the, the way I'll lose perspective. I can't even express myself then.  And uh, only thing I'm thinking of is that I be obedient and do exactly what is wanted. (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And when I was thinking of this on the way here, somehow it seemed connected with what I've been trying to think about, the last ½ days.  But I, now I'm not sure exactly how it is connected, except that it obviously shows I don't have confidence.  Or that — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Can you say er, any more?  Do you think any more about how you felt at that moment when she said she wanted to see you and FBS?  What you tell me is that you acted as though you were confused.  Can you, do you know how you felt?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Interrupts, overlapping with the therapist's last sentence) Yeah, well, it was a switch in my thinking.  I had thought, I want to see you, and then she reversed it and wasn't even reacting to well, what do you want to see me about?  But simply, well, I want to see you, and I imagine I was apprehensive.  But not — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: (Interrupts) As though you were going to be called on the carpet, or something?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, she said, "So we don't have to have a general faculty meeting."  So, so I knew that it was more in the form of an announcement.  And I thought, well maybe she wanted to tell us something about the reports, since they were due soon.  I don't think I was apprehensive once I went to get FBS.  But I think the fact she switched what I expected her to say.  Because I expected her to say, "Oh, what do you want to see me about?", or something like that.  And the fact she switched it, I think, is what confused me.  And maybe I had a momentary feeling of apprehension, I wonder what she could want to see me about. </p>
 
<p>But, well it's strange because it's mixed with, I mean — in a way I didn't think there was anything she could want to see me about that I was afraid of, so, I was just curious to know what she wanted to see me about.  But I always have this feeling of apprehension with people when they say, "I want to see you," if they're superior to me in work, with my superiors.  And so it was sort of a combination of just this habitual reaction of apprehension.  And then, a feeling of curiosity. (Pause)</p> 
 
<p>But when I think about that incident, the thing that bothers me is that, that I was observed by the other two girls uhm, as being confused.  But because I was being so — I don't know what to say — dependent on doing the right thing, or in any case, it made me feel very young and out of control.  And here were two people that, well, one is my assistant who I'm supposed to be controlling, directing, anyway.  And (Sniff) so somehow that seems to be part of what's bothering me about it. (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And maybe, the other part which contributes to the uneasiness that I feel when I think I was observed and all this, uh, is that when I asked her if she wanted me to go up right now, instead of saying, "Shall I hold the elevator?" FHYZ, I knew she wanted me to go up now, in terms of, before I did anything else.  And that she didn't understand what I meant by "now" when I said it.  But she answered me in sort of an exasperated way, "Yes, right now."  And uhm, so I don't know whether it's because I didn't express myself or that in some way I displeased her.  Here I was so eager to do exactly the right thing and I ended up displeasing her. (3-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>I was just thinking about that in terms of (Sniff) what I've been trying to think about the last ½ days.  And (Sigh) again, I, I can't quite recall what I was thinking when I connected it earlier on the way here.  But right now, it just seems like it's appalling me that I could react the way I did.  I probably have a lot, but having people there to see it made me more aware of it.  And I don't know whether it's because I think I appeared foolish, or th—, I thought so little of myself that I could react that way.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: You know, if there's a connection — and there may be some that are not apparent to me — it seems to me it must be that the things you have wanted to avoid, the conflict you hadn't wanted to think about, say yesterday for example, must be really what's troubling you.  Because it sounds from what you say as though your feeling is rather out of proportion to the event.  You are much more exasperated with yourself than you, than the situation you described sounds like it would call for.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Y—, m—, as, I'm transferring the feeling I'd have to what I don't want to think about. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, I me—, ah, it sounds like it's some other — </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Mm. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: — thing that's accounting for the feeling.  Not the situation itself.  And, of course, one thing you have been avoiding thinking about, is your feelings about the whole idea of getting pregnant.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) What that brings to mind, well, first I thought I just don't understand why I am avoiding thinking about it.  And, and then again, I don't understand the great fluctuation in my reaction to it when I do think about it, when I'm not here.  And then I think of, last night uhm, I saw in the paper that they were going to have hearings on the pill, and they cited that some doctor has found incidences of a rare disease — I don't remember what it was called — but where there are uhm, I don't know, triple whatever genes, whatever it is, instead of double and uhm, the fact that most of these unborn children are aborted.  And I immediately started thinking both well, should I try to become pregnant after I stop taking the pill, or, or not.  Because I wouldn't want to risk that, even though it seems like the child never lives who has this disease. </p>
 
<p>And then — I don't know wh—, MSCZ — I mentioned it to MSCZ and he said well, maybe we better wait awhile, then.  And immediately I thought, well I don't want to wait and yet, in a way I know I do.  And I also was thinking that it must be just awful to have, g—, I guess, y, you'd call it a miscarriage.  And, and yet I've known people who've had them and that they've hardly even known it.  Or that it — anyway that it's not necessarily that painful or awful to go through.  But it was almost as if, if it happened to me, then I — the conclusion would be I couldn't have any children.</p> 
 
<p>And also sometimes I start thinking that I won't be able to have any children, because I'm so old.  And I don't know where I've gotten that idea.  Oh the only way — the thing I think of when I think of that, is my mother once saying something about a friend of hers who was eager for her daughter to have a child, and daughter had been married for awhile.  And she was in her late twenties, I think still in her late twenties.  And my mother said something that, this woman was worried that the best years for bearing children were going by, and her daughter hadn't had any yet.  And, I don't know, I don't think I paid that much attention to it at the time, but now it seems like I'm fixing on it. (Pause)</p> 
 
<p>It almost seems like whatever I do, if I stop working, I'm afraid of something.  Either I'm afraid of being pregnant and then having children and, I don't know, meeting whatever test I think it will be that can I function as a woman.  Or that, if try to become pregnant and I can't, that then that will prove that I can't function as a woman. (Silence) </p>
 
<p>And it's funny how I was thinking about, too, the, I don't, I do want to have children.  And so there's this conflict of wanting them and yet being afraid of beginning to try somehow.  And also being afraid of just not working and therefore not — right now it seems to me — not having anything to do.  And then I, I was just thinking that, whenever MSCZ and I used to talk about how many children we'd want to have, he always said no more than two. </p>
 
<p>And, I don't know, I guess, I don't know why I was feeling this way, but I always thought I'd want more than two.  I don't know, I just, I don't know whether it's because I was afraid something might happen to some, and therefore I'd want enough so that there'd be some living no matter what happened.  Or, if it just seemed nicer to have a bigger family, or just what.  But, and then MSCZ said, if we have more than two, we'll have to adopt them.  And at the first times that he said this, I was extremely upset by that.  And now it seems like a very attractive idea to me.  But then other times, I can't imagine having children at all, in that I'd be functioning as a mother.  And so I, I go from being able to visualize it to a certain extent, and then just feeling that I won't be able to do it at all. </p>
 
<p>And I think also, uh, I don't know — this must have occurred to me last night — that seeing this girl, whose husband I mentioned yesterday who was at the party, uh — seeing the girl, and how she's reacted since she just had a baby, has made me afraid in a way, in that she's acting just the way I, I don't want to be.  And I don't know how to explain that, except that i,, it's just, the child is everything now, all her thoughts are on the child.  I mean, a child should be important, but (Sniff) that's all her life is now.  And all she wants it to be.  And I, I don't know whether it's because I think it might happen to me because that's the way it is when you're with a young child and you don't have any help.  Or whether I'm afraid that I'd let it happen, because I'd be afraid of exerting myself to do anything else. </p>
 
<p>And again, I wh—, if I try to visualize what else I'd do if I had children, the only thing that I can imagine is what my mother did.  Somehow getting out and being in organizations and committees, and things of that nature.  Which maybe in the end, if I were in the kind I enjoyed, I would like.  But somehow that whole image just appalls me, and I don't know why it is, except I know it's connected with my mother. </p>

<p>I think it's because, probably anyway, because that whole thing stands for a lack of real interest or involvement to me, since my mother seemed to just kind of be going through the motions without really being interested in the things she did do.  And she would always be saying things like, "Well I'm not going to take on anymore.  And yet they needed me and so I did it," or, in any case, it was always almost like it was civic duty, rather than something she really wanted to do.  Maybe that's why I have this horror of it. (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And it is true, too, when I think of my interests, I don't really think of them in the same category as the committee work my mother did.  Even though it could end up being committee work — if I were working on something connected with education — I don't think I'd think of it the same way.  But yet, when I think of my mother and a lot of the things she did, I think of her being either a secretary for something, as she was for various things, and so all that means to me is just writing reports, which she used to hate to do.  Or else, doing something connected with raising money.  And that to me is, has just no interest whatsoever.  And she's done a lot of that. (Pause)</p> 
 
<p>But maybe, I don't know, I was just thinking, maybe I would even find raising money something I wanted to do if it were for something I were really concerned about.  And I, I don't know, something about the fact that my mother, for all these years has done things that I call committee work, that she hasn't really wanted to do or been interested in doing. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Just to get away from you?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well I don't, I must have seen that way.  I know I thought of it in terms of to get away from us, meaning all of us children.  But, and I know it made me very angry.  And so, I don't know whether I ever saw it as just particularly me.  But it was obvious that it wasn't satisfying to my mother to be at home and to be a mother and a housewife.  In fact, she showed such obvious distaste for any of those, anything connected with either of those roles.  She hated cooking, cleaning.  She didn't want to be around when we were, because she was always off at committee meetings.</p>
 
<p>And never had fun with us when she did.  She was always just disciplining.  And, it's terrible.  Now I can think of her doing things that she enjoys doing.  But if I think back to any time before I finished with high school, I can't think of anything she did that I think of as something she enjoyed doing.  It was always things that had to be done.  Even to gardening and things like that, which I know she enjoys now.  But at that time, there were other things that had to be done.  So the gardening was just one more thing that had to be done. (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And I was just wondering if having this image of my mother makes me afraid I might be equally dissatisfied with being a, just a wife and a mother.  Because even with her getting out of the house and doing what she did, she wasn't happy.  And the thought of going through all those years being so grim and unhappy just makes me not want to put myself in the position, so that I might go through the same thing.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>I was just thinking about the fact that at first, when I was younger, I saw her going off to do all these things as just so she could get out of the house and that she was deserting us.  And uh, I suppose it was really me, because I, I can't, I couldn't, I mean, I was just too centered on myself, and I don't have any feeling one way or another whether it bothered FYC and FNA and MLWZ.  And it's almost as if I were thinking it didn't.  (Sniff, Pause) </p>
 
<p>And I know that made me — well, I don't know whether it's important whether I took it personally, or whether I thought we all felt that way — but I know it made me feel very angry toward my mother.  That's probably one of the reasons I, I felt angry toward her for so many years.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And it also makes me think of the fact, after, I think it was after I started going to college.  It might have even been even later than that.  But in any case, when I was around less, uhm, and then when I was home on vacations, she would be around at times, when I'd come down for breakfast.  And it used to be that she would never be around.  And she was very nasty about the fact that any of us would sleep late, and breakfast was already over, and things were going to be messed up again, the kitchen and so forth. </p>
 
<p>But then, she began hanging around so she would be there.  And she'd make a special effort to cook anything we wanted.  Whereas, for years, we've been left on our own. And I know that annoyed me too.  Because I think I was feeling well, it's too late now to start giving that kind of attention.  Or maybe I sensed she was weaker now, because she had some kind of a need, that she was around.  Whereas, before she hadn't been.  And that just made me angry, too.  But I don't understand how that particular kind of feeling would affect my feeling toward pregnancy. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well you said it — at least part of it is that you are indeed afraid.  Sounds like you would end up feeling some of the same things your mother did, that you wouldn't want your kids once you have them.  I think you're afraid of that, among other things.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I suppose that's true, because at first I was thinking well, I want children so much.  I can't believe that I'm afraid of that.  And yet, I am afraid, I know, of being somehow unsatisfied with that kind of a role.  And, or feeling I'm not fulfilling myself, or however to express it. And, I know when I've been feeling unsatisfied with myself while I've been teaching, that I do take it out on children right away.  Even though at other times I can really enjoy them, so that I suppose it really is a fear I have. </p>
 
<p>But it seems like that's only, well I don't know if incidental is the right word, because, it's an important part of it, but that the main part is, I don't know, (Laughs softly) it's sort of, — I guess this is what I don't want to think about. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: What were you going to say?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure.  Something about, well, being a woman comes to me now, but being happy in those roles of being a woman, a wife, a mother.  (Sniff, Sigh) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p></p>

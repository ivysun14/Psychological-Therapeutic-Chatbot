<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, go ahead, how have you been doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, um, I lost a sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, was she the one that was sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, she passed away.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry, sorry to hear that.  How long has it been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, what, since she passed away?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Almost a month now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Month, oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I think the 29th would have been 28 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it was just before the holidays, uh, just about like the other one did.  The other sister I had was [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what did this sister die from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of they think it's, uh, um, Webster's disease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or Pasteur's disease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One of the two, they don't know which one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, they didn't do an autopsy or anything because she used [INAUDIBLE] and, uh, then they cremated her afterwards.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I had that.  And I'm having trouble at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I've got supervisors that are not my supervisors—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Trying to tell me how to do my job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I've got my supervisors that won't believe a word I say to them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About the situations that I go through.  Um, anger issues is one of my problems right at the moment.  Um, because I, I'd run a job and then he comes in the middle and wants this job done or this job done.  I can't complete a job, and, uh, I'm trying to work on my efficiency, trying to get it high enough to, to pass with the rest of the company, and I can't do it because of him, and, uh, uh, I don't know what to do with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.  How long, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's, uh, just about taken the fun out of the job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long has it been this difficult for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, for the past 3 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is not a new job.  You have been on this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been here for 4 years on this job—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four years on this job, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, this guy's just getting on my nerves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But what you do you actually do in the job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I band, uh, uh, material.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which, uh, has to go through a BS.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is like a wiggy I band before the wiggy gets there, and then when the wiggy gets done, it's sent to a supervisor and he distributes to wherever he has to distribute to.  Uh, he's coming to me trying to get me to run the jobs faster.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, he has no right to come down to me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And tell me these things because he has to go through my supervisor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's, uh, he's not even supposed to be in my area, but he comes down 3 or 4 times a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I can't get, I've gone through my channels.  I've gone through my lineman.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he tells me to ignore him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which, in my heart, I can't ignore people.  Um, I've gone to my supervisor and my supervisor just about cussed me out the other day because of it, and the only other person left is [NAME OTHER] who is the plant manager, and I don't want to go to him because it's going to cost me my job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Um.  I understand.	"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] told me 2 years ago that there was no stress on the people that, that are banding or wigging.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The only stress goes to the, uh, lineman.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And supervisors.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what do they produce?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, cabinets for Home Depot, Walmart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, all green.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is, is he being, uh, hard on you personally, or is he like that with every employee thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know because I don't see, I don't see the rest of his employees.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, it's kind of like mind games.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll come down and he'll start counting stuff and he's not supposed to be there to start off with because if the job just come off the line, he's already got a piece of paper that tells him what, what job's coming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He just needs to stay in his area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you don't finish x number of pieces in the timeframe, can you still leave once your 8 hours is done or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When my 8 hours is up, see I leave at 3:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I'll stay extra if I need to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, if they'll let me stay after.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like tomorrow morning, I've got, being I had to come here, I've got to be at work at 4:00 am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To catch up with what I missed today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but generally you don't have to stay longer to finish.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They only got us on an 8 hour schedule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What do you think are your options?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Um, I really don't know about my options.  I've had one, that's change jobs, but there's no jobs out there that, that deal with this kind of equipment.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, so I'm stuck there.  Um, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel a need to come and talk to the therapist?  We have a therapist here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't think I need to talk to a therapist because the therapist ain't going to help.  All of this is talking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I do a lot of talking at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, uh, um, I've got a lineman that don't believe a word I say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's the same person when I told him my sister passed away didn't believe me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I had to go to my supervisor to get a day off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, but, uh, I don't know if the dude don't like me or what, but, uh, I'm basically in, uh, I'm in a, I'm not in a mill area.  Uh, we're away from the mill area and there's 6 of us altogether just in one little pack, and he, the supervisor has not gotten down to us all yet, but he's, he's been in my area so many times that I've just gotten to the point where he's just going to have to go to [NAME OTHER] and, uh, he's my supervisor, and uh, talk with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because he don't need to be talking to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.  Yeah, if you need to talk further and get some, uh, ventilation or [INAUDIBLE] or whatever, we have a therapist here.  You may have met her before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can make appointments with her, and then one option is to keep talking to your proper supervisor, uh or ignoring or, uh, going to the higher up if you need, if you need to, or, or maybe, uh, putting up with it for a while, you can see what happens.  I don't know.  There's different options here you have to think through and see what will suit you at this time.  Uh, how are things at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, they're all right at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With your wife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't have any problem at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a problem at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You taking any medicine from other doctors?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing from others, and the Zyprexa, you take 1 at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you want to leave it at that, or do we need to go up on the dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't want to go up anymore because I got a delay [INAUDIBLE] it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like an hour and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, or do we need to reduce it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Again probably not at this time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at this time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, try to take it earlier and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Lexapro—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm still taking it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You want to leave it at 10 mg I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And the Ritalin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm taking that in the morning and I'm taking it again at noon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Should I take 1 before with the Ritalin?  See I take it at, uh, I take it 6:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I take it at 11:00 in the afternoon.  That's lunchtime, 11:45.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is when I take it.  Should I take a, a half a dosage in between?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Will that calm me down a little bit more?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  Usually Ritalin works for approximately 3 and a half hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	From the time it absorbs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So morning you take it at 6:00, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So probably it may start working by 7:00, roughly approximately 7:00.  It'll work until 10:30 I would think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, should I do it then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then, uh, if you take 1 at, uh, say 10:00 or 9:30 or 10:00, then it'll start working by 11:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you take, uh, you can take 3 if you needed to take or you can take 2 and a half, whatever suits you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, again, if it makes you more paranoid, more edgy, then you have to back down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the other hand, if it calms you down, then the third one is okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, it can go either way.  For a lot of people with pure ADD or ADHD, this calms them down, so the third dose will be fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But on the other hand since you are on Zyprexa for past history of hallucinations and depression or whatever, it can gradually backfire.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, make you more edgy or paranoid.  If that happens, then you have to come down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you want to try 3 then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, let's try 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'll just put 1 three times a day.  You adjust the time, like every 4 hours, every 5 hours, every 4 and a half hours.  Um, and you can take it even, uh, it works for about 3 and a half hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some, some people it works 4 hours.  So anywhere from 3 to 4 hours you can repeat that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No more than 3 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lately have you heard any voices, anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any visions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"I've had a couple of visions, but they were, uh, um, one was I was coming up from work —	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I passed a guy mowing the grass in the cemetery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He sat down and I was coming up the hill in [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was sitting down talking to a woman and when I got to him, the woman wasn't there.  So, uh, that freaked me out, but I tried to run and ask him, and he said it was his wife, his dead wife.  His wife was buried in the graveyard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, but, uh, otherwise, I haven't see anything else besides that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, is it after your sister's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Uh, no this was before.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, I've been reading books on, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Spirits.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Spirits.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the ghosts of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Any other visions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, no voices lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the past, when you increased Ritalin, did you ever have any problem with visions or voices because of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"No, but maybe more jitters.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Jitters, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then again I was on 30 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were on 30 at the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that was, uh, that was back in, uh, I think when I first started the program out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was '96 is what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, in case if you get jittery after, just back down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, if it backfires you back down.  Uh, do you need any Viagra or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I got that.  I still got Viagra.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so on the Zyprexa, you're going to leave it as, any suicide thoughts lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any thoughts of hurting someone else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but, uh, you know, the supervisor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but he's the only one that I'm having trouble with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but do you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I'll act out on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But the thoughts are there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you feel like you would be able to walk away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you don't really want, want to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but I would, you know, if I had—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The thoughts are there, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I had the thought and the opportunity for it, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The reason you will not do that is because of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's not right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Morally it's not right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'd decide to do it another way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you don't want to go to jail or something like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'll end up, uh, probably having him arrested.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For mental cruelty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because that's what he's doing to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what he's doing to me.  That's what mind games are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand, but don't, don't actually try to hurt him.  That's not good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Have you ever been violent to anybody before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, anger wise you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, but I can, I used to go out to the old farm when I got angry or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'd go to the farm and work out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Work it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And when shall I get you back here again do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About 3 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you really want to go that long or should we get you back sooner?  I'll be glad to see you in a month if you want to come back in a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I'll come back in a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, so I'll give you, you want one refill on the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's be one too.  Is your weight more or less the same or any changes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It varies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to [INAUDIBLE] and step up, let's get your weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One ninety six.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It goes from 191 to 198.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so it's more or less average.  Any sugar problems, cholesterol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, you said [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] checks on, on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] okay.  He checks, what every 6 months, once a year.  Okay, so far.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So far, I got low blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, everything else is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Lately has your blood pressure been up or, uh, okay, or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's been, it was normal and then the last time I went in because I was taking the, taking the Ritalin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the morning, and when I take it in the morning, it makes my blood pressure drop a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it made it drop a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think it's something to do with thinning the blood out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the, is the blood pressure going down or up when you take the medications?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, going down a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Little bit, okay, but not too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's not too bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but you don't have—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And usually they usually check it about twice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you don't have high blood pressure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I have no high blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'm going to check your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] made me taking salt pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Then it was low then.  Okay, are you taking enough fluids [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I drink a lot of fluids, uh, and green tea a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Green tea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, pulse is really good, 72, and let's see, do you know what your height is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, 6'1".</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seventy two, so you're a tall fellow.  Let's get your, your weight was 196 I think, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let me get your blood pressure to make sure that it's not too low.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See I work in a hot warehouse, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My last dose, my last one for Ritalin was, uh, 11:45.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'm going to take it one more time.  No, it's, it's looking good.  Blood pressure's good today.  Yeah, I'm getting a good, good level, 118/74.  So today it's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the morning it's lower than that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How low is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's like 109/58.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sixty eight, fifty eight, okay.  You're not taking any blood pressure medicine, any beta blockers, anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, probably you may have to have a liquid, fluids, and, uh, salt [INAUDIBLE].  Uh, right now, it's, it's pretty good, 118/74 is what I'm getting.  Okay, let me go and get the prescriptions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need a doctor's note too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  So the Zyprexa will be 20 mg, 30, one at night.  Get you a refill on that.  This will be Lexapro 10 mg.  You don't feel unusually paranoid or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  One every morning, giving you one refill on that too.  On the Ritalin, I'm going to write it 3 times a day, but if it makes you jittery or [INAUDIBLE] or you feel it's too many pills, you can cut back to 2, two and a half or 2, whatever works for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ritalin 10 mg, regular strength tablets, 90, put down 1 three times a day.  On this, I'll have to write 2 separate scripts because they won't give a refill.  What time do you usually start your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I start around 6:30, 6:30 to 3:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I have to be in the building at 6:00 in the morning to, um, crank my machine up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Get it ready to run.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On the weekends, they, uh, have us come in at 5:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  On the first one, I put 1 three times a day.  On this, I put 1 in the morning as optional and by mistake, but you adjust your time, whatever time you need this Ritalin, for the first and the second month.  Lexapro for the month [INAUDIBLE] and, uh, no alcohol or anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No alcohol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No other chemicals or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay then, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, the doctor's note.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, Um-hum.  So you need a whole day's off or half a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Half a day off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so for this afternoon, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I'm going to put down, uh, [PATIENT NAME] seen at this clinic this pm.  Please give him half a day sick/medical leave, sick/medical leave.  Okay, yeah, I'm here Monday, Tuesday and Friday, so any problems, you can come back sooner.  Also you can lower the dose if it's not, uh, right, and for any emergencies, you can always go to the emergency room and they will examine you [INAUDIBLE] talk to you and they'll try to help you if, if that is needed, okay.

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're having some stress and we will see if this will work better for you.  Any other questions?</p>

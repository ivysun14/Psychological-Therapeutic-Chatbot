<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible from [00:00:00] to [00:00:05] over things, and you know, honestly I don't mind. I mean, if you're going to get a cold, you're going to get a cold. Take extra zinc. But then I was like, "Oh no. I feel sick." And then I took off the jacket, and I thought, "Ah, these seats are so cool." (laughs)</p>

<p>But, um, yeah, so this week was an interesting week cause Jeremy and I, we kind of got in two little tiffs. We never actually get into fights; we get in tiffs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. What is the definition of a tiff versus a fight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where things get kind of like high intensity and I almost—either I almost feel like crying, or that I cry, cause I feel that it is that we're fighting, or I feel like he's attacking me or I feel like I'm attacking him.</p>

<p>Just the stress of the moment—I'm so used to things being so happy and supportive and sound, and it's sort of like, I mean, (pause for .02 seconds) yeah, I think it's naïve of me to expect there's always going to be this happy, doo-tee-doo. [00:01:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the things that we get upset over are just like—well, one thing is on politics and pretty much we're the same, except for I'm a little bit more sided towards Romney, and he's a little bit more sided towards Obama—and that's fine.</p>

<p>But when I start talking about politics, um, like I started thinking that I like the idea of health care. I think that's a good idea. But then we start talking about, like, you know, if states run it then there's all these sort of issues. When we were talking about it one morning, we were just talking on and on about the debate, and I don't keep up quite as well as he does—he reads the New York Times. </p>

<p>And there's just certain things that sort of sound—well, yes, maybe they are promises or there are things that they say that they're not going to deliver—but they just sort of sound right, and I think there's guilt in me for not questioning—or for questioning them. My family is super-conservative—[00:02:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel badly about questioning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like any time I say anything like, "Oh, I like the Affordable Care Act. I think it's a good idea," instantly I'm like, "Oh, better not say anything like that around my parents." And like, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you start to feel like you might be thinking something differently that what your parents are thinking—you feel guilty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm less interested in what your particular views are -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know, I know. (laughs) I tried to share them -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) It's fine for you to share them. I'm not going to question you on what your views are, but I think the idea of—I guess I want to understand what the guilt is about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, no. I know what you're saying, and I'm trying to get to the bottom of the story without going through the whole fight. [00:03:05]</p>

<p>But I think—I got upset when he was just like, "Well that's not true what they said." And then he was like spending all this time hovering over the phone, and I was like, "Well, what are you looking at?" and like, I—we start—he didn't tell me and then I was like saying something like, who I like, "Well, I think the plan that Romney had, you know I think that we should expand Medicare. You know, people that can't afford care need help."</p>

<p>And he's like, "Well, how socialist of you." And he said it in sort of a smart-ass sort of way—oh, you know like, um, like, "Oh, you're betraying your conservative viewpoint that you presented a while ago." And it was like (sighs), I was like maybe -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe he attacks you for agreeing with him. [00:04:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah, or he attacks me, or he was trying to make a joke.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel attacked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did feel attacked because that was sort of what my last boyfriend did. I mean, you're right, he doesn't—like I don't keep up with the facts, so when I was like, "Oh, well this person said this in the debate. What's wrong with that?" and Jeremy would be like, "Well, these people—they can say it in the debate and that doesn't mean it's true."</p>

<p>And you know, I eventually figured out why he was hovering over his phone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's fact-checking (inaudible at 00:04:33) work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) He's done that to me, and I appreciated that cause I was like, "Oh, well this makes a lot more sense." And it seemed very fair on both sides, both candidates seemed to be quoting things that aren't necessarily true. But, um, yeah, I just (pause for .02 seconds) I felt attacked for some reason. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>He was like, "Well, that's not true . You're just saying lies, or you're just —" and I was like, "Well, I'm not trying to quote lies. I'm not trying to present bad arguments. Why are we even discussing this if I, you know, if I don't know anything."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just brought back a lot of bad sentiment, and then like, finally I just—cause I felt like I was about to cry—I have a hard enough time focusing as it is. I didn't want this fight—it totally distracted me from a calm, going into my chair, doing research and um, (pause for .03 seconds) and um, (pause for .02 seconds) and then I said, "Oh, well I don't want to ride in the car with you so I'm going to stay home for—" um, (pause for .02 seconds) or like, "I'm going to stay home because I really just don't feel like riding in the car with you," cause he drives me like a block, two blocks down to the bus stop. [00:06:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I came and he was just going to go, and then I started crying and then he sat down. And, "Oh, I'm so sorry." Like he apologized and I apologized for saying that I didn't—you know, I really didn't feel like riding in the car with him, but it was more or less—and I'll later explain—that I just thought I would break down in tears because I just felt so like (pause for .02 seconds) he was out to prove me wrong, not to really listen to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, later we talked about it and (pause for .02 seconds) we just sort of agreed to not really talk about (pause for .02 seconds) politics too much, and try and work on—cause him and I really—I guess it sort of brings up how we're sort of a correlated system. If he gets worked up, I get worked up. [00:06:55]</p>

<p>And it was really apparent—his mom came over Tuesday with his brother's dog, the yippy one who goes to the bathroom in random places and seems to hump pillows every now and then. (laughs) Um, which is fine if they're not my pillows, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: but it was kind of nerve-wracking having the dog just running around, and like during dinner he would jump up on the couches. He was smelling, and he was smelling my pillows that I crocheted and spent so long on. And I'd have to get up—I got up three times during dinner to chase him off the sofa, and his mom -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you know the dog was coming?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughs) (pause for .02 seconds) And Jeremy was really tense cause of the traffic and he had to pick up, like, ingredients for the dinner. And he just was super-tense and when his mom was coughing and not covering her mouth, he was (pause for .03 seconds) you know, like, "Can you cover your mouth?" in this sort of tense, like, you know. [00:08:06]</p>

<p>I had set the oven to pre-heat and our oven has this setting—like it's either bake or broil, and he really wanted to do a bake temperatures, and if you have it on broil it won't pre-heat, so the fish wasn't cooking and the mom got up. She was like, "Oh, I have to feed the dog some chicken soup." So she was like, "Oh, give me a pot."</p>

<p>And so she started cooking while Jeremy was scrambling to get dinner out, and it was such a tense situation. Well, Jeremy—this is where the tense moment came up, where -I mean it was already pretty tense—but then Jeremy was just trying to make conversation cause his mom just broke up with her boyfriend. </p>

<p>Jeremy was just like, "I read in the paper today that 64 or 65  percent, 64 percent of marriages end in divorce," and I said (pause for .03 seconds), "What? (pause for .03 seconds) What does that number correlate to? Like, what do you mean? Do you mean like 65 percent have been married—and where are the statistics from? Are they from the 1960's? from the 1980's? Are we talking people -" [00:09:22]</p>

<p>And he was like, "Well, of all marriages." I was like, "Well, that's still kind of like—I mean, that still doesn't make it—" it didn't make any sense to me because for me, like statistics—when you talk about something that's—I don't really think it's an average phenomenon. You can say divorce rate is 65 percent, but is that along socio-economic class; is that along -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not precise enough for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it wasn't precise enough for me. It didn't make sense. And I think—like I've read studies about co-habitate—I guess why I'm so sensitive and touchy about it is cause I've read studies on co-habitation where, you know, they say, 'well, 64 percent of this are going to divorce when they co-habitate. But when they co-habitate and they have future plans, it's a different number.' [00:10:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you can use statistics -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you spend so much time right now reading studies and understanding numbers, and you're going to be looking for a little bit more specificity and explanation about what -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, what it means. I was just, yeah, yeah, I guess that's exactly it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's interesting because when you talk about this conversation and the political conversation, the more you know the more critical you are —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: about the information that you're hearing, and so it sounds like he's a little bit more well-read about some of the political stuff -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and so when you maybe heard something, and maybe came to an idea about it based on a generalization or by a broad -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a broad (laughs) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: layman's scope of it, he felt frustrated. And then he throws out a stat and you're like, "Wait a minute. That could mean so many different things; be interpreted in so many different ways." [00:11:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're right. It felt frustrating to you though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and he felt attacked. And then like, I felt really bad and I almost started crying because I was just like, "Oh, I just feel so horrible." And then when I picked up the plate that had—it once had oysters on it and ice and it was sludge, and I spilled it all over the table. Then I dropped the plate, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a really hard night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a hard night. And, yeah (pause for .02 seconds) yeah, I guess both him and I do get very defensive over our numbers and our -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if there would be a way to talk about that stuff that would feel less attacking to each of you? I mean, you sort of made this plan not to talk about politics anymore but that's hard in an election year. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) Um, and he reads the daily news to me so that's kind of hard. [00:12:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm wondering—instead of taking it off the table, could you guys come up with a way to have conversations that might feel less attacking, less likely to bring you guys to the defensive. Can you, you know, is there a way to talk about the numbers; talk about the marriage stuff, cause that's another topic that's going to be hard to take completely off the table, without feeling—like one or the other is being condescended to or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe if—I mean, I think him and I probably just need to be, like he needs to be maybe like (pause for .03 seconds) a little bit more patient when I, cause I don't read into the politics and I'm not as well educated. Or I'm not as well read up, yeah, (laughs) and I probably should just work on saying, you know, "I have these general principles but I'm curious: can you tell me more about the candidates and give me -" [00:13:03]</p>

<p>You know, if I don't really know—I mean I think that sort of makes sense. If I don't really know the full intricacies, I should say that I don't know the full intricacies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know what your—you know your ideas, and you know what makes sense to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) So maybe I should just always frame my comments, until he sort of gets the idea, that I'm not going to be talking specific details or specific numbers. Maybe I should—you know, instead of like being—trying to—I think maybe sometimes my tone can be awfully defensive because when someone doesn't agree with me—this happened today in my, um, (pause for .02 seconds) group presentation meeting that I spent so long trying to understand. [00:13:56]</p>

<p>It was actually the most complicated part of our presentation; the most complicated theory. And I read so many pages and tried to understand so many, and I tried really hard to make my slides beautiful and cohesive. And you know, people were just like—you know, one guy is the nicest guy and he said, "Your slides are beautiful but I'm afraid that our presentation is just going to be too long if we have all of your slides."</p>

<p>That's understandable. I had that fear too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and easily I can hide some slides. (ph) But then this guy—like the other guy—him and I are always—he probably doesn't think so but—we're probably always butting heads, and he's like, "Do we really need that slide? What's that really saying? Do you really think it's important?" And I was like, "Well, I was going to ask the teaching assistant about it," and I was like, "but I think it is important that people—this is what was in the paper and this is what tells us how we get rabid flopping (ph) with our state." [00:14:58]</p>

<p>And he was just like, "Well, okay," and then he—I was just like, "Ohh!" I just felt—like everyone was correcting my slides and everyone else sort of put it together at the last minute; just sort of put equations on the page; you know, they just did three slides and I had a very complicated part of the presentation. It was really difficult for me to like (pause for .02 seconds) you know, like all sort of the intricacies. </p>

<p>And I kind of got upset because it's like: here you guys just spent—and I know I spent too much time and I realized in the future, not to sweat the small stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm hmm. Put more detail in that anyone expected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or cared or wanted, and I just felt—I felt so bad cause while the teaching assistant was talking to us and I was like, "Oh, well do you mean that this is how it all gets in the ground stay (ph)? " and he was like, "No, no." I mean, I was interrupting the teaching assistant and, uh, while he was talking because I was curious. I was trying to make sense of everything that I read but, um, (pause for .02 seconds) I think I had just read, I knew too many details but not really. [00:16:13]</p>

<p>I knew they existed but didn't know how they were experimentally realized. I wanted to—like when he was explaining something—you know, like if he kept on talking on and on, I would've forgotten what he was describing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But. I don't know, I just—and I felt like that guy and maybe he did have a good point: is it important? And I asked the teaching assistant and he said, "Yes, it was. Maybe the equations are not as important but this picture is really important." And the equation that describes the picture, I think. And he's like, "As long as you can explain that equation and how effectively it works, then, you know that's fine." [00:16:58]</p>

<p>But, I just—oh, I feel like the papa bear. I had all my slides and I had the most corrections. You know, the group sort of laughed and sort of like—well, the teaching assistant said, "Well, you had the most complicated part of the presentation."</p>

<p>And then I felt stupid for complaining or like saying that. I was just really embarrassed and I put so much time into it. (whispers) I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you apologizing for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (whispers, emotional) I'm getting upset. I mean, I'm tired of feeling stupid. And that stupid guy that said, "Do you really need that?"—he always makes me feel stupid. No one else had corrections on their slides; no one else had—well I guess Cliff did, (pause for .03 seconds) but not much.</p>

<p>No one like—(pause for .02 seconds) I guess there were corrections on other people's slides but, maybe I'm just a little bit more vocal about my corrections. [00:18:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it that there was something wrong on your slides, or that people felt that you just had too much information to present?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there were some things that I think, well I was emphasizing the wrong things or—well, there was one slide I had to completely hide because it would be too complicated to even explain. We have 30 minutes and we have five people talking, so to put all of our three or—like I had six slides—so to put all of our slides together (laughs) that's longer that 30, 35 minutes.</p>

<p>And then the other thing was: just sort of—I think that my slides just didn't point out things that could have been as relevant, so I just moved some pictures around and just had to quote stuff. There were things that I even knew the subtleties of and the teaching assistant's like, "No, no, no. Don't talk about those differences." He's like, "I don't even know that there was a difference between that. For our purposes, you don't have to mention the differences." [00:19:10]</p>

<p>And I think, well yeah, I think I read it into too much detail. (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like you were working really hard and familiarizing yourself with a lot of the information, and you didn't have enough time to kind of step back and see—okay, well, what are the really important main themes and what are the important details to get at those main themes from the presentation. </p>

<p>Is that something you feel like happens in other areas, whether it be other classes or in other areas of life? Focusing on the details and having a harder time pulling out and distilling the main -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's always been—that's actually, I mean I joke about that sort of, I guess when I'm learning a new situation, I don't necessarily generalize. I am—like in ballet, I'm very focused on; is my foot beveled, is my, like—all these little things—[00:20:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: all, like, two teachers this past week were just like, "You need to be soft," and I was just like, "Oh, " -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Flow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, flow. And he was just like, "Your upper body is very tense," and here I have been focusing on how high my leg is, how high is my knee relative when I do a passé, does my foot need to be higher? How arched are my feet? I've been concentrating on all these little details, and I guess it's hard to dance.</p>

<p>It's feels good to have that release but it's very hard for me, yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) I guess I eventually—like I mean—being so focused on the details really did help me decorate the apartment. I knew something felt missing—I knew it didn't feel right—but I sort of focused on little details and it actually turned out really good.</p>

<p>I had a good vision, and each little detail sort of fed off the other, and seeing the big picture of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if there are places where the details are important and places where the details might get in the way of the more important piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if you had gorgeous things on the shelves but forgot to get a couch—that would be a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the apartment, maybe there was—maybe it was a small enough task—or who knows why—but for whatever reason you were able to focus on the details and the whole picture, but in these other places maybe the details are getting in the way of the bigger picture. [00:22:04]</p>

<p>And it maybe because for you, decorating the apartment was not as complex a task as understanding whatever I'm sure -</p>

<p>CLIENT: The experiment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: whatever very complicated physics thing you were thinking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think actually Jeremy—cause he has the big picture, he's really good at the big picture—and that's what we sort of joke about, that we're the stereotypical man and woman. I like very fussy and particular, even with my cooking, but the overall message: does it taste good? (laughs) Sometimes I get disappointed, like if it doesn't look good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I do that with my appearance; I pick it apart. I just (pause for .02 seconds) Is there this one zit on my face—I know probably no one notices or cares about that one zit—but like, it will just totally, like my face will be a blur and there will be a zit and it's so frustrating cause I can't (pause for .02 seconds)—[00:23:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you could let that piece go (ph) that becomes really important, even though really the overall picture is totally fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Like, I mean, my face is not blurred by oblivion, (ph) by tons of zits, maybe it's just a couple and yes—I do have a hard time seeing the big picture. That's actually been a problem in literature, when I had to write essays in high school and college, I had that problem of: what is the main point?</p>

<p>And I had to read the CliffsNotes, and I had to think really hard, and like (pause for .02 seconds) I always seem to get the wrong main point, or just the real basic—it's not any sort of like thoughtful—the things that stick out in my head are normally not the important things. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how that feeds into your anxieties. [00:24:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .03 seconds) Probably does a lot. I know—yeah. Well, doing that presentation I got so anxious over all the math and the equations and I didn't get too anxious about the actual physics or the machine. I got into—I saw all these complexities which fed upon more complexities; kind of like a Ponzi scheme—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And um, (pause for .03 seconds) it fed quite a bit. Um, (pause for .05 seconds) yeah, I guess, maybe I just—when I'm learning—I think this helped me when I'm decorating. I had Jeremy to help monitor; well what would you think if I did this? Or—and I think maybe I should have talked to the teaching assistant sooner. There's all these sort of—he could've just easily said, "Don't worry about the geometric phase gauge," or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And would you've been able to let it go if he said that? [00:25:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, cause I'm very trusting of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. So what stopped you from you being able to determine what you throw out? How come—what makes it easier to let it go if someone else says it's okay? Or if Jeremy says, "Yes, that's alright,"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .02 seconds) Well, (pause for .06 seconds) cause I guess, like I feel like I have sort of protection. (pause for .02 seconds) Like, if I turn out to be wrong, I can say, "Well, this higher-up order (ph) told me it was right, so you should confer with them or you should talk with them," like, or, I could just say I don't have much stock in my—or much, I could say belief, or sort of um, (pause for .03 seconds) relative importance in my thoughts. Cause I have many thoughts, many ideas. [00:26:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which ones are important?</p>

<p>(chime sound from cell phone)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the sleep center. I wound up getting myself a sleep appointment. I've been having a hard time staying awake and that's been another frustration.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I just—I got to the point where I was sitting up in class and I just fell asleep while sitting up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. It's been getting worse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I mean—today I—I mean I still make that conscious decision if I'm not in class—like I still, like today, this morning, I woke up and did some work and felt this extreme sleepiness. So I was like, "I'll just sleep for 10 minutes," and it wound up to be 20 minutes, so I was 20 minutes late. [00:27:17]</p>

<p>But, yeah, it has been getting worse and I'm frustrated just that I can't focus so well, or it's just—I mean, it's just frustrating when I feel this urge to take a nap and then I have to eat something to wake up, or to like keep myself awake. So that's sort of been going on and so finally I went to see the doctor, and the doctor said, "Okay, well let's check. Let's have this sleep study done and check stuff off the list of what you don't have, and try to determine what you do have." So I'm excited and also kind of scared about that. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Do you have it scheduled yet or that was them calling to try to schedule it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no. They're already scheduled. They call me up asking if I have any questions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when is the sleep study?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This Sunday. So it's really—I get there at 8:50 and I can't have any caffeine or alcohol. I mean, I'm not big on drinking alcohol, maybe a glass with dinner, but you know, I can't have that after 12:00 pm. And I'm just like; no coffee, no naps. I haven't taken a nap—oh yeah, I did take a nap today. I forgot. (laughs) </p>

<p>(buzz from cell phone)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Voice mail?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They just called up with questions and I need to call them—or asking me if I have any questions about it. But I'm just—it's kind of weird because they tell you to just sleep like normal, but you have electrodes -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to sleep like normal. [00:28:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) But I guess if I don't have a nap then—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to be very hard not to have a nap. But anyway, that's sort of—so that's sort of optimistic. I realize that I would be happy if I wasn't narcoleptic, but I do want to figure out why am I so sleepy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need some information about what's going on —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: cause this has been going on for a while and it sounds like it's getting worse so —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs) It's frustrating cause like I don't want to fall asleep on the bus and just sort of forget where I'm going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not safe. And it's exacerbating your concentration, (inaudible at 00:29:45) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and who knows what else it's affecting. We don't know why it is that you're feeling so tired—getting some answers about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's—it's always been sort of my problem. When I'm hearing—it's interesting—cause people, actually a lot of people, like my friends, come to me to talk about problems. Like my friend, Paige, was in a moment of panic attack and crisis because she was just in such a bad depression. And she actually does see a therapist. [00:30:15]</p>

<p>She was saying that—you know, I told her that it was probably because—cause I told her, "Oh Paige, you're good at many things." She's like, "What am I good at? I'm not good at anything." And I've been realizing for a time that she works in the same research group; she lives and is in the same class as her boyfriend; and they've been together for so long, I think she's forgotten who she is. And I told her that. So I saw the main point very clear -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: when I was helping someone, (pause for .02 seconds) cause maybe I've actually been through (pause for .02 seconds) the same problem or, you know, or sometimes I think that's why Jeremy gets anxious. Or why, you know, he would like probably to talk about politics with someone that was also equally informed. (laughs) [00:31:13]</p>

<p>And I realize that I don't—I'm not—I can't be a super-woman. I'm coming to terms with that. I cannot be a super-woman, and that means that's why you have different friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. He may want to have a political debate with someone who's as into politics as he is, but that doesn't necessarily have to be you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that doesn't mean he doesn't want you to be his partner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That's one thing—and that's what I told him last night—and he said he's been trying. People have just been busy. We've just moved in and he's exhausted. But, you know, I, um (pause for .02 seconds) cause I realize that we have dinners a lot of nights, and cause we see each other every night, it's like, "Well, what's going on?" and well, not much.</p>

<p>I think that's why, like, I give myself space, and I had ballet until nine o'clock last night and then I had dinner and came home at 10:40-ish. So that gave him lots of time; he was able to relax and go for a walk. And I see this like a really good thing, like I get it. I need my own personal space to develop myself. [00:32:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm becoming more assertive, so I'm proud of myself for doing that. But I think, yeah, I need to work on seeing the big picture for any sort of situation, cause I have all of these thoughts. I mean—yeah, that is actually so true—cause I—because I haven't been feeling too pretty lately, I really wanted to get a new dress for the wedding we're going to in October. </p>

<p>And, um, I spent so long looking for the right dress and, you know, I'd be like, "Oh, what about this dress?" and Jeremy's like, "Yeah, it's a little bit plain." And, "What about this dress?" I mean, I just wanted, I just didn't feel like my old dresses were good enough, and I just picked apart every little detail. [00:33:07]</p>

<p>I was like, "Well this dress is going to make me look fat," the one that I have, so then (laughs) (pause for .02 seconds) you know, and it just caused so much lack of—I couldn't concentrate on my work. I was still concentrated (sic) on the dress. And I wound up just fine—I realized, you know I think my dresses are very nice that I have. Why spend another $200 just to get another dress when I have other nice dresses? I should just take them off if they don't fit (pause for .02 seconds) that well.</p>

<p>(pause for .03 seconds) And Jeremy's like, "Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea." He's like, "You're going to look beautiful in whatever you wear," and I'm like, "Okay. Well, that sort of—could've been—I could've saved so much more time -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I—yeah, I'm not really able to see the clear picture cause I focus on individual -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Looking at all the pieces. [00:34:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Is there a way not to do that, or?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well how did you do it with your friend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, (pause for .06 seconds) I guess I've been thinking this over a long time. I didn't know the answer. I had to put the pieces together and sort of, you know, like (pause for .03 seconds) sort of (pause for .03 seconds) like, I mean, I've seen it in my office and they're always doing this one calculation. And I've heard it from one of my other friends, like about—cause one time I was like, "Paige has such low self-esteem. I don't know why," and my other friend, Liz, was like, "Oh, well I wonder if Chris, um, being—doing—being just quicker -" I mean, Paige's brilliant. She's just a little shy and not as quick. [00:35:06]</p>

<p>But she's absolutely brilliant. And you know, Liz said that perhaps because he's quicker than her that she just doesn't feel like she ever succeeds. You know, I saw Paige with her friends, and I thought her friends would be so physics-y and dorky, but they were cute. They were all dressed up and Paige was dressed up too, and I was like, "Paige's a girl! She's more than a physicist." I mean, she's dressed up cute before, but I didn't know where this was—sometimes I don't know why people dress up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know them well enough, sometimes it could just be, "Oh, it just suited my fancy," but no, she loves to dress up and be a girl, or like a stereotypical girl, but not in the sense—you know what I'm saying. She likes to dress up; I'll say that. And, you know, I just sort of saw a different side of her with her friends. I guess getting to know her more and more, I came to realize that with her saying that she couldn't go anything—that she wasn't good, I was just like, "Well, wait, wait. No, no." (pause for .02 seconds) I mean, she's great at a lot of things, you know. And I just, it just made sense to me. [00:36:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe it's having more time to come to your decision about something; I sort of wonder if giving yourself that time -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That break.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: yeah, maybe some space from it away before you start trying to make decisions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you had, with like the presentation -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: what would've happened if you had read all the material and then had some space and time before you decided what slides you were going to create? Maybe some of it would've, maybe you would've been able to distill some of it—figure out which pieces were getting filtered out and which pieces you were going to keep and highlight. [00:37:03]</p>

<p>And I think about with your anxieties, when you can take a deep breath and focus on: 'okay, what do I really need to pay attention to right now', some of the extra details do fall away. But when you don't remember to do that, you might start worrying about, like: 'well, what did I just touch? Was that the soap or was that sanitizer? What was really in that bottle?'</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 'Did I pay attention to what it said on the canister?' And all of the different thoughts that could possibly come start flying through your head, but when you can take a breath and slow down and decide what you actually need to focus on, some of those details you realize are less important than others. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I think sometimes it helps me to calm down if I ask, if I would've just asked the teaching assistant like, "Hey. I've read all these papers. And I'm trying to make sense of them." And, um, you know, just ask him a couple of questions. [00:38:03]</p>

<p>I think, like, if I would've met with him today and he would've helped me sort through them because he is an expert in the field. And I think there's certain things in life that, um, you know (pause for .02 second) like for instance—did I wash my hands? What was on there? What was on the soap thing? </p>

<p>Things are—I should be an anxiety—I mean, these are experts and I can be my own expert.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of those -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what things do you need to consult an outside expert, but also letting yourself be the authority for what you can be the authority on. For more internal-type questions, you're definitely the authority on: What do you need to pay attention to in the bathroom? What do you need to feel good about yourself, in terms of: do you need a new dress or do you not? You're the authority on that stuff, and trust in your instincts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think I'm a very good—I don't know if I really trust myself. [00:39:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're working on that one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs) I know. I'm working on it, but I think—and maybe that's why I get so defensive—is because (pause for .03 seconds) well, I don't know, when I do trust myself and someone tells me I'm wrong, then I get mad. And then I (pause for .03 seconds) I guess because for someone to prove me wrong when I proved—I don't know, cause I don't really trust myself. There are times that I really think that I do trust myself, and, ah, like for instance for ballet, I got placed in the intermediate level after this weird kind of very short audition. [00:40:01]</p>

<p>And I told them—I was very upset—for like two years I've been in the intermediate level and I've been told that I should try the advanced level. And so, I was crying. I was upset. I went into different studios with their intermediate level and they were like, "Oh you should come to the advanced one." Yeah, I wasn't—I wasn't perfect. I did make mistakes, and there are many things for me to learn, but I saw the other girls and I was like, "What are they doing that well?"</p>

<p>But the teacher last night, he really appreciated some of the things—like my legs, my technique -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm hmm, and last night you went to advanced or intermediate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went to intermediate but all the advanced girls—they're allowed to take any class they want, which pissed me off. But anyway, it's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were in class with a lot of people that were deemed advanced. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Advanced, yeah. I was like, "My arabesque is so much higher." And like, then I realized, I talked to my mom about it, and she helped remind me of the big picture. She was like, "Well, do you go to their Master classes? Do you audition for their Ballet Company?" She was like, "They don't know you and, you know, by taking -" They switched so that the intermediate was taught by one of the head supervisors. [00:41:24]</p>

<p>"But putting you in intermediate, they could find out what kind of dancer you were. What more is it and what more do you need to work on and would you be a good fit?" I felt a little bit better, but even still, I sort of saw—it's kind of like when I realized that parents seem to like their own children more than others. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think (laughs) I sort of saw that with dance. It made me feel better, and Jeremy's like, "You know, you just need to let this dance thing go," and I was—in one sense I saw how that was probably the bigger picture, like: Am I having fun? Am I learning something? Am I getting exercise? Yes, yes. [00:42:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the role that dance plays for you right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's a big sort of release, and something I can concentrate all my efforts into. Um, and it's a way of (pause for .02 seconds) in a way it was sort of like—because when I was pre-professional training when I was a kid, the studio never liked me cause I didn't have very high arches. I have flat feet, (laughs) and so they just sort of ignored me. And ever since —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's something you can't practice away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. I have stretched—I have a stretching machine that Jeremy thinks is my torture device for my foot, but it's very, it's still, I mean my foot still is flat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not a changeable thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you can work around positioning or something. [00:43:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and um, so I've always had this sort of like: When I'm older, and I'll stretch, and I'll get really good, and I'll be that ballerina that they didn't think I could be. Now that (pause for .03 seconds) and I slowly I have been going in and out of dance. I saw old dance pictures of myself and I was like, "Egads!"</p>

<p>You know, this was like during college when I was out of the pre-professional program and I was like—I want to redo this. I want to be good at dance. Um, you know, I wanted to be good. I wanted to be light. So I was so happy when this teacher last night, he seemed to really like the way I danced and paid attention to how I moved, rather than just be ignored.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh, (pause for .02 seconds) you know, I realized that like I, like I've been saying of coming into terms with not being super-woman which seems—like there was a girl at school, Kate (ph), and she was, she flopped back and forth between being a physics undergrad and a ballerina in international companies. [00:44:20]</p>

<p>I see pictures of her and I just like—oh my goodness, she's beautiful and she was nice and she's intelligent and she's such a great ballerina, and, you know—I try to find a fault with her, except for—but you know, I'm sure she has faults, but Jeremy's like, "Well you're much prettier," and he's like, "And you're higher up there in physics."</p>

<p>He's like, "What does it matter?" I don't know. For some reason, I just feel like I want to be good at something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm, like I—I mean there's—in physics, I mean I admit I can do it, but there's so many—like my friend, Devon (ph)—I was talking to him today and he's on his sixth convocation. [00:45:08]</p>

<p>I'm on my number one and I'm not sure if—I'm trying to—I'm not even sure if that's going to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, yeah, and baking. Of course, there's—yeah I can bake maybe better than the average person, but not as good as like—oh, there's—I mean all those cooking blogs. I think they're amazing. There's this one girl called Sprinkles Bakes and she does these amazing, like art with the—and Jeremy's like, "Well, maybe it doesn't even taste good. And think about how much time." You know and like, I just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can only do so much. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're trying to be a baker and be a doctorate-level candidate and to an extent, be a ballerina. And you compare yourself to people who maybe are allowing themselves to specialize in one way or another? [00:46:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're toying with the idea of not being super-woman, but you haven't quite committed to not trying to be super-woman.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughs) Yeah, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because the idea of super-woman is that you can do all of these different things, right? So you can be cool and fashionable, but also nerdy and smart, and also athletic, and also artistic -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and you still have footholds in all those different places.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) I guess I can't come to terms with like—the, you know, it's okay, like, it's okay if I'm not a specialist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and maybe that's what you're awesome at. Maybe what you're super at is not, not being just any one predictable way. Maybe your awesome thing is that: well, you are the girl that's smart and can do physics, but is also girly, and can also -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Um hmm. I guess I never thought of it that way, and I guess, you know, being in this school, you see people that specialize in amazing things. They're amazing specialists. [00:47:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause for .02 seconds) I guess that's maybe not a bad thing to be good at many things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There's benefits to being both ways -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: but it's hard to be a fantastic specialist and a generalist, at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah, that's very true. I guess you can't be perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Not a human.(pause for .02 seconds) It's okay not to be perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess maybe that's seeing the big picture. I need to work on that. think that maybe should be a good homework assignment for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably lifelong practice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah, I can imagine that's something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not a one-week (laughs), you know, but perspective to try to keep in mind for homework.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we stop there today, and see you next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [00:48:16]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously if you can't fit me in for a while that's okay—well it's not really okay, but we'll make it okay. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm pretty limited outside of business hours. I generally start about 7:45 in the morning and I end about 6:00.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, my God. (laughs) That sounds like an insane day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Earliest and latest slots are pretty solidly booked up. I might have a 4:30 or an 8:30 or something like that, but I probably don't have a lot of flexibility, at least now. Knowing that I can keep my eyes open for a slot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That was why I brought it up, to ask you to keep your eyes open and, knowing that you're pretty solidly booked up at those ends of the day, I'll just be aware of that when I'm looking for jobs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're around here you can always come around lunch or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'll just look for something around here. [00:01:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I can think of any other way I can be flexible about that stuff I'll let you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks. We'll make it work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Can we talk a little bit about what you mean when you say "taking up emotional space"? It's one of the things that I thought I knew what you meant when you first said it and the first several times, and it seems you use it in categories that make me think I don't necessarily understand what you're talking about. It's not entirely clear to me, like what we were talking about yesterday of me being loyal to people and also anxious about them. But I can't remember exactly how anxious is related to not wanting to dump on people in my life. Does that make sense? [00:03:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I guess what I'm referring to generally would seem to me, in terms of you're taking up emotional space, is worry about the way your having and expressing your feelings to people will of impinge on them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not so far from dumping your feelings on people. They're not exactly the same, but they're kind of like that, I guess. In other words, I feel what I said in relating the stuff about loyalty to that. I'm not sure I recall, either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will either come up again or it's not important (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's basically what I was taking from it. James and I, when we were talking two nights ago, I think one of the things he is finding is that it's just exhausting to be my main source of support. Somehow over the summer he's kind of become one of my only sources of support in terms of when things go really bad, I call him. There are various things behind that. He has really asked me and has always pushed me to call other friends also, and that part of the conversation I just really didn't feel good about. I can't tell how much of that is me pushing back against taking up emotional space and how much of this is me feeling like—there is kind of a resentment for me at the end of it and I don't know how much that was justified. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Justified?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It's not like "justified" has any value. (laughs) Do you know what I mean at all? I guess what I said after the conversation was, "You know . . . " and he was like, "Are you okay?" I was like, "Well, yes, but less so than before we started talking about this. I kind of feel like a package that is heavy and that is being passed from one person to another." That and it's hard for me not to have a filter with most people. It's hard for me to take up space. Then the next time they have to talk to me, I have to catch the mop or something. It's really good that I have all of these people who really care about me, but I feel like it's making all of my relationships into relationships that are really just centered around me. [00:07:29] It's very easy for me to talk about myself always, and then I talk about myself for five minutes and I'm like, "This isn't a conversation. I don't like this." But I don't know how to get out of it. I feel like they think I'm sort of fragile—which they think I'm sort of fragile because I am so fragile, to be clear. (laughs) But they are afraid, maybe, to talk about other things. I feel like the depression is everything that I am. That makes it harder when I talk to other people, and it seems to me like they think the depression is everything I am also. That's a lot clearer in my mind than it was before I started talking about this. Thanks. (laughs) [00:08:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No problem. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just keep thinking of that David Foster Wallace story and I just don't want to be that. She had this support system and there was a special elite core of members within the support system that she tells everything to and it just feels so . . . arrgh. It's beautiful. (laughs) Novels are hard for me. Actually, it's like art is hard for me. I go too far into it sometimes or I have to catch it at the right moments. I'm re-watching Buffy and I had to stop at Season 6 because Season 6 is too much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which one is Season 6?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the one where she comes back from the dead and, basically, she just wishes she wasn't alive the entire season, so the season is her reconciling herself to the fact that life is hard. I knew it was coming then, so I could stop. It's just easy, particularly for very good art, for me to get so far into the characters that I become emotionally overwhelmed and that will send me into a week of being miserable. (laughs) [00:10:47] That's why I reread things 20 times, because I know what's coming. It's still an emotional journey, but it's a comfortable one and one that I know what's going to happen. David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men was a book that was good for me to read, even though it did, I think, send me off into several days of mess because he's ultimately a really hopeful writer. He's talking about "this is the way that people fail to connect", but he's talking about it in order to connect, to say connection is possible. It's not an accident that he ends the story collection with one or two stories in which connection really happens. That's nice. But I think I might need to take a break before I read him and adjust, although I do still find his writing style to be [ ]. (inaudible at 00:12:23) (laughs) </p>

<p>I will listen to The Last Five Years. Do you remember that show? It's a musical—my favorite musical. It's about the five-year relationship of a young couple who gets married and then gets divorced. It's just a two-person show and it's all loose. One of the people is moving forward in time and the other is moving backwards in time. They meet in the middle and have a duet and that's it. It's completely devastating. I think the playwright wrote it based on his failed marriage. (laughs) I think he might have gotten sued over it, actually, which doesn't make sense because the wife is treated much more favorably in some ways. It's still very emotionally accurate, just incredibly real people. It would be hard to be that person. I ran across it and started listening to it in college. That's another one that I always see something different. [00:14:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a novelist and he drops out of college to finish his first novel. He's a break-away success; everybody loves him. They meet when he's 23 and she's five years or several years older. She wants to be an actress. They get and he has an affair, or series of affairs; it's unclear. And then they get divorced, or he leaves her. It's funny—I got to talk to the playwright. He came into Notre Dame and he said he felt like it was this very, very culturally specific work about being Jewish in New York and being in New York, especially. The man is Jewish and the woman is Catholic. One of the things I heard this time around was, "Oh, well obviously she doesn't think they're going to get divorced. She's Catholic. That's not how marriage works for her." [00:15:55] They just have very different ideas about when you leave and for her, you don't leave. I thought it was very funny that he would say, "I don't understand why this has such appeal to an 18-year-old in rural Texas." I was like, "No," because it is universal even though there are a lot of the jokes I got over a period of ten years. So this time around I was listening to the song about the husband didn't envelop me a lot and it's different than it was for me, but there is also a lot of the same stuff. For him, he needs some kind of emotional independence from his wife. [00:17:05] I think the line is, "All that I ask for is one little corner, one tiny room at the back of my heart. Tell her I found one, she sends out battalions to claim it and blow it apart." That's not what it was for me at all. I guess this shame was something I had heard but never been on the same side as. Also, there is a plot point in which the husband, Jamie, has a whole long song in which, as his Christmas present, he gives Cathy, the wife, a watch and he says, "Take your time. I am going to support you while you devote yourself to acting full time." Like "do this". I was looking into it yesterday I was like, "That was a terrible idea." (laughs) That is something you did that kind of started it, because he's brilliant and he's an artist and he's successful. In some sense it's about a kind of independence of artistry and she's not being successful. She is really uncomfortable with that and she really doesn't want him to have to support her. And so it's like she's grateful, but to have to keep on being grateful as you continue to not get call-backs, is brutal. But I get defensive a lot. (laughs) James needs somebody to take care of and I need somebody to take care of me so we work out pretty well, but I need that independence also. [00:19:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean you need to feel you're not burdening him too much or that you can take care of yourself in some ways?</p>

<p>CLIENT: More the latter. Yeah. I do need to feel like I'm somebody outside of him. It's way more of a problem for Cathy than it is for me. That's on her end what drives things. For me it's just kind of something in the back of my head and something I've talked with James about it also; but I've always known this is something in our relationship I need to watch out for. I need to not get sucked in too far to feeling like I'm completely dependent on him. [00:20:49] Right now it's a problem in that the things that he said, "It's okay for you to lean on me in this way," even though I've said, "This is going to be really hard on you. I don't think I should lean on you in this way." He said, "It's okay," and now it's really hard on him. Part of me is angry at him for not listening to me or . . . (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Inviting it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but more I feel bad for having believed him but recognize that it should be, "Well, okay, I'll lean a little less now." Like none of this is necessary, you know? Maybe. I don't know. (pause) [00:22:19] He didn't say anything, but it was one of those—he was silent for several minutes because he was getting his temper under control. We were on the phone. I had called him crying because I was freaking out about paying some bill and didn't know exactly if I had that much money in my account to pay it. He said, "Okay. Get out your checkbook and we'll look at the checks and see if there are any missing. We'll account for all the checks that you've written and see if they haven't been cashed." I said, "I don't really have just one checkbook because I lose them, so I just have two or three floating around." (laughs) That's something that never would have occurred to me to feel bad about, but he was [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:24) Seriously, dude? (laughs) I think he did the right thing in terms of managing his anger and, if he had yelled at me, that would have gone really badly. At the same time, I knew he was really angry, so it didn't go well. Especially financially, he does a lot of handling for me. I am really grateful for that but I also worry that it's going to be too much for him and that I shouldn't just tell me what I need. [00:24:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean that you should preemptively pull back on certain things and only leave him certain things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I also think that's a terrible idea in that that's where distance starts, I think. My dad is coming to town today. He hasn't told me about this. He's just been texting me. I don't have unlimited text. I have a lot and I usually don't go over, but I don't count them. (laughs) He sends me these long texts and I started to reply and I'm just like, "I'm just going to call him." I leave a message and he texts me back. He's like, "It's too late to call," (laughs) and so I text him a reply and then he texts me back again. (laughs) I was a late convert to texting, in case you can't tell. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like we'll make plans and then he'll suggest changing them. I'm like, "Wow. Everything in your life is really subject to change in a way that's just not for me anymore." There was one time, I was like fourteen and it was in summer, and he came home from church (we lived across the street from church) and he said, "Okay. We're going to the city in a half-hour." (laughs) I was like, "What?" [00:27:00] And he was like, "I told you, right?" And we were like, "No. No you didn't." (laughs) So we packed up and went to the city for the weekend, a couple of days, and visited friends and family. Oh my gosh. That is really crazy. I really like the stability of having plans as James does, but it doesn't come naturally. James is like, "When is your dad visiting?" (both laugh) I had told him, "He's going to come on Wednesday and leave Thursday, probably before you get in, because he's getting in tomorrow really late." And then yesterday my dad was like, "I'll have a car, so I can help you move if you want—maybe even stay over until Friday to help you move." That's my dad. (laughs) We call him poppa. I still do. The good thing about him is that—it might be more with me than with other people—but he's really, really good about recognizing that this is a busy week for me and saying, "I just want to be with you. I'm going to come and I'll be in the coffee shop whenever you get out of your appointment. You do what you need to do. Don't worry about it. I'll find a parking spot. I'll just follow you around for a couple of days." That's really nice. As far as I can tell, his entire theology is based around "show up and be with people and be flexible"; and I think that's pretty good. [00:28:55] He's really good with people that are grieving, people in the hospital. He really gets that—just be there. He and James wear, not only the same size shoes, but the exact same kind of shoes. (laughs) It's a long-running, intermittent joke that I chose James because he's like my father and he chose me because I'm like his mother. I'm way more like his mother than he is like my father. [00:29:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he sounds a lot like there are many things that are different, [] (inaudible at 00:29:48) </p>

<p>CLIENT: They are, but they are also really similar in many ways. Some of the same kinds of [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:03) There was one time in college where I bought a pair of flip flops for myself and, at the same time, James's mom sent him the exact same pair of flip flops that she had bought for him. (both laugh) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really funny. [00:30:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess part of it is that my father's family lives all over the country and they don't necessarily spend that much time with each other, but there's just like an "e-thought" of loyalty. Basically in any city I go to I have a relative that I can spend the night with and just, "S happy to see you. Always." Then there are periodic [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:21)—usually at funerals, which is strange—where there are these huge and loud and [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:32) rapscallions (laughs), very idiosyncratic and probably pretty obnoxious to people outside. It's good to belong there, even though you don't. We're all alcoholics. (laughs) We're all kind of a mess. It's like we really are all in it together in some way. It's really important to me. James and I were talking about this last night. There is an episode of Buffy, I think it's called Family, in which Willow's girlfriend is not being accepted by the rest of the group and then her real family shows up. It's both because she's a lesbian and because she's a witch, clearly homosexuality equals magic, so they're trying to browbeat her into coming home. Buffy and everyone else is like, "No, she's our family. Go the f**k away." [00:33:14] We were talking about the fact that that loyalty is not that they like Tara. They don't dislike her, they "nothing" her, but because Willow loves her, she belongs to them. She's part of that. James was like, "I'm not sure I'm comfortable thinking about that in terms of friends who are family than if they were actual family, because then what do I do with Vivienne's husband?" Vivienne's husband is a huge asshole. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's in the story?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think I reconciled myself to that much faster than he did. I gave up on Brad much faster than he did. I don't know. I was kind of afraid to say, "I think we do owe Brad that same loyalty." Yes, we do. That's not incompatible with thinking that he's a huge jackass and saying, "How dare you treat my sister that way?" And saying, "No, I will leave the room when you make racist and homophobic comments. That's not okay with me." But he's ours. That's a good thing. It's one of the things I feel I'm lucky to have. [00:35:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean that kind of sense of loyalty among your family?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not there with my mom's family. They freeze each other. They're a whole other kind of f**ked up. (laughs) I guess I think of my dad's family as "hot" and my mom's family as very "cold", but my youngest aunt, Marla, has been . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your mom's youngest sister?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my mom's youngest sister, who is probably about seven or eight years younger than my mom. I kind of take her as a model of how not to let go of people in that, somehow, she has gotten to the point where she is married and has one child and they live a life of conspicuous consumption. I both really want it and I react against it also. I guess I do want a wine frig that has a separate temperature for white wine and red wine. (laughs) That's awesome. She sets boundaries, but she always reaches out. Every year she always invites everyone for Thanksgiving. My mom never goes. She goes once every six or seven years, and it usually ends badly. Everyone is really awkward. Everyone thinks they're having a good time but nobody is actually having a good time. Sometimes there is a really awkward, hushed silent beat, but she just keeps reaching out when she can, even though about a year after my grandfather died she got into a fight with my grandmother. I don't remember what she said to set it off, but my grandmother just erupted into this paroxysm of rage in which she basically said, "I am mourning your father and you are not." Marla was just like, "No. Get out of the car." (laughs) I think she just took her home and was like, "Okay, we're done for now. I'll let you know when I'm ready to talk again." But she just keeps going back to that. She just keeps trying. She just keeps being open. I want to do that. I don't know how to. [00:38:43] </p>

<p>My mom says that she can't be around her family. She basically alternates between trying to reconcile with them and freezing them out; she will say "forever" type contact at all. My mom says that the rest of the family puts her in the role of the sick person. That helps them be who they need to be and so she can't be around them for that reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of like an identifying patient in the family?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She is like, "Dude. I'm the one who is getting treatment." (laughs) This is not a reflection of reality. I don't know how to evaluate that. In some ways I feel like Marla had to get out when she was really young and build a person and a life for herself early. I think in some ways she is less damaged than us; or more healed. She had cancer and almost died as a teenager. She was at boarding school and was in the hospital near the boarding school and her parents never visited her ever. [00:40:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So then fast forward 30 years and she's having surgery on both her feet—she's a long-distance runner. I don't understand how it works at all. There's something like she might have to have her feet amputated and so she's having the surgery to get her back to running. It was really hard and a big deal and mom never called or visited her or did anything. Marla's like, "Okay. We're not okay. This is a problem." (laughs) I don't know how she does it; and it's not like she's perfect at doing it, but she keeps doing it. Every year she e-mails me and Amanda and Jason and says, "Hey, if you guys are around, I'd love to have you over for Thanksgiving." That's not that unusual in that there is no conflict there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but it's also inclusive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. How are we for time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got a few minutes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought a lot in teens and early twenties about just cutting off my mom and just being like, "There is nothing. I have to not see you or talk to you." I don't want that. I don't know how much of it is the kind of guilt that I recognize as not actually good and how much of it is "that is not what I think family means". I don't know how I will ever be able think about my mom and not have that stab of feeling guilty. Every time she crosses my mind I'm like, "I should do this better," or "I am failing her," except for when I'm actually around her. Then it's both "I should do this better" and "I am so angry at her." (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:07) what to do about her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's felt about the same way about this for about the last 15 years, so it's sort of okay. (laughs) No, it's not really okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be familiar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's something I'm used to bearing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what you're describing is being sort of terribly vulnerable to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You're right. There is nothing I can do that will make me less vulnerable. Even if I cut off contact with her for the rest of our lives, I would still be that vulnerable to her. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what I can do is choose what that looks like, if that makes sense. Say, "I am vulnerable to her, so I would rather be vulnerable in a way that I feel what I value." Eh? (laughs) You look very skeptical. [00:46:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really too bad that your mother, for a long time, has made you feel so terrible in one way or another. Terrible about yourself and agitated and terrible, and there is nothing you can do to protect yourself from it or from her. I appreciate you can handle it in ways that you might feel a little better about it or not, but that seems to me kind of burying the weed a little. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of. I'm not very good at sitting with things that are bad, but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe we should stop for now.</p>

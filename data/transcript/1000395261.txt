<p>PATIENT: (4-minute silence) I was just thinking about that when I came in today I, again, noticed what I think of as the dentist's smell only, uhm, this time it made me think of specifically the material used when I went to the orthodontist to have the, my teeth straightened.  And, uhm, well it was even more that, that because I didn't have my second teeth then.  But, uhm, at, I was also thinking that, I guess — I don't know, know how old I was when I stopped wearing braces but I was still fairly young and I, I, I guess I didn't — as I remember it, I didn't — want to give them up.  And I felt sort of disappointed and I was told that everything is finished and I didn't need them any more.  And it sort of made me think of today when I saw Doctor BBB, at the end I asked him when I had to see him again because previous to this time, he had been seeing me more regularly than once a year because of the I-U-D.  And he said I didn't have to come in any more except for the yearly check up.  And again, I, I don't know — I felt almost as if I were disappointed and (sniffle), and I was just thinking about it.  And, I don't know, I — I know it just seems like it's some kind of a prop for me but I not sure exactly how it works. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking again about this feeling when I knew I didn't have to go back to see Doctor BBB very often and it seems almost as if I depended on it.  And but then I was thinking that I must be feeling that way about it because I feel even more so about coming here.  Uhm, I don't know, sort of almost as if it's the main object.  Well, coming here is kind of, the day is centered around it in, in one way.  And ah, when I was feeling that way today, eh, it seemed like — except I was feeling "Well, this is ridiculous"  too but I think my feeling was almost as if something important was being taken out of my day, or out of — I mean I didn't go that regularly so I don't know why I'd feel that way but — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking of teaching.  And I know — I can't remember if a, if this occurred to me when I was going to the doctor of right after I left but I think it — that something about the fact I used to get out and teach and then do other things.  And comparing it now, thinking it's quite a big thing just to go see a doctor — thinking it's quite a big thing just to go see a doctor — that was coming to my mind before and does again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, you made the point yesterday, and the day before that uhm, you had mixed feelings about coming back to see me.  When you came in you felt you were showing how angry you were that you were here.  But you were almost of the other, opposite feeling also because you now are ah, thinking how it felt to lose your braces and how it feels to, ah, not be seeing Doctor BBB so often.  And I think you must be thinking of those things, partly at least, because you are entertaining the idea of what it would be like to not see me.  And, after all,, you haven't seen me for some time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, it just makes me think back to how I was feeling before I stopped coming in the summer.  Uhm, because — and I imagine I — I can't recall but I imagine I talked about it here too — that I think I was feeling very afraid.  And I don't know, trying to, I guess, anticipate all possible feelings when I wasn't coming.  And — but then I'm thinking that once I stopped, I didn't really think much about it.  I must have to some extent but I, it was, I guess it must have been I wasn't going to let myself think about it. (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I just had sort of a mixture of thoughts: I was thinking that, uhm — well it's a combination of sometimes things MSCZ said because he's felt I was not really trying to make things different.  And — I mean, he wasn't criticizing what I did here, specifically, but in a way he was, I guess.  And uhm, and then sometimes I felt that I'm not really trying or — I don't know, that I'm, I'm making myself think I'm trying when I'm really not or, or some way I'm kidding myself.  And, uhm, when I'm really not or, or some way I'm trying kidding myself.  And, uhm I don't know, there was something more with that.</p>

<p>But, but then also when FNI was asking me yesterday what I was going to do this year, as if I had to be doing something specific, I began to think of that again, and, and feeling pressure because of them.  And feeling it two ways: one because I guess I d—, I was feeling maybe still do — that somehow I was answerable to her.  But, uhm, I don't know, it was also just sort of looking at my life and making coming here so important that then I feel it doesn't really matter what else I do because I'm coming here and almost feeling that that is a part of why I want people to know what I'm doing.  Because then they'll think I'm doing something.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, I, I somehow have the feeling that if I keep feeling that way — I don't know if it's really right to put in terms of "Then I'm not trying"  but it just — well — (fading out)</p>

<p>(Pause) Well, it, I, I guess what I mean is that it seems as if I'm making coming here my life rather than, uhm, something else my life that coming here helps but —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So then when you're telling me how you felt angry about coming you're trying to deny that, right?  That you feel absent, that you really do want it to be the central part of your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I do today but I d-, I don't think I did — I mean maybe I was all along but — I mean, I, I think I must have been feeling angry even though I might feel this too. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I'm not sure about this, but maybe — because I think the last few days, I have been more aware of this feeling of not wanting to make, have the emphasis so great on, on what I do for my day being coming here.  And uhm, sort of leaving me feeling nothing else is important and so perhaps, I was feeling angry more, I guess, at myself than — (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking of, uhm, at first about the fact that it seems almost as if MSCZ, both for himself and then he's trying to force me, I think, uhm, is trying to set out his — making, beginning with this fall really a new year and, uhm, changing our life more to the way he wants it and I think, if I'm really honest, the way I want it.  And he's being very organized about it and about arranging things ahead and wanting things down on paper so we really know what we're doing.  And, uhm I think more, sometimes I think it's more so I'll do things like having people to dinner and uhm, seeing any shows we want to see and things like that.</p>

<p>But I don't, I don't know, whether it's to help himself or if it's just to help me or what but, uhm, I don' know, I feel sort of uneasy about it.  And just about how I felt coming back too.  Because I did come back — independent of, of this particular thing he's doing — uhm, feeling I wanted to be more effective about making me like the way I wanted it to be.  And it seems like there've been many times when I felt something along that line.  Maybe I haven' — I think perhaps I realize more what is not right about my life than, than I have others but I don't know I still have, I have this very uneasy feeling that I'll just fizzle out.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  And what would be the result then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, I g—, I think I'm imagining if I fizzle out that it would be like last spring or since FBO was born since now we have her so she's part of the way I arrange my day and all.  And, and I, this would be, coming here would be the major focal point.  And then I'd just sort of get other things done that had to be done and do nothing that I thought was fun I don't know, somehow I'd make caring for FBO and housework take all days of the week and be sort of tired and sometimes I'd work up to wanting to do something with other people but not, not very regularly and uhm, and I'm imagining that, I don' know, somehow MSCZ and I would sort of be there but not really — well, communicating isn't very good but — (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so that what you're imagining then, is that your life would center around FBO and me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that definitely was the way I was feeling this spring.  (Pause) Well, I can't remember specific times but the way I'm feeling, which I've already said something about, is, seems very familiar to me because I think one reason I'm afraid of — perhaps I'm already fee— that I never stop feeling that way so that's part of my fear, I don' know — but — uhm, I think somehow I thought if I felt angry then — well, I didn't really think it out but it seems as if by losing my anger, I'm now afraid I'm back where I was before and I don't want to be back there.</p>

<p>And just thinking about FBO, in particular when I think about trying to find somebody who will take care of her regularly I keep thinking that if I find somebody good and I feel very confident in the person, the person's reliable and kind and so forth then I'll be able to leave FBO and not feel qualms about it.  But it, maybe that's just putting it off to an extent.  Before, I didn't like leaving her and maybe I really still don't but now I'm sort of putting it that I can never find somebody that I feel good lea— about leaving her with and uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Z—— and another thing, when I think about the question FNL asked me yesterday, — I'm sure this is probably I reacted so to it — ah, is that when she asked — it's sort of a question I think I, in a way I've been asking myself because I have been feeling I don't want to be, have my life be the way it was last spring and uhm, and, and in just in terms of what I'm doing myself during the day, I don't want it to be just simply coming here and taking care of FBO but I, I, it seems as if I don't really know what I do want it to become other than that.  And, and I guess this is part of what I'm afraid of, since I don't know then that — I might do nothing about it (Pause).</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yeah, well uhm, I think, eh, obviously there's something in for you though, that you have this fear, at the same time that it's something you want to get rid of, that satisfies you, or did satisfy you in a very important, central way.  And I'm rather struck that it comes up again after all that you were talking about what happened in PTN in the nature of your vacation.  Because this kind of life of FBO and you and me walling off everybody else, trying to really exclude everything else, including MSCZ, must be the kind of thing again, that you wanted very much when you were a little girl.  You could have your own baby</p>

<p>And you could have your daddy and just the three of you and shove everybody else out, ignore everybody else.  So FLA wouldn't be around and FYC wouldn't be around, much less MLWZ, and it's as though that's kind of situation that you've created. /</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) You mean, so not wanting it makes it seem as if it really is true.  (Silence) No, ah, I was just thinking too, about 2 slips that well, I made, or almost made in PTN and one I, in effect, literally did make although I caught myself just in time, in PKW.  But one was when FBO would eat she sat in a place where she could see out windows and if anybody was outside she could usually see what they were doing.  And in the morning my parents ran around the tennis court that's not too far from that window.  So she'd liked to watch them and we'd say, "Oh here comes grandma, here comes grandpa."  And one time, or I think several times after that, I almost did it but one time it was on my tongue to say "Here comes daddy."  Even though it was my daddy not hers.</p>

<p>And, uhm, and then just the other day, in PKW, a girl that I met recently, who lives in our building, was, she was talking about they were moving to another apartment within the building and how they'd looked for other ways of finding the kind of thing they needed to live.  And they decided the best thing was to stay in that building.  And, uhm, then she said, "What are you going to do?"  Meaning, I think, more long range and I almost said, "My father —"  meaning MSCZ —.  I don't know, it just, I just seem to have everybody all confused. (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I begin to think of something that occurred in PTN that made me feel very angry at the time.  That's, I guess it's part of all this because it just shows how untrue wanting this triangle relationship and only this time with my father in it rather than you.  Be-, uhm, and this is part of the way things always seem to be.  Uhm, ju—, uh, MSCZ'd been up there, I guess, for 3 weeks and then he went back to p—, to PKW and came up the next weekend.  And when he did, he brought up some of those bbc chocolates, that he loves and he sort of nominally — well, he passed them to me and said, "Give them to your father."  But he'd really brought them up for everybody who'd be there, himself included.  But he, my father loves chocolates only he'd — I don' know if he knew that particular kind but it was just sort of a gesture to give them to him but they were to be shared.  And there were so many it was obvious that were they to be and, uhm, my father wouldn't open them.</p>

<p>So one night MSCZ said, "Why don't you bring the chocolates in to your father.  Maybe he's forgotten them?  "  And so I did and I tried to make sort of a joke about it.  My father said, "Put them back."  And I don't know, I took it as if he were annoyed but maybe he was just sort of, "Don't bother me now."  Because we were all playing a game or I had come in, just joined and eh, everybody else was sort of going through a trial run.  And so he might just not have wanted to think about them then but I immediately took it very much that he was very annoyed and angry that he wanted them for himself and I wasn't to interfere with what he was doing.</p>

<p>And so then, the next night, which was the last night we were all going to be there, uhm, MSCZ was really getting kind of upset because he had been looking forward to these chocolates so he, he was just saying then there was nothing we could do.  And FLA asked me, "What about those chocolates?"  So I said, "Well maybe you can say something to daddy."  And she did and he immediately opened them up..</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Confirming everything you've always thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, the thing I keep thinking about that is that, uhm, he may</p>

<p>Not have felt toward me, I guess, quite the way I have thought but I think it is true he has a preference for FLA.  And, uhm, I don't know I'm just thinking I'd, I don't want to keep being bothered by it to the extent — because there is an element of truth in it, even though I know I've always exaggerated it.  And it seems I should just be able to accept it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it also — I get mad at myself, when I, when I'm aware of this feeling of jealousy toward FLA because she is favored by my father and, and I'm seeing it as even more than it really is.  And, uhm, and then I, I don't know, I think I'm being — I don't think I'm being sour grapes, saying, "Well, I don't want any attention from my father anyway now."  But, uhm, I don't know, I just feel as if I've grown very much apart from him and from the way he sees things.  And I don't like the kind — I think, I don't know, I, I can't judge if it's part of my jealousy or what but I don't think I like, I like the relationship that he and FLA has, or maybe I should put it, the kind of relationship it would be necessary to have with him to have him feel the way he does towards FLA.  And, and yet I keep being jealous because FLA has these things. (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking after I said that that uhm, it's almost as if I want to get what I've always been after from my father just so I could reject it at this point.  And, I don' know, it seems like, to an extent, there's something like that that's often been part of my relationship with MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

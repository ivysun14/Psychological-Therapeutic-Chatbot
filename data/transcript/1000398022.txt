<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, 2 different things are on my mind.  One is that uhm, (Clears throat) the whole place feels so empty, because I guess most everybody's gone.  And when MNWZ and FEN were leaving, I, I, I don't know, I said something was — we just said a couple of things to each other.  And I was saying something like you're the last ones to leave, meaning it seemed like everybody else had left.  And then I was thinking, and I didn't say it, then I felt awkward about it, even the thought of, it was sort of, except for you and me.  I mean, it was sort of except for us, kind of a feeling.  And uhm, you know, the feeling of being alone with you, more than uhm, I mean, literally, alone, more than just sort of alone in this room.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>And I don't know that it's being alone with you that bothers me about that, is the way I was thinking about it.  You know, sort of the way I was thinking of we will be alone, and you know, sort of group myself with you, as opposed to everybody else leaving.  And uhm, (Sigh) I don't know, there's just an intimacy about it that bothers me, I suppose, because it isn't really true.  And yet, it felt good to feel that way.  (Clears throat, Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>I don't know, the other thing I was thinking, (Clears throat) it's partly on my mind because uh, i, it's something that happened, something MSCZ said today, but then I was thinking of it while I was waiting to come in here.  Uhm, and I think of it right away again, is that today somebody called me saying that they h—, knew a CHN girl personally, who wanted to come over.  And this person had gotten my name from FYR DGK, and she wondered if I still was looking for somebody, and so we were talking about it.  And it sounded like if the way this person has described the girl, uhm, it would be a wonderful situation for me.  She sounded very nice and capable, and responsible, and so forth.  Uhm, and so we were talking about it in various ways that could work.  Uhm, depending on whether on not Mrs LDJ continued to help me.  And nothing's final, because this girl wants to take some courses, so it depends how things can work out for her, whatever courses she wants to take.</p>

<p>And uhm, she wants to do some, she wants to be trained so she can be a secretary when she goes back, I think for BRD firms, or NCN firms, or anyway, where BRD is necessary.  And so we were talking about what kind of training she'd want to get here.  And then I called MSCZ, partly because I was excited, because this is the first good thing that had come along, even though it may not work out for me, since I've been looking.  And uhm, then partly because I was thinking, well, he might have some business associates who would know something about what the qualifications are necessary, because he, they do have a lot of people who have firms in other countries.  And uhm, I think mainly though, I just wanted to tell him, because I felt excited about it.</p>

<p>And so he immediately said, "Well what did you say you'd pay?"  And uhm, it was, everything was based on my keeping FYR 1 day a week, and so I said I would pay 60, if she were doing everything, which is what I've been saying all along to anybody who's been applying to do everything except for the cleaning.  Uh, and he was furious, and he said, "Well that will mean it will come to just about 80, because FYR will probably, will want us to do Social Security."  We're not absolutely certain yet, but uhm, in any case, it would be close to 80.  It would be a little over 75.  And anyway this is what FDO was going to be.  And MSCZ had already said to me, you have to just decide whether, what you think you have to spend, and then do it.  And then we'll have to see what we have to cut back on somewhere else.</p>

<p>And, uhm, and yet when I said it today, he was furious, because he wants me to stick to a lower figure, which would be lower than what we were going to give FDO, and uhm, last year I'd felt very uncomfortable about having to ask somebody to work for what we'd had to ask FDO to work for.  And I just feel I can't do that again.  And he's asking me to go back to that.  So anyway, I was just, I was feeling very upset about it, and intimidated again.  Because when he gets mad, he gets really mad, and I reminded him that he'd said that I had to make the decision.  But he was still mad, because I didn't decide the way he wanted me to.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, in thinking about it, I just, again, I suppose I could just talk to him again about it, but he's getting tired of talking about it.  And yet, I don't want to be intimidated, and I don't think I've made the wrong decision.  Because all, anybody I've talked to who's hiring help, I'm still paying a very low wage.  And uhm, well, I just feel I'm right.  But then again, I'm inclined to, I guess, not always be sensible about money.  So, I, I start having questions when he gets so mad.  And uhm, he does intimidate me when he gets mad.  I guess that's what really bothers me, that (Clears throat) he wants to, and he does, and then he gets angry when he intimidates me, too.  (3-Minutes Silence, Stomach growls)</p>

<p>I don't know, I guess, wondering, part of the rea—, just sort of imagining, uhm, how some things would work out.  Like with FYR coming in a slightly different way, (Clears throat) so that she got FSO to whoever was taking the children up, and then picked her up when they were brought back.  Uhm, mm, and how she'd work out getting everything else done, because she'd be doing less time at my apartment, although for the one day she came, she'd come longer.  Uhm, just how, wondering how she would be with FSO.  She's done a lot with MYDN, and FNI, I know, has been very pleased with her.  Uhm, but I, but she's never had to care for FSO.</p>

<p>And, and then just thinking about when this woman called today, about the CHN girl, of, she called right in the middle of my talking to both Mrs LDJ and FYR over this new thing that uh, assuming I can find somebody to live in just for evenings, and uh, seeing if they're both agreeable to the way it would have to work.  And so I didn't want to talk to the person who was calling right at that time, because that was right in the middle of the others, and I really didn't want them to overhear, anyway.</p>

<p>Uhm, but my first reaction was sort of, well I've got things all worked out, so now I won't be interested any longer.  Why couldn't this call have come earlier?  And, but then I called, I just said I would have to call her back.  And when I did call her back, I realized, well I'm being silly, because if she would work out, it would be a lot better than having 3 people.  And uhm, it might work out that I can still keep FYR.   And then I don't know what my feeling is.  In a way, I was kind of slow to see, well, maybe this would be better.  Uhm, whether or not because Mrs LDJ has been helping me, when I was so afraid I'd find nobody who could help me.  And uhm, she has been good.</p>

<p>I think in a way, I do feel I would prefer uhm, to find somebody younger for a permanent person to be taking care of FSO.  Because Mrs LDJ does seem to be getting pretty tired.  But uhm, (Sniff) you know, a—, a—, I mean, still, if that's my choice, I'm not that unhappy with my choice.  And so I don't know whether it was partly, well how can I now tell her, I mean, she knows that I may still find somebody to live in to do everything.  So it's not I'd tell her some shocking thing.  But yet, I had a reluctant feeling to uh, you know, think of the fact that maybe I'd be telling her that she was going to be finished with us.  And uhm, (Sigh) I don't know whether it's because of a feeling I might need her again sometime, or what.  (Clears throat, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I guess I'm, I'm really uhm, I don't know, I was just thinking, well, (Clears throat) I suppose there's something to understand about my relationship with Mrs LDJ, but I really don't feel that it's, I don't know, somehow I feel it's something I can figure out myself, and (Clears throat) then I thought again about yesterday, and uhm, the trouble I was having understanding things at the end.  And I guess, what you were pointing out to me, of the fact that, the fact I couldn't understand you, was a way of not seeing what you were saying, or what you have, and that would make me then think of your penis, is what I left on, I guess.  And uhm, well, I g—, I, I think I'm feeling that today I'm trying to avoid all, thinking about all that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Yeah, it sure sounds like it.  Especially after what you said right away, that you felt we're in a very intimate situation today, because we're here all alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) That might be s, something.  I was just thinking about the fact that well, after we'd talked so much the night before last, uhm, and the whole thing began with MSCZ being uhm, well, loving but a—, I mean, he was touching on my problems about uhm, responding to him sexually, and, or just my problems, you know, about responding to my own sex, liking being a woman.  And uhm, he had just bought the book uh, (Clears throat) I think it's called "The Classic Nude."  It's photographs, uhm, I think that's the title.  But anyway, it's something he'd wanted for a long time.  He brought it home and first spoke of it the way he done about that other book, on, uhm, th,th,th, the uh, I've forgotten the title.  But anyway, it was about sexual positions, really, that people could enjoy, men and women could enjoy.  And he had presented that to me, as if it were a present for me, and that had made me very mad.  I'm sure I spoke about it then.</p>

<p>And so, he'd started out presenting this one the same way.  And I guessed immediately it must be that book.  I didn't have the same feeling about it, but uhm, and we joked about how he was pretending it was a present for me when it really was for him.  But then later, he got more serious about just sort of, how did I feel about the book, what was my response to some of the photographs.  And uhm, a, and anyway, it ended up in our being more intimate with each other, just in what we were talking about, and I suppose, feeling closer.  Even though we fought too, because whenever we touched on money, we'd start having a fight.</p>

<p>Uh, uhm, but we ended up making love, and even though I didn't have an orgasm, I don't think I really wanted to.  Uhm, I wanted to make love with him.  I wanted to uhm, enjoy it as much as I could, but I didn't want to feel the pressure that I had to have an orgasm, I guess is the way I was really feeling that night.  And uhm, and maybe really underneath it all, I just didn't want to have an orgasm.  But I didn't mind it being pleasant, as long as I didn't have an orgasm, I'm not sure of that, but in any case, it was a very willing thing on my part, and I didn't feel I was just doing it to please MSCZ.  It was sort of an expression of our closeness, I suppose, too.</p>

<p>But then last night, he wanted to make love again, and I didn't feel I could say no.  Because then I would displease him, and (Clears throat) you know, then we'd have this cold, distant relationship again, and he'd be upset and angry, and you know, the whole pattern.  And so again, well it was more we had intercourse, than we made love.  And uhm, I tried to pretend enough so that it wouldn't be unpleasant.  Because now, he can't even have intercourse with me if, if he feels I'm, you know, just sort of doing it because I feel I have to.  But I really did feel that way last night.  And I was thinking, wondering why I felt so differently last night than I did the night before, and the only thing I could think of then, was that it was because I had assumed he wouldn't want to make love again, since we had just the night before.  You know, it was sort of like a safe time, and it was a shock in a way, although I can see it shouldn't have been.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I don't know, now I'm wondering if well maybe, because I really felt at one point, that I couldn't stand it.  If, and especially it was when he was doing anything that was beginning to be at all pleasing to me, you know, sexually ar, arousing at all.  I would get this feeling, I can't stand this.  And so now I think of it, especially after thinking of how I left here yesterday, what I was thinking, that it might have been very much a feeling I had to save myself for you, or it wasn't you, or whatever.  Uhm, anyway, you were very much coming between us, because of my feelings.  (Sigh)</p>

<p>And the night before, uhm, it really was almost the opposite.  Because I was very much thinking then about how much had I been, you know, wanting to be a martyr all my life, and let all these situations develop, or even created them.  And, and I was really feeling, I was feeling sort of temporarily freed from my father, and I suppose then, freed from you.  Uh, a—, I had very much of a feeling, this is going to change the way I see an awful lot of things, and the way I feel, I'll feel about things.  But then, last night it was as if I were really back into uhm, the way I felt last year, I suppose it would be, or you know, so many years.  (3-minute silence, Stomach growls)</p>

<p>Uhm, now I'm thinking again about all the intricate ways I can work out my baby-sitting problems, and, mainly I was thinking about money, though, I guess, because I was thinking about uhm, I'm starting FYR next week, just 1 day.  And uhm, I was thinking, should I start Mrs LDJ the way it would be if she really did stay permanently, because I'm paying her a lot more, right now.  And uhm, (Clear throat) thinking about those things, rather than — but it still has to do with, I suppose, my feeling about MSCZ, and our problems deciding or agreeing, or resolving our money affairs.</p>

<p>And I, I don't know, I get back to where I started, one of the things I started out with today, of feeling confused.  Because on the one hand, I mean, maybe there's nothing to be confused about.  He really wants me to do something his way, but he is saying, but you have to decide, and he just doesn't like my decision, and I'm just going to have to stand his being annoyed.  Uhm, but I just can't understand when he had said decide, that he got as angry as he did today.  Because that, what I said to him, that arrangement would cost less than keeping Mrs LDJ, and doing something that we discussed, that he agreed to.  And uhm, (Sigh) I just, I don't know, I just don't understand.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I want to go back.  You know, you said that you uh, were thinking about the idea of being martyr, and how that, or, or something connected with that, felt to you, as though it was going to change things.  You were going to feel differently.  You just toss that out and then drop it.  What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) Uhm, we—, at this point I'm not even sure, because it was definitely a feeling I had, and I, I, I guess a feeling I won't cling to certain patterns of behaving and reacting, because now I can see what I've been doing.  And uhm, yet obviously it isn't, well it hasn't worked yet, because I feel as if now I'm back into all my old patterns.  So, I'm, I'm not completely sure what I did mean when I was feeling that then, but it was definitely a feeling I had.  I really, I don't know, because I've had that feeling before, about things.</p>

<p>And yet, somehow uhm, I think my feeling at this point is, there are fewer things that are in the way of my uhm, solving my problems, than before.  And, I mean, I me—, I suppose that's obvious.  But yet I, I think I have this feeling that they're a lot fewer.  And this just seemed like one of the major things, that if I can stop trying to be a martyr, that an awful lot would fall into place.  But now, I don't feel that way.  It's as if, well what's that got to do with it.</p>

<p>And I think I, maybe the way I was feeling about it is because it came in, what I was thinking about, was connected with feeling I was clinging to you, because then I wanted to keep coming here until you rejected me.  And right now, I don't feel that way, I don't feel I'm clinging to you because I want you to reject me.  (Pause) Or, I sh—, I don't mean, I don't know, i—, or just simply that I would not, I would refuse, no matter what I understand about it, to give up having these fantasies about you.  I mean, this is how I saw it then.  Because I really wanted to go through this pattern of in the end, you'd reject me.  But today, the fantasy seems so real, it doesn't seem like I'm trying to do anything, except these are the fantasies that make me happy —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Wh, what fantasies?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know, except being alone with you, I guess, because that's —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) But you haven't said anything about it, I mean, just mentioned it.  You didn't elaborate.  What are your fantasies today
about us being here alone?  You allude to something, but you don't say.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, well I haven't thought directly either, but it would, I think, have to be the opposite of what happened last night.  That we would make love and that I would enjoy it, and be able to fully become involved, because I would want to make love with you.  I would get your penis.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And what makes that more satisfying than what you had with MSCZ the night before last?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, the way I was feeling the night before last, it isn't.  But the way I was feeling last night, it is.  And, and that's what I don't, I mean, something happened to change uhm, you know, sort of the direction of what I wanted.  Uhm, because I felt satisfied the night before last.  Because we, we were close.  Making love was, you know, a part of having been close and being close.  And I didn't feel upset after it happened, I just felt good.  And last night was very different, and I had a very strong feeling of not wanting to become involved, and being disturbed at seeing him becoming involved.  And yet, wanting to pretend enough so he would—, so he wouldn't be upset, and you know, just keep the whole pretense up.  And uhm, (Sigh) it was like 2 entirely different experiences.</p>

<p>And the night before last, I hadn't, I — I suppose that's why I could do it — I had no feeling of needing a fantasy, like I'm having today, and uhm, last night I, I didn't think of it, but I must have been feeling that way then, because I just can't understand it in any other way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And what do you feel happened?  To make that change?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I, I f—, I still think I was, even when I left here, resisting understanding something.  But I think it had to do with, you know, your pointing out that at some point, I was having trouble because the whole thing was beginning to center on you.  And my wanting to, you know, sort of touch, feel, see your penis, and the whole thing I'd been talking about with my father, and you know, and then sort of generally, vaguely, with MSCZ, was true with you.  And I couldn't see that at all, yesterday.  Un, until the very end when you were pointing out some things to me.</p>

<p>And then, at the very end, I don't even remember what you said now, exactly, but I went away thinking, oh, what I'd been avoiding, you know, is that what I'm trying, you know, sort of not understanding you, is then, like not seeing your penis, or something like that.  I don't know.  But somehow your penis came into my mind.  Whatever you said at the very end made me think of your penis.  And that's how I left this room.  And I didn't, I guess, consciously keep thinking about it, but I can, it seems like that has to be it.  And I don't feel I really still understand, uhm, quite what happened yesterday, so I changed around from the way I'd been the day before.  Or, you know, th, that, sort of, my attitude or feeling, or whatever it was that was different the day before.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Or m—, th, then I just think of something else that, it seemed to me I was more upset by than was, again, appropriate.  Uhm, today, the subway that I had to take to school was extremely jammed.  And I wasn't being bothered by anybody, but directly in front of me was a man uhm, standing next to a girl who was sort of half turned away from him.  And he was, I saw him size up the situation, look at her rear end, and then decide he was going to uhm, sort of hold onto it, or whatever he was doing to it, or caress it.  Or I don't know what word you'd use, because he was, uhm, obviously getting a charge out of it himself, but it wasn't very obvious, except I saw the whole thing.  I saw him look down and see, and then change the way his hand was, and then saw her beginning to look annoyed, and uhm, he did more obvious things right before we came to the stop.  And then we all got off.  And it really bothered me.  I mean, I was mad at him for what he was doing, and mad at her for not doing something to stop him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What exactly was he doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, he was just sort of feeling her rear end.  And there was no mistake about it.  You know, sometimes I've seen things, or had things happen to me that I haven't been too sure about.  But there was no way that I could have been mistaken about what I saw.  But I don't think, you know I mean, she, it was happening to her, and she could react any way she wanted.  And I know I would have reacted by being a bit more positive on not liking it, than she.  I mean she kind of looked around to see who it was, and gave him a dirty look.  But she didn't move, or anything.</p>

<p>And uhm, I've learned that, I mean I find I cannot stand there passively until I get to the station, and think well, o—, we're getting out soon.  And I've started stepping on their toes, or jabbing them, or moving away or you know, confronting them directly or something, so they stop.  Because I find I can't stand it.  And I don't see any reason why I should.  But she just stood there passively, the way I used to a long time ago.  And that might be partly what was bothering me, because she was doing something I used to do, because I didn't dare do anything else.</p>

<p>But I don't know, because I reacted so strongly, there must be uhm, well, I, I, I don't know, I mean he was so, he was so repulsive that I don't want to even think, well maybe it's because I was jealous I was wishing it were me.  Uhm, unless it gets back to the fact that I thought of it here, and then I'm wishing you would be molesting me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, I don't know, I, I, I still have, if I imagine it, which I, I suppose I have to admit I must have just been imagining what would I do if you decided to make love to me.  Here I am talking about it.  Uhm, and then, what would, how would I react?  And I just don't know.  But I think I wouldn't like it.  (Pause) I mean, it's one thing to imagine it, but it's another for it to actually happen.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, you know what it begins to sound like is that when, you know, one is really get down to what you're really thinking, what you really want is to keep my penis secret and hidden, just the way you want to keep your father's money.  Secret and hidden, and so you don't handle it.  You know it's there, and it's yours.  And you're, now it sounds like you're doing very much the same thing.  And you have it in fantasy.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   The way that money seems to be mostly fantasy.  In your mind at least.  And that's the way you have my penis.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, I guess the question I have, because I can understand that today.  I think that must have been what you were saying yesterday, is that uhm, the question is, I'd, I, uhm, am not sure quite why, you know, what it is that uhm, specially at this point, makes me want to keep your penis in fantasy.  How I feel more secure having it that way.  I mean, i—, must be more than just habit.  Of, you know, because I must have felt that way about my father, and then now about you.  And uhm, I resist any other reality, like MSCZ.</p>

<p>But I don't quite understand, I can understand, I guess that's partly why the other day when we first started talking about my feelings about being a martyr, I felt free, to an extent.  Because I could see how I might be doing things here, so that in the end you would have to reject me.  Uhm, but this seems somewhat different.  I don't think I'm doing it just so then in the end, you'll have to reject me.  And uhm, well I guess the only thing to think of i,i, is you know, just the security of, it's a sure thing.  It's always there, and there's no danger of it not being there, if it's in, only in fantasy.  (Pause)</p>

<p>MSCZ said something last night that I, I, I just thought of this wh, when you were talking, and I can't get it out of my mind.  And it's, I'm sure it must be more directly related than I'm actually seeing it as being.  But I mean, it has to do with the whole money question.  And what we f—, been talking about.  Because when I went home yesterday, and there was, I had some more discussion about money or, you know, how much I'd pay people, or something.  Or I was figuring out what I needed from him for the next 2 weeks.  And trying to figure out an overall budget.  I was looking at what we'd written down for our budget for last year.  And then I said, "Well why don't we just spend some of this money from my father."  I said, "Not the money he designated for an apartment, because I don't feel I could do that, but some of the other."</p>

<p>And he said no, he didn't want to.  Having the night before said, "Well, we can always sp—, use the money from your father, if we have to."  And when I said, "OK, let's do it," he said, "No."  And I said, "What do you mean, no?"  He, I said, "Wouldn't you use the money for the, an apartment, if we were going to buy one?"  Or maybe I said I wouldn't feel at all hesitant to do that.  And he said, no, he didn't think he'd use it for that, either.  That he didn't want to touch any of the money from my father.  And he wanted it to be there in case he died, so I'd have some money.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, I didn't really think about that at the time —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) This, this was last night.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  — yeah.  Because, you know, n, now I think, well My Lord, that's just right into the whole thing.  You know, there's, he's saying he's going to die, and then there's the money from my father, representing his penis.  He's telling me he wants me to save it.  I was just annoyed at him last night, because he had the night before said, "OK, we'll use it if we have to."  And uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And that's when you felt close to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, oh you mean when he said u—, we could use it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  (Pause)  Yeah, well, I did have a feeling, I think last night when we, when we finished saying, I think what I said when he said no, he didn't want to use it at all, I said, "Well, let's give it back, to him."  Because it really bothers me, having it and not using it.  And, you know, in a way, not wanting to, and all these feelings that we've been talking about.  And uh, I have seriously meant that, although I don't know if I'd ever actually do it.</p>

<p>And he said no, that was when I think he said no, he wanted it, to know it was there in case he died.  But uhm, (Sigh) somehow I think we'd be better off if we did give it back to him.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But I think this must be very closely connected with this change in your feeling.  I don't think it's accidental that you felt very close to MSCZ when, among other things, he had explicitly given you permission now, to use that money from your father.  And you know what that means to you.  And you felt very close and freed by that.  And very satisfied.  And uh, then he changes his mind, totally.  No, you can't have it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And you reject him totally.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) Now, I don't want to spend the money at all, thinking that.  I mean, that doesn't seem like a very good way to feel close to MSCZ.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, because it means somehow —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) That's like saying, it's money, it's not your father's penis.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  — Are you saying that's how I took it?  I don't know, I was thinking of it more as saying yes —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And then you accepted MSCZ's.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, I see, because otherwise saving it, I mean, you'd be saving it if it were more than money.  (Sigh, Pause) I don't know, I'm just thinking what I can, I mean, this is probably just only a part of it, and I don't, I don't know if other things chang—, if I, my attitude changed in other ways, then it might change toward that.  But I really feel I have to do something about this money, because it's been an issue with me for so many years.   And uhm, i—, so often it seems like what I want to do is give it back to my father, although I, I don't know, I mean, it would just be a horrible thing to do to him.  Because he, well, I mean, I, he would just feel terrible, so it would be hurting him to do that.</p>

<p>But uhm, on the other hand, in a way I don't want to, to just because it is a security if anything ever happened to MSCZ, and uhm, but I don't want to go on with this feeling about it. And (Pause) I don't know, so then I was thinking, well maybe I should start trying to manage it.  Then I might feel that it's money, more than by pretending it's not there.  But then, I, I, the other way, I just, I just feel like I don't know, because uhm, I can also th, think of it, well then it would be handling money, like handling my father's penis.  I'd still have it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Mm, meanwhile just anticipating the trouble tonight.  Because I was thinking, well, it seems as if, well I know I'm bringing all sorts of feelings into this whole question of money, but it seems as if MSCZ is too. Because he keeps contradicting himself.  And uhm, or, I mean, he —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Especially that other man's money.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  But also what he said about, you know, my making up my mind about what I had to spend.  And I certainly was within, lower than the limit, what I told him today.  Then what I'd talked about with him, having to spend, and he contradicted himself again.  And uhm, again, it's how intimidated am I going to be by him, or how do I handle it?  And uhm, how do we get at wh, what it is that we're doing to each other over the money, question of money.  And uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, it may not all be clear yet, but I think it is very important that for the first time, you're really seriously, you know, have mentioned the possibility of using some of that money.  And the night MSCZ gives you permission, whatever was going on between you, you felt very close to him.  (Pause)  And the night he withdrew permission —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Interrupting) Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   —  you were very angry with him.  And then, you sort of turned to me, by coming in here, you know, having your fantasies.  Well, our time's up.

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: [indiscernible] I thought that they ran, you know every five minutes like during rush hour. Oh no, only two trains out there, two trains. Whooo. (laughing) Starting out, first words, exhaustion. (laughing) You know. Oh gosh. You should have seen me, I put my blond wig on this morning to go see my girlfriend. It's so funny. It brought back to me things like I've noticed myself walking like this sometimes. [indiscernible] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she thought. And in fact I felt when, when I'm not comfortable with people I find myself still trying to put, put on a face, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But we had a good - we had a good disagreement last night too. I kind of realized that - see for a long time she, she came out with us and you know it's not just her words. Like one time it was [indiscernible] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But in a way I still do it. But she was saying something like, what I do a lot of times is that I'll read something and I'll just take it on. Like we had some kind of argument, we were talking about Christmas. I said I didn't want my kids if I ever have kids to believe in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because being that, like a lot of kids - maybe not all kids, when you tell them this, and then all of a sudden you tell them it's not real, it's like lying. It's like the first stages in lying to the child even though they get older. And she said well, well what about the good side of it? You know like children have to learn to be creative and all this. And you know she was presenting the other side. So we came out with some fella that she had read. And she told me his name. She said you know I - when I get to college I have to be worried about this because people will want to know who said it and where they said it and all this and what book and all this. So that kind of brought up something that I hadn't learned, that you know you had to - I felt defensive though. From my standpoint.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, you're attacking me. I said Jim does the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said she wasn't attacking me, that what she was trying to do was tell me, you know to think, not just take something at face value. I think I do that a lot. I'll read something and I'll just take it at face value rather than going into depth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I'm kind of lazy. I think it's one of the reasons I have such a problem getting to new phases with my emotional difficulties, because I can't think to - I'm not disciplined enough. And I don't think enough. But  - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [indiscernible] too sensitive [indiscernible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See because this is the same thing all over again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it felt like criticism, like you're not as good as I am, you're not this, you're not that. And rather than just taking it for you know being ignorant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't know. I didn't realize I was doing that. And the only reason - I realized, that's when we had the whole talk. You know I pouted for a little while, the whole bit. Like a little kid. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I realized she was right in most areas. You know like I still believe that, well like she came out with at the end that this one psychologist that she had read had said that for some kids that they face reality very young. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know a couple that have done it already and they can't believe in the Santa Claus thing. If you push it down their throats they're going to become neurotic. And that made sense, you know like putting in a concept like some people, not all people. Like don't just make it a generalization.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'm afraid that my kids would be neurotic or something. I'm afraid that - see, I lived in a dream world for a long time. And I still regress to it sometimes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: When I don't like what's going on. And I think part of it started by all these fairy tales, this bit about Santa Claus, this whole thing (3:00).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there was something there that you were seeking out of. You didn't want that kind of thing to happen you your kids.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Happen to my kids. But it was - I was using experience and she was trying to tell me - I was using my experiences and I shouldn't' do that. I don't know, maybe it's because I could face reality and people were trying to push all this baloney down my throat so I ended up living in a dream world and that you know like, in the real world, again just didn't like what I saw. And I did see it. You know I could understand what was going on. Most kids then were really, either dumb or didn't have the realization. Couldn't you know just regress. But I would go to where there was sense [ph]. Like a - what was real.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you said in a sense, that's what you don't' want to happen to your kids.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if telling them about Santa Claus is going to do that then...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That and all the other fairy tales and all this. Because then, then you're having to turn around and say but oh, no, now you're old enough. And now you have to accept the real world. Now what we told you is make believe. It was nice. It was a story. But see, if they were a child like I was and people would tell me things, I was very gullible. And I would believe it because I didn't know. I was ignorant. I was very - a child is always you know more [indiscernible] than an adult. So you take it at face value and then all of a sudden they say it's not real. And you say well then what is real? What's going on here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People tell me one thing and then they say another thing and then, you know. And I think that that was one of my problems too. I think, when I was a child. I didn't want the last night. You know like I said I don't want - just out of the top of my head I said I don't want my kids to believe in Santa Claus or any other fairy tales and fables and everything. I want them to be told the real story, that there was a nice man, there was a legend that there was a nice man that went along and gave presents, and this is what we're commemorating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right something like you don't' want to fool them or trick them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. I don't want to tell them one thing and then have to tell them when they get a little bit older that it was just a story. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it has to be clear what's real and what - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And what's not real. Yeah. But maybe that's just me. Maybe I'm being selfish and I'm trying to deprive the kids of something that would be like, to them would be very beneficial. And she was bringing out her own experiences, how they loved their mother. She loved her mother even more because she used to go through all this baloney, you know, like leaving stuff for Santa Claus and making things for him and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know, and all that. But you know decorating the tree for Santa 'cause Santa's coming. And then she said she loved their mother even more when she found out it was her mother doing all of this. But I don't know, maybe I didn't love my mother when she told me. Maybe it was the way she told me. I don't know. But she just said, you know we can't leave, we were going out and she said - we didn't have a fireplace and the door was locked. And I said well we have to leave something for him to get in, like a key. She said I'll leave a knife. And I came back for something - she stayed there. And I saw her taking the knife. I said, you know what are you taking the knife away for? Santa won't be able to get in. And I started to cry. And I was like, I was about six, I guess. I was old enough to learn.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she said, well, there is no Santa Claus. 'Cause I guess she was sort of, you know, we were going out. There was nothing she could do. I was crying on, you know like, and the only way she could do it was to come right out and say well, there isn't a Santa Claus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm the one that leaves all the presents and everything. I don't know how she told me though. I can't remember that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's kind of - I probably, whatever she said was not, at least the right way for me to take it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's why. Again maybe I'm going into my own experience. And to me it was a rotten experience, the way I found out about Santa Claus and the way people always told me about it. Things like that, Santa Claus and all these other fables that they tell you about. And all of a sudden they're not there. The Easter Bunny. All, you know, the Fairy Godmother. I don't know. I can't see any sense to it but I guess it's supposed to be good for kids for creativity. I guess if it doesn't get out of hand it is good for kids for creativity. But - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I'm afraid that my kids would be like I was (5:59).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I get them hung up they won't be. It's weird. And I never realized how much that really bothered me 'til it just came up last night. I just - you know just out of the clear blue sky I said I don't want my kids to believe in Santa Claus. But that was one of them that happened during the week that just kind of made me think. It seemed like there's something there you know about distrust and that. And not only that but it's about not thinking. And you know like I feel like I'm kind of lazy but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah there's two things. First of all having - being duped or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you were a kid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being duped and then reading a book or just reading them one book and saying oh, that's why! I'll just take what he says. And I agree with her in this case that if I couldn't name the book and the author then I didn't really think about it, I just took what he said for face value and said okay, this is part mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is true. I tend to do this. I read and whatever I read I say well, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So this is my problem because I know I'm ignorant. And I say well, I don't' know. So he must know more than I do. So I'll take on what he says because I don't know anything about this subject. You know. So I guess that's part of it. And granted the thing that I'm thinking about when he says to see if it makes sense. And reading a few other books, pros and cons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that was one thing. Let's see what else I - oh, I know. The other thing about it is, this happened last night too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: My girlfriend was trying to solve my feelings, because she comes out and her mother had called. And I'm getting close to my girlfriend's mother because she, you know, she didn't have to be nice to me and she is. So my girlfriend said - she comes out and I was in the living room and she said well - and I guess from the kitchen you can kind of hear what's going on in the living room. Or I mean, from the living room you can hear when people are talking on the phone in the kitchen. And she comes out and she says, well, I told my mother you were here so she said why don't you send the little beggar out? And right away, you know I took it for face value what she said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just thought to myself - I felt a hurt. And then I said well - and I laughed out loud you know I said ha ha. You know. But inside I felt like, that's a nice thing to say. You know? And it was very funny because like seriously, see when I like somebody, it's very hard for them to kid around that way with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I take it seriously. I take it like, oh Jesus, you know thanks a lot. What a thing to say. And then I know she knew I felt that way so later on she said, she was trying to explain to me that in Canada a beggar is a small child. It is not, you know like, they call little children beggars.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what she meant. Because she's like adopted me as her younger daughter. And so this is all she meant by it. But you know like, the first thing is like a hurt. I say, oh, Jesus. You know what a thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something about that, that's the way you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably, yeah. And actually that's what it does make me feel like. You know. Because I did feel like something like that, like I was being taken in, like it was charity and that. And I still, I guess I'm still a little bit paranoid of it because I used to be - I used to say I'd never take charity again and I say like people are always going to try and get what they can out of you by supposedly offering this hand and this hand taking whatever they can get. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there you are in a bind of wanting that but not being able to take it because it's not worth anything again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well see it's a feeling like, like when she said that that almost made me feel like that's what I was doing. I was trying to get in. And I really wanted to get in to a place in the family. But I went to like Thanksgiving and they're coming over for Christmas Eve and everything. And I guess maybe I do, maybe it's because again, it's because I'm ashamed of where I came from (9:00).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is an honest, you know same thing like she was a doctor and she practices now as a nurse but she is a Psychiatrist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know you say wow! What a mother. And then you say you know I kind of look and say well look what I came from. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're with me [indiscernible]. And see, and I still have a hang up on my past. I really, it really bugs me where I came from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't get - how is that being ashamed of your past?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well part of it if that - see I'd like to get into, almost into their family. I want to be adopted as like a younger daughter or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And she is almost like a mother to me. Like she's very nice to me and we talk. She's also been through therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she was talking to me on the phone the other night and we talked about an hour, you know around there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she is so much like a mother. You know like, all right, so she's a little, like Jodie said she's a little intimidating and I could see it the other night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She started to get a little bit. And I worked around it one way Jodie works around it another way. But we still got around it and she got you know off that little bit of defensiveness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's really funny because you know like I can talk to her. I used to put on - I used to really - she used to say to Jodie, don't - tell Wendy not to try so hard. We love her, we love who she - she doesn't have to try so hard. 'Cause you know I'd almost again like handstands for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I guess I wanted a mother and she was there and she would be like really open. And I couldn't believe it. That there was someone there that really cared. And Jodie said they used to go over and talk. And she'd come back and she says jeez, I don't know which one's her daughter 'cause we sit and talk about you all night. And it used to make me feel very good because it seemed like there was somebody there that cared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know even when you weren't around, it wasn't like oh, I care about you, I care about you and then with somebody else they don't' even talk about you or think about you or anything. And here it was that they were trying - they were you know feeling bad because I felt sick or because I was having a problem. And you know like they'd try to work out what they could do to help me and all of it. And it's just, it's like an older sister and a mother might do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like for a girl who's like really has problems. And most of them she made herself. I'm not saying that I really lived an awful life as far as outside. But I took it that way. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like you really need that. And then they're with you a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They do. But I still feel like the beggar. You know when she said that, oh, I just realized you know like god. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you were the poor little waif who doesn't deserve it or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of it, yeah. Well probably partially that. Or that I'm afraid that by saying that it's almost like it's going to be stopped. Like what they care about is just going to you know like ah, she's here today and when I get tired of it, you know somebody else will come along.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That it's going to be just the same as everything else in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It'll be - well that's partially it. Because it's a very transient life. Every time I turn around I'm moving someplace. It's like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can't depend on anything to be there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Well see that's the same reason I stuck to religion for so long. Because at least I was - every place I went I was Catholic. I was something! You know like I was Catholic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was kind of hard. And that's one of the reasons I had - I still have a little hang up on it I guess. It's one of the reasons for a long time - like I thought I was pregnant for three months 'cause I had one affair. Three months I didn't get my period and I thought I was pregnant. Because I had -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know one of the basic morals of the church. You know don't do it. Whatever you do don't do it! You know. And so that was a problem. Still is. I mean I haven't been [indiscernible]. And I don't know whether it's just because I haven't found the right fella or whether that's just an excuse or what. I really don't' know. Or maybe I'm afraid 'cause you know I didn't get anything out of it (11:58). And I felt - I actually felt a long time inadequate or that there was something wrong. Even that I might be queer. I was really scared that there was something wrong because I didn't get anything out of it. I thought oh, Jesus. You know I can't, you know I can't do anything. Oh my god you know I'm the frigidest woman. I thought I was crazy because I was younger. I was just a prude as some people would say. Oh you're frigid and all this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I got so scared. It was really weird. It was you know like a sex thing too. I was really afraid. Again I couldn't do as much as other women could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I thought by then I might as well, she had been married for four years and she said she didn't get anything out of it almost the whole time of her marriage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When she first got married he was nice and he really loved her before, you know before he did it. But you know after awhile - and then she met another fella and started dating him, you know even while she was married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she found out that there really could be pleasure then. She said but you know don't feel like this because I told her, I said jeez, I thought there was really something wrong with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And see again, this isn't just this one thing. I mean that's on sex and this is on other things. And I just feel somehow I don't come up to par with everybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's like that. And like it wouldn't' bother me so much it's just that I know I've got the capability to come up to par.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes I'll really try and I won't get there. It's like with teaching. I didn't get the class, my girlfriend did. And I had been working for, I don't know how much time. And I was supposed to get the next class. But my girlfriend Jodie - she could only give it to one of us. And we're all three friends, right? So I had had problems then. And I was going through this bit where every time somebody would say something I'd say oh, Jesus something else is wrong with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just and attitude I have. Like oh, god, something else is wrong. I did something wrong again. And so she really couldn't give me the class because like if they caught me at something, she's right, I don't' know what I would have done. I probably would have broken down and cried or something. If somebody would've really smarted off to me or really called my bluff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But my other girlfriend wouldn't. She'd just go like this, forget it Charlie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean called your bluff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because I could act like I - well I mean even if I did think I knew what I was doing, you know all the time that I was teaching. Sometimes I wouldn't. Sometimes she'd throw me into these situations, like I'd be teaching dancing. Right? I never took a dancing class. I'm teaching dancing. And I'm watching and learning and I'm also teaching at the same time. Okay, you go into the other room and help Ashley with these pivots. A real complicated pivot I've never done before in my life, I've seen her do it twice or once or whatever. And I had to help them, teach them this pivot. And it's like a bluff. Because I don't know what I'm doing either. You know I'm hoping, I look at their feet and I'm hoping their doing it right and I'm hoping if I show them I'm going to show them right because if I don't, it's going to look really funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's weird. And you know the same thing happened in charm classes. Like I wouldn't know what I was doing. I started off with, there was no curriculum. I had to watch her and catch whatever she was trying to say and then I'd try to help teach you know them. And it was all a bluff because I did not know what I was doing. I really didn't. And so if I would have had my own class and I wasn't sure what I was doing, my other girlfriend could've bluffed it. She could've just gone right through and if they asked her something she would either - if she really didn't know it she would have come out with I don't know but I'll look it up. Whereas I might try to make up an explanation just pull something out of the air so I wouldn't sound stupid because I'd be afraid I would look stupid to the girls. Like I didn't know what I was doing. So that's even worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's why you didn't get the classes huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partially, yeah. That and like I said because I was going through this stage that everything I was doing was wrong. I felt like you know like I had almost like a very, very bad inferiority complex. And so she really couldn't' give me the class. But you know I said then, I said well if this other one's only been here, my girlfriend's only been here for like three months and I would think, I don't know how long, I guess I've been taking, you know, watching classes and student teaching a whole class through (15:04). So just like six months. She'd only been there for three months. So she knew less than I did as far as just the teaching goes. And she said it took her about a day or two to figure out which one should have it. Because she knew I was more qualified than the other girl.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the other girl was a better teacher because she could bluff it. She couldn't do anything else - and she would - she also said - see I have a habit of sometimes being like a beaver. And working and working and working. And then sometimes I get started and go. And I said how will everything you know, because I guess I'm sort of depressed if I'm working real hard. It's almost like taking a vacation with yourself. And I was going through these periods where I won't do anything. I won't read, I won't do - you know I won't exercise, I wont' do anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'll just fluff off. And I guess this is one of the reasons, because she was afraid that every weekend I might not have my lessons prepared. She'd have to look up things, you know, look in the magazines and everything to make sure you're doing the latest makeup and hairdo and all that. But see this is part of it. This is very funny with me. I will go all out for something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if it's not real easy, I can't stick to it. Like - like guitar. I took that for a year. Sometimes I'd practice, sometimes I wouldn't. After a year I quit. You know I never got really good at it because I never practiced as much as I should have. And I only took it for a year. You have to take it for a couple years to really get good. But it was just funny because I want everything now. That's part of it. I'm very impatient. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm. You can't stick to anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can't stick to anything. I'll go - I'll go gung ho for awhile and then I say oh, you know, do I have to do this again? It's sort of like falls into a routine and I can't stand the routine, it drives me crazy. And I guess maybe that's again because of my life. Because I've always been changed. You can change from here, you can change from there. I'm very adaptable. But the problem is, is I'm too adaptable and yet I don't adapt and stay there. I have to be changing constantly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So two things, you want everything right away and also you have to keep changing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Because I just don't like to stick to one thing for a long time. This is one of the reasons like, with my job, it's very funny. I've had two and this is my third job since I've been out of high school. And I kept both the first to for a year and a half. And then I got so bored because it was such a routine, I had to quit. I had to get out of there. Like I couldn't stay at something for five or ten or fifteen years. It would just drive me crazy. And - well especially because of the type of work it is. Once you get secretarial down pat really well and you know the different filing systems and all that other gore, it gets so boring you just want to crawl the walls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you change jobs to get out of there and go someplace else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So this one - this one I'm almost glad they're changing me around. They're changing me from lost to loans [ph] every once in awhile. And like I've been there six months and I've worked for like - well yeah, I've worked for like, like four different stations I've worked. So it's been nice 'cause I've learned different ways of doing things and different people and - it is a lot more interesting 'cause you meet more people. I mean not meet them [indiscernible]. But I have a great rapport with the boss. I don't just take his dictation and say, you know the hell with you for the rest of it. Usually you get to know him fairly well and I get to know his wife and this wife pretty well. And what subjects you can talk on, what subjects you should stay away from, things like this. But I don't know, it's just like with me, I can't stay to one thing. And I've always wanted, like I wanted to be a dancer. Like boom, I want to be a dancer, that's it (18:02). And I did - I did work for about six months on weight. I have to admit I lost - when I was real thin I had lost about 22 pound, 23 pounds. And of course it's like, maybe six months or four months or something like this I had lost it all. So for me that's pretty good because I did stick to one thing anyway. I mean no one walks around, like one weekend they might not lose any weight and then the next week they lose three pounds or something, you know. But I did stick to something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if it was just like losing weight. I wouldn't eat and I knew I couldn't eat. So I did this for a pretty long time. But then I still couldn't stick to it. Once I was down, I went right back to my other type of eating habits. Where I would, you know I'd just go out and I'd eat until I was so full I couldn't see straight. But again that was just taking my anxieties out on food. I don't do that quite so much anymore. I mean I've - I will overeat some days, but most of the time it was because I was really hungry when I went in. I'd just eat too fast. And then I find out oh, Jesus, I'm too full now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was at a time when - oh, gosh. And this was right about the time I lost the class. And I was doing all sorts of research at night for work. And I gained so much weight in that time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I must've gained ten pounds in like a month or something. Because I would go out and I would have three or four thousand calories. And I'd come home and I'd say, why did you do that? And you know then I tried to vomit, I'd do all sorts of things. I can't handle that. My stomach [indiscernible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I was doing it. And I don't know - I guess it was because I didn't feel like anybody cared for me. So I was going to treat myself in the only way I really remember having treats. Like when I was little my mother would make fudge and things, and so I'd go out and get all the sweets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would make up for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sort of. It was like yeah. It might even be - see I don't know with me. I was reading some things too about like how overeating can be different things. It can be like a punishment, it can be like, you know, all sorts of things. And I sat down and I thought well, it could be a treat. It could be something with when you're very nervous you'll eat. When you're very happy you eat. You know like whatever. But I think it may even be a partially two different things. It's like making up because nobody else is around and nobody cares that I was so good. Nobody else is caring about me so I'm going to care about me. And it's almost like, I almost think I was trying to stop myself - it's not really like a punishment. I remember my photographer saying that, he, I wanted to go into dancing. And I said I'm going to quit my job, I'm going to start, boom, boom, boom. He said you've got pretty good pictures, you can make a temporary composite. I said good, I'm going to quit my job and go right into it. And he said wait, hold it. You know. Then he's telling me well, you know it's going to be hard for you to do work 'cause you're so short. It's going to be this, it's going to be that. Are you sure you want to be - you know like your movement isn't that fantastic. All he had to do was rip me apart a little bit and then the real inferiority complex that came out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Came out. I really had one. I mean I had [indiscernible]. I'm all set. And the other thing he said was have you ever thought of directing? Like you're not good enough for front. I said no. He said you might be pretty good at directing 'cause you've done a little teaching. You know. And you sit and think well, I never wanted to be - I think I can honestly say I never wanted to be a dancer for - for the fact the I could say I was gorgeous or beautiful or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mostly it was for the money. Because I wanted to make quick money, I wanted to go to school, I wanted to do things. And I did not make the money at secretarial work. I thought I'd make better money at dancing (21:00). And I like convention [ph] dancing because you can meet so many people. And you can say I'm a people lover, I'm not a typewriter lover at all. And I thought this way, I could be out meeting people. Okay, well, I went into dancing and that's as far as I went. I did like a couple of unprofessional shows and I worked one convention. And that was it. And then I started getting - well I had already been getting fat when I got the - went to the convention. And then I just steadily started getting heavier. And I knew it was like running away again. I figured like I really wasn't good enough for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this way I had an excuse. See I could say well if I'm overweight, I can't be a dancer because I'm too fat. You know. Too fat for a dancer anyway. And then I realized that the business, that's all that was, it was like a defense. So now I have an excuse. I'm really just as good as everybody else is, I'm just as good as anybody else in that field. However I can't do it because I'm too heavy. You know. Like I do that a lot with myself. I make excuses. So I think that subconsciously that's what that was. I mean I was trying to make an excuse for it so I'd sit there and I'd eat and I'd eat and I'd eat and I'd say well, can't do it. Just can't do it. And I do that sometimes. I did that like with my friends, when finally waking me up on that. Like with friends you've got to go a lot further than regular people. And I call them and I do make a lot of excuses. Oh well, I did this much. That's enough. The store is going to do the rest. Or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - rather than getting down and saying, well this is somebody I care about. You know so I should be more. I should do more. And I don't do it and I know it. You know with people that I really care about. [indiscernible] selfish thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't want to give to anyone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's hard to give to them. Even - it's not so hard now. But it was very, very hard before. I realized that it was hard for me to give. You know. Part of it, well part of it is even with myself. I have to say that much. Like I don't speak up enough with people. And I don't, partially it's because of the inferiority complex that I've got about myself. That you know I told her, I said now you're wrong. And she said - see I burned this table, I think I told you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said if it were my table, you know, it's my table and if I were to burn it, I would have gone down and I would have done this and that and the other thing. I said in person? And I felt myself - I heard myself and I sounded funny. And it's because it wasn't even so much that I didn't want to put myself out for her. It was because I didn't' want to go down to the store and talk to this woman and say, I want you to buy - I want you to get this thing special. And I can be real, like pushy on the phone. But when you get me in front of somebody I can't be pushy. I can't go right up to her and say, now look, I don't want any excuses. I want this and I want that. You know. I guess it's because when I face somebody who's like in a real ritzy place or something like this was, I guess I feel the inferiority coming up, welling up. It's very hard for me to come right out and say, in the way I would like to say it. I'd probably come out and say, would you please get us, I wish you would. You know and then like what good is that? It would sound more forceful on the phone if I can sound forceful on the phone. I can't do it in person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I guess that's - I mean I can fake it with some people. But I have a very hard time faking it with somebody who is again, very ritzy decor and all this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like that inferiority or whatever you feel [indiscernible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. It sure causes a problem. Well that's one of the reasons I think I'm like that with fellas so much. Now we're going to have a Christmas party Saturday (24:00). And I don't know - I've been pushing it too much I think. And I think that I'm just afraid that something's going to come out like what used to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'd say things like, I don't care if they're not going to have chicken rolls, old fashioned music, and it's going to be with all old partners there. First of all maybe it's just me, I don't know but like this world, it's very hard for me to say and completely be all the time because it's so damn rocky. You know. And I'm afraid that what I'm going to do is maybe not go like for the older fellas or something, run around and you know kiss them or some stupid thing like this. But I'm just afraid like I'm going to be too much because I'll tell you, I felt like getting up and singing a protest song just for - just for the fact that they're so damned hypocritical that they're bugging me. And I don't know why they bug me so much. Maybe - again maybe it's hard for me to be in reality. Because it seems so rotten. You know. And I say, but that's not right! You know everybody preaches this. And then they say yes, they're a Catholic, they're a Jew, whatever. They go to synagogue, they go to their churches. And then they turn around and they do all this baloney to people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said, you know like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't make any sense. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's like saying - it's again, it's like lying. It's just like, you know. And I say to myself, well I don't go to your churches, and I don't go to this and that. And yet I live your principles. And you don't do it. You're - you've just taken, you're just stabbing everybody in the back that you want. You know to get your own almighty dollar. You don't care who it is. Like my boss, I know he's trying to use me now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it. Thing is like oh, when am I going to get to see your Christmas tree? And all this. I said uh-uh. I'm glad I'm not working for you right now. Temporarily I'm not working for him. So I'm sorry. I'm going out to dinner tonight. I'm going here, I'm going there. And anytime he wants me to go out, I'm not going out with him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like hate him [ph].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Partially yeah because I'm waking up to him. And waking up that he wants, oh every time I say something for nothing. And I know he's - you know so far I haven't even let him kiss me. You know like well one time he just grabbed me and he pulled me to him and kissed me when I didn't want him to which I didn't like. You know that was like, because I had this father image of him. But I don't even know if I've got that anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're kind of disgusted in him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See that's it. Part of it is because like I realized that I liked him more or less like a father. And then he turns out to be so schlocky. Again it's just like my brother. I cared so much about him and I thought he was so great and this big Mr. Wonderful. And then he turns out to be a small minded guy who - oh I didn't tell you I guess. He didn't even show - I think that I did last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He didn't even show up last Sunday. I was so mad. I even called him like three times and he's not home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's like you're at the point saying look, if those people are going to hurt me you know forget them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And you know like I guess it's - see again maybe it's because I'm so mad at my brother that I take it out on them too because it doesn't hurt you so much when you don't care about the people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You say well, I maybe feel sorry for them because they can't love. Because if you love, if you really love you can't treat people like that. You can't hurt people, you know like, hurt people purposely if you care about them. I don't care what anybody says. My girlfriend says oh, I think he loves you. I said bullshit he loves me. You know. And then she came out with me and we had a discussion. And I remember bringing it up with my stepmother when I went to see her, I went to see her Saturday. And I said you know mom, and she'd asked me if I'd seen my brother (26:59). I said you know mom, it takes a lot to realize that everybody can't love you that you love, that you think is going to love you. But she was saying that like none of her kids - I forgot what it was. She said she didn't think any of her kids were coming, or she hasn't seen like her daughters and that for a long time. And I said, well, you know I said with my brother it's like this. And I said it's very hard for me to realize that everybody you love can't love you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you can't have everything you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you want, right. But you know like I can live without material things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it doesn't, I mean it bothers me. I'd like to have this and I'd like to have that. But I can live without it. Like I haven't had any new clothes in I don't know how long and I love new clothes. But I can live without those. I'm the type of person that if I don't have like people around me who care like, I have a stepsister who's more of a sister to me - she has a lot of problems. her husband and her aren't getting really along too well and they're going to head for something really serious if I open my big mouth. But see again I'm afraid I'm going to lose her. I've got like one stepsister who cares and I've got one brother who's supposed to care and doesn't. I've got another brother who was (crying) [indiscernible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sobbing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have so many heartbreaks in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [indiscernible] my own brother who doesn't give a shit about me. I've got a guy who - I'll never forget when I went to the park that night and he used to hang out with a gang. [indiscernible] He got in a little bit of trouble when he was younger too. I mean he was born rotten. But I remember coming home and he brought me into another room, I don't know if it was my bedroom or what it was. He was mad as hell and he said, if I ever catch you up in that park again I'm going to kick your ass. Don't you know what those guys would have done if I wasn't there? (sobbing) He was showing me he cared. He cared. He didn't want me hurt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [indiscernible] dead but I can remember that. Dave cared about me. He didn't want me to get hurt because he cared. Then he came back and said well I don't care [indiscernible].</p>

<p>[White noise gap 29:56 - 32:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then all of a sudden these people out of the clear blue that pull you out of it. I'd probably be dead by now if it wasn't for them (33:01). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You should've gotten it from somebody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should have gotten it right where it belonged, right in the home but they couldn't give it. They - I got to get to that point where I've got to realize that I can't expect something they can't give. She could give love but she couldn't give me security. She felt insecure too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jesus, yeah, she lost her parents when she was three years old. She was in an orphanage all her life. How could she learn to, you know - I'm surprised she learned even any kind of love or anything when she was younger. But you know like it just really bothers me because there have been so - such - like a couple of wonderful people in my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But again I just - I have to get to that you know to that point where I can accept that they just couldn't do it. Otherwise they would have. That they did care. See because I still link these things together. Like if you care, why didn't' you try to do something? Why didn't you tell me? You know like my foster parents. Why didn't you tell me I was doing stupid things with fellas? You knew I wasn't a bad looking girl. And you kept wondering, why did I get girls. Why didn't I get boyfriends. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she's got fat ugly legs. What does that have to do with it? There's people who are two tons and they've got millions of boyfriends. It's because I just didn't have the - you know I was like, every time a fella was there I was doing handstands. Now my mother saw me with fellas sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She could - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She should have helped you with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My stepmother, sure she could have. But she didn't - she really didn't know. She was 76 years old and she was younger - I don't even know how it worked. I guess the first fella you met that you went out with you married and that was it. And there was no dating and there was no - I don't know whether they put on all the time or what they did when they were younger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some people opt to give in to you but there was no way they could somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they didn't know. They didn't know how. And then her daughter was - I thought her daughter was something special because when she was younger she was a dancer and everything and you know, she could have gone into show business, she was very pretty for her age and everything. And I thought like, this girl was a dingbat too. She was reliving her life in her daughter and everything. And I said to myself, you know like you can't be like this just because you know these other people feel that way doesn't mean you should. And just because these other people have these feelings - but she was just as insecure. She's chatting with her daughter's boyfriends' and all sorts of goofy things. And she'd always be checking mine over. Every time I met a fella she'd check him over from head to foot. She didn't like this one because his eyes were funny. She didn't like this one, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I couldn't go out with these people. I didn't even have a chance - see if I could just have dated more. Just for the very fact of going out more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: and meeting different people, being able to go out with anybody I had met that I liked and I thought was okay. I would have learned a little bit more. But Jesus they overprotected me so much you know like, my girlfriends were going to Willow Lane when they were sixteen. And learning you know different things in bars and that. and I couldn't learn that. And it was just - oh, I don't know. I just got to the point where it was driving me crazy. That you know I would do these things. If it weren't for my birthday, if my girlfriend wouldn't have come out and said what she said. That she came out - and I'll never forget that day. We cried. First I cried and then she cried. She told me about her father. She didn't think he loved her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was so funny because it starts out, she's holding me and I'm crying all over the place. And then she tells me about her father and she started crying I'm holding her. We were like two little kids. It was so funny. The mother daughter role and it switches. But it was just you know like, if it weren't for Jodie and her mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I'd do today. Because I'm so - I felt like - I felt like life wasn't worth living.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just like I went to work every day and I came home and I watched TV every day and you know if I had a date, okay (36:12). And if I didn't I went out with this guy I didn't even care about. I didn't know then that I shouldn't - you know if you don't like what he's doing or if you don't like the guy, drop him. Because I was so damn insecure if a fella asked me out I thought boy, here's something. I better hold on to it now or I'm going to lose it. That's why they always wanted to marry me and I didn't know that either. Because they want somebody who's like that, a lot of fellas.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somebody who's like a clingy, [indiscernible] they know she's going to be in the house all day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there wasn't anybody for you then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, nobody I really cared about. The only guys I ever really cared about, one of them got - well two. One of them got killed in Vietnam and the other one's a doctor. And he - it was so funny. For a whole year I just - every time that man came near me I just went whooo. You know, like I was in the hospital for five days and he came in every day, and he came in on his day off. See another one, another just - I loved him partially just because he cared about people. I was a person to him. I wasn't some kind of a you know like a number or a dollar sign or whatever. I was something important to him. And I really loved him. I think I really did. I really felt - not just an infatuation, not just - it wasn't just admiration.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just loved that person. Maybe not even as a man, I don't know. I think I'd have to meet him again and maybe date him a few times and see if I loved him as a man or just as - he's just such a beautiful, beautiful person. That walked into my life when I really needed somebody. You know like somebody I - oh, gee, every month I go to my doctor. And you know I say is anything wrong, do you have any problems. And he'd take time with you. And one time he said, see this is another thing. He left me and he said, could you wait just a minute? And he spoke Spanish and I know French and Armenian or something. He was Bulgarian. And he said could you wait just a minute? And he went out to I guess the janitor or something. And the janitor either had problems or his wife had problems or something. And he sat there and he talked to the guy for about five minutes. And he said, and he came back in and I said what's wrong? And I guess it was something to do with his wife I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He always got a problem and he doesn't have any money so he said, I guess he was going to go out and treat her free. Or something like this. You know and I just thought to myself, how beautiful. You know I know some of these idiots in this good Catholic hospitals, where all they're looking for is the almighty dollar and they don't care about anybody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now here's this guy who comes in on Sunday and he trims my cast, it's his only day off on the week, he works six days a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he does this and he does this for other people. And it just you know he was the type of person that I could really fall in love with. Because he really cared. And you know like I've always been interested in medicine. And then when I see somebody you know in the profession that I like. And then you know like being that type of a person. And he was one of the first really giving people, giving for no reason, not for any return. Or not expecting any return.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he just, you know I just I really fell for him and when I found out he was going to Oklahoma, oh Christ. I cried. I turned as white as a sheet when he told me that. He said oh, yeah, I'm going to Oklahoma for a couple of years. And I didn't cry. I wouldn't cry in front of him. I didn't want him to know but I went in that dressing room and I cried and I cried and I cried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You lost.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why. I guess it was just because he cared (39:04). You know and I had, I had one or two boyfriends at that time and one fella was by me the whole time I was in the cast. And the other one's my good friend Jim, he was always there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he made jokes about it, like I was a turtle. Like a little girl in a shell or all this. But see he's another one. He's one that for a long time I didn't understand. I was getting peeved because he would try to force me to think. We'd go out and he'd come and he'd say that's stupid. You know you're not thinking. Blah, blah blah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that would bug me. But then I realized you know like he's right I wasn't thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all he was doing was trying in his own way to get me to start doing something. And I wouldn't, for a long time I wouldn't do it because I was stubborn. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm. And hurt too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well partly that too because I thought that's what he was doing, attacking me. But somehow I still wanted to go out with him. Whether it was because I was afraid I'd lose another person in my life that in some way cared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he wouldn't try - I think even then I realized he was trying to help me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just didn't like the way he was doing it. It was like he wasp pushing me and I didn't like that. I don't like when people push me. You know to go in this direction or to go in that direction. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's okay to prod - not to prod but like, to open the door and make a suggestion and let me think about it. I think that's the right thing to do. Okay. But don't push me into something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's been all my life, you're pushed her, you're pushed there. And I don't like it. I don't like to be pushed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like to be you know shown a little bit and then let me do the rest of it. But don't push me into something. It always felt like that's been done. Like do this, do that. Was it the way I wanted it done? This is one of the reasons when I read a book too, even - it's because from training.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know you're used to doing everything just the way you're told it's supposed to be done. It's very hard to realize that some people don't know what they're talking about, some people that's their belief and you can't just take one person, you've got to take all sorts of different people. And then you know mold to it, see what you want for you or what's good for you or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and you have to take charge of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's got to be you. That's right. It's got to be you in charge. And it is very hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very hard for me to get in that position because I'm so used to it being the other way around. And part of it is, well maybe it goes right back to maybe I feel like caring. I felt like caring is controlling but, I used to feel like when somebody cared, they were almost like a more dominant figure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When they cared. Like well I know Jodie even is sort of dominant. That's one of the reasons we had a problem because sometimes I - see I'm getting to the point now where I want to be on my own two feet. But like I know I've got to get out of that apartment because it's all her. And like I can't go out with her because well she's sharper than I am. Not prettier, but sharper. She's been through six or seven years of college, she's done this, her wit is sharper. And she can attract fellas more than I can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's got something about her too, you know like she's also blonde. [indiscernible] two fellas wearing a blond wig. But you know it's just like that she attracts more people than I do, more fellas especially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I feel like, like when I'm alone I have no problem. I can be, you know I can check phones, I can go downtown. When I'm with her it kind of limits me. I'm like afraid, afraid that I'm going to say something that sounds dumb or afraid that I'm going to, you know, I'm very controlled. And when I'm out with her, when I'm by myself, I'm fine. So like she - they want me to move with her and Eliza to Texas. I don't think I can do it with them. Unless I can get over this. Unless I can get into a field where I'm good in my own right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah because otherwise you're always feeling second (42:00). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I mean it's very hard. I think even if I got [indiscernible] it would be very hard. Some days, because she really is a fantastic girl. And like, people would say what do you do? Oh, I do this and that. Oh that's nice. And what do you do during the day? Oh, I'm a secretary. She comes out with I teach business law and marketing. You know and they go wow. You know. And the type of fella that she attracts, sometimes they're a little above me as far as this goes. And I really can't keep up with them and I don't want to. But like the fellas I've got right now aren't up to me. And I mean they've got college but they just you know. And so I'm like in between. I'm higher than what I'm - than like the fellas that are in the office. I can't - there's not one of them that I think is really sharp enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I would like to date. You know like on a steady basis or anything. And yet I'm not quite up to like what her fellas are like. They're like the top lawyer in Pennsylvania, or the top this, and the top that. I'm not quite up to that point either. So I'm sort of like in between. And I don't like the fellas I'm with and I don't like - I can't reach the fellas she's with. So I'm sort of like, bleh. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It stinks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I don't like that feeling. I've got to find my own way. And I've got to work my way up so I can be up into the - like I would eventually like to get into her strap [ph]. Into the type of fellas the she dates.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I ever got married, that's the only type I would marry. But because that's - because I know I'm going someplace and I'm going to make it. If it kills me, I'm going to make it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know just like, like all these [indiscernible] conferences and that, when they blow up. That's part of the reason why I've got the fellas that are at the level they're at right now. Because they've got the same thing in certain ways, they're aspiring to be this. But in certain ways they're not, you know they're not too hot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A fella might be pretty sharp up here, you can talk with him and have a good conversation and that. And then the other way, like with social graces they don't know what the heck they're doing with a woman! I don't mean that they have to go, you know that type of thing. But they can't control me! And I go oh, Jesus. And you know they don't want to have fun. They have to act this way because they're at this place, they have to act. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I say bullshit, I want to have fun. I want to get up and they have like a band and they're playing the Charleston, I'm going to go Charleston. I've never done the dance before. Here I'll do it because it's fun. Oh, you can't do that. Why? You know? It's the type of thing where they're I should say they're uncomfortable, I shouldn't say that they - that's why they can't handle because they're uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you need somebody who's sharp but who's also sort of loose.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you need.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the fellas that she knows are smart but I mean like they are really smart. I mean they might be like IQs of 160 and that [indiscernible] because that's a stupid way of measuring. But I mean like say that everything you come out with they can come back with boom. And you know you go (laughing). You know? And then you try to explain to them what philosophy you've got. And well you don't really have one. You know and you're sort of like groping here and groping there. And you feel stupid. You're saying well gee I don't know. I haven't read an awful lot on philosophy and yet, I don't know what I am. I believe in love and I believe in loving your neighbor and I believe in you know like - like not hurting anybody purposely. And that's about it. I use this as a guide. And I say that so far is what I'm sure of as my philosophy. And that's it. I mean my religion or philosophy what to call it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I feel like I should be able to go into more depth. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And with these people you have to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so there's two feelings. One is that you really, there's a lot there. There's a lot out there that you need to know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And somehow that will help you be with the people you respect or think are sharp (45:00).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Well I think eventually I'll get there but it'll take a long time. Because like I've only been - it would be very funny if you met me a year ago. I mean I'm messed up now because of transition but boy was I messed up a year ago. I was nothing. And I felt that way. Absolutely nothing. And now I feel second best but at least it's better than nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just felt like, I really did, I felt like it wouldn't make any difference if I were - well I still feel like I wouldn't make a heck of a big mark on the world. If I died. Tomorrow. But at that time like a year ago I remember going to confession because I figured well maybe I'll get hit by a car because you know like heaven's got to be better than this, or purgatory's got to be better than this. This place is shit. It's you know it's boring, I don't do anything, I'm not going anyplace, I'm not meeting anybody. I said who cares?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For a long time I felt like that. Or I'm going out with somebody I don't care about. This life is so darn boring. I said I figured I'd probably get married and have a few kids, get old and die. Why not just you know die now and forget the rest of the baloney? But I really thought a lot about it for a long time. I really didn't care because see at the time I believed in heaven, hell and purgatory and I figured you know you're either going to go one or the other or in the middle. And if you're not mortal sin, you have no worries. But you know like now I've sort of broadened that aspect. Like I don't think you know like when I sit down and think about it, I can't - I can't see how there's a good god but there's got to be a hell. So that's sort of, you know that's [indiscernible] except for like I know there's like an antithesis and all this baloney. If there's one - if there's good there's got to be a bad, otherwise they fight and all sorts of goofy things. And that they would be like against each other and if you have a good you have to have an evil. But it's just, Jesus I was so messed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I really, I couldn't - I could go to that church and I couldn't feel close to God most of the time. The only time I ever felt close to God was when I was a Catholic. Was one time when I was in high school, and I was watching the blessed sacrament, they had it out. And they had like somebody washing it. And I could remember I felt so close to him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was so, such a beautiful feeling because I just sat and I talked to him. And for you know like the whole fifteen minutes it was really beautiful because I felt like he was listening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it - he was almost like taking me under his robe or something. Because at that time that's the way I thought of him, as God the father with, you know this big flowing robes and the whole bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling really warm and protected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was like a really beautiful feeling. Like a real communion with him. But I hardly ever felt anything close to that when I was in church. It was always, you know in Latin I'd go to sleep. In English people would be, if they had singing people would be singing completely off key. And you know I'd just be sitting there. And it was over, then I would go home, and that would be it. And I'd done my obligation, I'd gone to church. But I could feel like, I felt pretty close with Jodie and I did - we did cross meditation. And I could feel closest to her soul. Which was weird. It wasn't weird, it was actually beautiful. One time in yoga I felt like what they call the third eye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right here. I felt like something was going to happen, it scared me shitless. Damn was I scared. Just all of a sudden like I wasn't there. It was like I was, almost like my spirit was trying to leave the body. That's the only way I can describe it, that's how I felt. And I got so scared, I said no! Like you know like and I broke myself out of it (48:00). THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was scary and yet it was beautiful because I couldn't feel my body. At one time I could feel when I was doing deep relaxation I could feel like my feet and everything going to sleep and my mind was awake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But everything was asleep and it almost felt like a lifting feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I talked to a swami and he said that's the beginning but it's not something really. You have to get into a lot deeper. But it was almost like the astral, you know, raising a little bit. And that scared me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it because you were leaving yourself or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well it was like myself was leaving myself, you know and I didn't know where it was going to go or if it was coming back. And [indiscernible] away and it kind of - maybe in a way that was kind of nice because at least it said one thing, that I didn't want to die. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what I was afraid of. That somehow I'd - my spirit would leave and it wouldn't come back and you know like the body would either be taken over or it would be dead or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And well I guess it's like a hang up with a little bit of [indiscernible] because I guess everybody doesn't want to die. I mean it's sort of like an innate thing that's human beings. They just don't want to die. It seems that way. Everybody's real brave until the last minute and all of a sudden, I don't want to die. But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stop. Speaking of dying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Speaking of dying. What a way to stop. Jesus. You know what's weird. For a long time - but then see now I realize that at least I feel like life is worth living. It - you know there's someplace, I can go someplace, sometime, I'll finally get there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's snowing out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow. It's beautiful. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't believe it's almost Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah. I can't either. You know what's so funny? I don't feel like there's anything for me for Christmas. In Christmas. It's really weird. I keep trying - like when I sing the Christmas carols, I get myself into kind of a mood that's nice. and I think of like the gifts. But the only thing I can think of would be nice like, I can't wait to see my nephew and my girlfriend's nephew open the packages. And that's about it. I mean the rest of it like, well of course I don't believe that Christ is God or things like this and that's probably part of it. But the whole thing is just like eh, I wouldn't care less if it came or didn't come. You know? I guess it's because it wasn't a real great time when I was a kid. It was for Jodie. She loved it. I kind of like watching her. She gets such a kick out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [indiscernible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I don't think it's ever been any real great things for me, Christmas. It really hasn't. That's kind of sad because I think even if you don't believe in Santa Claus or anything, it should be a nice time. Like a beautiful time of the year. I don't care. Like [indiscernible]. You want me to come next week or...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. If you want to. I'll be here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You'll be here? Okay, good.</p>

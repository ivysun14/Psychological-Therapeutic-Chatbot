<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doing all right. Doing all right. Crazy cultures. I don't understand how PR people . . . I've been going at this shit at least ten hours a day, at least. Even right here, I got here as early as the door opens, Tweeting, fucking Facebooking, e-mails. This is going to get done. There is no way this is not going to happen. I don't give a shit if I have to beg, borrow and steal, this shit's going to get done. [00:01:01] It just doesn't make sense. It's a lot of money for people like me, but it's really not a lot of money. We're at $1300. We have 15 days. That's plenty of time. I just need people to kick in bigger chunks and then I'll do whatever I have to do to make it be done. I've been on Twitter. I'm following over 1,000 people. I've got 200 people following us—or me; whatever. I'm good at this shit. I'm targeting places. I'm being pretty good; it's good. I'm directly appealing to people. Once they follow me I say "thank you" for following me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean "follow" you? [00:01:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know how this stupid Twitter thing works? It's glorified text messaging, but I'm realizing it's actually pretty amazing because it's all real time. You're a psychologist and let's say you have a Twitter account and let's say every day you post a couple of things—articles or tips for the day or whatever—and I'm like, "I'm interested in that," so I would follow you. It's as if you gave me your number, but I don't have your number. Do you know what I mean? I get to follow you. You'll see that I'm following you and you're like, "This guy has a band and I like music. I'll check it out," and follow me if you want. Once two people are following each other, then they can send a private message to each other. Otherwise it's public. You can be like, "Hey, man. If you can, share the link. It would really help out." I am working this shit like a busy Croatian hooker. (both chuckle) [00:02:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that how it feels?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's pretty exhausting. Also, my friend made a good point. He was like, "You're not a PR person. You're doing this out of personal investment. You're working your ass off for something you really care about." I had a tension headache from Sunday until yesterday. I still have it a little bit just because I'm jittery and amped up. I'm excited one minute and I'm really worried the next minute. It's a vulnerable thing. Yesterday I wrote a really tight e-mail to a shitload of– all the churches. Any important church I could get the contact of, I just wrote a whole—I was like, "This is who I am." [00:03:54] I gave them the whole spiel and I was like, "I was the copyright manager of the Assyrian Weekly. I've done my part for the community. We always talk a big game about how we have to help talented Assyrians and push them. I need the community's support. This means a lot to me and I wouldn't even ask if it wasn't important to me." I'm able to influence others. Any chance I get I educate others about Assyrian stuff. It's a platform, so by helping me they're helping . . . I did a little thing about how the culture doesn't really have much of a future if it's not supporting artists and especially in a diaspora. What kind of future is the community going to have if we're all bankers and jewelers and shit. There has to be some kind of cultural production. So I don't know. I tried to make it as brief as possible, but also very direct and just like, "Listen . . . " So I don't know. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other difference between you and a PR person, I wonder if this is why the core metaphor comes to mind, is that a PR person isn't having to sell themselves. That may be what feels . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's what I don't like. It's just like, "You fucking moron. These fucking dipshits," especially among Assyrians. I hated writing that because I know a lot of them either aren't going to get it, they're not going to care, and that fucking drives me crazy. They're so unappreciative. The best example, two great examples are System of a Down. Do you know this band, System of a Down? They're kind of like a heavy metal band. They're huge. Huge. And they're all from L.A. They're huge and awesome. Good for them. They're very genuine and they talk about cultural stuff. [00:06:04] That's fucking fantastic. The issue that I have is that everyone now is like, "Oh, yeah. System of a Down." These are people that if System of a Down came to [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:15), or they saw them walking down the street. They're heavy metal, like mascara, weird. They're not particularly handsome dudes and people are like, "Look at these fucking freaks," you know? But the minute they're accepted by everyone else and they're a big deal, they can't wait to fucking lick their ass. That fucking rubs me the wrong way. It really does, especially when I'm a local boy, like I have worked in the general public. I have published materials. People know me. Academically, whatever. Everything I've done, I've included my heritage in it. So it's like, "Fuck you, man. Fuck you." That really rubs me the wrong way. I also know it just is what it is. [00:07:06] There are other talented Assyrian artists like me, of Assyrian heritage. In Assyrian there's a great saying, "Go die, come back, and I'll love you." (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's a great saying. In other words, (sniggers) when I can't take you for granted, then I'll take you seriously. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What? The saying or just the . . ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are a lot of good sayings like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't love you until you're dead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can you believe that shit? There's no word for fate in my culture. There is, but you know what it is? It literally means "the letters on your forehead", like it's written on your forehead. That's some serious shit. Can you imagine? In a way it's beautiful. I love that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Poetic. [00:08:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's a lot of poetic shit like that. But, yeah, there's a lot of poetic shit like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's that concrete.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For example, good morning is not good morning. Good morning is "kind light". That's the literal translation. And good night is "kind night", so "may you be treated kindly". It's very beautiful, very beautiful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you don't matter until you're big and famous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. The other example is Chris Bohjalian, the guy that wrote Midwives. He's Armenian. He has never wrote a god-damned thing about Assyrians, but he suddenly has awoken and now his new novel is about the genocide and his [own fucking broad sisters]. (inaudible at 00:09:02) Awesome. Good for him. That's great. First of all, he's a Johnny-come-lately. Second of all, people are salivating. He's everywhere. The Assyrian National Committee is using him, of course, as well, and he's a little naïve to even understand that because he certainly doesn't need them. It's just like, man. Really? Wow. Do that. I don't care. It's not just me. There are a couple of us who have been at this shit for—not just artists. I have some academic friends—people that are really worth some notice and there's nothing. Nothing. Because if you're not in their little circle and if you're not their little foot soldier, and also if they're jealous—there's a lot of that, too. That's just a fact. Once you're that big, you're already that big, so they can now just try to be your pal, do you know what I mean? [00:10:06] But when you're in that in-between, where you need the support and you're kind of getting somewhere, there's a lot of "who the fuck does she think she is?" Like, "Look at me. I'm a psychologist." It's just pathetic, it's just fucking pathetic. And I've already decided, whether I succeed at this or not, I think I'm going to write something about this. I don't know where I can possibly publish it, but it's not just for me. There are just a lot of us. My friend, Seth, barely made his goal. The guy just wanted $3,000 or something. This is a talented band, fucking eight people, classically trained. They're combining all these Eastern European jazz sounds and he's doing all these amazing renditions and it's like are you kidding me? Who are we supposed to support? Who are these talented, smart . . . it's just mind-numbing. [00:11:10] Seth has even more of a thing than I am. He volunteers. He's very in-the-community. I'm in the community in the sense that they totally know me and I've done stuff and I do my stuff through my own work, but Seth is very . . . It's like man. Wow. Anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does sound like you're describing the experience in your feelings. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The big and famous accepted people are more important than their own sense . . . [00:11:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is why I was interested in this in grad school. I think this is all connected to collective trauma. It's a microscopic thing in the family, but it's really a community-based thing. It really is. It's also the reason why I love Assyrian guys' and girls' weirdness because we can't help it. There's like this weird thing. It's kind of like you're my cousin. I want that validation, you know? I think there are a lot of fucked-up things like that and I really think if I were a psychologist, I think there are incredible studies that either have been done or could be done about—especially this one, because it's not recognized. It's one thing if it's recognized. Then you somehow cobble together a healing process, but I can't imagine what the psychological backlash is generation after generation of, not only not being recognized, but just being toyed with. It becomes a political football. Yeah, what happens in our community also goes on, maybe not in all families, but in a lot of them. [00:13:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The much-broader, intergenerational cultural milieu is of not mattering, really being killed, mattering so little as a culture, as a kind of person, that you're not as important as everyone else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And that the only way to matter is the constant validation from mainstream, non-Assyrian culture. (pause) The very newspaper I was the editor of hasn't written one word about my book. Nothing. Not one thing. The Assyrian section, he's a sweetheart, he had one of my poems translated and published. Yeah, that's awesome. That's a dwindling readership. It's very petty because, God forbid, they give me the attention because I'm the real deal. I'm not some hack. [00:14:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say that, "God forbid," what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the editor now of that paper is a completely self-serving prick. Completely. This is across the board. Everyone knows this, so he's using the paper to just get his hands into everything. Now he's doing a PhD in genocide studies. He fashions himself this kind of intellectual, cultural, important dude, you know? I think he's my age and he's an ugly little prick and just a dry, boring personality. God forbid that someone else—and he's not from here—someone who is a local boy who, I think, people would be very happy if they . . . that's the other thing. Some of them would be very happy, maybe, to support—they don't even fucking know. I can't reach out to every single—I need a way to get to people. It's not just me. He does that to select—there are certain people he just won't give attention to. (pause) [00:15:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a kind of identification of the aggressor. You spend a lifetime or generations being the one down. Once you achieve that "up" position, you sure as hell are not going to help anyone else up, [just like you were saying. Keep your own kind down.] (crosstalk at 00:16:10) </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right. That's right. All you're going to do is kiss the ass of what's above you, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which includes joining what's above you and putting them down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right. Absolutely. There's no question. There's no question. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a classic defense in trauma.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So I'm right, right? I'm not an idiot. I know it's literature, but that's my sense. I think I intuited a lot of that, but from what I read as well, yeah, absolutely. I've said that before. It's like a weird combination of inferiority and superiority complex. There's no middle ground. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have two choices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I've already decided down the road because I know it's going to happen, when they come to me and they want to interview me, I'm going to say no; or if I say yes I'm going to fucking let them have it. Not just them, but all of them. Be like, "Let me ask you a question. What the fuck are you interviewing me now? I don't need you now. Who the fuck cares for your rinky-dink 3,000 readership or barely that you have? I needed you when I needed you." [00:17:37] That being said, fuck that. Twitter, everything else, people are so awesome. I love London, I've got to say. Every single person that I've followed, people are like, "Hey—I love your . . ." They're so warm. Americans are cool, but British people are just very hardy. They're like, "Oh, yeah, of course. I love the video." I do miss that. They're very salt-of-the-earth, even the cool ones. They're just cool people. [00:18:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also sounds like you get into a place there where it's just more straightforward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's straightforward. They just appreciate. They're like, "Ehh. Cool band. I love this." Boom. They always have that. When I was there, I think I told you, random people that I met egged me on to do an open mike. They let me borrow their guitar. Like what the fuck? Who does that? They're just very, very sweet. I do miss that. (pause) So, yeah, I don't know. I'm even going to send an e-mail to my boss that's fucking loaded. It's weird. I don't want to go there, but that's how important this is. I don't give a shit. That' show important this is. I'm going to be like, "You've asked me about my music. You've been curious. This is what I'm doing. I just want to share it with you." She has a little crush on me or something. I don't care. Fine. If that works to help the effort a little bit, I'm down. (pause) [00:19:43] I was like, "Maybe I should sell my car." (chuckles) I won't do that, but I was like how to figure out ways, so . . . (pause) One of my academic friends, one of these guys I was saying gets ignored a lot, is the editor of the Assyrian Review, which is one of the only really across-the-board outside of Assyrian, good scholarly journal. It's based here. I decided I'm going to do a grant proposal for them. They're a non-profit, and that way it will give me experience. It will be great for them if I can get them some money. I think that's a good idea. [00:20:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they hiring you or is this something you want to try on the side?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He's one of my best friends. Remember I told you a friend of mine gave me $2,000 to fix my car? He's a sweetheart. No, no, no. I just said if we get some money out of it, if he can give me a little bit, whatever, I'm okay. It's more that I'll just cut my teeth on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also it's something I care about. This is what real people do in a community. That's an amazing journal and it deserves to do well; and my friend deserves to do well. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The support you didn't have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and the support he doesn't have. And the amazing thing about him is that he's one of them. He was in the Assyrian political party and he's born in Libya. He's hard core, but he won't kiss their ass so . . . (pause) I guess the long and short of it is that I feel pretty good, I guess, like I'm doing pretty good. [00:22:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just thinking that, really, it does sound like it has settled in a different place than your whole sense of yourself riding on whether this gets filled or not for other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think what it is, is now I have a more realistic—like this is going to get done. I've put my mind to it. If I have to humiliate myself and ask a bunch of people for $500 or whatever it is, that's going to happen. That's just going to happen. I'm not doing this shit all over again; and I shouldn't have to. That's the thing. There's no reason for this not to succeed. I'm not asking for $10,000 or whatever. I'm asking for something reasonable when it's a bunch of people, so this is going to fucking happen. So I think that's making me feel something. There's also that it's empowering. I feel like, you know what, I fucking believe in this and enough is enough. Every dumbass is doing some project and getting somewhere and are you kidding me? Fuck that, man. I think that's empowering, kind of. [00:23:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's less of waiting to see what other people think in order to feel like you must be worth something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Going and getting it. That's it. No, no, no. I'm going and getting it. Absolutely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're saying that you believe it's worth something. I'm going to get into it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm willing it to happen. Absolutely. Fuck that. (pause) Even in general, I had all these tension headaches. I didn't take Ativan. I was like, "All right, my head hurts because I'm excited/stressed and I'm working my ass off." It's hard to sit in front of a computer or on your iPhone 10-12 hours a day. It's dizzying. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the strain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [00:25:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The metaphor in trauma plus the power, sounds like you've removed some of that feeling that everyone else has the power over you in this; and it's not that you're now moving aggressive power to other people, but are just feeling empowered.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm finally allowing what other people are telling me to be true. Everyone is like, "Dude, the video is awesome. This is great. It's like you're pushing to make your goal." It's not that I didn't believe that, it was because I was in that position of waiting for others to validate. It's like, yeah, I am going to make my goal. I demand to make my goal because there's no fucking reason not to here. (pause) This is making me plan more, too, a little bit. It's like, "You know what? This time next year I want to go and play shows in Europe." Why the fuck wouldn't I do that? What are you crazy? Plane ticket? I don't care. I'll sleep on people's floors. That's what you do. Whatever, because we'll do well there. I don't know if my whole band can do it or not, but it's going to get done. It's a solo project. It's making me finally really take control of how I want things to go instead of just letting things unfold in some random—you know, and then feeling like, "Why am I not able to . . ." Well, yeah, you're not able if you don't enact or try to enact your will onto things. If you let things just kind of willy-nilly happen then, of course, it feels like you're weak and ineffectual. (pause) [00:28:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like the movement from being a passive recipient of the external world. I just keep thinking about "written on your forehead", how unbelievably concrete it is that you're the passive agent. It's scripted and you have to follow the words on your own forehead instead of [having agency] (ph at 00:28:47) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's incredible. What I feel good about is that I've been working hard. I'm reaping the rewards now of fucking hard work. This is not like some epiphany. I think that's why it feels genuine. It's not like, "This week I feel like this." I'm having my ups and downs but, overall, even in those dark moments something is like, "Okay. Today you feel like . . ." Even when I was here last week or the week before, there was something when I left here that was like—I can't explain it. Do you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were here last Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't like I wanted to curl up. Even before I came here I was out doing things and it's a very different way to be. You can have those moments. We all have those moments. It doesn't matter how much you better yourself or whatever. Some days you're going to feel defeatist or whatever the fuck you feel, but something in you is like, "This is just part and parcel of having a week." just part and parcel of having a week." [00:30:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is a little bit more of a foundation of a self that it kind of persists resiliently in the midst of streams of not-so-good feedback or streams of good feedback. I think you came in Thursday, it was at $780 or something, and you were really, really, really disheartened that you weren't going to make it and angry. There is a moment of that; but you pretty quickly find that that's not the sum total of you and that you actually can go out and change the $780. You work at it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like some random thing is happening to me that's out of my control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And probably people who meet their goals and kick start are people who do exactly what you're doing now. That's how it works.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right. I know for a fact the way that he did it. I have like 40 backers; he had like 12. So, clearly, he hobnobbed and some people gave big chunks, and that's exactly what I'm going to do if it comes down to that. There are still 15 days, so I'm hoping I might just have $500, hoping I can keep it going. You're totally right. People do all kinds of stuff. It's like starting a business. You do what you have to do. Even the show that we're going to play tonight, it's all very different. I'm not even thinking about it. After here I'm going to go about my day and around 7:00 I'm going to go to the center and play a show. I don't fucking care; whereas before, I would have either totally not have done the show, I would have found an excuse not to do it, or I would be stressing all fucking day worrying about things that are going to go wrong or be all nervous. [00:32:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just don't give a fuck. If I'm going to go and kick their fucking asses, (chuckles) I don't care. I don't give a shit. I have an awesome band, great songs—fuck it. And also, who cares? It's a little bar in the Square. I'm not playing Wembley Stadium. Even that feels very, very different. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's not as much riding on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no. I mean the only thing riding on it is that it's moving forward. All of these things are steps, you know what I mean, and that's what's important. You have to keep your eye on the prize. (pause) [00:33:31] Even the woman thing, I think I'm turning the corner. The science chick might come to the show tonight and even the yoga girl—if they want to fool around and hang out, that's cool, but that's all I can do. Unless I'm falling in love or genuinely into somebody, I'm kind of tired. I just want to be honest like, "Look, this is where I am in my life. I just want to be clear. As long as you don't expect anything, as long as we're just hanging out, it's fine." [00:34:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that's another place where one of the strands of what you get, one of the motivation to keep them around, is this constant proof of somebody wanting you; and if you don't need that quite as much, like you know you have a good band and you'll go out and do a kick-ass show, you don't have to have them around to prove that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I can have them around because it's fun. I do like them, but just be clear with them that I'm just not in a place where I can get serious and have expectations. If you're cool with that, cool. If not . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You realize you're going to be even more honest with that because if they're not cool with that and they're not there, then you're okay. Your self-esteem isn't dependent on people being there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's nice, but it's not all about that. (pause) [00:36:07] It is interesting, though, that the one thing that gives me tension headaches is there is that space of feeling like I'm kind of happy, do you know what I mean? I don't like the word, "happy". I don't like that word. I know you have moments of happiness, but I don't believe that you can just be a happy person. That kind of annoys me actually, just like you can't be sad every moment. I definitely feel like, "Wow. I feel so content in a way and I actually feel kind of empowered," but it's a big adrenalin rush, so that's making me feel a little like it's causing tension in a way because my body and my mind doesn't know what to do with that. Is that possible? [00:37:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Totally. I think also your mind has relied for so long on the inside/outside dichotomy and above thou and below thou dichotomy, where that's where in your culture, in your family . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that above thou/below thou?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Above thou/below thou. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that a saying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I'm just using being above/being below another person. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to name the next record . . . that's a great phrase. [00:37:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Above thou/below thou. I'll give you credit. I'll use a pseudonym for you. Wow, that's cool. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll be in pseudonym too, then. (laughs) That's then the way to make sense of the world and to structure your self-esteem. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything has come from the outside which, of course, is no way to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and being reliant on the external judge to tell you if you're good enough or not, so if you're shedding that extreme and saying, "I don't need that anymore," I think it can be really disconcerting. It's like that's been an armor that you've worn. It's protected you in a way to have the idealized other, who you strive for and hope for or want to win over, or want to look up to and be like one day . . . [00:38:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So now I think it's like my—like you can be with work, right? Send this pretty much like, "I love what you've written. This is excellent," blah, blah, blah. "Thanks." So even that's like—wow. That's it? I have this nice job and people are nice and they like what I do. I think my body is almost like what the fuck is happening? (both chuckle) (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can look at the idea of medication that would cure your ADHD and then change your life as a one-line of fantasy about hope for the future, that maybe one day you'll get there and everything will be different. To have that sort of dissolved as the thing that—maybe it helped a little bit—but that's it. It's like you're trying to live in a different way than striving for the idealized, hoped-for image on a pedestal. [00:39:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think all of it is really about being empowered, that a pill or some chick or your mom or your fucking boss or even a psychologist is not going to waive a wand or something. It's a simple thing, but it's not if you're someone that never had that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's simple and it's kind of scary. Even analysis, like a pill, you could be, "Okay, let's do this," but then what's it going to do? What's it not going to do? I think that's incredibly terrifying in a number of different ways here, the psycho farm appointment, kick-starter, approaching and committing to things that will now kind of bear out the fantasy hope. They're going to come to an end and then what? It's what else would drive you to do something besides striving for the idealized object on a pedestal—women, for example, the perfect woman who one day, somehow, some way, will fall into place. If that's a fantasy, then what? [00:41:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the thing with these chicks, too. I've done away with that now. Even when I think of Samantha or Michelle, now when I think of them I don't think that anymore. They're humans. Sometimes they sweat, you know what I mean? When I think of the nitty-gritty of what it is to be a human, I'm like, "Yeah, whatever." Everyone's got their weird quirks. When you really take time to look closely, everyone's got something that you could be repelled by. Except Cecelia—she's an amazing cat. </p>

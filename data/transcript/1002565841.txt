<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, good, pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just got a new car that actually runs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, what'd you get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, 2000 Grand Am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's a nice car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where'd you find it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I just got it from like, um, one of those places down on [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow, like one of those ma and pa places.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it runs pretty good, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many miles does it have on it, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think 11,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's low, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's see, uh, me and my boyfriend got back together and we're moving into my dad's house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are?  Both of you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, um, he finally got a DUI the other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, he did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, Friday.  [INAUDIBLE] all about that stuff.  Uh, yeah, apparently he was swerving and the cops pulled him over and he was right above the legal limit, but, so now he's suspended from work, yknow, FedEx driver.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So [INAUDIBLE] so he's suspended without pay until the 26th of June.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ooh, like a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then he can go back to work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With a restricted license?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It depends on if they want to give him a restricted license or they taken away or I don't know what they're going to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has he had a DUI before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is [INAUDIBLE] it won't be that bad.  Hopefully they'll give him some kind of restricted license.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we're moving in to help him with mortgage and all that good stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To help who?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With the mortgage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To help your parents?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, so that was interesting this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, have you started moving in already?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, I'm packing up the apartment.  That was a mess too.  We had a roommate that, uh, didn't pay me rent and that was ugly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she left.  So we're in that apartment by ourselves right now.  Work's going good though.  I just got off vacation.  Uh, a week, two weeks ago, I don't know.  Oh, yeah, um, that's why I took that vacation.  That whole, I had, um, ectopic pregnancy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's where your, um, well, not you, but where a woman's egg is stuck in her fallopian tube.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's dangerous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It was bad, and, um, I went in, I took a pregnancy test and three of them were positive.  So I wanted to know for sure if I was pregnant, so then I went to planned parenthood.  That was a bad idea cause I found out they use the same things that you do from like Safeway, yeah.  So I was like those are worthless.  So I had really, really bad cramps just on the left side, so it was like screw work, I'm going to the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the first time I went to the hospital they said that I might have an ectopic pregnancy and I did miscarry.  So that was, I think I was five weeks along right there they were saying.  Uh, and then a couple days later, um, it was, I was started to bleed and I couldn't even stand up, so I was at work and I just walked out of work.  Good thing I called my manager and explained on the way to the hospital.  And I went in there and I was up there for about 12 hours [INAUDIBLE].  I had ultrasounds and all kinds of, and then finally doctor, the gynecologist comes and tells me that, uh, we're not sure if it's ectopic but there's something, there's definitely something up there.  So at first they thought it was a cyst on a ovary, but then they're like, but you're having so much pain just on the left side that we want to, so there was a 50/50 chance that I had that.  So they wanted to do was they wanted to give me surgery and they shoved a camera in my bellybutton to see if it was in there.  And sure enough it was stuck in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was an ectopic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This was after you miscarried?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think this is, I don't know if this was because of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, you must not have miscarried if the pregnancy was still there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.  I don't know about all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they did laparoscopic surgery though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and then they, um, it only took like an hour to do and I was home that night.  So it wasn't that bad and I didn't have any, I didn't even have any stitches or anything.  But basically, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So did they have to remove your left tube now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The whole thing.  cause I was so, yeah, I guess it wasn't a miscarriage then, huh.  That I was so, it was just in the wrong spot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was six weeks along by then and they said they could have moved it if I had came in, yknow, earlier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, but, yeah, he said that I could just wait and see what happens.  And I said this hurts way too much.  Just go in there and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's dangerous.  Women die from ectopic pregnancies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it explodes.  He says it feels like getting shot in the abdomen.  I was like, um, you can go in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And also you're on medication that's not good to be on if you get pregnant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lamictal especially.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I heard that mom asked you if this would cause it and I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wouldn't cause an ectopic pregnancy, but Lamictal can cause birth defects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you using contraception?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I use, we use condoms though I'm not on birth control.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So some of your condoms don't always work then, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, apparently.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay, cause that's something we're going to have to talk about.  It's real important cause with Lamictal, like I said, it can cause significant birth defects sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, as soon as I stopped, as soon as I found out I was I stopped taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just in case I caught it early enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Did you go back on it then or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, about three days later the first time I went to the hospital they told me I could start taking my medication again cause either my baby [INAUDIBLE] or I miscarried.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's no chance of having a healthy baby, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  And, [PATIENT NAME], are you wanting to get pregnant again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not right now, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, cause if you were we'd probably have to take you off the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But if you're not, then we can stay on Lamictal and just make sure you use some kind of contraception that's effective so you don't get pregnant with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, okay.  Wow, so you went through quite an ordeal it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when was, when did all this happen?  When did they do the laparoscopy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Man, it had to been, trying to think of the date, had to be three weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	cause I had been back to work for a week on Sunday, so three weeks ago, cause it was the first part of my vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Which I was planning on taking vacation anyway, but I decided to take it three days early cause surgery kills you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, it's, yeah, it takes a while to bounce back from it.  So how are you doing, how are your spirits doing through all this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think [NAME OTHER] was more upset than me really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think he wanted a little kid really bad, not like too bad, but, yknow, he was okay with it, but then he's okay with not having it.  He just wasn't okay with the way that it happened, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So are you, have you gotten depressed or not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not like terribly depressed.  I think just like normal like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sadness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Um, have you been sleeping okay at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how's your appetite, is it normal or increased or decreased?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, obviously when I had that surgery it decreased for like a couple of, like a couple weeks though.  I'm just now getting it back so I'm just thinking it is because, um, all the messing around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, well, the hormonal changes too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How's your energy level, is it back to normal, are you still tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think I'm finally back to normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And do you feel like you're able to focus mentally okay and concentrate okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Have you been worrying about things excessively or more than usual or not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not the usual, not more than the usual stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, you got stuff going on, I'm sure you have some worries about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just moving and all that.  Okay.  And are you getting some joy out of just day to day activities, [PATIENT NAME], or do you feel like you're just going through the motions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I'm getting joy out of every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was thinking I've worked a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've been working a lot of shifts, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you had any suicidal thoughts at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I was drinking a couple nights ago and I was going to jump off the balcony but I just decided not to and just lay there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you trying to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I think it flashed through my mind for a second.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I was just drunk.  It wasn't even that high up.  We're on the first floor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, the first floor, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't drink as much anymore though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often are you drinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only, I'm going to say like once every two weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the only reason we drank that night was cause a really good friend, [NAME OTHER], moved back to Oklahoma and we were really like sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when you do drink, how much do you drink usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, I guess I have the tolerance of my father, so like usually I go past ten.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ten drinks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Shots.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ten shots, of what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Rum, vodka, all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you get pretty drunk then when you do drink?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, you do have to be careful cause you do have your dad's genes for alcoholism and so it could over time get the better of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Plus I shouldn't be mixing with pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's another big concern, yeah, because alcohol can interfere with the medicine and the alcohol can affect you differently because of the medicine.  Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I had another question.  Um, I read somewhere that, um, antidepression and, um, mood stabilizing pills, you can't take things like, uh, Nyquil or Tylenol PM with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tylenol PM or Nyquil with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like sleep aids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Antidepressants?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, some of the medicines that are mood stabilizers or, um, antidepressants can be sedating and so you have to be careful if you take more than one sedating medication because they can have additives, sedating and make you really tired.  But, no, there are people that take, uh, Nyquil or Tylenol PM with sleep, or with antidepressants or mood stabilizers.  That's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where did you read that, do you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I read something on the back of it that said if you're taking pills that involve depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they may be talking about MAOIs, it's a specific kind of antidepressant, you're not taking, that can interact with other over the counter medicines and those prescriptions.  It can be real dangerous, but you're not on that kind of antidepressant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  Um, so, um, so you're going through a lot right now, but it sounds like you're handling it okay.  Do you feel like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really feel like I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am, that's not right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And so how many hours are you working a week now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, last week I did only like 45 to 50, and then it slowed down now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's slowing down, what was it before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, I'm slowing down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, from 45 or 50?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, this is my weekend so I go by like from Wednesday to Wednesday, so it's just that, yeah, somebody else is on vacation right now, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you still like working there okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it bothers me sometimes like any regular job, but I feel like I'm a Conoco pro.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you've been there for how long now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, four years I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you the manager now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm assistant still.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Assistant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They offered me the manager and I said, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Too much pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too much pressure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would it be more money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I think it'd be salary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have this one thing where you can be a manager in training.  I might do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can become—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But never become manager.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So what kind of pressure is there if you become manager?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just like, um, just like, uh, let's see, the other day we had like a shortage in cash.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if, uh, you can't focus the shortage on one of the employees it goes on the manager.  So basically, um, everything goes on the manager.  Yknow, if something's short, something's too over, or, um, you give the wrong advice to your employees, it's all your fault really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I can't take that much, um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fault cause I'm not very professional.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So rather just not deal with that, let someone else deal with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely not a leader.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how'd you come about moving back in with your folks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow, I'm kind of excited because it's a comfortable place for me, yknow.  I mean, it had bad memories but like it's, I don't know, it's just comfortable I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's going to be weird having him there too, but, and it's weird that my parents don't talk to each other.  But [NAME OTHER] there so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you'll be okay.  Now are you thinking about this for short term like a few months or long term like a year or two or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, we were, at first we were going to stay there until they sold the house in August but now that he had all this DUI stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's house is selling in August?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My dad's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they're going to sell the house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I say my dad's because my mom is never there.  She lives out of her car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She doesn't like sleep in the car and stuff but she's never home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And they're selling their house in August then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, that's what they were originally going to do so were just going to stay there for two or three months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But now that my dad isn't making money anymore, he was trying to convince his mom, my grandma, to move in there and pay the mortgage for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did your dad quit his job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he's just on suspension and he doesn't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, your dad's on suspension?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's he on suspension for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The DUI thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I thought that was your boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, no, no, that was my dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I misunderstood, I misunderstood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"I'm sorry.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.  I thought, I misunderstood, I thought it was your boyfriend.  Okay, now I get it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope, that was my dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, okay.  I was wondering why—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so I guess your dad's not working now.  So you'll be paying rent while you're there too then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's only charging me $300 because he knows that I don't make that much, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you'll stay there maybe for a few months and then just kind of see what happens?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, now I understand.  Okay.  So anything else going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a lot going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get all mixed up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Anything else, [PATIENT NAME], going on that I haven't asked you about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you're back on your medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lamictal and the Lexapro, okay.  And you're doing okay with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  No side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not that I can think of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I probably need, cause those Lexapro samples only have like 20 in a pack.  Those Lamictal ones have like 300.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I ran out of those, I ran out of Lexapro really faster.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And they're not giving me very many Lamictal samples either is the problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see what I've got.  You're taking—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there any like generic ones I can go pick up at Wal Mart or something that's the same?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet that I'm aware of.  I haven't heard of it going generic yet.  And I don't know when it will be going generic.  But if it does, that'll help a lot.  Um, I'm thinking is there anything else that is generic that's similar.  There really isn't that I'm aware of so we're kind of stuck for the time being.  Let me see what I've got back here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I have them with me so I can see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought [INAUDIBLE] at least 15 days in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let me see what I have.  Let's see, that'd be one, two, and a half, so five weeks worth of Lamictal.  And that's all I've got left.  You can sure have them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then with the Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This will definitely get me through it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And there's enough for [INAUDIBLE] Lexapro, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Great.  I think I only have like ten left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Oh, you're still taking one and a half of the Lexapro or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two of these at 10 mg, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Taking two, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then 100 mg of these, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, 100, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, I get all worried cause I have at least, yknow, six or seven days left, but I get all worried when I have a low supply.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you don't want to run out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and the other thing I found out, now you still have some insurance, right?  Just doesn't pay very well for medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, all it has, actually I think I have it.  If you can tell me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All it gives me is like a discount, yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can only use it.  I found it in a box last night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, it's really good for like, um, when I go see my gynecologist, it's only 10 bucks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.  It just doesn't have great prescription coverage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause I did just find out about a program that if you don't have any insurance, um, not really, don't have, it says no drug coverage, so if you have some, even if it's bad, they won't help.  Unfortunately.  Let me see also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] oh, here it is, prescription card.  Discount only, not insurance.  So it basically gives me like, it's basically a coupon for prescription pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, cause I've also got these coupons for Lamictal where you can get 35 dollars off a starter kit.  But I don't know how much it would cost for a starter kit.  Because if I, my concern is if I don't get enough samples, they don't give me many these days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if that happens we can look into this as an option too, see.  Um, again I don't know how much it would cost you.  But at least it would be 35 dollars less with this.  So we've got some options [INAUDIBLE] okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Anything else going on that we didn't talk about that you wanted to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no, I think everything else is okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  All right.  Well, why don't we, um, gosh, [INAUDIBLE] six months this time.  It's hard to believe but I guess it has been.  Do you want to go that long again for your next appointment or do you want to check in sooner?  What do you feel comfortable with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't mind checking in sooner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You want to do three months this time or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think three would be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let's see, this is May, June, July, August maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now remind me what's your work schedule, what's your day off or days off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never know.  But usually when you give me the card then the next day then I would go and I would just write that I need a day off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just so happens that I have today off [INAUDIBLE] come in today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, that worked out well then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that never happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And do you want to do a morning or afternoon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I prefer an afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you do something like [DATE] at one thirty is an option?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [DATE] at one thirty.  All right, good.  And you can just call me, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Well, good luck with the move.  Hope all goes smoothly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying to really pack really organized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tried, I'm such a neat freak sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, moving is always a little stressful just because there's so much involved.  I hope it'll go well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my parents' house is right down the street.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that'll make it easier then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] take care of yourself okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See you in August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, bye—bye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Enjoy your summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks, you too.</p>

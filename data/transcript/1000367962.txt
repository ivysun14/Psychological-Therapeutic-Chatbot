<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (14-minute silence) I think I'm trying to decide which makes me feel more uncomfortable: not saying what's on my mind or saying it.  (Silence) When I got home last night I hadn't meant to say anything to MSCZ about what I talked about and then just suddenly it was almost as if I had to have his approval or re—, be reassured by him or something, I just mentioned that I talked about the fact that I need to control what happens when we're having intercourse or at least to some extent control it.  And he, he said, or somehow anyway he ended up asking me if I mentioned the fact that almost always I have to be on top.  And it hadn't occurred to me before, at least I wasn't aware of suppressing it yesterday.  And it just, when he asked me that, it just horrified me to think I might say that here, have to say it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, just any of the details, I guess, are just very hard to say.  And it seems like I can only handle one at a time and I have to build myself up to mentioning it.  I, I, it's almost like in the end, by talking about it specifically, you could be there in the room.  And that's a horrifying thought to me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: This is what you meant, then, by moving or not moving, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Because I had wondered about that at the time.  Is there something especially horrifying to you about the idea of your being on top?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Perhaps because I realize that, well, I don't know exactly but it does seem to be the place where the man should be in a way.  And so it makes me feel unnatural that that's where I am.  (Pause) Because there's, I think almost — well, I don't know whether it has anything to do with wherever I am but there is something that I've always tried to pretend I didn't feel, but a curiosity about how I must look and I suppose MSCZ too but more me, whenever we're having intercourse.  And I don't know quite why I have that curiosity.  (Pause) And I was thinking just a minute ago, too, about this reaction I have to the position and of just having intercourse, whatever the position is.  And having always wondered how actors and actresses can even pretend to be in that position and have everybody see, it just, even if it's just acting it always seemed awful to me.</p>

<p>And I also thought of something else I've done occasionally.  And I don't know if this has anything to do with how I now feel about it but when I knew what essentially intercourse involved and realized that my parents obviously had had it, I couldn't, since they had nothing to do with, they seemed to have no physical contact with each other or if they did they seemed to be sort of embarrassed about it, I just couldn't imagine them being close enough to have any kind of relationship like that.  And so I used to try to imagine them having intercourse and I couldn't.  And it bothered me that I was trying to imagine them that way.  It seemed something dirty about it or wrong, anyway.  (Pause) And I think of the closed door, their closed door too, in terms of this.  Just sort of, I think of the closed door and I don't know quite why.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you imagine them, try to imagine them, them having intercourse, who's on top?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know (laughs).  I —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You're afraid to become that specific?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, to myself even.  (Pause) Or perhaps, too, I'm sort of confused about it because I can think of reasons for having my mother on top and reasons for having my father.  It's almost l—, like I can understand my mother feeling something enough so that she would want to have intercourse and then it would be a case of my father's accepting it or tolerating it and therefore he'd be on the bottom.  And that's how I feel if I'm on the bottom, that I'm just sort of letting it happen to me.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And it just occurred to me that, aside from what my father is, I don't think I want to think that he could want to have intercourse.  And I accept my mother's wanting to but I somehow like the fact that it comes easily to think that my father wouldn't.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I was thinking again about not wanting to be specific, when I'm here, about MSCZ and my having intercourse.  And I even find, to some extent, I don't know, this is kind of a vague feeling I have in my mind, but it seems to me I often avoid sort of admitting the specific things right to MSCZ while we're having intercourse or talking about it.  Or I just somehow want to have things happen and then forget them.  (Pause) I suppose it's paralleled in the fact that very often I just want to keep my eyes closed the whole time.  And it's almost then like I won't know what's going on.  (Pause) And it almost seems, too, that when I'm having the struggle of feeling something and then feeling myself not allowing that feeling, I'm just trying to separate my awareness from feeling involved in what's happening.  And it's sort of, my self is one thing and my body and what's happening to it is something else.  And if I keep my eyes closed then I can keep that separation possible.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I'm finding all this very hard to think about and I keep finding my mind going back to just things that happened today at school.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you don't say them.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it's almost like they're things that can make me feel good.</p>

<p>ANALYST: The other thing I noticed when you said that, uhm, — did you notice that you said you feel your mind, sort of as though you and your mind are as separate as you and your body are?  You, you mentioned a while ago that you felt, you tried to keep yourself and your body separate.  But you sometimes talk about your mind or your — and in the same way as your body, like it's somehow independent of you too.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think since I've been coming here I realize that it is independent of a certain control from me but I'm not sure what I think I am when I say my mind is something, my body is something, and I am something.  But I think I used to feel that I was just simply a mind and a body.  And a part of my mind was self-control or it was the mind exercising control over thoughts.  I don't know, it just seemed much more simple than it does now.  (Pause) And I'd simplified it then, too, so that, I don't know, every time I think about it it just seems everything broke down to, my body was ugly and bad and evil and clumsy and so forth.  And if I worked on my mind, then my mind could be the good part.  And it was the area where I could achieve, although I never, I had to work at it so I never felt sincerely that it was particularly good. (Pause)</p>

<p>And the things I liked about sports was having the discipline of it, which meant my mind was telling my body what to do.  And if my body obeyed then I could play well.  (2-minute silence) And I think, before if I said, "I"  or "Myself"  or anything I meant my mind and everything I put into what my mind was.  (Pause) But now I don't know what I use and what I mean when I say "I."  (Clears throat) Because I'm, I know now I separate self-control, in a way, out of whatever I might mean by my mind.  Because it seems just much more of an emotional thing now.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I just began thinking about (clears throat) school again and how, since I've gone back, I've had almost no desire to control the children and making them be quiet and make them sort of march along and all that kind of thing.  And yet somehow I feel I should be doing it.  (Pause) And when they're being chaotic and noisy, especially if it's in the middle of something we're doing together, I can't judge whether it's, it's a good thing of noise and they're learning and (clears throat) they're communicating because of something that stimulated them in what we've done or that they're just being silly.  And this insecurity about it makes me want to just make them be quiet.  (Clears throat, pause) It made me think it's almost like myself making myself be quiet because I wasn't sure that if I said anything or did anything it would be worthwhile or not silly.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) Well, our time's up.</p>

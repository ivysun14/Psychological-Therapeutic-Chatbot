<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So.  I, let's see.  You were, when were you in the hospital?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About a month ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About a month ago.  And I have not seen you here since then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's time for, it's Haldol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's time for the shot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, I'm trying to make sure I, um, let's see.  [DATE].  Oh, and by the way, I has, I hospitalize now at [DEIDENTIFIED], not [DEIDENTIFIED].  So if you go to [DEIDENTIFIED], you won't get me.  But if you go to [DEIDENTIFIED] you do get me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  Um, um, you were hospitalized, oh, okay.  I saw you since then, in May.  And, um, I, you did come to the office, didn't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Since then.  Okay.  How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm okay.  I just have a lot of voices that are driving me nuts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I can't sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are they saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They want me to kill myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how are you fighting that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Trying to ignore it the best I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And good are you, how are you, how successful are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have not come close to trying to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you keeping busy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, what are you doing to keep busy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Working out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yeah.  Have you lost a lot of weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like how much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 130 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, in how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In about six months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's too fast.  Are you eating anything at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I'm eating, I'm just working out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much are you working out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least two hours a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wonder if that's partly what's making this worse.  Are you drinking enough fluid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's a very short period of time to lose that much weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's concerning to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was 300 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, I'm afraid that that much exercise is making it, it might be making it worse for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Should I cut down?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would say you don't need to lose a lot more weight, anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What else do you do?  Are you busy with your children?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  My kids are all moved out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So are you alone a lot of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what, oh.  Okay.  What else do you do?  Do you have any crafts or hobbies?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so the voices are just there all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  They're just real loud now and it's affecting my sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The voices are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're loud and affecting your sleep.  They're not, are you currently wanting to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you, are you intending upon doing so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Do you want to, or the voices are just telling you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The voices are telling me to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't want to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the voices are really loud and you can't sleep now.  All right.  Uh, what is your mood like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mood's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And sleep is poor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because of the voices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, your appetite?  What do you eat in a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I eat three meals a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like what do you eat each meal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like in the morning I eat cereal.  Then at lunch I'll eat a hamburger, some fries.  Then dinner we'll fix chicken or soup or stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you are eating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you throwing up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not making yourself throw up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're not skipping meals?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I eat when I'm hungry.  If I'm not hungry, I don't eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how many time do you eat three meals a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What's your energy level like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's okay.  Not too much energy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so, okay.  Not excessive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, concentration's probably not very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you do when you're exercising?  Do you listen to the TV or the radio or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, a lot of people will use an iPod or an MP3 player to try to drown out the voices.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I do, I got one of those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need, you need to listen to music or watch TV or something while you're exercising.  Otherwise you're in your head.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about racing thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that the voices or other things, too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other thing, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, what is, what is that primarily, then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My girls being pregnant and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Both of them are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When are they due?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One's due [DATE], one's due [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And who are they living with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Their boyfriends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, are you having crying spells?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I just cry.  I wake up and I've been having a lot of, uh, panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about worthless feelings or hopeless feelings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of panic attacks.  What does that mean to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't sit still.  I'm running everywhere.  Moving excessively.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So having excess anxiety with, uh, excess movement.  Okay.  Like you just, you can't keep yourself still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because?  Do you know why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, it, is it a need to move your legs or they kind of almost hurt, or is it that you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They move on their own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are trying to outrun the voices?  Okay.  So you're shaky.  Um, so it could be the akathisia, akathisia, which is a side effect of the medicine.  You're taking the Cogentin 2 mg twice a day.  Are you taking all your medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  I need scripts for all of them —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't have no refills on them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think we need to add, maybe, some Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you been on that before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was, it, over sedating for you, wasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You could give me some Seroquel for at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, because you're on the Risperdal.  The, um, what I was, okay.  Are you worrying a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most, is that, okay.  Are you going to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What, what I think we should do is stop the mouth Haldol, the pill, increase the shot, um, and add some, and Ativan helped you in the hospital, didn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did it make you too sleepy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll add Ativan.  Do you know the date?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what is your husband doing right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Working.  He's laid off, but he's got a side job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, you're not paranoid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're not going to kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what I'm going to do is stop the by mouth Haldol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can write it down.  Oh, you need a prescription, so you'll just take what I give you, then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We're going to add, uh, Ativan, um.  Is it hard, would it be hard to take a pill three times a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm afraid to get you too sleepy, so I'm going to do 0.5 mg three times a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then increase the Haldol Decanoate, the shot, to 200 mg a month.  And then we're going to continue Cymbalta, which I need to think about some more over time.  And the Risperdal, which is down from what it was.  Um, and the Cogentin.  And the BuSpar.  The Restoril is only 15?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's increase the Trazodone.  Which one helps the most?  The Trazodone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's increase the Trazodone.  And the Restoril, leave at 15.  And then, um, so we'll increase the Trazodone to, but you're not driving after you take your medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I'm in bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  To 200 mg at bedtime.  And you want to come back like, see, in one month I won't be here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Today's what?  The [DATE]?  Yeah.  I'll be away.  So we'd probably be better off giving you your shot early rather than late.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So let's say come back in three weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, um, let's see here.  So, oh.  I wrote you, I did increase.  Did I increase the Trazodone to 300?  Oh, I already in.  Oh, we stopped the Restoril.  Oh, shoot.  I already did give you a higher dose of Haldol.  The Trazodone is at 300.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we'll continue that.  And then we'll just add the Restoril back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Restart the Restoril.  So today is the [DATE].  The Trazodone you have refills on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Haldol D, I'd better write that.  And Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got some Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  Risperdal.  2 mg, you take one in the morning and two at night, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Cogentin.  And BuSpar.  And then we're going to add the Ativan and, uh, the Restoril, we're going to add that back.  Just, we'll start at 15 mg, because you'll take an Ativan, probably, at bedtime, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, let me get my prescription sheet.  Um, let's see here.  Um, let's do the Ativan.  You're not taking, uh, medicines from anybody else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  There's.  Okay.  So Restoril, Ativan.  BuSpar, Cogentin, Risperdal and Haldol D.  Do you, would you like me to write these down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think I should, maybe, too.  Um, let's see here.  Risperdal, 2 mg, one in the morning and two at bedtime.  Are you sure you're getting your medicine right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does you husband help you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And has he talked lately about being concerned you were over medicated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel sedated or over medicated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Haldol D.  So all right.  Let me write this down for both of you.  Today is the [DATE].  We're going to Haldol D, which is the shot, 200 mg per month.  We're doing the Risperdal, two mg am, four mg PM.  We're doing the Cymbalta.  Do you take that in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, 60 mg in the morning.  Cogentin, 2 mg two times a day.  The Nadolol.  Did we?  You're on that, too, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I forgot to write that.  Okay.  Nadolol.  20 mg twice a day.  I've got to write that script, a prescription for that, I think, don't I?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You're going to have some strange prescriptions, here.  You have Trazodone, oh, I wrote it last time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Trazodone, 300 mg at bedtime.  Restoril, 15 mg at pm, is bedtime, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, BuSpar, 30 mg two times per day.  Okay.  Let's see.  BuSpar, Restoril.  Trazodone.  Nadolol.  Uh, Cogentin.  Risperdal, Cymbalta, Haldol D.  Okay.  So I need to, and then the At, oh, Ativan.  0.5 mg three times per day.  Let's see if we got them all.  Um, huh.  Let's see, and then, I've got to do that [INAUDIBLE].  20 mg.  [INAUDIBLE].  Let's see.  I've got here, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  And I've got here one.  Well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't need the Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I'm just trying to make sure, let's see.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Oh, it is eight.  Wait, oh, and then I, wait.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Okay.  So this should be right.  Let me write your Nadolol prescription, then I'll give you your shot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So now you're at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just for the hospitalizing, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This office has not changed.  You know where it is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I can hardly tell you, because I've gotten lost a few times trying to get over there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My husband probably does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  He probably does, or.  All right.  Here's the Nadolol for the tremor.  Risperdal, BuSpar, Cogentin, the Haldol D.  You have Cymbalta.  Here's the Restoril and the Ativan.  And you have Trazodone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Okay.  Nine everywhere.  Um, I have to get a, um, syringe.  So, um, hang tight just a second.  I'll be right back.  Okay.  This is for you.  And this is for my box.  [INAUDIBLE].  What bothers you the most about your daughters?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're young and they not, they not knowing what to expect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yeah.  Are you, um, worried, yourself, about being a —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Grandma?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Grandmother?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?  Well, we've got to get you straightened up so you can help them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, [INAUDIBLE].  Um, okay.  This is new.  So we're good for today, but we'll need to get that script for next time.  Um, this is the only one I've got for you in here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, [INAUDIBLE].  Okay.  Um, okay.  Da—ti—da—ti—da.  Now, since you're on tape and we're doing this thing, you can't scream when I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I won't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tuck the needle in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm just teasing.  We, we wouldn't, we wouldn't want them to think that we can talk but I can't give you your shot well.  You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Scared to think that, if you don't mind.  I'm just teasing.  Okay.  So we're going to do 2, 2 ccs, which will give us 200 mg instead of 150, which I think is what we did last time.  Now, I think that part of the problem is you don't have the girls around all the time.  Your role has been changed now, hasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's been pretty stressful for you, I think.  You've been a mom a long, long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you've got to get out and do some things, too, besides just exercising.  And you cannot overdo it because that's not going to be good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you've got to be make sure you eat enough and drink, what about fluids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm drinking a lot of fluids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of exercise are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Weight lifting and stuff like that with weights.  Riding a bike.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, I don't see how you could possibly have lost that much weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean that sounds a little dangerous to me.  Um, you okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When was the last time you, well, in the hospital I guess you had a physical, didn't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  And was there any trouble driving down here or anything today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Golly.  No blood, even.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Do you have any, um, okay.  So there's enough in here maybe for one more, but if you can get the refill and bring it with you, that would be probably the best idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any, any, um, questions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I want to thank you for, um, doing the, um, this research with us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And um, um, I'm going to turn the tape off now.</p>

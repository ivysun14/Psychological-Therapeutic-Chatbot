<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, so how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Anything new since we met last month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Things cruising along pretty smoothly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  School year's winding down.  You doing okay with school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I could be doing better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Struggling in some classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you passing all your classes or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not all of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many are you not passing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And which two are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Math and Bible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Math and Bible?  And do you know if you have enough time left in the semester to get passing grades or is it too late?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I could, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Still hope to pull them out then?  Okay.  And you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, wait, no.  I mean, I don't have my project or, no, I made a 94 on it.  So it should be bring it up to like C something probably.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And that's in Bible?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're already hopefully at a passing level.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are you getting your homework turned in in your classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  All of it?  Most of it?  Some of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, most of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And the ones you haven't all got turned in, will they at least give you at least partial credit if you turn it in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which classes are those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	History and, but I have an A- in history right now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What have you turned in late?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, I, I can't think of anything I've turned in late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you're doing pretty well keeping up—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like.  Okay.  And how's your mood doing overall?  Have you been feeling up or down or somewhere in the middle or do you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And have you been having a lot of ups and downs in your mood or has it been fairly stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sort of ups and downs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And I can't remember if I asked you this question in this way before, but, [PATIENT NAME], if there was scale that ran from plus 10 to minus 10, where plus 10 is the happiest you've ever felt and minus 10's the saddest and zero's just sort of neutral, where would you put the range of your mood on that scale?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Plus two?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that average or is that highest or lowest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it, does it stay at plus two all the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it goes up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what's the highest it goes to usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Plus five.  And what's the lowest it'll go to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Zero.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Zero.  Okay.  So from neutral to feeling pretty good?  Okay.  So plus five to zero.  Okay.  And have you been sleeping well at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No trouble getting to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't been waking up at all or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  Okay.  And how's your appetite been after eating three cheeseburgers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Veracious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Real hungry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Has it increased since we increased the Abilify do you think or is it just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's growing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It looks like it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's growing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did a growth spurt.  Okay.  How's your energy level during the day?  Is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's, it's on the lower side probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel tired all day long or do you feel pretty good in the morning, but wear out as the day goes on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, I'm more tired in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you first wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then once you get going, does your energy level pick up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And is it at an okay level then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's at an okay level.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And does it stay okay throughout the school day and then does it continue into the evening or does it sort of drop off in the evenings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It drops off in the evenings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's pretty common.  Um, are you able to focus pretty well and stay on task at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about when you have homework after school?  Are you able to focus then or is it difficult?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I finish all my homework and so I'm, it's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay.  Have you noticed yourself feeling irritable and getting easily upset lately or not too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, kind of irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Little bit at times?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you, have you noticed some irritability too?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think since I went off my medicine like once 'cause I forgot to take it or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You forgot to take it what?  One day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's, he's, I think he's overall been less irritable since he stopped the Focalin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was my next question.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably just 'cause I went off my medicine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Focalin you mean or the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You forgot it for how, how many days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And when was that?  Was that this week or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And when you forgot it for a couple of days, did you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The next morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  When you forgot it for a couple of days, did you notice yourself feeling more irritable on those days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you or are you just listening to me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I get, I don't know.  I think I was less patient.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's true.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's good, that's good awareness.  You're observing yourself.  Have you been feeling nervous or anxious much?  Okay.  Have you been enjoying yourself at school or when you're with friends?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Um, what have you been doing for fun?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Rock climbing, rock climbing, rock climbing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At school or outside school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Outside school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At a gym or actually on actual rocks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Both.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And where do you climb?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going actually this weekend to [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're doing technical climbing with ropes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I also do ice climbing [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have to have a permit to do that or are there places you can go without a permit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In cert, yeah, most of the places you don't have to have a permit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And do you have like a, an instructor or somebody you go with?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's got some real good people he's climbing with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, and then the next week I'm going up [DEIDENTIFIED] with [INAUDIBLE] and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.  Do you ever go watch him climb or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Overnight.  I watch him climb at the gym.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I, I can't do this, this weekend—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But, no, they, I mean when they went ice climbing, they like trekked back quite a ways.  I'm like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And they were, I'm like, oh, my gosh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What have I done to this kid?  But, yeah, the overnights can be interesting.  So he's going with [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So they do, apparently, they're internationally known for training—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Climbers.  So, um, he's probably one of the youngest ones, but they, um, they climb, there, there's a, there is a climbing network in it.  It's a real network.  People, you know, people know and they, like the guy who's taking them this weekend and next week talked to the guy who took them ice climbing.  And, um, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds like fun.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They're going to do an overnight and they're going to go up the way, who, who—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know what that is even.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know where there's like a, uh, a valley in the middle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll explain it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you know where [DEIDENTIFIED] is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's in the right, it's on the right side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	North face [INAUDIBLE] in the bottomless pit which is, you know, where kind of like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know where the bottomless pit is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know where that is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we're going up the north face of that side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Holy smokes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To the top.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  I don't know anybody that's done that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nobody's that one of your patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Patients, friends.  I've lived here my whole life.  I never even heard of that being done even before.  So that's pretty wild.  Well, good.  Well, have a good time.  It's very safe.  You're all tied down.  You got somebody—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep an eye on him.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	People lay—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] each other.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] people.  I mean he, he didn't [INAUDIBLE] the 250 pound Air Force football player the other day, but [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's probably good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that sounds really cool, [PATIENT NAME].  That's really neat.  Excellent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good energy outlet for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a very good way for him to learn how to stay organized and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And focused?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Focused.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, safe and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always focus when I'm climbing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always focus when I'm climbing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, you have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you really have to.  It's very important.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Why don't you try that at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  That sounds like a, that sounds really cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now we're going out to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Well, we might be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know, whatever you do.  He's just learning the skill set with a pro.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.  Now what about, um, did you notice any difference since we adjusted the Abilify dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's not much of a change.  So I didn't know if you would.  Did you notice any real difference?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean after [INAUDIBLE] since I went off the Focalin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's probably why too.  Probably from going off the Focalin.  It was probably suppressing that a little bit.  Okay.  Any side effects from the Abilify that you can tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And, [NAME OTHER], are you aware of any problems with the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's working like a charm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Yeah, [PATIENT NAME], if you kept feeling just the way you have lately for the next year or two, would you be pretty happy with the way things are going right now or do you feel like there still needs to be some changes or adjustments?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And, [NAME OTHER], what's your feeling about that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What about your irritability level?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I changed that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And what kind of things will get you upset or angry?  What kinds of things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm, chores.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just don't like to do chores?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you like to do chores?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not particularly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't either.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't blame you, [PATIENT NAME], a bit.  Most of us don't really enjoy them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been better though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You have been better.  You, you have been better.  He worked out some sort of deal with [NAME OTHER].  I don't know what it is, but and he kind of held it together for four days and then it kind of, kind of fell apart.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still working on it.  Building.  Things like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I haven't blown it this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So I guess one of the, oh, and, are you aware of any problems with the Abilify, did you say, [NAME OTHER]?  No, no side effects, okay.  And I guess what would the side effects be?  Any muscle stiffness or soreness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No tremors, shakiness—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In your hands?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Steady?  Dry mouth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More than any of us have in this dry climate?  Okay.  Um, you don't feel sleepy or groggy during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Little bit of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Little bit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's mostly feel groggy sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you feel, when you take the Abilify, do you feel like you're not taking any medicine at all or do you feel like you can feel the effects of the medicine?  Do you know what I mean by that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like it has an impact kind of?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Some people can take medicine, they say they don't, they don't feel any difference at all.  They don't feel like the medicine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't feel any different except I'm kind of, uh, I feel kind of fatigued a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little fatigued.  Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really don't get enough sleep.  So that could be the case also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could, [PATIENT NAME].  That could be another factor.  Okay.  What about stresses right now?  Any major things that are stressful to you or are weighing on you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [NAME OTHER], are you aware of any stressors right now?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I'm, I'm stressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he should be stressing his grades, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	His math grade.  But, no, he's, I think things have settled down more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you think so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Whoa, excuse me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it sounds like overall, things are going pretty well.  The one remaining symptom that's a little bit troublesome is the irritability, but it's getting better overall.  It's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I think it could be a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still has a little ways to go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now the other thing about that is that, the medicine may not 100 percent take that away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In other words it may help, but it may also be some learning in terms of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Learning to not let some things get under your skin or bother you or be as irritating to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In other words, what I mean by that, [PATIENT NAME], is we all get upset with some things in life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes you just got to to kind of deal with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly, but we have to learn how to deal with them, you know?  Um, I might get upset with an insurance company that I have to call 10 times or a pharmacy that I have to repeatedly call 'cause they mistakes, something like that, but if I get angry and upset about it, then it'll interfere with my day at the office.  So I have to learn how to deal with that so it doesn't get me upset.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And doing chores is a nuisance and a pain sometimes when you want to be out doing other things, climbing, or maybe just doing something fun and yet you still got to get the chores done or you can't go out and do the climbing.  So if you can keep working on and maybe you're doing this with [NAME OTHER] already, how you deal with those irritations and frustrations over time, they don't bother you so much and you can just enjoy life more.  So what I was going to suggest if you're okay with this, is maybe we stay at this dose of Abilify for a little while longer, maybe another month or so at least and just kind of see how things go.  Especially going into summer as the stress level goes down, we'll see if that also reduces some of your ability, irritability.  If it doesn't, we still do have the option of going up a little bit more on the Abilify, but we also run the risk of increase in side effects particularly fatigue.  So I want to be careful—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not to overdo it.  So does that sound okay with you, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, [NAME OTHER], you're okay if we leave it for—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Another month or so?  Okay.  Do you know when school's over, [PATIENT NAME], for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE]?  'Cause what I was going to suggest we might do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm correct, mom?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is get together like after you've been out of school for a couple of weeks or something this time just to see how thing are going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any plans to go anywhere in the early part of the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Outward bound.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not in the early part of the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.  Oh, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'll be cool.  Where you going to go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.  That'll be really cool.  Everybody I've ever talked to who's done that loves it.  It's like one of the most, some people say it's one of the best things they've ever done in my whole life even.  So I'll be interested to talk to you when you get back to see what you think.  Especially with all your climbing experience now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people would be freaking out doing stuff and for you'll, it'll be just a piece of cake, you know?  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, I guess you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we do get out [DATE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When you get out.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what if we were to get together like, you know, roughly two weeks after that.  Let's see where that would put us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I was going to say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE].  Two weeks will be [DATE] or around there somewhere.  Would that work for you, [NAME OTHER], do you think?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Excuse me, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Actually, we may not be able to do the [DATE], but somewhere around there.  Do you know your schedule that far out, [NAME OTHER], or does it change?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I can make, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If I'm able, he's going to have summer school in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So an afternoon time—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is best like, um, well, let's throw out some possibilities.  We could do the [DATE] actually at like one thirty would be one option.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, is that a good time or do you want me to give you some others?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That day's probably good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's probably fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Would you like an appointment card also?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let me check on refills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Refills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Refills we did six months' worth last month.  So we're good for a while.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's [INAUDIBLE].  Right now I've just been using up the 2 mg—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] we'll get through this.  I haven't filled the other prescription—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yet.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you have trouble or can't find it, just, we can always call it in for you if you need me to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now it's cooler in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's getting cooler finally, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It says 77.9 now.  So, so, [PATIENT NAME], overall, what, the feeling I'm getting is that overtime, you're doing a lot better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER], would you agree with that?  That over time over the months, he's doing much better?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still have a ways to go, but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I, yeah, I think he's doing better.  I think he's buckling, I mean you have been buckling down on your—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Schoolwork.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Schoolwork.  You're very capable of doing it.  It's just whether you want to do it.  Whether you choose to do it or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, [PATIENT NAME], what grade are you in now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Seventh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seventh, yeah.  I'm just thinking, you know, I see a lot of kids make that transition from middle school to high school and the kids that kind of get their study habits down in middle school have such an easier time in high school, uh, because they've already got those habits formed.  The kids that struggle in school, never get good study habits, they really struggle in high school and then they have a lot fewer options on, you know, after high school.  So I'm glad you're working on this now because I think if you keep working on it and really buckle down and get some good study habits, high school will be so much easier for you and then you'll have a lot of choices when you get done with high school.  So keep up the good work, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Good.  All right.  Well, be safe this weekend and have fun, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, thanks, [NAME OTHER].  Sure.  Yeah, it should be perfect weather weekend for climbing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's been really hot too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It should be like oh, my gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mom, here you go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, no, what is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The keys.  It's the mailbox key.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Take it easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	See you later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Bye bye.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like a good person [inaudible at 00:00:04] usually pretty (ph) good rate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well admission (ph) was 50 bucks an hour, which I mean that's not—right? And supposedly my transportation costs—got it down to a dollar I think? Okay? yeah hold on to the same states.</p>

<p>But yeah, it would be nice, especially because there's a chance I could be able to make it, not a lot, but it would be nice to be able to do that. So that's, cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. (Pause) Sorry it's a little nippy in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh it's fine. It's fine. Oh gosh. So speaking of finance for really good things—I wanted to talk to you about something that I'm really frustrated about and I'm trying to figure out exactly how it goes off this.</p>

<p>On Tuesdays, my husband and I are both seeing our perspective therapists about the same time. You know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I mentioned to you that just in general, go smoother if he gets out the door at the same time as I do because he just to leave opportunity of problems happening, and then him not going to work. [00:01:12]</p>

<p>Well he has been struggling a lot with this and is talking with his therapist. And his therapist wants him to enter this agreement where he calls in from work, every morning by 9:00 A.M. And for every day that he doesn't, he has to write a check to charity for 20 bucks. And he has to do this.</p>

<p>And I'm kind of frustrated about this. And I'm trying to figure out whether I should really get myself involved, because that doesn't actually affect him. It affects me. I am the person who has whatever there is shortcomings in our budget, has to work harder to do it. And so I think that it is just going to cause strife, and I wanted to find out if it is reasonable to intercede on this? [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Yeah the—</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's concerned that if he says that, he sounds like he's trying to make excuses. (Pause) so he's concerned with that. For example if for some reason—part of this potential contract would be that if he doesn't do this, because he has to do something to take care of me, I would specifically see that that's what it was and not him, so he doesn't lie about it.</p>

<p>And so he's concerned that if he says oh, it's actually going make this even more of a hassle for my wife than for me, because she's the one that's going to have to figure out how to make the money to make up the gap?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have no problems with giving to charity. It's not that. It's just that we're losing what—a thousand dollars a month right now. And so, is it unreasonable for me to independently say that this is actually a really bad idea?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's quite reasonable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite reasonable and (pause) I'm sure they can find something—</p>

<p>CLIENT: He can even donate his time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Productive. [00:03:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean have to do an hour or two hours for every time he doesn't go to work, volunteering at a charity. I don't mind that. But it's just if it comes to financial things it will directly affect me more than him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and I would say you've, in various ways, paid more than enough for his difficulty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that'd be completely reasonable and it seems—I mean as a therapist, one is concerned about, the patient trying to [inaudible at 00:03:45] other things. But this just seems so—</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's really very open about [inaudible at 00:03:50].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Evidently true that it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the thing of it is that part of the reason why it's being done this way is because he is now finally open about the fact, to certain people, that he will lie about it. For example, he even said if he did enter this agreement,—my husband said, "I would have to call from the number of my lab so you can check numbers of where I intend to be at. Or I [inaudible at 00:04:13] days when I'm not going to be able to call in to show that I've been there by 9:00 A.M." So he's even really open about the fact that he potentially would evade it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no it sounds like it (pause) could be helpful. They just have to find another (pause) punishment essentially then a financial one like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because that one doesn't affect him as much as me. And—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Well, and even if it affects you at all that's not fair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he had an easy way of being able—he doesn't have as many skills to even pick up additional income. For example, I mean although I pulled a lot of family favors to do this, they could not do this for me if I didn't actually have the credentials and the ability to do this. [00:05:08]</p>

<p>It's not like something you swing for your other friends who don't have the background. This was I'm calling, you have a calling, you having a calling. I'm—wow, they needed somebody to do this. </p>

<p>And so yes it is that, but that's not the same thing for him. And he couldn't do—what research he does, he can not right now, do anything like that. Or even some of the stuff he does, he can no longer tutor for a couple of reasons. And one of which is that operates (ph) the contracts. </p>

<p>So I don't understand exactly, but he really loves to enter and he's at work. He is not allowed to be doing any teaching for institutions other than the one where currently he has a grant right now. So he had to stop that. (Pause)</p>

<p>It was kind of a big thing coming down because a lot of people he knew spent their summers teaching at community colleges—teaching Intro to Biology, and nobody can right now. [00:06:05]</p>

<p>And I'm hoping that things will be rewritten so that he can do that, because that's, especially as a post-Doc—for someone who has a PhD and isn't in faculty, that's the bread and butter, where they make their money.</p>

<p>When you're young you make, and it's neat, but apparently this is a big day. So (pause), but it affects me more than him. And so I like it. I think it's a great idea for him to have accountability, but there has to be a different way around it. So I appreciate your feedback on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that was something that's really been bothering me. I am really happy that he is (pause) addressing this though, because (pause), it is true that (pause) there are things that basically make—if you set yourself up to succeed, often things—they may not succeed in things, but if you start the day out right, you can usually have things go smoother. [00:07:09] Okay?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I mean it's that kind of accountability check—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some people lay their clothes out, some people do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:07:15].</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if he can get in the door—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fifteen percent increase. And in productivity that's huge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or even just—the thing is, is that it starts this—if he gets stuck there, it starts this terrible spiral of feeling bad about himself, therefore acting out, therefore then becoming altered, and so the more you get into this, and not going to work. The whole thing starts.</p>

<p>On top of the fact that he isn't going to work like he should be, like the rest of the world. And (pause), it gets kind of frustrating because of the fact that both of us seem so perfect on paper that (pause) people that know him well can not even believe—they would never believe the truth. And they certainly can't believe a quarter of the truth about things. [00:08:12]</p>

<p>No matter what, they won't—when he was very open to family about the fact that he has compulsive lying issues, they're—no you can't do that, you just like being insecure. They're making freaking excuses for him. (Pause)</p>

<p>And so it's (pause)—but even friends will be—because he's set up this façade to seem like he's really in charge of things, most people would never believe that he doesn't make it into work. They figure he's somewhere else. (Pause)</p>

<p>So that's sort of a bit of a frustration for me right now. (Pause), But it's kind of interesting because of—just perspective on certain things. As much as I talk about how much this sort of thing negatively influences me,—have you ever a friend in the picture send you three months worth of [inaudible at 00:09:16] that I have?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't give those to myself. I can't. Most of them I can't into [inaudible at 00:09:22]. He is in every single shot. That is (pause)—that shows, at least on some level that he has the ability to have consistency on something. It's just a matter of redirecting things. He isn't hopelessly unorganized such that he can't do it. I think that it also shows that he rip off (ph) that kind of stuff. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actively avoid getting the shots. So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He has to be actively responsible for getting [inaudible at 00:10:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I know it's (pause), it's called [inaudible at 00:10:11] because once you get in a lot of shots, you start getting directions and reactions. And then you start having to map just to make sure you don't get injections in the same place to often.</p>

<p>So it's, yeah, usually (ph) fine without getting a shot if I don't have to. I will because it's just itchy. It's a pain, sometimes literally in the ass.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've had that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's (pause) just, yeah—he manages all that and that pretty damned amazing. So that shows—I'm not just saying it to say oh, look he has redeeming values. What I'm trying to show is that he can plan and deal with something that, not complicated, but something that you consistently do on a regular basis. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>So I think maybe this might work. I don't know. This is the first time. He has been seeing people for, God, since 1995. And this is probably the first time anybody's really played a hard line with him, because he's been very, very good at convincing people other than what is reality? And so (pause), I'm interested to see where this goes.</p>

<p>(Pause), I meant to tell you about the first day of this and I could tell [when he woke with me] (ph),—something happened and he woke up in the middle of the night and he was just super frustrated because he couldn't get back to sleep. And I could tell he was panicked about making his first day about this. And you know what? It will get better, but (pause) (sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that's a (pause)—that's not necessarily about him expectable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean that every time, I have the work, I've had something, or just one of those things where you're so concerned about doing the right that everything else gets in the way, which is—I mean he's taking it seriously though. [00:12:12]</p>

<p>The bad thing is that he was very, very angry and frustrated at this. About 4:00 A.M. he decided to go get a shower, because he was already feeling the fact it was bothering him, probably because he was sleeping funny and whatever. And so, (pause) but it's just nice to—we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean that—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—a way (ph) [inaudible at 00:12:36] where they know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be a good sign in that (pause), if they reflects that—so the system's getting shaken, like the thing that is avoiding work and acting out were helping him to cope with are now coming to the surface in different ways, such as waking him up at 4:00 in the morning or feeling [inaudible at 00:13:09] or angry—that's a shift in his old truth of functioning, which can herald change of some sort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean ho to change is always hard—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:13:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No matter what you do. And—(pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And generally it involves some pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for anybody doing massive amount of changes. I do know one of the things he was super proud of at one point, is that—a long time ago his dad made a promise that he had no intension of fulfilling, but the concept was that he needed to go to a hundred meetings and do this, and do that. And then maybe he would consider sending him to San Diego, or wherever.</p>

<p>And I know that when he had—they don't really like to do sign in, have somebody sign a sheet saying that you've been there at these meetings, but he explained that he knew that it was required. I know that he really had a sense of pride after having this many meetings he attended and this and that. [00:14:20]</p>

<p>And I know that one of the biggest breakdowns he had for attending meetings was when he realized that it (pause) really wasn't going to change anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Did that all] (ph) not help him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that they did not help him, I mean he went to years of meetings and that sort of, but just to know that the act of doing that wasn't going to necessarily get the pay off of getting the help that he needed, that it was a shell game. Seeing this that he either would not be able to do it or not dare to call out on this kind of thing.</p>

<p>(Pause), like his dad figured he wouldn't actually be able to do it I guess, or figured something. I don't know. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I assume he figured he either wouldn't be able to go to meetings or if he did go to the meetings, it would actually make a difference?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, or that he would grow out of this. His dad still thinks it's some sort of character defect that he just needs to get over (pause), sometimes. I mean it varies a lot (pause). [00:15:35]</p>

<p>That being said, if he took a moment to really give a good hard look at most of the family members, there is an underlying theme of (pause), self-medicating behavior, of which Dave is probably the one that is the least illegal.</p>

<p>(Pause), but nobody wants to sit and think about that because they're just—those are just babbles (ph). Dave is just needs to wake up and whatever. But (pause), (sigh), it's very weird.</p>

<p>Like I said it's kind of, excuse my French, fucked up, because his dad doesn't really believe in therapy. His wife is like the therapist. Yeah, no. (Pause). He's been married three times. He plays favorites on certain situations. [00:16:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know. Um, there is behavior that, for some reason, they [can't understand] (ph) that they don't expect people to, like, think about the ramifications. Like, Dave and I, when we were about 18, we were listening to his little brother, who was like maybe 12 or 13 at the time, calling his sister [his sister or somebody] (ph) and they were screening the phone calls, and it was him, and they wouldn't answer 'cause they just didn't feel up to talking to him. Now, this was blatantly obvious to Dave and I, that, from now on, that if we call and we don't reach somebody, there's a chance that we're being screened, as well. [00:17:09] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, this was back in the '90s when you could hear the voice—the conversation of the thing, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so we were thinking to ourselves, "Well, I guess, if that—if we see this happening, then that means that, equally, that could be something else like that." So it is not—to think [everything about me] (ph). I wasn't around, was a—with a grain of salt. And so, um, there is a lot of that kind of behavior, where they do things for other people in the family and, for some reason, don't expect that's going to sink in that this is favoritism or this is strange behavior—you know?—and it is kind of weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like they don't expect you to figure out that they screen calls from other kids and, therefore, they might do it to another one? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or they don't expect you to think far enough back. [00:18:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Dave's mom—who said she wasn't certain if, you know—that she could come visit Dave and hasn't seen him since, like, 2005, 2006, blah, blah, blah—um, she heard at the yarn shop that she was working at, the owners retired and closed the shop, whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And so she is now not working, and she is taking a—she called Dave while driving up [slaps surface]—driving to the West coast—she's in [pauses] Idaho?—to take a trip for a week or something like that, to take a vacation, like looking at the scenic places there. I don't know if she realizes that, like, Dave can remember three months back when she said that she had no money, and she just, like, talked three days back or three weeks back about how she was concerned about how in the world she was going to, you know, make ends meet, and then taking a vacation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that coast, although it seems—if you haven't been out there, it is exceptionally expensive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that area right around the California border there ... [00:19:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is all tourists.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, like, going to see the things like that, it is a very expensive area. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We were horrified that it was, like, slightly cheaper to eat, like, non-Manhattan, New York than it was out there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Yeah. Like, it was [inaudible] and, you know, Brooklyn seemed like a really good bargain. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's—you know, 'cause it is all tourists. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's—that says a lot, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so, um—and it is varied like that. You know, it is all Shakespeare festivals and fancy yarn shops and all this other stuff like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, um, I don't know if she put two and two together. Also, she sent us construction pictures of the new [bath. I found out] (ph) she had, like, an armoire built into the wall with the new house and all this stuff. [Slaps surface] I don't think she actually thinks that he put all this together and sees, "Wow, look at all the stuff, and yet you say you can't some see me." You know? [Pauses] And, um, that's part of—that's the reason why I don't even try to talk to them anymore. [00:20:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Aside from the fact that I feel like every contact I have just sort of falls into the ocean, I don't get enough back from them to figure out what's going on. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Letters, phone calls, texts, that kind of thing—nothing. Occasionally, they tell him something, which doesn't always get back to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which is even weirder. It is like, yep, sending an e-mail about a phone call that I made is like never doing it... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...'Cause he'll never remember to send it to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's a pretty rare thing that that even happens. So [pauses]—but it is just—it is very—you know, and it is, quite frankly—I mean, it is none of our business, but don't pretend to do one thing and not do another. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, sure it is because, [pauses] um, it is sort of your business if it is evident that she, his mother, is lying about being able to come visit or... [00:21:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even necessarily think she thinks she's lying; I think that she convinces herself at that period of time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't think she's really—wants to give a good, hard look on her life. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I resent her because she's put me in the [slaps surface] horrible, horrible position of being both his mother and his wife. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I never wanted it to be that way, but, you know, from [these reaching on] (ph), she—even earlier than that, obviously, she's not so interested. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't really understand why she called them half to—from the halfway point of driving out on her vacation to make sure, like, everything is OK, but he didn't know she was having a vacation. That's—I have done that when my parents were taking long drives, they, like, say, "Oh, call me when you're halfway to wherever, just so we know that you're OK." But they know ahead of time that I'm taking a trip. [00:22:08] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, he didn't know anything about a trip. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And that's also a child-parent—maybe that's not true; I don't know. Maybe I'm saying this the wrong way, but, I mean, my parents don't call me to tell me they're halfway driving anywhere. If—it seems like it is a reversed kind of thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But this whole thing kind of let down because I meddle—I try not to meddle a whole lot with this whole thing, and I mentioned the fact that—to him that, "You know, whenever your mom—like, whenever you tell your mom that you've been depressed, which you—it takes you a long time to actually say this, she freaks out and gets off the phone. She either changes the subject, or she freaks out and gets off the phone." And I said, "Why don't you ever talk to her and tell her about that?" And he's like, "Well, 'cause I'm sure she doesn't know what to say." And I said, "Well, you know, she can either talk to friends and find out what depressed people want to hear when they say they're depressed, or she can freaking Google it." I'm sure, if you put in "what to say to a friend or family member that is depressed," she will probably get more than one result. You know, it is not like these are things that are hard for her to understand, and she [used to teach] (ph) technology. [00:23:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and, [pauses] uh, one thing to say she doesn't know what to say to a depressed person, uh, I think it is just she doesn't have anything to say to her son. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I have actually done this. I mean, when I've had situations—like, I need to go and write a card to somebody who had been diagnosed with cancer...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I struggled, and I talked to a couple of people I knew, and I realized that the people I knew that had cancer at the time, it really wasn't as relevant 'cause it was, you know, this and that. So I actually went and spent some time on the Internet, and there were lots of places that will actually tell you how to properly word...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Things like that to say something. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess—absolutely. All I'm saying is, like, God forbid it was like a very close friend or... [00:24:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Parents or family member. Like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would at least say, "I don't know what to say. Please, I'm trying to figure it out." I don't necessarily have to tell you what to tell me to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, they'd know what to say 'cause it was them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: 'Cause it is somebody you were close to. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, like—and we finally called her back, um, which was really hard for him to do, to say this to her, and she's like, "Well, whatever. I don't know what to say, and whatever I say, it feels like fake stuff." And then she sort of threw her father under the bus for this, like saying that—like, I'd never really feel comfortable saying 'I love you' 'cause it sounds so fake—you know, 'cause her father never said it, but yet, you know, this and that, and so it was passed on to her. That's kind of bullshit. She may have never actually said those actual words in that order, [slaps surface] but nobody—I know that he loves me. Like, I've never—by his actions and by everything that he does in his life, you know that. And I can't even necessarily say that he hasn't ever said it to me; um, I just don't have any memory of it, but that's—so throwing him under the bus by saying that is very different because he [pauses] had a lot of actions that made you feel very, you know, cared for. [00:25:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Um, so, you know, uh, [slaps surface] [pauses] that's kind of like so then she threw somebody else under the bus for her own, like, lack of giving a damn. I really just don't think she gives a fuck about any of it. I think that, when she's put on the spot, which, unfortunately, I feel like I set him up to do that 'cause I kind of pushed Dave to put her on the spot for this. Even though he said this is things he wanted to do, but he never even thought of them as possibilities because he was afraid of, like, putting her in a situation where she would freak out and all and not do anything. Um, even then, she, you know, doesn't really have any strong feelings about this. You know? [00:26:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is very creepy. And so it is [pauses for four seconds]—it is very distressing. The other thing that's kind of distressing about this whole thing—and this is how it relates to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Is that Dave spoke briefly to his mother about the fact that, like, [pauses] communication being an issue, and, apparently, his mom did not know that his sister and him hadn't spoken to each other since graduation, when she called me a drama queen and all this crap. I don't think that's true. I think that she isn't—I think that words were never passed to her, but she had to have put two and two together and figured out that they hadn't spoken. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyways, Dave was mentioning the fact that—just briefly to her while trying to say why her behavior is causing this problem, like to make her face this. He was like, "You know what? Honestly, you're passing this stuff on. This is the behavior your—my sister idolizes you. She sees all this stuff happening. I don't speak to her because of this and that, because I need to set boundaries, and now I don't even know my own grandch—or my own nieces and nephews." [00:27:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, pointing out that this is, like—these are—they may not be direct consequences, but this is where the consequences are going towards. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's, like, "Well, why don't you call them?" Like, "I'll give you their cell phone numbers." So she's supposedly going to provide us with the cell phone numbers, but I am really—and as much as I love my nieces and nephews, I am really reticent to pick up the phone and call them on their cell phones 'cause I'm concerned that that is [sighs] [pauses]—I don't know how to explain this, but I—the parental [sighs] [pauses]—I am concerned about circumventing parental, like... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, of course.[00:27:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, you know, whatever. There was a period of time when my mom and my aunt fought about everything. You know, they just did as sisters. My aunt was born here; my mom wasn't, so, quite frankly, they don't have (ph) the same family members; they have different world views and different world backgrounds in terms of that kind of thing, all—you know, nearly all this—you know, not youngest (ph) but you know all this stuff—my Aunt, who is still—I feel very close with, actually. Um, but the thing is, is that, even when they didn't get along, I spent a lot of time talking to my aunt. But the thing is, is that, because I already had an established relationship with her as being my Auntie, it was not—there was no, like, breach of—of, you know, like parental consent, I guess? Because in no way did my mom ever see to think that these spats that they had as—as sisters as being something that affected me, because it was more about, you know, holding up, "I've lived life differently than you have, and you don't see perspectives as this." This is not about, like—this is not the same thing at all; this is—it is a very different kind of—if—strangely, it is actually more sisterly normal, like, fighting stuff... [00:29:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Than, like, this kind of stuff, where it, like, [slaps surface] you know. I—and so I don't know why, but I just feel very, very uncomfortable doing this. And I'm wondering if my discomfort with it is actually founded, I guess, or if I'm just making...</p>

<p>[Crosstalk]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Excuses not to get to know them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not [pauses]—I guess, saying [that we are] (ph)—you don't want to do something that their parents might feel uncomfortable with. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't—it is not even just like me being worried about redemption; I mean, it is beyond that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you also don't want to put the kids sort of in the middle of it in any way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea what they know or don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and I'll exude (ph), "Hi, it is Auntie Debra! How have you been? I know we haven't spoken in years and years."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old are the kids?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, Gemma is thirteen. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the oldest. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aiden is eleven. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And Katrina, whom I've actually physically never met, though I've heard a lot about—she is seven. And they all have their own phones, and so I could text them or whatever, I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be different if they were, you know, grown up...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or even in college or something like that, but those ages—I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because of the fact that his sister got a little bit creeped out by the fact that, like, when she—when she found out that Dave—like, his—you know, his preference for pornography [blunt that edge] (ph) of kids...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It started at the rough age of Gemma. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I could definitely see this becoming a problem. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least—I can definitely see that, if she felt like having a little bit of drama, she could make this into a problem, if that makes sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Sighs] Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't think it would ever be a problem 'cause Dave doesn't—like, the nature of his problem doesn't actually want to be attached to human beings and people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: These could be computer-generated images entirely, and it would be perfectly fine. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't think that they'll ever understand that, but, um, even just with me, I don't want to cause problems with the kids and their parents. And so, I guess, what I probably feel like I want to do is, if I want to have a relationship, maybe find an intermediary to find out if it is OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? But the problem is every member of the family is freaking nuts, so I—I don't know what to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you e-mail, um, Dave's sister and ask her if it is OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 'Cause it—uh, [pauses]...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am actually thinking about finding an independent friend of the family to do this for me, because I don't think I've ever done—sent (ph), whatever, I never get anything back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or if she even—like, she could have a filter so that, if it comes from me, it is dumped in spam or something. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I just think, at some point, it has got to go through her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, because they're that young. Uh, but, yeah, she may be filtering out your e-mail. [00:32:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thinking (ph) about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To be honest, it could be [pauses]—[sighs] because I have no way of—to be able to determine it, I have no way of finding out how much is read, or even to start it, or not even seen, or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, like I said, I'm trying to think about, like, maybe finding somebody. Maybe a—you know, Dave's—Dave's mother or sisters' kids, maybe cousins, maybe, to ask about this, or a family friend to talk to Ker—Kerry and say, "Hey, Debra really wants to get to know them. Is it OK if she—she contacts them?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I really feel like, me even indirectly—and it is not like a, "I'm afraid to talk to her." I mean, I am afraid to talk to her, but I don't ever get anything back so it is like—it is just setting myself up for not hearing anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right, whereas, if you had somebody else who knew her and could actually talk to her... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I have had... [00:33:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You'd likely actually get a response. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have financially given them things that—and never gotten a response about it, either. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Like, you know, kids don't have any—you know, "Don't have any money for the kids to have any clothes." Sent gift cards—nothing. I don't even know if I—you know, unless I kept the receipt to be able to check to see if the gift card still had a balance on it, I wouldn't even know if they used it or threw it away. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is that kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Wall. And I've actually, a couple of times, told myself not to look... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because it is better for me not to know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They use them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am perfectly good for my money. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And they actually are, unfortunately, deluded into thinking that I have unlimited resources. I'm pretty sure of it at this point. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you—what do you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure that they think that I am being funneled cash from my parents. [00:34:01] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is the only thing that makes sense as to why they [pauses] abandon Dave the way they do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Sorry, I'm confused. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm—the only thing I can think of is that, you know, the reason why—because my parents have stepped in and done things in lieu of parents for Dave...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I am convinced that they think that I'm getting money from—as a couple, that we get money from my parents. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You think—you mean you think, if they didn't think that, they would step in? I guess...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they [wouldn't nag] (ph). They wouldn't tell me things like, "The kids don't have clothes that fit them."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ohhh, OK, I—I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't get...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...[What you said there] (ph). So they're sort of pulling for you to spend money on their kids. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK, I just—you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't—I haven't [this hasn't happened in years] (ph) but [sure have seen them, though] ph...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But back in the days, you know, like the whole thing of, "Oh, my gosh, you know, Gemma is finally starting kindergarten, and she had a growth spurt and now, like, the sundresses that went down to her knees now barely covers her butt," blah, blah, blah, you know. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, things are very casually said to me. Like, her saying, you know, something along the lines of, um, you know, "I can't really afford a place," that kind of thing, and it is like, well, when I'm being told that her child doesn't have decent clothes, I'm not—you know, of course I'm going to step in and do something if I could. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But I think that—and that sounds to me like they're just asking. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're asking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't think that they would say that if they didn't think the money was coming from my parents. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which it is not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even like to get money from my parents for anything. You know? And I think maybe the reason why I don't like to ask it from them is because of—possibly because of the fact that people think of us (ph) that way—you know?—because everyone assumes I get it, so I don't want to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to. Um, if things ever got dire—sure. You know, like if Dave really, you know, had a situation where he was in an accident, and we had no way to pay for our rent—absolutely, I would—you know, or something like that. [00:36:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that, you know, it is important for me to figure—to struggle and figure it out for myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I never wanted it that way. And so I think that maybe it is the fact that the assumption has made it that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm even more so, like, unwilling to take the money. You know? When Dave graduated—or, actually, when he defended (ph), my parents paid to have a party catered for him, um, right after—like, basically while he was—the [public core] (ph) of the things happened, we set things up, that kind of thing, and we decided, for better or worse, how he did, you know, we're going to celebrate the fact that he put his effort into it; you know, that way he didn't feel that bad about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: His dad showed up with his brother. My parents paid for everything. You know. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, why? Because, well, until, like, the last minute, we didn't even know if his parents were—if his dad was going to come. But, certainly, he had no offer of anything, you know, and so I guess, in their way, they see this as, you know, for Dave's thirtieth birthday, paid—you know, [slaps surface] it was a surprise party paid for by my parents. You know? Um, [pauses] I think that they think that that's just—that there's like some unlimited tunnel of money that comes to—into our bank accounts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, therefore, you know, nobody needs to take care of him. Or at least I think that that's how they justify it in their heads. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether or not that's the actual reason, as opposed to they don't give a damn, might be different. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, as I follow, that's kind of the story they pretty much always told about everything, is [pauses] finding rationalizations for neglecting him. [00:38:00] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [pauses] yeah. [Pauses] But, [pauses] it is, [pauses] [sighs]—it is really hard because it is—you know, it puts a strain on my family, not financially, per se, about those kinds of things, but it is very difficult to have to make—you know, not make excuses but, occasionally, you have to, like, say something about it. You know, like—you know, well, what is—you're wondering (ph) is it their family for Christmas at some point; you know, really not. You know? We can't afford to, and if we could, it would be much more depressing than, you know, staying at home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sure that they're getting the picture. Like, I'm sure that they got the picture, at least a little bit of it, before, but I think it is kind of—it is hard because I know that it hurts [slaps surface] my parents because they really, genuinely like Dave. [00:39:05]</p>

<p>You know? And [pauses] I know, at least a couple of times, my dad and my mother have specifically said things like, "We don't want to step in in a situation where it is going to make their parents feel like they're not taking care of him." You know, they—they don't want to be—they're not trying to take over for in lieu of parents. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, for—especially with, like, parties or whatever. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but that is important since he doesn't have any. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I know that one of the things that he mentioned, to me at least, and that's something where it is just—it is very hard because, when you have someone in your life you love so much, and they're in so much pain. He was talking about the fact that, you know, him and the therapist were discussing the fact that he's never really grieved for the fact that his mother is not, like, interested in the least, really, about his life. [00:40:02]</p>

<p>And it was like—I mean, the fact that it is distressing to me to have him say, "I don't even know what that—what that phrase means—'grieving for things'. I don't know what that—you know, where that goes." And, to me, not even having the first idea of how to help him. You know? I mean, I'm not his therapist and I'm not his mother, but at least having something meaningful to say back and saying, "Well, I don't know, but maybe you should ask what that looks like." And it is just heartbreaking to see him this [pauses]—struggling this much. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't—[pauses] especially 'cause I just don't understand why. You know? There's a difference between, like, having tough love with a bad kid and having somebody who has a Ph.D., is currently doing their postdoc at an Ivy League school. I mean, yes, he has problems, but [pauses] these things developed after they started pulling away. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>You know? He had no problems in the past until he stopped getting family support, really—not real (ph) problems but—do you know what I mean? Like, these are not things that—I think that the cause and the effect are confused in terms of the order. You know? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, how do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, [slaps surface] I think that on some level they're—maybe see it as, "Oh, I need to pull away because he needs to figure these things out for himself." Dave has not really ever crossed any boundaries with them, or asked them for money, or put them in situations where he had to be bailed out of jail. I mean, these are not the kind of things where you have to play these cards. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean—I was like—it doesn't make any sense. Like, whose parents don't see them for seven years...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or who don't come into town when they're having major medical problems or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could see that happening if—if Dave was like his brother Brad, who was an—honest-to-God—meth addict; who, you know, from watching Breaking Bad, now we, like, understand a whole lot more about his brother from watching, like, cable... [00:42:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That's not true but disturbing. Like, I can see having that kind of relationship with somebody who, you know, is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, 'cause that's not what...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's not what is happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Has happened at all. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he hasn't burned any bridges. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, he's never put it—he's never walked away from bail to have someone's house to be taken away. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not the same thing at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. We'll stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, but we're all scheduled for next...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we're all scheduled. I'll be in Tuesday and Thursday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>[Rises from seat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect. Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [Whispers] Take care. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers] You, too. [00:42:40]</p>

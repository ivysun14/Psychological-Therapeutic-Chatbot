<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where would you like to start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure what to do about Sydney.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been - often when I ask him to do something he ends up saying, well first he says that he'll do it and then he ends up panicking about it and not doing it. And right now today we had had lunch and we had loaded up the car with a bunch of clothes that I have to get rid of and bring to Goodwill and he said he'd help me with them. But I also have this package that I need to mail today and I forgot it and I realized it as soon as we left the house as we were going and we didn't have time for me to drive back. And he said that we would mail it afterwards.</p>

<p>I was supposed to meet him and then we were going to drop off the clothes at Goodwill there and then get ice cream and he said that after that we could get the package but I'm like the post office closes at five. So not like going to so I was like what if you pick me up from the Square and we stop by my place? And he was like I can't do that; if I do, if it's something that you'll get, you know, I have to pick you up and I know you'll get upset if I don't then I end up panicking and you get upset.</p>

<p>I mean, I'm glad he realized it this time but now I'm panicking because I don't know if I'm going to get the package there and I said that I would get it to her. And if it wasn't for the fact that it was for my store and stuff, I really wouldn't care. And because I said that I would dye the stuff this weekend and get it in the mail by well yesterday afternoon, which is equal today since there's no mail on Sunday, so if I don't get it in the mail today then I will have lied. So now I have to go home and then mail the package and then he'll pick me up from my place, maybe though he might panic about that too. And it's like either I never ask him to do anything or he panics and feels like I can't ever rely on him. [00:02:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long has that been going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For most of our relationship. When I got home from vacation, like originally - well A, the flight home from Israel wasn't supposed to be super delayed but it was super delayed because originally my parents said that they would drive me back up and I had to be up that night for rehearsal but then the flight was being super delayed. And then oh, can Maria drive me since she's also coming up for rehearsal and so I called Maria and she was like well if I feel better in a week when it's time to go then sure. And then Maria wasn't feeling better and ended up leaving the group and wasn't going to the rehearsal. And I'd asked Sydney while I was still on vacation if he'd be able to do it and he said he would and then he ended up panicking and not being able to.</p>

<p>And then I had to figure out how to get there on time because I didn't want to take a bus because I had all my stuff. And even if my parents dropped me off at the bus place and put my stuff on the bus, I still would've had to get my stuff off the bus because if I took a cab, the cab isn't going to help me get my stuff off the bus and drag it through the station. So what I ended up doing is having my dad drive, or rather - no, I drove there and my dad drove the car back because I was like what if I borrow the car and bring it back tomorrow? And my parents didn't want to go a day without the car. So I ended up having to do all this craziness because he ended up panicking. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is this usually about transportation or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Often. Sometimes it's about - usually it's about transportation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that have something to do with his anxiety or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't know. Or I think it's more he's anxious about disappointing me. I guess it's because transportation is what I'd be relying on him the most because he has a car and I don't. And I made this plan with the assumption that the car would be available. If the car wasn't available, if I knew, I could make the plans around the fact that he's not going to be able to do something. But when he says he's going to be able to do something I'd like to be able to believe him of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it's really frustrating not to be able to count on him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's upsetting that he's experiencing this level of anxiety about meeting you someplace.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean it doesn't always happen; it just happens a lot. I can't not get mad at him. I can try to not express being mad at him but I usually will get pissed off and I'm concerned for his welfare but I'm also like if it ends up ruining my plans and I have to scramble to do something else then, or if I have all my stuff with me that I wouldn't have brought with me if I knew that I was going to be taking the bus or walking...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You end up in a very difficult position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so if I'm trying to get home from rehearsal and it's really late and he's panicking he can't pick me up and I'm not going to walk home by myself. And I really don't want to pay the $10 for the cab ride. So then it's forcing me to choose something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does this happen for him with other people too or is it something specific to following through on plans with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's - I mean well it's not like he's giving rides to other people. So I mean sometimes he might panic if he's supposed to meet someone for lunch or something but he doesn't have as many plans with other people so I can't really judge it that accurately. But I think it's mostly having to do with me. I try not to be mean about it or anything but... [00:06:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is your reaction like when you're angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I yell at him, insulting him or anything, but I do get very panicked and then I'm like what am I going to do now, how am I going to get there, what do you expect me to do? You were supposed to give me a ride and now you're not giving me a ride. How am I supposed to get from Point A to Point B? You said you would and now you can't. Which I think is reasonable. I try to be reasonable. I'm not telling him he's a failure or anything although if he keeps on saying that he's a failure I'll be like you're not a failure; I just am stuck now. And if it is his fault it is his fault and I mean - I don't know. I try not to get mad at him when he's panicking but it's hard when...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He can probably sense your anxiety about having to come up with a Plan B.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a tough situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like I can never depend on him for anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's really hard. You want to be able to depend on your partner. [00:08:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Even last night, he - well originally we were going to get dinner together after rehearsal and then he ended up having dinner while I was at rehearsal but said he would help me with dinner. So I went to the grocery store right before it closed. I got pizza dough and sauce and stuff and cheese and he said he was going to help me with the pizza. And I called him when I got in and he kept on not answering because he didn't hear the phone. And I finally got in. I dragged the really heavy bag in. That was so heavy and I shouldn't have done it myself. And I was like I needed your help because I had parked the car badly and I suck at parking and he doesn't suck at parking. Then I asked him to straighten it out and he's like why can't you straighten it out yourself and stuff. And also he said he would help me with the dinner and I did find kosher pizza sauce but if I hadn't then I would've gotten tomatoes and he would've made sauce with me.</p>

<p>And he's not feeling up to helping me with the car, with the pizza. I'm like okay well then what would you have done if I had brought home the tomatoes and he's like well I would've made you sauce. And I was like why can't you help me with this then? You said you would. I made these plans on the assumption that you would help me and he's like why can't you do it yourself. But you said - at that point I was just so starving because I hadn't eaten since 1:00 or 2:00 and it was 10:00 at night. So I did end up making the pizza myself but - though he ended up straightening out the car for me. It's just I panicked because he didn't pick up and I didn't know what happened to him and was annoyed that he wasn't picking up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling right now as you talk about it? What's coming up? [00:10:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm stressed and upset. It's just I see it happening and I'm wondering if I'm being a bad girlfriend or something. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong exactly other than asking him to do anything and I can't never - and I had made him lunch. Just feels like I always end up having to do all the things when he panics because he said he'd do something for me and then he doesn't do it for me. Or he gets sucked into his video game or something, which happened on Wednesday. Wednesday he left his phone here because he wanted - because it was out of batteries. And then he said he'd come back, he was going to go home, get his stuff and come back. And then he didn't and kept on not being there. Eventually he showed up at 7:30. He was like oh I lost track of time. I ended up playing a game. And he even went to get his stuff and he didn't even end getting his anti-depressants when he was there. So I don't even know what he got but after all that. And I had no way of contacting him there then I was really freaking out because I had no way of contacting him and he might not come back or something and where did he go and he promised me he wouldn't do this and he did it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He promised you he wouldn't do this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This feat. He wouldn't get sucked into a game, he wouldn't panic, he wouldn't freak out. He was just going to go home and come back. He promised me there wasn't going to be an issue or anything and then there was. So, and there was nothing I could do because I had no way of really contacting him. I did send him an e-mail but he didn't respond. [Something about] (ph) compounded about the fact that he has no libido, which I'm incredibly crazy about that and trying not to put pressure on him but... [00:12:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do those two things mix together for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well for one thing when he came back on Wednesday then he was - I'm like I'm really upset about this; I want you to do something to make this up to me. And he said what about sex? And I said sure except that never ended up happening because he got stressed out later and was no longer in the mood and, yes. And I haven't done any making out with him or anything for over a week now at this point which is really long. And once his libido gets back, if it does get back - his libido is as high as mine when it's working but right now it isn't working. And I'm trying everything I can, like anything he suggests but it hasn't really helped and he still doesn't really have a libido.</p>

<p>And he's on the Wellbutrin now which should be helping and I guess it's slowly coming back but it's not really coming back enough that I'm never seeing any difference and I'm going insane. I don't want to blame him because it's not his fault but at the same time I'm suffering from it and I really don't know what to do. And he knows that I'm disappointed but I can't not be disappointed. I can't lie to him and say oh no it's totally fine. Of course I'm not disappointed at all because that would be lying. He'd know it's a lie. [00:14:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are your expectations of him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well when he promises something that he'll do it and not, not do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of promises?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like with the transportation and stuff like that and helping me with dinner when he says it's fine and that he'll do it and I'm like are you sure and he says yes. And then he ends up not being sure and not being able to do it and freaking out. And I'm powerless and stuck because I depended on him and I have no way of preventing it other than never asking him to do anything anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he have control over the freaking out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and no. I mean I guess he doesn't have control over panic attacks but he does have anti-anxiety medicine that he could take and keeps on not taking it and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. So you're angry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Angry about that. And I guess when I panic about something, well A, I never panic about things that hurt other people. Like I don't panic about having to do something for someone; just do it. I panic about having to do things for myself and then if I'm panicking I'm being self-destructive but I'm not destructing anyone else, I'm not ruining anyone else's plans or anything like that. So that's the difference between us is that my panic attacks aren't causing other people to have to rearrange everything at the last minute and his are.</p>

<p>And I keep on waiting and waiting for his libido to get back and it doesn't and I don't know what to do. And I expect - he says he's attracted to me and everything and I know - so at least intellectually that it's not my fault. You know, I'm thinking maybe if I were pretty or something then his libido would be back and it is my fault somehow, even though it isn't. I expect my boyfriend to want to be doing sexual things with me. I think that's a reasonable expectation. [00:16:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a reasonable expectation in general...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean I know he has depression I guess, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes and part of this is health related and if he's having a lot of anxiety, that's often a libido crusher; depression is a libido crusher; and medications can compound that. So, yes for a healthy male, healthy female - it doesn't matter - you would expect that attraction to translate into wanting to be sexually active. But right now it doesn't sound like he's very healthy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. There's absolutely nothing I can do about it and - I guess it also bothers me because now he's supposed to be up on the higher dosage of Wellbutrin but that requires taking one in the morning, one in the afternoon which requires waking up early enough to do it and he keeps on not taking the second dose. And I'm like how do you expect it to help you if you're not - you can get up and go back to sleep. And also then he also keeps on staying up to ridiculously late at night. He tells me okay I want to play video games for an hour after you go to bed is that okay. I'm like okay well set an alarm and go to bed after that and then he - like on Sunday.</p>

<p>He ended up Saturday night staying up until 5:00 A.M. even though he said he wouldn't and then he did. I mean they're maybe into that video game but really it doesn't matter what he was doing. The whole point was that he was up and then he wasn't able to pick me up from Doreen's bridal shower. And I had to make alternate arrangements to get out early. But he promised me he would. And then he stayed up. In that case his staying up did affect me negatively. So he keeps on doing it over and over again.</p>

<p>Basically it's turning out that whatever he promises doesn't mean anything anymore because he doesn't follow through on his promises and it's just - I guess not ask him to promise anything and that doesn't really sound like a good relationship though. [00:18:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No it doesn't. It sounds like he's really struggling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel bad but I can't completely sublimate (ph) my desires.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No and you don't need to but it seems like you're having two reactions. One, you're feeling angry about the things that he's not doing that you would expect a partner to do - to follow through on what they've promised, to act on their attraction for you. These are things you expect in a healthy relationship and it sounds like you feel disappointed and angry that those things aren't happening. And the other piece is that you're probably worried about him because the fact that he's panicking about these types of things, the fact that he can't make good decisions for himself like going to bed at a reasonable hour to get to his medication...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of that is that he has insomnia, but take your Wellbutrin and go back to sleep. If you're that tired you'll go back to sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the insomnia is also probably part of the depression and one of the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...one of the symptoms of depression is changes in sleep patterns, having trouble falling asleep and feeling really tired and sleeping late the next day. These things are probably all connected. And it's really hard to watch somebody not be able to do the things that they need to do to feel better like taking meds, getting exercise, keeping a regular schedule. Those things would all be helpful to him if he could do them and right now it sounds like he can't. That leaves you feeling frustrated, that leaves you feeling unsupported. [00:20:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like I'm always the one who suffers. He promises me things and then doesn't follow through and he doesn't have a libido. I'm the one who's suffering.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're both suffering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have no idea what to do because I don't want to break up with him but I don't know how much more I can stand this. I don't want to put an ultimatum on him because it's not like he can control when he gets better. But I don't want this indefinitely either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't fix it for him. You can express your concern that - rather than - I know you feel angry but your anger is not going to get him to change. One thing that might feel supportive and therefore be helpful is to express your concern about the choices that he's making, choices that are maybe exacerbating some of his symptoms. And see if you can find ways to offer support to help him. Your concern about staying up late, which kind of sets off this pattern of then missing his morning medication, sleeping in, having trouble falling asleep the next night. Rather than expressing that as a promise me you'll go to bed, which feels like pressure, talking about your concern about why he isn't able to do that might help him kind of ease back into a choice that might be healthier. [00:22:35]</p>

<p>But asking him to make promises about things that he might not be able to keep, kind of adds to the pressure that he's feeling and might actually make the anxiety worse about - because he knows that he's having a hard - it's not a surprise to him that he's having a hard time following through on things, keeping promises and keeping commitments. Are there other people that can support him so that you don't feel like you're doing this by yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Well he has a therapist and I mean he has friends. But I don't know if they can support him in the same way, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably not in the same way, but I wonder if there are pieces that they can help with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm not even sure what could be delegated out that would make me feel better. I'm the one that's being affected by this. Like his friends, I mean besides - his friends aren't being affected by his depression; I'm the one who's being affected by his depression. So what would his friends even do? His friends can't not put pressure on him to not stay up late because it doesn't affect them at all but that doesn't really mean anything. Or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he spending time with friends, having fun with them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not as much. He should be spending more time with them. I mean well he has his major game every other week and stuff but he hasn't - and one of his friends is actually moving away. I mean he calls his friends and talks to them every week or so but he doesn't spend that much time with them right now. [00:24:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if encouraging him to socialize with them more might just be a healthy thing to do in terms of getting that connection and getting support, not necessarily they're going to do something specific. But being with people that care about you, connecting again to things that are fun can be really helpful when you're feeling anxious and sad. And those are things that are helpful to you when you're feeling sad and he might have some of the same response.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I can tell him but I don't know if he'll do anything. I can't make him make plans with his friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have relationships with anyone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No they're all his friends. I mean I've met them before once or twice but I don't really know them that well or anything. They all like me apparently but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel comfortable reaching out to them and letting - maybe they will...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have their contact information.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that would be a no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have - the most I have hung out with any of his friends is maybe two times total for one of his friends and the rest that I've hung out with are men. I've met them once. So he sees a lot more of my friends than I see of his friends so I really can't do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't sort of work them on the fly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess I could friend Janet on Facebook, but I don't have - well I probably would be able to find her from his Facebook. But it would be weird just talking to a person who I've only met once. So yes, I can't really do much of that right now. [00:26:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it would feel better if you kind of pulled back a little bit because it sounds like one of the things that's really hard for you is that you're continually getting disappointed. And while you're right in that you should be able to ask things of him and have him follow through, maybe pulling back a little bit and relying on other people more right now would be something that would just take some of the pressure off the situation because it sounds like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe but there aren't really other people I can rely on for most of these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you do before Sydney existed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I can rely on myself. I can't rely on other people. I can either rely on myself more or no one because - but the problem is when I get in the middle of a situation where I have all my stuff and I'm like f*** I have all my stuff. It's my giant backpack with my laptop that I wouldn't have bought if I was not going to be getting a ride or something where now I'm stranded at rehearsal. And then it's okay then I pay for a cab. Which would be nothing if I had a job but then it feeds into the whole anxiety about taking money from my parents. So that isn't a good solution either. And before this I didn't rely on anyone because rehearsal wasn't this late and Allison was in the group and she lived near me and we walked back together and I was fine and I don't have that anymore. I don't and there's not much I can do because there's no one who lives near me anymore. [00:28:11]</p>

<p>If he freaks out at me getting home from rehearsal at - I mean the solution we've come up with I was meeting him at Wareham. But that only worked if I've already given him my clothing and stuff because, or I have it with me because then otherwise I don't have clothes for the next day and it would still require going to my place after him meeting me at Wareham. So if that's a last minute change that he was going to pick me up and we were going to my place then it's either I walk home alone or I spend the money for the cab or I'm left without clothing for the next day. So really, sometimes there aren't good solutions. I've been spending most of the - I have less than $2,000 left in my two accounts. I am down to nothing almost.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So all these things are getting tied up together because you started with feeling angry and disappointed that he's not being able to follow through on commitments he's making, which you've attached to being upset about not having a job and taking money from your parents, which you've attached to being angry at music for making rehearsals later. And all of that together ends up feeling like you're blaming him for things that are in reality completely separate. But you follow this thread where they all get tied together and end up being really big. And each of those things are separate problems.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that none of those are problems. You know, the rehearsal time is really late and it makes it very difficult to figure out how to get there and back safely. I know it's really uncomfortable for you to be in the position of relying on your parents for money. It's been very frustrating to be doing the job search process for this long. And it's very disappointing that your boyfriend isn't able to follow through on his commitments right now. But they're all separate things. [00:30:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're connected separated things. They're connected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you connect them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean the rides are connected to the rehearsals, which is connected to the other solution being to spend my parent's money. It's a very obvious connection. If I have to get back from a late rehearsal by myself, I have to take a cab. That money is coming from my parents. How is that not connected?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's - yes it's connected in that way but they're separate problems in that your reaction to being angry at Sydney. You're more mad at - if you had unlimited financial means, you wouldn't be mad at him if he couldn't pick you up because it would be not a big deal to spend money on a cab. So it's like you're feeling like you can be more mad at him because you don't have unlimited funds. That's not really his fault. He's only responsible for the one piece. He can only be held responsible for his piece in that. And the fact - what time rehearsal is has nothing to do with Sydney. Whether or not you have a job has nothing to do with what time rehearsal is. Those things are separate and you're angry about all of them. [00:32:45]</p>

<p>That's funneling where the anger gets channeled. It's unfair if anger at your parents - you're angry at your parents for not supporting you the way you want them to about your job search. That anger can't come out at music rehearsal. That's not fair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No but I could've left the group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's could've. That's a separate - that's separate...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now it's too late because our concert is this weekend so I really have no - maybe I can write the group if you don't make rehearsals earlier next semester I'm not staying in the group because I can't do this anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is a decision you can make. That's a separate decision whether or not you want to be a part of that group.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't like being in this position. It's really something none of the others have to deal with this in the same way that I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: None of them do. Other people who do live farther away are male and their safety isn't as compromised as mine if they're walking home from rehearsal or biking home or whatever. And everyone else in the group lives close. And it's like okay late night rehearsal doesn't matter for them at all, but it matters for me because the reliance on people for rides or I am paying for an expensive cab ride with money I don't really have. And my parents said they would pay me for the cabs but they never do. It's like they don't actually leave the money for it. I'm like wait - my mom finally gave me the money that she should. She would relate the - when I asked for money so I couldn't have it so I wouldn't spend it and not feel guilty. So she gave me that money but she hasn't given me more money for rent. So that $400 that she gave me for all of April and May disappeared into the rent check. [00:34:52]</p>

<p>So it's not really there any more so it's not really making me any less [inaudible at 00:34:56] about spending money because I don't really have that much money left. And I guess what it comes down to is if I have zero money then they'll give me money for rent but maybe. But I don't even know that. Maybe they'll stop and decide that they're not going to give me money any more.</p>

<p>And I can't ask my mom for money for rent because she'll be like you just asked me money for these other things. The money that she did give me for these other things turned into rent and not into these other things. And I'm not feeling any less guilty about spending money than I was before. And my mom gave me the $25,000, $25,500, to pay off my student loans which went directly to pay off my student loans and that money's no longer in my account either. It's gone. It was only in there for a week or however long it took them to get my check for that and deposit it. And so that money too is gone. So it didn't - now at least I don't have a student loan taking over me but I don't have any more money for things. [00:36:19]</p>

<p>There is nothing left, basically. I am down to about $2,000 or possibly less between the two accounts. All the money that I make from my yarn stuff also goes directly into rent too. It all turns into rent and so therefore I feel guilty about spending it on anything else. Even the cabs that my parents said they would pay me for. But if they give me $20 for cab rides or whatever, it's going to turn into rent anyways. The same thing also happens when I get birthday money or anything else. It goes into my account and it turns into rent. I still feel guilty if I'm spending it on anything else because my parents don't put in the $800 a month that I'm spending on rent and utilities every month. They just give me money when it runs out. And I guess it would run out faster if I was spending it on other things besides rent but it doesn't feel like I have that money. It feels like it disappears. It doesn't really help with anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like this, when we boil all of this down it really comes down to the money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the depending on Sydney. I guess they're two separate things. It does come down to the money in this case when it comes to rehearsals. But if there's something like this afternoon then that doesn't have anything to do with the money and everything having to do with carrying heavy things or not having the time to drop off my package or whatever. It's the music where it will come down to the money or lack thereof.</p>

<p>So if I wasn't in this position in the first time, if they haven't made rehearsal that late then - maybe if I can tell them I'm leaving rehearsal early every day but I can't really do that for [inaudible at 00:38:35] and I really can't do that this semester because I'm the only alto, or I'm the only alto for most of the songs. So if I'm not there it screws up everything. I need to be there. So I can't tell them that I'm leaving early every week even if I want to. And I think that actually some of them might be 10:00 to - let me see how late they put it this week. I think they - last night it was 7:00 to 9:00 because it was Sunday. Yes, Mondays 9:00 to 11:00, Tuesday it's 10:00 to 12:00, Wednesday it's 9:00 to 11:00, Thursday it's 9:30 to 12:00 and Saturday it's 10:00 to 12:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really late the ones that are ending at 12:00. And I could just tell them that I'm not staying until 12:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you can. [00:39:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like music has the money that they can pay for my cab. If I borrowed the car from Sydney that's the only real way around it because then he doesn't have to pick me up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like with the music rehearsal - so there's two separate things. It's the rehearsals and a separate issue of whether or not Sydney is in position where he could be relied upon. And it seems like right now he can't so therefore you are responsible for figuring out what to do about music. And that might mean coming up with another safe way home or letting them know that there is no safe way for you to get home from rehearsal that late so therefore setting your limit to what time you'll stay to.</p>

<p>But that's your decision to make. And maybe that's borrowing the car, maybe that's asking your parents directly for a specific amount of money for the cab rides, maybe it's saying you're only staying for whatever time feels safe for you. But it's separating out the problem right now with Sydney from the problem with rehearsal. Rehearsal isn't his responsibility. And right now you need - there's a pattern that you can't necessarily rely on him if he says he can pick you up, so take him out of that equation. And you be responsible for figuring out what to do with rehearsal and we'll figure out what to do with Sydney and how he's doing separate from that. [00:41:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably borrowing the car is the best solution because then I'm not taking money from my parents and if Sydney is already at the house he's not going to need it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that will be one way to make yourself independent and keep those two things separate from one another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's probably the only solution because otherwise I'm screwed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's a good solution. It keeps you fairly independent. He doesn't need his car and you can be responsible for driving it, having it and being safe. It takes relying on him to be able to show up, takes it out of the equation. Why don't we stop here today? I will see you next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Oh and the week after - so next week will be the 14th, so the 21st I probably will not be... [00:42:50]</p>

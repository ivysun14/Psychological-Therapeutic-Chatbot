</p><p>COUNSELOR: For all you connoisseurs of the superb, we have Tape 105, Client Number 0426-002, Interview Number 8, Track B, Side 2, Part 2 That's right, we have Client 0426-002, Reel Number 105, 8th Interview, Track 2, Side B, Part 2.

</p><p>PATIENT: Have you moved out of town?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I beg your pardon?

</p><p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 1:07:29.8]... (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you asking me? Yeah. And here's your... 

</p><p>PATIENT: We went to the park today and it was too cold to stop and eat.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you have a... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Kind of had a little bit of one.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:07:49.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Goodies?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Tasty (ph). [Move this before I come on.] (ph) Jim told me the other night he didn't think that, he thought that masturbation was like a monkey on my back and after I got rid of my guilt feelings that was all that was going to happen.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:08:32.5]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well yeah, I kind of think he's right, really. I've just come to really kind of admit it to myself that I really don't like sex, to you. It just doesn't turn me on. Now I'm sorry I agree with him but... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like I don't see how you'd be lowered (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well he said..., "Now you think it's all going to take care of itself and you're not really going to..." Like the reason he wanted me here was so that we could have a good sex life together, and...if Anything else happens, fine, but that was his reason for me coming and that I thought it was mine too. I just, it just doesn't turn me on.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Especially with him, it's one heck of a big turn off.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not just with him. Yeah, because as far as partners go, he's just as good as Anybody else you could pick... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...but I just don't get excited about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, occasionally I do, but it's just so, everything, all the conditions have to be right and I'm the one, I have to want to do it, not... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You would have to want it?

</p><p>PATIENT: ...if I'm not in the mood he can't make me be in the mood. When I think of sex, I think of something dirty, I really do. I mean, even though I laugh about it... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...it's really the truth, that's what I think of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I know what you mean by dirty?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's unclean. And I can remember the night before we got married, Jim's mother was trying...I don't know what's the matter with her, but she was saying..., "The worse part about intercourse is the smell." And nobody had ever said that or...it hadn't even occurred to me until I was kind of looking for it, and sure enough, it was right. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So the smell just is [inaudible at 1:11:15.1]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is. You know I guess it's in our bathing (ph) room. But every time we have intercourse, like I think of his mother saying that, and it's like she's in the same room, same..., "The bad thing about intercourse is the smell." Sort of like she's in the room with us at all times.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like she's in the room with you at all times and like she's calling attention to it at all times?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [It kind of leads you to think?] (ph) [1:12:00.6]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, like it's not, I can't imagine his folks ever being very affectionate toward each other, and in a way it's sort of like her saying, "You won't like it. You're not going to like it, it's no good. You know you might as well forget it, but I'll point out a few of the bad things so you won't have to look for them." Or something like that. I just...I don't know. I'm sure I would have found something else that I didn't like about it, if she hadn't of said it... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If she wouldn't have, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...if she'd just kept her mouth shut.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckling) I wish she'd have had her own daughter to tell.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To sort of inflict that on?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I just can't remember my mother ever saying Anything like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (phone ringing)

</p><p>PATIENT: But it used to be kind of, not in a real joke (ph) but I, when I've had that sperm running down my legs or on the bed, it just, it really does kind of turn my stomach, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And he'd say, "Well, I give it to you and what you do with it after that is none of my business." But it's, it is a little bit repulsive to me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:13:23.2]... and it sounds like it.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I'm not that clean a person.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean...my house isn't spotless and neither am I all the time, it's just that in the foreign area, like this, is my excuse for not liking it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm not clear and the way you're saying it doesn't make it sound like an excuse. It sounds like, it's like sperm running down your leg or the smell of the sperm, like really disgusts you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I always think it does but I can't...millions of other people get along just fine without it, so it must be an excuse that I have made for myself.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess. I mean, that sounds sort of like a hypothesis you have about life and stuff.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, there's got to be some nice, simple answer, instead of like...digging back into my childhood...? Because all of these things I think about, like sex, in my childhood...what I thought about it? It just doesn't seem like that could do it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There's not enough back there to explain that, how you are [with it?] (ph) [1:14:41.4]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't really know what it is that's supposed to be explained. I don't know how people get this tight about... Jim says I'm Victorian about sex, but then I said if you live with a Victorian man, you're bound to feel a little uptight about something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that [inaudible at 1:15:12.5]... he's at fault [this time?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Not in that area but, well I mean, he is awfully tight about sex, but I mean...like he's the ruler of the family. And just the other day we had to shell out 70 dollars because he wanted to take a speed reading course and I wanted to, too, but he said, "Which one's more important?" So when he put it like that I had to agree that it was possibly more important that he take it than me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:15:47.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, because he's in school and he has to read much more than I do. When I read it's for pleasure. When he reads it's to get through school.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I wanted to take the course, too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's [the fear of contemplating, guarding those tools.] (ph) [1:16:04.1] I mean, some way that you perceive objective [inaudible]... regardless of the fact that he some how needed this more than you. Like in some way it feels like you need it as much as he does?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not only that. It's like everything that we spend a lot of money on is for him...if it's like 20 dollars, okay, then I can have that, but he'll take the 100 dollars and spend it on something that he needs.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure, it shows you he's strong.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I've got to agree with him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In some rational... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, if I'm, unless I wanted...lay down on the floor and kick and scream, he's right. But I feel like I should get something, something that I want to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you continue to feel that you're denied? [inaudible at 1:17:04.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I still want you just, like all this, is subjugated into, like always like second to his [inaudible at 1:17:15.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, unless they're little wants.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, if they're 20 dollar wants.

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckling) That's all right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But if they're 100 dollar wants [inaudible at 1:17:22.4]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Then we haven't got the money. I mean, really that has the money...it's like I believed all this stuff but I still feel like I should be getting a little more... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...than I'm getting.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. But if you, on each and every decision you can, like [inaudible at 1:17:42.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Do what he's...because... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...it's natural, it's normal.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But underneath there's the nagging feeling like, "I'm not getting Anything. I'm not getting mine at all." It's the little inconsequential things. I don't think you should be miserable as hell.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, not ultimately (ph) I think is my problem.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That you can't show that to him, do you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it would just be so unreasonable for me to say, "You absolutely cannot take that reading course and I'm going to kick you down the steps if you do." You know, which I'd really like to say sometimes...and then follow through and kick him down the steps because he went ahead and took the reading course. I would like to take the reading course. And...like your hands are just really tied because you, because it is unreasonable.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm still not clear. I'm not clear how it's unreasonable. Let me tell you where I am with this. You know, I thought you were talking to me like, he needs that because like reading is the tool of his trade, and I just want it, I want the scalpel to cut my meat with and he needs this because he's a brain surgeon, or something like this. It's really important for him but it's trivial for me. And I don't see that. It sounds like it's very important to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: It is I guess. But maybe it's not, I mean, it's better for him, right, that he should have it, but it's not essential that he have the reading course, that he can read 9,000 words a minute, because he's gotten...along okay this year. As a matter of fact, he's gotten along much better than the rest of the fellows in his class because he does read much faster than the normal and I don't. So really, I need it worse than he does. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I said, this, is what you were saying a minute ago.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does. But I can't say that. I mean, it would be so unreasonable for me, the submissive wife to, it would be just out of character for me to... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not calling it that. I don't...I mean, I hear the part about your feeling sort of funny and really like, well, you said acting out of character. I understand that, that makes a lot of sense, that you're always...you see yourself as giving in, time in and time out. I understand that part, but I don't understand the unreasonable part? What's sort of... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Unreasonable about me wanting to take the course?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because like, it's going to be his livelihood that... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [So does he know you feel all this?] (ph) [1:20:39.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he does, but he took it much better. And what do I do with it? I just breathe (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're not worth it?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I know I'm, you're not supposed to say that, I'm supposed to say that. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm hearing isn't it?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's worth it because he's using it for a livelihood and so it's... 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I'm just using it to enjoy myself.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, if I were to take, and another thing is, he intimated that I wouldn't follow through with it and that it would just be money down the drain.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Down the drain.

</p><p>PATIENT: And so, why not let him use the money and do a good job of it and then I'll suffer through reading, putting away. But there are so mAny things that I'd like to get read that I just, I never do because there isn't that much time and if I could read faster. It's an amazing course.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd really like to take it?

</p><p>PATIENT: I really would. But I don't want to, like he brought this readometer home and he can have it for six times, and I don't want to sit down in our dining room while the kids are outside playing and have to do it. While when he's doing it, he's..., "Get the kids out of here. I have to concentrate. I have to get this done." I want to do it the same way he did it. I mean, no wonder I can't do things, I have to do everything else and all he has to do is go to school. I mean, he never makes the dinner or cleans the house or watches the kids. So I want it. But if I take the course, it'll be coming out of our vacation fund or something...or, "Sarah won't be able to go to preschool the first two months, because you took the course. We had just enough money for one of us to do it and you blew it."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, because he will have already taken it and then you take it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I see.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it would be unreasonable for us both to take it at the same time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I didn't know that upset me so much until [inaudible at 1:23:22.0]... I just go along...at home, not really thinking too much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like it didn't bother you so much until you touched on it here?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it did I'd say, but I just never admitted it. It was really that important to me. And then there's always that doubt that I would not... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Follow through?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think I could follow through but I just really wouldn't be reading, say 120 dollars worth faster, when I got through.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he'd make, okay, so you might follow through but like, he'd make better use of this than you are?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He probably will.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He has the brains to use this [inaudible at 1:24:09.0]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: [inaudible]... Yeah, I was just really disgusted with him when he said that the other night, even though...it may be true, that maybe nothing will happen in our sex life, but maybe that I would get, I would be Wesefited by therapy but he wouldn't be. It was just, it's just so aggravating that everything I do has to Wesefit him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it's aggravating that it seems like it was that you come here and get fixed up just for him, rather than you come here to... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Get fixed up period.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like he only cares about you if you're under him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and he's awful selfish, you know he is. (chuckling) But it's not supposed to be so bad because he admits that, you see.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean that's what he says?

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, if you accused him of being selfish, he'd say, "Yes. Yes, I am. I know I am." So... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like it makes you feel cross? [overlapping voices at 1:25:49.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, what can you say? You can only say it once or twice and then it kind of loses its affect. (chuckling) After that nobody goes, "Oh!"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes it sound like you'd say it as a weapon or use it as a weapon and then...after a while he has the armor up because...it pierces him then?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, no really. I mean, like I don't say it to, I mean, we'll just even be talking and he's so (hitting table for emphasis) damn logical or something. But if I point it out to him though, he's selfish, he'll say, "Yes, I am."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's not the kind of reaction you want out of him?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd like him to say...maybe carry it a little further, "Yes, I am, but I'm going to try and overcome it." Or Anything, rather than just admitting it and saying..., "And there's nothing I can do about it, I was brought up that way." Or something. Sometimes I think like, country schools are not the best place to learn about sex. I guess I really didn't even know about it, but...when I was in kindergarten, the big boys in our school would come out to the outdoor toilet and watch me go to the bathroom, practically every day. And I've just been sitting here wondering...what are they laughing about? And I never really knew...like until I was 18, 19 but it's something that I, that...like I remember very vividly. But I didn't know Anything about it...like they didn't even touch me, they were just all very happy to stand around and grin.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: We had a really dumb teacher.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean to let them do that to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, I can't remember, I'm sure it happened more than once, like there was three of them I remember, that always got excused at the same I did. Now, he must have been a real dunce to let that continue.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why, he should have stepped in and done something, at least realized and then stepped in and done something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then looking at him, I guess he really couldn't expect it. And...almost everything that I remember, happened to me when I was four years old. That must have been a great year. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A patriot (ph) year?

</p><p>PATIENT: A patriot year, right. I get all fed up that year. There was a bunch of real clods in our school that year, all of these big boys. I remember my older brother was trying to show everybody how strong he was, and he laid on the, flat on the floor and lifted me, one foot here and one foot here, and all of these big boys and the teacher were standing there, "Hey, hey, look at that view." I can remember my brother being so disgusted and I just thought, "Ghee that's, they must just be nuts." Here I was [inaudible at 1:29:53.4]... and they're doing this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well where are your feelings in that, I'm not clear? It sounds like you didn't know what the hell they were talking about?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I mean, yeah. But then I realized what they were talking about. My brother, my own brother was looking... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:30:09.8]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: ...up my dress. Now, he was really mad to think that...because what he was trying to do was show everybody that he could lift his sister with his bare hands. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: So he was mad too and I probably wouldn't have even known if I hadn't of witnessed his reaction, was so violent really.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Tell me what you men by violent?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he really got made at this guy and I don't think it, not because of me, I'm sure.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, I was just disgusted at that...tender age, it was probably in sixth grade, and he wasn't looking up his sister's dress, that's for sure.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, it sounds like you still have feelings about that and I'm not sure... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what my feelings are, except that all of these little things I remember.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess that's probably where I started hating men. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just think of it, of those... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that sounds to me like being on exhibition for those people [inaudible at 1:31:29.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's like that whole year that's what I was, on exhibition for the whole damn school. I mean, it's like I couldn't do Anything but what somebody was going, "Woo, woo!"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't even go to the bathroom without having [inaudible at 1:31:49.9]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Without having the whole group... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...practically the whole eighth grade at that time was out there. Some of them were 15 and they were in the eighth grade. Now, you think they would have known better if I didn't. I think at four years old it was kind of a way of getting attention...nobody ever beat me up or Anything. No, they were too busy watching me go to the bathroom. I had a safe year, no one attacked me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like they were keeping you moving and laugh at you?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. They put a lizard in my dinner pail one time but (chuckling) but other than that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So, it sounds like you're saying, "So, in some way I got off scot free and yet in another way I had to keep guard." Do you know?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I do. Well, I knew I didn't get, like a lot of the kids that year got punched a lot.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But the big boys always protected me because I was the one they were going to...getting ready to watch go to the bathroom.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: But maybe I think they're really dumb, because I always had my dress pulled down and I don't think they could ever see Anything. Well that is kind of stupid. (chuckling) To take your time out to come watch somebody strip.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because they weren't getting it?

</p><p>PATIENT: They weren't getting Anything but they... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Exactly, just that little broad there, just not right now.] (ph) [1:33:39.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what I think of that. I think they were a bunch of nuts again. But it really gripes me...like that they would do that to a four year old girl.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel like indignation for that girl or... 

</p><p>PATIENT: For that girl.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...or for, pity for that girl and indignation that they'd do something to her like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. But it's like...if you're 15 and you're still in the eighth grade, maybe there's a little something to be said there, too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it can explain the boys, like sort of excuse them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think they were all guilty. (chuckling) All in the same family or something. But I do wonder why me? I guess I was the only one. And I can remember them saying, "Don't tell Anyone." And I thought...what am I going to tell? (chuckling) I should have, that would have been kind of choice (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, got them into a little bit of trouble.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Oh, I see.] (ph) [1:35:10.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd probably been beaten until I couldn't walk. Yeah, but I didn't feel like I...I wondered at that when they said, "Don't tell." So I must have...I mean, like I knew they weren't supposed to be there but it really didn't bother me all that much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yes. You knew they weren't supposed to be there because they were afraid you were going to tell someone?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because they said, "Don't tell."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If they hadn't said that you wouldn't have known?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not, well, the way they said, like I can remember they said, "You ask to be excused and then we'll come out." And I thought, "Okay."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it, yeah, it sounds like they had something, like there was a hint of something, because certainly it wasn't hurting you at all, what they were doing?

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you couldn't help in that. You couldn't help them attain these [inaudible at 1:36:14.6]... or something.

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [What were you doing there?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: But I'm not, I guess you don't like to sit on the toilet seat and be laughed at either...even at four years old. You think you're doing something funny and you're just sitting there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, so that made you feel uncomfortable to a degree, [did it, being lied to?] (ph) [1:36:38.3]

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't think, like it was even that. If it had of effected me in that way, I would have at least told my mother. Because I'm sure they hadn't threatened to beat me or Anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They hadn't threatened you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't think so. I mean, I don't remember that. It was just sort of like getting in their good graces, which was always nice...because the big boys would put you on the swing or carry you on their back or something wonderful at recess time or protect you from your brothers. (chuckling) Or a lot of things, they just came in real handy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So, it sounds like you got, in a sense you got payment or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I worked them more than they worked me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. But you're, so in a sense it's that should give you a measure of satisfaction?

</p><p>PATIENT: It does kind of, when I look back on it. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because it almost sounds like you aren't...okay, so you say, in an ultimate way, you worked them more than they worked you? [Well, it sounds like, I can't tell exactly Jessica, if you're, like you're angry at you or...] (ph) [1:38:08.4] 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not angry at myself I don't think.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [They are there...] (ph) [1:38:19.4]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [...your dress pulled up?]

</p><p>PATIENT: Disgusted probably, that they would pull a stunt like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, especially with being the [inaudible at 1:38:28.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but that still is explained because they were [inaudible at 1:38:32.1]... they were...for boys.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's all...like even when I think of four years old, I liked the attention that was given...and here I had a really big audience and I didn't have to do Anything. I mean, I didn't have to sing or dance or perform in Any way. (chuckling) I would perform, yes, and sat there on my throne.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it was like, you didn't have to be accompanied. You didn't have to do Anything special to be with them?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. (continuing vibrating noise of some kind) Those were the good old days come to think of it. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Those days could go on forever?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, now I have to get out there and work for my attention. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Now that your attention is down to sort of nothing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I never had to do Anything special and I was always the center of attention because I had these horrible braces. And I could not walk into a movie theater in our town until the lights were off, because there were a couple of real clods that would point and call me 'Brace Face' until the lights went off and the movie went on. You know, I would come out crying. Those were in the days when we paid 10 cents by the way for all the movies. And my mother would say, "Well, you know what they're like and you know how cruel children can be." Well, here I was a child and it's like, I wouldn't not go to the movies, because I knew I was going to be ridiculed. But I would, after the first time, I waited until the lights were off before I went in.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:40:41.3]... Yeah?

</p><p>PATIENT: But I think my folks should have gone in with me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what I was going to say. It sounds like, if you were my baby, [help you along?] (ph) (continuing vibrating noise)

</p><p>PATIENT: They didn't help. And I don't, like my father went through it...all of his life, he was teased by all of the kids and he still, to this day, sits like this. So he should've known, instead of saying, "Well..." You know, maybe to himself, "Well, I had to do it, so it builds character." That's my parent's favorite thing. "If you have to do something hard it will build your character." I have got so much character (chuckling) it is just overflowing, for the things I had to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:41:29.6]... hell when you were a kid... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...doing chores and stuff?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not really, they let me lay around and get fat when I was a kid, my brothers had to do all that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Where do you get your character from?

</p><p>PATIENT: From going to movies, from going to town on Wednesday and Saturday nights that... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh.

</p><p>PATIENT: But it wasn't like your... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:41:51.5]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like even just going to the movies by myself...like my brothers wouldn't go in with me. I mean, who would be caught dead with your sister? And they would probably be, my older brothers... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, you could take yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) Yeah, they'd probably what, be one of those saying, "Yeah, here comes old Brace Face...let's really give it to her."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: My older brother would, my little brother fought like a little rooster for me most of the time. You know, but it seems to me like, even though my mother didn't like movies, that she should have been the one that went in with me...for 10 cents or 17 cents for adults, she could have come back out.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it is almost as if she didn't care to hear enough about you, even to do that like minimal, minimal thing. Like it wasn't Anything off with, from her, it was like... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it wasn't like, it wasn't the extent.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like if you went here, now days.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure and two fifty is a lot.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: However you want to category these things, I mean that's... 

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't even think it was in those days.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And yet she went, she like let you go through all of that.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I know like she knew it, because every time there was a movie I'd come out crying.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So she even knew what you were going through?

</p><p>PATIENT: And I can remember this one thing she said. She told me what this man had said about me, that I had pretty eyes, and I just cried and cried and cried. I mean, like that was the only thing he could say because I was so ugly. (chuckling) I mean...you'd have to really look. It's a wonder he didn't say, "Her ears are cute." (chuckling) Looked bad, bad.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really had to go to great lengths to find Anything about you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Really...like he was the sort of man that was always standing around bragging about his children and I supposed he looked around and saw me and he was shocked. He couldn't say I was cute, since I was really fat and I had these glasses and braces. And my mother did the worse thing to my hair you could ever believe. You know, I always thought I had a happy childhood but I really didn't. I had a horrible childhood. (making noise) I really hated to be me. You know, like I liked to go because I really have always liked people, so there wasn't that, that I could stay home and be just as happy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, I always wanted, you said, I always liked to go?

</p><p>PATIENT: To go...like... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To town?

</p><p>PATIENT: ...to town.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You liked it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I really...like I didn't have the willpower to stay home, even though I knew that I wasn't going to, that if I went into the movies alone, I was really going to be humiliated, before the flick started and then at intermission. My mother would've had to stay through the whole show, as a matter of fact, because they turned the lights on at intermission and I just had to crawl under the seat. [1:45:25.8]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like, I just wish like you could see and visit her that this... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah (ph). I was just wondering whatever happened to jerk that lead the pack.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The finger pointing guy that did this?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I could drive him, yeah, I could run over him today with no feeling of remorse at all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like roll over in front of you, anger and hatred that you felt then, you feel now because of this guy?

</p><p>PATIENT: I still can't stand him. I mean, you know kids are cruel, but I'm teaching my kids not to be. I don't think that follows, that all, the kids are born cruel. That's just a lousy excuse for mothers who don't watch their children or don't teach them compassion or show them compassion for people with afflictions. (chuckling) And I had one or two, except for my beautiful eyes. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And you know that's something I can't stand to this day, are kids teasing because I just had so much of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like when you knew people [inaudible at 1:47:13.1]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Ooh, I get so mad. Because most of the time it's nothing they can do Anything about, the kids I mean.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, all of the time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. They're like afflictions that their, it's like a characteristic they're helpless to change, like wearing glasses or... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, even sucking their thumbs, that's not the child, it's [inaudible at 1:47:41.8]... (continuous vibrating noise) But I've only, I've just caught my girls doing that once, she's never again behaved like that, teasing a little girl.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, oh.

</p><p>PATIENT: And calling her a cry baby. I mean, that's not so terrible but it's not helping the situation either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nothing terrible but like it's enough that you don't like it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, like she, and I said to the neighbor, she came out and said, "What was the matter?" (phone ringing) And I said, "These little girls were down taking this, calling this little girl a cry baby." And she said, "Well, she is." You know, I'd like to hit her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: "You old thing you."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's serious (ph) to you, her against you, saying to you [inaudible at 1:48:43.3]... something like, somebody should have given you [inaudible]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no. Yeah, this little girl, this mother's little girl now has glasses. I wonder if she'd feel the same way if the kids started in on that?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Give her a dose of her own medicine? [inaudible at 1:49:04.7]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, she wouldn't be real cool about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I would've been a lot better off if I had just stayed home on Saturday and Wednesday night, because other than that, I don't have Any bad memories...of my school days. My fourth, when I was four that was [inaudible at 1:49:43.5]... good deal.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean, other than that you don't remember being teased?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, not in my school I wasn't teased.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because...like they had kind of grown up with me and they knew what I looked like and it didn't offend them like it did this kid in town.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it sounds like though, the kids you grew up with really made allowances for, [maybe your weight?] (ph) [1:50:14.9] (continuous vibrating noise)

</p><p>PATIENT: Or but, yeah, they didn't even notice that I had baby fat because I'd had been big since I'd...when I was a baby. (chuckling) The knew what I looked like and it didn't bother them like it did this kid in town that couldn't stand it. (chuckling) It drove him nuts I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, and that's what I'm hearing, like this, is, like he really found you offensive [inaudible at 1:50:44.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess he didn't want me around, yeah. That's not half to what I found him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, he was just... 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, he was kind of a poor specimen.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Misspent youth?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he was, yeah, he had parents that were really old...and he'd been let run forever.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible at 1:51:22.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: And, yeah, there was something lacking in him because of...like nobody else would have said Anything I don't believe. He was the one that started it and the other fellows thought, "Well, what the heck, might as well." But it was always Dan that started. And I still would like to punch him. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, I hear you...like, hearing your duress...like saying, "Well, he's a poor specimen and they let him run and it's all very understandable. I'd kill him right now!"

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Well, I wouldn't mind...I don't think it would be a great loss to Anyone.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Go off on him like a book (ph)? [inaudible at 1:52:14.6]...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, probably I could. I could probably...like if I saw him out of gas, I could probably drive right by...let him walk two or three miles. I don't think I could ever wound him, unless I had a really good alibi and I knew I could never get caught. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you... 

</p><p>PATIENT: He might be able to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you talk to me if I become Dan?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, because I wouldn't say Anything to him. I've seen him since he's grown into manhood I think. Well, like say when he was graduated from high school and I just sort of ignored him. (chuckling) You're beginning to look more and more like him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what do you want to tell him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Nothing, I don't want to say Anything to him, except I...like, no, but I wouldn't even say that. Like I hope he gets it back a hundred fold. I don't generally, I never say Anything to people to make them mad. You know, every so...if I'm insulting or sarcastic, it's purely accidental. I mean, it happens a lot of times because I don't think before I talk, but I don't say that I'm looking for, I don't say things to hurt people's feelings. [inaudible at 1:53:53.0]... even Dan [would not be exciting to do that to.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know like you say, [inaudible at 1:54:02.4]... to do something like that... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think it's that I've really gone through much more than a lot of people have. I mean, if you were born beautiful and just kind of floated through life, because you could never know what it was really like to have people picking on you and you were never quite safe unless it would start (ph). You know, like you couldn't even laugh and enjoy yourself because...somebody's going to throw something at you or taunt you or Any... I found my brother and some other big fellows picking on a mentally retarded fellow, and I was so angry with him and I tried to make him stop. But I just wanted this guy to just go berserk and just knock the shit out of him, just once...maybe [sort of easy.] (ph) [1:54:58.4]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I never would.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, like you were always on the receiving end and never able to [inaudible at 1:55:08.8]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But like that's not the way you attack...like if I would do that, it would look like a little wet hen going in like this and the fellows would go like them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You [have those feelings, responses though?] (ph) [1:55:26.2]

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I mean, I would like to take judo or karate or something. Now that I might be able to do to Dan [inaudible at 1:55:37.0]... you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... that's sort of like shooting him or something. It's something that doesn't take Any great power to do, it's just critics (ph) or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's like, you couldn't be sent to jail for doing what I would like to do to him, if I threw him on his back and stepped on him or something. (chuckling) Yeah, that I wouldn't mind doing to him. But I mean, it's like succeeding (ph), that's so final.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you'd like him to [inaudible at 1:56:09.3]... your punches and not just... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wouldn't mind if he had, like a broken arm or broken leg, arm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I wouldn't really mind...like if he was crippled and people went around and said, "Hey, crip!"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, I would never say it to him. I wouldn't be the first one that said, "Hey, crip!" But I might... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You stood watching it? [inaudible at 1:56:34.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd go along. I would just kind of go by and watch it. (both chuckling) I probably wouldn't even laugh out loud.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. At his [inaudible at 1:56:43.6]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd just be very... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... what you gave me.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think...like she finally got it, his wife divorced him. But it not that same thing, not because he was...different or Anything, just because he couldn't live with her or she couldn't live with him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [inaudible at 1:57:13.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: He probably suffered some pain.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not enough and not the right kind?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not the right kind, but it'll do until something else comes along.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't care a fig for him. (both chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All right and it's making me laugh because I thought to write the understatement of the twentieth century. It sounds like you do care a fig for him. Like you care a fig that he would run that onto me... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. The, yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...just to be laughed at or... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Or Anything, except that I won't be around to enjoy it...he's like in Florida or someplace, and but I have...like I have kind of kept tabs on him. (chuckling) I know where he is. I don't know where Anybody that I really like is. (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like it sounds like he's (ph) staying very naive. This guy has a special meaning to you...so like gone (ph) down and if you know where he is... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, and...like even when I was in high school and my teeth were straightened and I didn't have braces on, he'd still come by and say, "Hello, Brace Face." And at the time I said, "Ooh, you idiot." But it really hurt my feelings and often I would go into the restroom and cry because Dan had done it again. He had sort of this kind of ability to get under my skin, you know?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What was it about what he did that did that? "And you had to just hurt me and it's just, he made me feel horrible." How come?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because he remembered it I guess. I mean, like if you knew that he really knew you when. And like everybody else did but they kind of forgot about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I guess, was it like some how he knew the truth or [inaudible at 1:59:17.5]...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it was, because I mean, you could see that he would never let me forget that I had braces.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But you didn't have braces?

</p><p>PATIENT: But I had braces.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Had, had, yeah. And I figure you [inaudible at 1:59:36.5]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, at that particular time, yeah. But nothing had ever, like Anybody else said, my mother gave me a permanent one time when I was in high school that was so fuzzy, and the boys would say, "Hello, Fuzzy!" And that never affected me...because they were friends. And they thought, "Well, we'll tease her because she's such a good old sport."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That story has a nice feeling to it? [inaudible at 2:00:11.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but braces. I mean, like you hair is something you can do something with later on...and like even...like the girls were all friends and I had dates, even with fuzzy hair. It wasn't that repulsive to me as braces are. Or the fact that I wasn't protected from my ugliness by my parents. I think they really let me down.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's like, it sounds like, very important to you that some how they just let you take off to town, I mean, wouldn't help you [inaudible at 2:01:00.2]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think it's just unreal that my father had gone through 29 years of that and he... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And did not tell them [inaudible at 2:01:12.3]... that it was happening to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it just never happened to him because he happened to be a male and he could fight.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh.

</p><p>PATIENT: And my mother would always say, "Your father went through this and he just developed a splendid personality, and everybody thinks he's so great." You know and, "He didn't let his braces stand in the way of getting along with people or getting his feelings hurt." But he has had his feelings hurt, I know, or you wouldn't sit like this... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...to cover up your mouth.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Also, it must have been to him, like oh, the tough act to follow, what you believed or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think I believe that. I just think that she never had Any, she didn't have to carry around a mouthful of crooked teeth.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She couldn't [inaudible at 2:02:08.6]... you?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. She didn't really know, she still doesn't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: My girls, it's not going to be that though. She's already got crooked teeth.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're going to be good to her [inaudible at 2:02:24.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know how you do that. I mean, I know how my mother could've done it. And I can remember her telling me about the ugly duckling stage. I never believed that crap either, because I...I had friends that were really cute when they were...when I was going through the ugly duckling stage, they were all cute. How'd that, (chuckling) how's that work? They just pick out one ugly duckling? (laughing)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, maybe. [inaudible at 2:02:54.2]... So it doesn't sound like Anything she was saying to you was right?

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't believe Any of it...like you kind of hope that some day you'd...emerge a swan, but you just have to go through it. You know and I've heard others...some of my friends would say, "Oh, I was so tall and skinny and I could...everybody teased me." And I'd think, "Gosh, it that's all I had, to be tall and skinny, I would have traded places with them." I mean, who says, "Look at tall and skinny." Well, Dan probably would. (chuckling) There must have been something about us two together that... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I don't know what I could've done to him that upset him so. Just being around I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, [inaudible at 2:03:58.0]... because he like physically [inaudible]... like he found you physically disgusting but I thought you said he was poor?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I wonder how come just he was the only one? His mother must have been frightened by braces when she was carrying him. I wonder if that would cleanse my soul or something, to cripple Dan [inaudible at 2:04:51.4]... (chuckling)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it would just feel damn good, whether it would cleanse your soul or not.

</p><p>PATIENT: Ooh, that would, yeah. I mean, [inaudible at 2:04:59.0]... weird to view (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: See you Tuesday.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, [inaudible at 2:05:07.8]... [audio fuzzes from 2:05:10.2 to end]

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's start.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's see. I started adding to the letter I wrote yesterday. I've just been so busy trying to get things ready for the move and packing and really just getting a little bit stressed out about that but it's a lot of pinpoint accuracy between what I do here until I go, so. But yes...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel about moving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Out of the country? Well I'm excited about it but I'm also, I'm just curious how well I'll be able to maintain relationships that far away. My brother has some friends and such. On the one hand, they haven't - some of them have moved up state, for sure, but none of them have moved out of the country with the intent of staying out of the country.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that your intent?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For a while, yes. I mean, it's not just stay out of the country it's to live in another place so I mean it's a more positive twist on it. And yet they - I don't see myself as a role model for them but I do see my actions being determined and delivered and for me and not beholden to I think what somebody else wants. But yes, I mean I'm excited about everything, that's why I frankly can't wait for it to happen and because there's such a push up to the point, I had to write a letter to a veterinarian last night to try to get my dog a pet passport. It's just one thing after another but it's... [00:03:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A logistic you hadn't thought about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I won't get into Virgin Atlantic's rules of flying to the U.K. versus flying to France but it's just bizarre.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've had to learn it apparently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, and - well I'll give you a spin. So in order to fly - Virgin won't fly pets to the U.K. in the cabin or under in the same flight but you can do cargo. But cargo won't let you fly them unless the ground temperature on both sides is 75 degrees or less. So in the summer...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't guarantee that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And so you have to bring the dog in, bring it home; bring it there, bring it back, until they say okay yes, it's 68 degrees and whatever. So it's a bit of a headache. And then you never know when your dog's going to go so you have to line up with your sister-in-law at the other end. Nightmare. It's a headache and my dog doesn't realize how much effort I'm putting into it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not getting any gratitude.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing, nothing, he just sleeps. So, yes, it's a logistical nightmare and, but I signed up for it so it's all part of the baggage. But I am excited, I really am and I don't know how everything will shake out, I won't know I guess until I get there. But to me I think these are the things I live for. I guess you could call it adventure but I guess would like to call it just living deliberately. [00:05:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels most important to talk about today because I know we'll be a while. I double-checked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really will be a while before our next session this time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, that's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then there's not that many meetings in August before you go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think to just touch on the letter of my day a little bit. I think it's in hand but the things I added, not a bunch, but just the things I added are things that have been kicking around in my head for a while and the things we've talked about in that part of it is just to say in our family we've been prone to not bring up things that might hurt somebody or just to avoid confrontation. And I said I can't do that anymore because this will only distance us further and I don't know if this letter may hurt you; that is a risk I have to take. I can't control that but I would hope that you would want to know what's going on with me and know that my intent behind this is so that we can have a real relationship now on just to varnish with jokes and evasive action. [00:07:52]</p>

<p>I think, I'm still working on that, but I added that and I also added the fact that in the past year and a half since I've started the letter I've had a chance to reflect on things that I hadn't been able to see before, which include how he dealt with living in a community that odds are they knew what happened and he didn't leave. And I said I know I probably would've moved far away. And also every time he looks at Mom, how does he deal with that without feeling like he's betrayed her each time he looks at her? I said I feel that way myself. And it's - and I think I closed by saying you know that you probably were so wound up in your own concerns and fears that you didn't realize that I had concerns and fears that were going unnoticed or unaddressed. So that's where I come in. [00:09:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like a really balanced letter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's getting there. The part that I'm struggling with is the issues before. I think I told you about the fairly intensive workshop I did in May 2010. And a lot of that, a lot of what was stirred up in that whether or not it was in the letter to as far as how I don't think he really wanted to be married during this; hands off to the point of negligence. And in some ways the letter is - I'm just trying to weigh how much of that I want to put in there, how much of it matters, because some of it's kind of condemning. I'd like to, what I need to do is print the whole thing out and just read it and edit it and see overall how balanced it is because I want it to be balanced. And I think it's got merit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You put a lot of work into it, put a lot of thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that is work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is, I know. I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't have to be on paper to count. The time that you've sat with it and thinking about what you want to put into it and how you want it to come across that all matters and I think it will be reflected in what you end up printing out given time. [00:11:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess that's where I am with that. I guess what I'll probably do is work on it the next time until I see you again. Maybe I'll e-mail it to you before, especially now that I won't see you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're certainly welcome to as I said before. I'm happy to read it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. So yes, that's that. I'm not sure where we left off last week with, where I even said l was last week with my attraction to you. So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Last week we talked a little bit about what you imagined it being like to sort of carry that and not have that, to still feel that when we end. I guess I'm also curious about your intentions with regard to whether or not you'll enter into therapy when you get to Paris because - and I'm wondering about that because working through what it meant to be attracted to me with another therapist is I think another way of working on your fantasies in general but also what it meant to be attracted to your therapist. [00:13:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I'm not sure yet. I mean in some ways it depends on just time and availability, where I am and what the services are offered. Just, I don't know. I don't think it's something I'll start up as soon as I land but I don't know. In some ways I just kind of wonder having been over there a few times, things are just so - they seem to be - it seems like oh yes, it's just like here but there's so many things that are so different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it's not the same just because it's a similar culture. It's a different culture and customs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and different, yes, ideas of how things work and how things are done. So I don't know. I mean I'll obviously go to a therapist over there it's certainly true I'm sure, but to me the French sensibility is so different. I guess that's a generalization of course but, so I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there are definitely differences in sensitivities when doing cross cultural therapy and even I think a lot of times it gets minimized the differences between European culture and American cultures but it is two different cultures. And if you do enter into therapy, part of the work is being attuned to those cultural differences. And even though it may not be as visibly evident as when you're working with someone that has a different language or a different skin color, there still are cultural differences that need to be part of the work so that you feel well understood and you don't feel judged. [00:15:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's just it. If I say this is how and they said what are you crazy? Are you some sort of creep? And, so yes I don't know what to expect but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's an unlikely reaction with a therapist. Even a European therapist but I understand...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand your fear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's not a fully honest fear but it's something along those lines. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Give it, yes. Give yourself time to feel it out. You might also find an ex-pat community that may have some links to American-born therapist or people that work heavily with the ex-pat community there. Usually there are pockets that you can find your way into.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. But I guess I just wonder how much of the background I'm going to give on this. There's the whole thing with my dad and my sister and this with my wife and then there's this and it's like how - I suppose that just remains to be seen how much needs to be divulged. But... [00:17:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if you do decide to go forward and pick up and start there with someone new, you can also use me in order to alleviate some of the burden of going through all the history because I'm happy to, if you sign a release of information, I can send...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh okay, sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...a treatment summary that will highlight some of the main things we've talked about. Most therapist do also like to hear in the client's own words because it's different than my - my perspective on what you've done and your perspective is different. But that could help us sort of bridge some of the gaps so you don't feel like - you don't need to reiterate all the work you've done in the past year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, okay good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's time consuming and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes that's just, not as far as a big concern for starting up with [a set of] (ph) styles but just the limited time that's left. Well that's good to know. So is that something I need to sign before I leave?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No you can - when you hook up with someone new they'll have, they should have a form that allows for communication both ways and then you just fax me a copy or send me a copy and I keep it. One copy in my record and one copy in yours and nobody gets sued for breaking your confidentiality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it also gives you a chance if there - to put some limits also on what's shared too. So when you share a release of information you can put limits around topics, contents, dates of treatment, things like that. So things you want to be thoughtful about or you can say whatever, the entire length of treatment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I'm not sure I remember the dates of when I touched on certain things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, of course you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yes, to me it's all relevant or all irrelevant. Each case is different so. I'm not sure what else I need to say but - I had a question that I thought about earlier today and just out of curiosity. So you know about all these psychological issues and studied it and worked through it with clients. So, and if this is too personal you don't need to answer it of course, but how do you turn off the therapist and switch to being - are you aware when you're exhibiting your own - I mean things that you study or treat people for. I mean does - do you know what I mean? Or your interactions with people, I mean is it just like do you find it hard not to analyze them without - just out of habit? [00:21:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Short answer, no because I'm not always at work. So I mean I think when I'm living my own life, I think I may be attuned. I think I'm a fairly empathic person in my office and outside of my office and I don't think that comes from being a therapist. I think I'm a therapist because I pay attention to that stuff anyway. I think it's part of what led me to want to do the work I do. So that doesn't feel different for me. I don't think that I - I don't unwittingly analyze the people in my life. There are certainly times if I - that I do it on purpose. You know, what's going on in this situation, why is this happening, but I don't think it happens without - I don't think it happens all the time or without my knowledge of it. My awareness of myself, I'm looking in at one person. Sometimes I am blissfully unaware of whatever neuroses I'm exhibiting, sometimes I'm aware of it, and I think it happens in everyone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Interesting. I'm just curious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you ask?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess the same as the carpenter's house is the one always falling apart, whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No time to work on your own stuff. [00:23:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I just wondered if it gives you an advantage in your private life, being able to acknowledge an insecurity or neurosis or something. And what that must be like if it does. But I guess I should say it had less to do with you in specific but just therapists in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we're all different, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? It's probably true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting because I think part of your question sort of hints at this idea that I think you do carry around with you. That at some point you're sort of done and you have this stuff under your belt and it's perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I don't know. Well I mean, yes perhaps that's true. I don't know but I think for someone who's practicing regularly it's probably something that's very well-oiled to be able to identify these things and for someone like me it's sure between when I leave here and whenever I pick up again, I'll be very rusty at these things and so I - I don't know that I feel like I'm going to - I think at one time I did feel like it was going to be something I just had to do and then I'll be healthy or something and I'll be able to handle these things in a mindful way or a reasonable way. [00:25:12]</p>

<p>But, yes I think - and sometimes I despair in a little bit in that. And I know people who have been working on things for decades and I just don't know how excited I am to be doing that if that's my future. And is it an appropriate assumption to think that what do I have to work on now in order to not be working on these things in 10 years. I think the stuff with my dad is the stuff that will help. And I don't know I guess lately it just seems to me that as I work through the things with my dad, that the realization that to be human is to be imperfect and what I mean by imperfect is perfect being the verb, like complete, completed. And so it's an ongoing process shaped by everything we've experienced. And we can't choose what we've experienced.</p>

<p>And so I think about my dad, I think about what shaped him and how he probably didn't want to do things he did. But he did and there are a whole array of influences and circumstances that led to that and just as much an array of consequences. So I don't know if these circumstances gives birth to something like that that gives birth to circumstances that form me and then what I do forms circumstances that shapes somebody else. I don't know. I guess that's kind of what I've been thinking about lately was just him and I guess as I have compassion for him I think I also - I tend to forget this but I also deserve compassion in my own circumstances. [00:28:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's the biggest piece for you is being able to hold onto that. Being able to equally have compassion for others and hold onto what it is that allows you to also feel compassion for yourself. And I think, I was sort of thinking about the question that you asked in different ways as you were talking, and I think about being non-judgmental. And I think for you compassion for yourself is being non-judgmental about yourself because I don't think you struggle to the same degree about being non-judgmental of others as you do about being judgmental of yourself.</p>

<p>That's the piece for you that's always going to be something you need to keep in mind because it's easy to slip into very critical thoughts about yourself. And I think that'll be something that you've certainly gained a lot of control over in noticing those critical thoughts and leaving (ph) you to come up with less critical thoughts and being more compassionate. And that's what's going to get rusty if you don't think about it and slip back into those critical thoughts and believe them without questioning. But that's not something that has to happen. That's something - you don't need to do therapy to remember that. You just need to be mindful of that. [00:29:39]</p>

<p>And that's something that you can hold onto and will be a big difference to you over the course of your life. But it's never going - you're never going to be done remembering to be compassionate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, hopefully it'll just get [evened out] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it'll get easier. The more you practice it, the easier it'll come. It's not always going to be such a task but it's something you're always going to have to do. And I think that's one of the things that when I'm sitting in the therapist chair it's easy for me to be non-judgmental of others and to be able to see things from a lot of different perspectives. But it's something - I walk in, I know I'm at work - it's one of the skills that I put on. Does that always happen outside? Most of the time but not always. There are times I forget.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially in traffic around here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard. Yes, no I read - I think we've identified that for me the first instinct is to be judgmental of myself. It's kind of interesting now that I think about it because for a long time I've tried to influence my wife's thinking about being so quick to judge other people. And as I think about that she has influenced me in trying to be less judgmental of myself. So that's - because she I think has learned to get for herself it's almost as though we have opposite but complimentary issues and skills. [00:31:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, but you can really help each other to develop the skills that you want, that need strengthening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't think I realized that until just now as far as just that her skill is almost the reverse of mine. And I guess just as quickly as she is to judge whoever, I am willing to give someone the benefit of the doubt and just as quickly I am to judge myself she's willing to give herself the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that's part of what drew you together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I can't say I can think of anything else for months, years that suggests that but maybe it's just the way things turned out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in any case, whatever it was that drew you together it's certainly something that - think about goals you have for your growth as you leave here, knowing that you have this built-in mechanism between the two of you to be able to solidify some of the skills you've been working on to keep that present. [00:33:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Plenty of time left. I think it's - I guess just as an aside I came across my blue folder, all the handouts from the DBT last night. And it's been something that's been on the shelf, and not to say on the shelf, but within reach specifically for a long time because I don't want to forget those things, I don't want to forget that there's a lot of good information in those handouts. And so it's obviously something I'm going to take with me, literally with me. And I guess I want to be able to bring those things so that they're in the forefront of my mind and not a distance memory that comes up to me in a few years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that group is a really good match for the way that you were working in here and in your time, in your own world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and that actually might be something, might be a way in France to kind of connect with the [inaudible at 00:34:59] and see what ....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yes finding a sort of dignity group or skills based group. A lot of skills based groups use the DBT skills. They get morphed into other things because they just work. They work really well and they work in a lot of different ways. You often find, if you find a mindfulness group or a meditation group, you often find those skills are being used in there. What do you think are some ways that you can keep the stuff that's in the blue folder popping up to your consciousness rather than on the shelf because they work wonderfully but not through osmosis. [00:35:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I see, I see. I suppose I could just put it upon the kitchen table where we have breakfast and just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, one place you're going to really see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and to that end put it some place where I could start my day with something edifying, not something condemning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you use Google alerts or reminders in your phone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can have them pop up for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Set an 8:00 reminder. Instead of saying appointment with Dr. Tran, have it say...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, oh, I see. I thought you meant the message can pop up for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you can set your messages to be something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Custom?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's probably an app for it too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are actually a few good mindfulness apps out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that does actually work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just calls it to your attention; it brings it to the forefront. And it doesn't have to be something you spend a ton of time on. But if you get a reminder, breathe deep 10:00, it will remind you to take a deep breath right then. [00:37:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You may laugh but I have this app that tells me, reminds me to drink water throughout the day because I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I won't laugh at all. It's a good healthy skill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can go hours and hours without drinking water and only drinking coffee and I'll say why do I have a headache. But it has actually forced me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it reminds you to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It helped me actually stay far more hydrated than I ever have been in my life so it's, so yes it worked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And now you feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it, I mean it's definitely, it's a reminder. It brings it to the forefront to your mind. It forces you to think about what you decided was important when you weren't distracted by the other seven things going on in that moment. And so setting an appointment reminder to breathe. Or you can set that as a recurring appointment that happens at 10 and 4.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at five times a day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And every time you hear that or see it, it would just kind of force you to reflect for a minute oh yes that was important to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, certainly some apps you can get to the point where it's like oh just stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and that's - so then you change it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yes. But I do have this dream of having a morning where I get up and then I take the time to do things that I know are important. And I don't know right now - I say right now but it's been right now such and such for a long time but it's a different set of circumstances - but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how can you set yourself up for success in the next place? What do you need to do to make that dream more achievable? [00:39:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well for one thing I have a lot less crap in my life. I'm selling a lot of stuff, which is actually a really liberating feeling. I mean there's so much stuff that, I mean books that you want to read that you've never - you've held onto it for five years, ten years and you still haven't read it. It's like okay, I have to let this go. And clothes that you liked the idea of wearing but you never actually put on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and letting go of these expectations. I mean really those are expectations that aren't appropriate. If you haven't read it in 10 years or if you haven't worn it all year, then it's not right for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I'm wondering how can I bring that to other parts of my life but I don't know yet and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, so I think one way to think about that is there are there goals or shoulds that you have in mind that continually make it to the list or the next list and never get checked off? Rather than berating yourself for not checking them off, it's questioning well is it really an appropriate expectation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That is true and I'll have to think about that because there are lots of things, not lots but there are probably five or six things that - like the letter to my dad, like this letter I have to send off to my professor and like things like that - that just weigh on me and I don't know. I don't want to do them but the weight of them - I guess I wondered if I want to be free of the weight more than I don't want to do the task. And I guess I don't know. [00:41:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what it is that makes you not want to do those things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. Sometimes I think that I don't like to think because that's work. Does that make sense? I mean it forces me to make decisions and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's different than thinking. I was surprised when you said don't like to think because I feel like you think through things quite a bit. But making decisions is a little bit different than thinking. It's the next step because when you make a decision you actually cross, you stop certain lines of thought and you choose one. I wonder what feels weightier for you, the thinking or the allowing yourself to stop the process?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do think a lot. Maybe it's just that I need a break sometimes. Those things don't seem like a break. But it's kind of like the scene where people are writing a paper, you just don't want to do it, you put it off. And it's why is it that you put it off? Because you have to critically think? No, when I think about it, no I do like to think about things because you have breakthroughs. What is it? Is it the writing? Perhaps, but more than anything else it's just like the daunting girth that I put on it that I don't know. It's just overbearing. But I can never pinpoint what it is exactly except that I fear the horror. I don't know. It's with everything though so, it's - it seems like anything I can be held responsible for, whether it be a song or a letter requesting something or a letter to my dad or a paper... [00:44:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The product. It's not the process that you're afraid of it sounds like it's the product, which forces a commitment. Committing yourself to a single argument in a paper or a finished song.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, or a - yes. What I'm wondering about is are these things truly finished? I think about Hebrew. I'm not taking lessons right now and I feel so out of it in the past week because I've been so busy with these things that I know it's something that I have to keep doing and you've never done, like therapy. And yet I guess I'm just wondering if each of these things that I have to do is just along its own thread a continuation of the next. And this letter I have to write to a professor asking him to help me with something and my going abroad is an extension of that project because I have to explain that project and finishing that research, summaries is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're all connected. [00:46:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...again is something that is, it's never really done. You can never say well I'll never have to do that again. It's always something to be continued, I don't know. And I know I've never been good at doing things regularly. It's like, I'll clean my room - when I was younger - I'll clean my room and say oh it's done. I'll never have to do that again; this will never get messy again. And the idea of doing something regularly it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Circular tasks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and it's funny because I actually have been getting better about going to the gym. I've been 8 times in the past 2-1/2 weeks and it's something that's becoming routine. I mean there's no question about it any more. I may not like it but you leave the gym with the feeling of having done something good. Each one of these things you're leaving with the feeling that you've accomplished something, that you've done something good. And I guess I just need to think about that a little bit more. [00:47:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and that's what keeps you going and I think that's has been hard for you is that allowing yourself to hold onto that feeling of accomplishment for doing something. Even though it's a repeated circular type of task, it's the good feeling that makes us want to do it again. And that's something that when we first started meeting it was really hard for you to let yourself feel good about something. If you had played for a while, you felt good for maybe a millisecond before you said to yourself but I don't really have time to do that again so what was the point of practicing? Why pick up the sax now if I know that I'm not going to have time to do it when finals come around. So you didn't get to experience the good prideful feeling. And if you can allow that feeling to seep in, it will carry you forward to want, you want to chase that feeling again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, I guess that's just the crux of it is how do I let that feeling seep in? How do I - how is it that I [inaudible at 00:48:17] know that I'm going to exercise again today and on Wednesday and on Friday and yet I really don't think that I'm going to pick up a saxophone today or tomorrow or Wednesday? I don't know what it is. And it's not as though I have my workout clothes just on a hanger on the door that it's just ready to go or it's not like I'm going to put them on on those days that I'm going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you've developed a belief in yourself that you'll go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So that made it easier to do it and I don't know. [00:49:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you let yourself believe in yourself in that area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, with that, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, somehow you'll transfer that to the next area too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, not a complete transfer but a partial...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Extend, you'll extend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So I'm going to have to think about what it is about that that's allowed me to - in some ways it's just time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Well you can't do everything all at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I mean when I was in school going to the gym was harder. And as this move has taken over so much of my life and my attention I think it's also led me to believe that I have a choice as far as how much I let something dominate my attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it gives you more power when you have a choice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because right now I feel like oh I have to do this, I have to such a hard time for those fun things. If you go to the gym then I'll do it. So anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are those have-tos or shoulds?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I want to go to the gym; I don't want to do Hebrew a bit. But it is a good feeling when it comes up when I have that [inaudible]. I was doing language though so it feels like it never really gets quite past the surface because there's so much work. Anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop and I will see you in August?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: July, right, end of July. You're in my book.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure it's July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure you're right and I'm sure it's in my book but I did not look ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you and have a good... [00:50:56]</p>

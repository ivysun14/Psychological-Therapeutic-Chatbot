<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) It's funny, once I got here, in here today, I didn't feel as nervous as I thought I would.  Because coming, I was thinking again that at the beginning of the week I often feel a little bit stranger about it and I was expecting to feel quite nervous and, and unable to say anything.  And I just don't feel that nervous.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Something that uhm struck me after I left on Friday (coughs) and it is something that disturbs me just in general at times, I think I'm very aware of the sound of doors opening and shutting when I'm waiting outside here.  And while I'm sitting there I feel very much shut out, on the outside.  And then I was waiting for my husband at his office and again, I, it was the same kind of sound that I notice here and it just struck me again that it bothers me to hear doors opening and shutting.  And then I became aware of the fa—, the thought, of the fact that I generally just hate to have doors, have rooms shut when I'm inside them.  But at home I don't like to be in a room with the door shut and when some—, something else is going on somewhere else.  And I don't like a feeling at school either of having my door shut after the children have left.  And even if the room is big I begin to feel very boxed in, and I don't like other people's doors to be shut.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And the door here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I hadn't really thought about it except I wouldn't want this door open.  Although at the beginning it bothered me when this door shut too, because I, it was almost like I was in a little cell or something, and —.  (Pause) And I was just trying to remember if I shut my door at home when I was younger.  Because FYC used to always have her door shut and that bothered me.  Because I know it gave me the feeling of being shut out.  But I can't remember.  It, it would seem to me I left my door open, but I, I can't really clearly remember.  Because it's almost like I'm not participating in —</p>

<p>Well for instance, with my family I wasn't really participating in any family activities, so the only way for me to know what was happening was to overhear and, and I just had this feeling I had to hear anything that was going on.  (Pause) And I think that's why at school I want the door open after the children have gone home, just so I'm, I won't miss anything that might go on.  Although I might not want to participate in it.  And I think I get the same feeling from that as I did from the time when I used to just sit and look out the window and watch people.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny that my thoughts have jumped to thinking of times when I get defensive again and then from that they went to thinking back to this weekend and, uhm, I even during the weekend I was wondering if I were using it as sort of a defense.  But, uhm my cough got very much worse.  And it was almost like at times when I knew I was going to talk or I wanted to say something and I'd sort of tense up so I wouldn't cough and then I'd start coughing.  But uh, on the other hand I wonder if I wasn't really using the cough.  Because there were times when I felt under some tension because we had, we had another couple with us and they stayed at my parents' house and I always feel under tension when I have guests at home.  And then we went with them to a party that a friend of theirs had invited us to, so it was all kind of a new situation and I would have felt tension there.  And I couldn't tell whether I was using it just to, so I could retire and not make much of an attempt to socialize or whether it was really happening.  But that bothered me all weekend and the fact that if I really was using it, it bothered me that I'd be doing that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I, I'm not sure I heard you correctly.  You said there was another couple staying at your parents' house?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  With us, yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh, so you were in —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  In PNOTS.</p>

<p>ANALYST: — PNOTS, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Because it just struck me today.  I had to talk a lot at school and I still coughed but I didn't do anything like what I was doing.  Or it didn't seem to me I was doing anything like I was doing at — during the weekend.  And it also struck me that on Friday, the times, when maybe I coughed at other times but times, when in particular when I was saying something I didn't really want to say or I found hard to say, it seemed to me I would cough right in the middle of it.  (Pause) Did the lights go out on Friday?</p>

<p>ANALYST: I think it must have been the day before that, Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, well then I don't, I don't know when this thought occurred to me.  But maybe it occurred to me, it seemed to me it occurred to me over the weekend, but I was thinking of the remark I'd made that if I said things then you could use them against me.  And that was a feeling I had about saying things sometimes.  And I think maybe even at the time the lights went out and certainly afterwards, the thought occurred to me that perhaps this time you did it to test me and see what my reaction would be.  Which is similar to I think the other time when I got here.  I used to be here early and waiting out in the front and I had the feeling that again you were keeping me waiting to test me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you thought that, how did you feel then or how do you feel when you think that I would do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when it was about, when I felt that way about the waiting, I was mad because I found the waiting so unpleasant but —, I can't really remember and I don't (pause) I, I would say I'd almo—, almost accept that, well, maybe you were testing me with the lights going out.  But I'm not sure that really is the way I feel about it.  (Pause) The thing that just came to my mind is that I must feel on my guard with everyone.  (Pause) And even with MSCZ if, if he just becomes particularly nice to me or affectionate, I always think well, now why is he being this nice to me.  There must be a reason.  (2-minutes silence)</p>

<p>But the situations at school that made me feel very much on the defensive, one in particular was uhm, at the end of school today, the, my supervisor came up to me and mentioned that the girl who is my assistant wasn't feeling very well.  And I knew she hadn't been feeling particularly wonderful.  But neither of us have felt very well for quite a while and I just thought perhaps that's what she was talking about.  And then she went on about how she really should go home and shouldn't be in school.  And then I began to feel very defensive that well, maybe I hadn't really inquired into how she was feeling and perhaps I was being very hard on her and driving her and I just felt extremely defensive about it; that I was doing something wrong.  Whereas it turned out something had happened to her when I was not there and I just hadn't known about it.  So there was no way I could have done anything.  But again I felt very guilty that I hadn't really thought of her, and, and also that the, my supervisor was in effect attacking me, which probably she wasn't doing at all.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>This must be on my mind, because it keeps coming into it (chuckle).  But it's something I talked to MSCZ about once because it bothers me that I just, I just feel as if I'm just lying here complaining all the time.  And I'm sure it must be because I have this reaction that you must find it awfully annoying to hear somebody just complaining all the time.  And perhaps there's an element of the fact that it seems somebody, maybe it was my mother, used to, when I tried to work things out that were bothering me by talking to her, she'd say well don't complain all the time or stop worrying all the time.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And you feel that's my attitude also?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, nobody likes to hear somebody complaining all the time.  It seems like the only things that I ever talk about are things that bother me or upset me or that I don't like.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking of the conflict I have on feeling on the one hand that what I am naturally, people won't like.  So I have to try to please them more and then wanting to please everybody no matter who they are no matter how I feel about them, so that I'll go out of my way to, as if I think I can.  And it just seemed a dichotomy that first I don't believe anybody is going to like me and then I believe I really can please them if I got out of my way enough.  (Pause) And sometimes when people tell me the impression they've had of me I find particularly disturbing because the things that they usually pick out as the traits they noticed most are ones of being somebody who is quiet and friendly and gentle and, and almost compliant, amenable or it seems to come out sort of being a nebbish.  (Pause) And when I know that, that I'm this way out of fears, it bothers me even more that people think this is what I really am.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And speaking of fears makes me think of the, perhaps I've mentioned it.  The dance that FYC and her husband are planning and I think in some ways I'd like very much to refuse going.  But on the other hand that seems like escaping and, and so I think well maybe I should make myself go because it'll be good for me and if I have a horrible time it will be nothing less than what I anticipate in a way.  Because I anticipate feeling extremely uncomfortable and not knowing what to do with myself and feeling kind of in the way.  And feeling all sort of held in and not free to be whatever I feel like being.  (Pause) And I'm sure part of this feeling on my part comes because I've never been to a particular dance like this so I have no idea what one does.  And, and, and I can't relax not knowing what the right thing to do is.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What's special about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's, uhm, just, well it's being given at their house and there are lots of little dinner parties beforehand.  And so I don't know first of all how much of a really dance situation it is and how much it's just a big party.  And if it is a dance how much one has to dance and whether the dance is the main thing when you get there.  And my brother-in-law is inclined to like very much things that, the way they were done in years ago.  And so it might become something that is completely centered around the dance.  Oh, what kind of music they'll have.  Whether they'll have sort of old fashion music or modern dance music and — because that horrifies me too.  To think that I might actually have to dance because I, I can dance with MSCZ because I don't feel uncomfortable with him but, or I know he knows I'm not that good a dancer.  But I always get this feeling of horror at the thought I have to dance with somebody else, and then of course, I dance even worse.  I suppose it is, I just feel very insecure about it, because I haven't done whatever is going to be the, however you act, enough so that I kind of have a pattern for myself.  Because I know I won't feel free to act just whatever strikes me at the time.  And this is part of probably what I was talking about one of the last times on what, how I talk to other people and also the way I act.  I have to have the experience time and again and get some kind of a feeling of a role or a pattern that you form and, and then I act according to that rather than just by observing the situation as it comes up in any one time.  So it makes me very stiff and formal.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And this was something that surprised me, the more I thought about it.  Because I've always thought as, of my mother as liking formality because in a way she is very stiff and formal too.  I can see that she takes the same kind of refuge in acting that way.  But I used to think also she talks very often about the elegance of time gone by and how she misses it and how people used to care about appearance, caring about setting the table nicely or wearing long dresses and the kind of slow pace and the comfort of it, and, and it just seemed as if she would be so happy if she could have this kind of elegance.  But then it began to strike me that she never really does any one thing thoroughly when she could do it thoroughly and in a kind of elegant way if she wanted to.  Because she might set the table so that she's using nice silver and maybe nice china and then she has horrible place mats so the dining room will be a mess.</p>

<p>And it bothered me this weekend to be home because it just seemed like there were just again little piles of things all over the place in every single room.  There was just a little clutter of things, worse than anything I've ever been.  And it's just kind of depressing to have all these little messes around of things that people just sort of dropped there and —.  I've always known that she, or my family as a whole, is inclined to be this way somewhat but I've never felt that so many rooms were as bad as, as I did this weekend.  I just felt I couldn't even go into one room without feeling very depressed and disgusted by it, because they were just, they were just all so messy.  And I don't think she really even notices.  (Coughs) Because when I complained to MSCZ he said well, that's just like you.  But I really think I notice especially if I know I'm having guests even if it were my parents who were guests, I would notice.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You almost choked on that.  Did you feel you were saying something especially critical of her and you shouldn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.  I felt as if I were holding a cough back for quite a while and you know, I just suddenly started.  (Pause) Because what I did do was, it makes me now think of all sorts of things to attack.  Or another thing I, occurred to me.  On uhm, Sunday we usually have a fairly long breakfast and sit and talk for a while afterwards.  And their dining room gets very, very warm because the sun comes in it and they have the heat on and it seems like every Sunday somebody is feeling warm and you have to kind of fight with my father to get him to open the window.  And this Sunday I happen to have on a very warm dress and I was sitting with the sun right on me and I was, I thought I was going to die, I just couldn't stand it.  But I hated to ask my father if we couldn't have our window open a little bit and you could never go up and open it yourself.  You have to check with him and then he, he would do it in a very grudging way.  But I was kind of surprised at my great hesitance to even ask it.  Probably because I was afraid he'd turn on me and be angry at me and tell me that was a stupid thing to want done; or no, I couldn't have it open.</p>

<p>And I also noticed that at one point we were talking about the problem with bussing negro children and just education in general and very often the kinds of discussions that my parents will have I don't know enough so that I don't even venture to make my opinion known because it means kind of fighting in to say anything.  But since I have thought out a lot of things for education, I jumped right in.  But then I could just feel myself being so emotional and it upset me that I had to be so emotional about it.  That I couldn't just say it and just simply, well that's the way I look at it and in, in a kind of objective way but I was —.  I don't know how to describe how I was saying it, but I, I just felt so emotionally involved which is kind of the way especially my mother and my father somewhat, the way they are too in discussions which really aren't discussions.  And it always strikes me when there's somebody there from outside the family who does not enter discussions or conversations this way and it happened that our friends are inclined to be very, well, this is how I see it and they have kind of a calm exterior.  (Cough)</p>

<p>And another thing I noticed earlier in the weekend when my parents were talking with some friends and uhm, some th—, they were talking about the football game, because we went to the KQ-HT game and uhm, one man said something which my mother didn't agree with.  And she wanted to just say well, I disagree but she couldn't just say it in kind of an offhand way and she started to say I, and then she obviously was looking for the right word, that would express how she felt, and I could just see she felt so aggressive about it.  And finally she had, she said, "I have to contest that!"  And just using those words really disturbed me.  Because it was just kind of a casual comment that the fellow had made and she was getting in as if they were in some formal debate.  And sort of almost as if, and, and I can see maybe this is why I get so emotional, almost as if the more feeling or the stronger the word she used, then it, then the more weight it gave to what she was going to say after that.  And if she just said well I don't agree and then this is what I think in sort of an off-hand way that it would have been unnoticed, or not agreed with.</p>

<p>And maybe that's why I get so emotional because it's, I'm sort of defending myself against any attack that might come, I'm making my case so strong that then it will be harder for any attack to come.  (Pause) Or it's even almost as if I'm trying to convince myself that I'm right, because I was thinking I even do it when I'm talking to MSCZ and just maybe describing something that happened during the day at school or someplace else, and —.  But I remember his saying practically every time, this, don't get so excited, calm down.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And something else happened this weekend that MSCZ and I were talking about afterwards.  Because my father always used to be, it seemed to me unaware of what was going on, just in the family, this is, now for instance after I was in high school.  And if we brought friends home either during high school or at college, it would take forever before he'd know their names.  And I, I just gave up a long time ago that he'd ever even remember their names.  And, or we'd be having, we'd be talking about something and after dinner at home, and, and he would just be off somewhere else.  And I know I used to complain about it to my mother and she said that well, he has other things on his mind and so he's abstracted but, or distracted, but it used to, I think I must have seen it as a lack of interest, that he just couldn't be bothered to pay any attention.</p>

<p>And this weekend my parents were having a group of friends that, they have a group of I think 6 couples who every month will have dinner at somebody's house.  And on Sunday they were having the group at their house.  And it's something that I think if my father enjoys anything, he enjoys that.  And you would think he, he would know that they were going to come, but at one point he was talking about giving some liquor to my brother who was, his fiancee was going to be having a party and they thought they'd be short.  And my mother had commented that he needed it for his (father) own party tonight and he said, oh what party, who's coming; which is sort of what he always did.  Or else if my mother said, "Well we're going, don't forget we have something to go to tonight," on a weekend, he'd always say, "Oh, what, what's happening," and he just never seemed to have any interest.  And MSCZ couldn't, MSCZ thought that he was teasing, that, that he really hadn't had, that he didn't know, but I think he really just didn't know and I, I can't understand somebody being that unaware unless he really just doesn't enjoy it and therefore blocks it out until he has to face that they're actually coming.  Because he wouldn't go up to uhm this place that FYC and I went skiing several winters and after 1 or 2 times a lot of people from PNX would come up for, for the Washington's birthday weekend.</p>

<p>And a lot of these people were part of this group that are very good friends with my parents and it just seemed like a situation, it was a lovely place and very relaxing and here was a classmate of his and a lot of old friends from PNX so that it would seem like he could have had a nice time but he just didn't want to go ever.  And so many times, not, we didn't do it many times, but it seems like every time but one he had some reason he couldn't do it, so my mother did it alone.  And he'd much prefer just going to PTN and being there with just my mother and himself and maybe some of the children if they were able to and then maybe 1 or 2 friends, but I don't know, it just, he has to be in PTN and then be the one having friends coming in.  That's the only way he seems to enjoy it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Coughs)</p>

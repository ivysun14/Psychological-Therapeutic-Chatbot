<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good question. I'm sort of worried about the whole trying to lose weight thing. Because when I was at Sydney's place this week I looked on the scale and I weighed 160. And that is more than I've ever weighed before. Granted I don't know how accurate that scale is but I'm assuming it's mostly accurate or something. And —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much above your —</p>

<p>CLIENT: The most I've ever been before that was 150. And that was like in high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's been a long time since you've been close to this weight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the highest you've ever been.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what do you feel like is contributing? [00:00:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm eating things that are fatty but at the same time I'm not like snacking all the time when I'm not hungry. So like it shouldn't matter too much if calories are calories. Like where I'm getting them from if they fill me up as long as I'm not eating ridiculous amounts of food. And I don't think I am. Like if anything I usually end up skipping meals so I end up having lunch and dinner (inaudible at 00:01:19). Maybe it's because I'm exercising less because I drive everywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That could add up. I mean I think when you boil it down to the simplest equation it's calories are calories but weight gain equals more calories in than calories lost.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the exercise — if you don't feel like you're eating that much more it might be that you're exercising less and therefore not using up as many calories.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe I'm slowly eating a little bit more such that it adds up to more weight (inaudible at 00:01:50).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does add up over time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But — which I really as I said with this — with my frapp for breakfast slash lunch that I'm having. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well those can be kind of sneaky calories because liquids don't make us feel full in the same way that really eating a meal does. So if you are doing something like that often —</p>

<p>CLIENT: But this is liquid ice cream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is liquid ice cream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. But it's liquid ice cream so sometimes your body just doesn't register the feeling of fullness. And you can drink a lot more calories than you can eat in a shorter amount of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also takes awhile for your body to recognize fullness. And so eating something quickly, whether it be ice cream or liquid ice cream, it might be that you're eating more calories before you recognize that you're feeling full. Because you have the ability to sort of suck down a frappachino on a hot day pretty quickly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so sometimes you don't realize you're actually getting in something like that. I don't know how often — in the sense that you can't ever have a frappachino. But if you're doing that more often maybe than you are used to. [00:03:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And it might be. But then again I used to eat ice cream all the time. And now I'm just drinking ice cream sometimes instead of eating ice cream. And I don't usually don't go get a frapp and then get another ice cream some other time on the same day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It feels like a replacement rather than —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean maybe it's a little bit bigger because it's like three scoops of ice cream and stuff. But I'm eating it instead of lunch. I don't know. The problem is I feel like it's easier to like exercise more. And I suck at counting calories. I really don't want to have to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just would rather just exercise more but I don't know if —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To exercise more?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you work that in more to your schedule?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably considering how unemployed I am right now. And how little I have to do. The problem is last Saturday night I injured my back. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's because I didn't (inaudible at 00:04:08). I was doing back exercises and then I started feeling better. Then I stopped doing the back exercises. And then I moved into the new room where I don't really have space to put out the yoga mat anyways. So I haven't done the back exercises anymore and I think that's probably what happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. So they were helping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think if I go back to doing that then that will help. But I guess I can go for walks if I'm not carrying anything at all. But like even if I'm carrying my purse it starts to hurt. And on Tuesday I had someone who had won yarn that I had donated to a charity auction. It was custom yarn and I finally finished knitting it and was giving it to her on Tuesday. And so Sydney also had to go to the Square so I walked from mid Square to over by the Law School was there this person was. [00:05:04]</p>

<p>I was carrying just the yarn which — I mean it was about eight ounces. And then my purse. And by the time I got there I was just in so much pain I ended up after giving her the yarn, I sat there and waited for Sydney to get out of therapy. And it was like please pick me up when you're out of therapy. Then he picked me up and I got home. I was like — granted once I gave her the yarn it was like I was carrying less but I was still carrying something. It was enough to hurt me and I couldn't really just like drag myself over to down the street to get to where the bus would pick me up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems like right now if you're going to walk it needs to be a walk that you're just going for a walk. Just carrying your keys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which is sort of hard to only be carrying my keys and not my purse. I have to then set out to just go for a walk. (inaudible at 00:06:02)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's going to be a planned just going for a walk for exercise so that you're not having to carry anything with you. [00:06:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then I'm wondering if like is my body not able to support — the fact that I weigh 160. Is that why my back is hurting? Like I don't think so. It's not like it was a sudden weight gain. It was over time. So my body should be used to carrying that much weight. So I think it was just the lack of back exercises that did it. But I'm just worried and still trying to figure out where I can even do these the back exercises in my tiny little room with not enough space for anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. It seems like you're not that happy about the room switch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's — in some ways it's bigger than the old room. But I guess because I have things now in the common areas — they were in the common areas and now they're in my room. [00:06:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Sort of taking up space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of taking up space. And also my desk. Because I didn't have a desk in the old room and now I have my desk in the new room. And that takes up a lot of space too. And maybe I could rearrange things but then that requires moving lots of furniture. So it just seems like I'm going to have to find another place. But like I can't really think of a good place to do it.</p>

<p>Because I don't want to be doing the back exercises in front of my housemates and stuff. And so maybe I could keep it in the TV room and do it when people aren't in the TV room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there times that the house is empty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends on the day of the week. Like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday; yes. Because Aaron is at work and Tony is over but usually he stays in the living room with [Overton]. But then Thursday and Friday Aaron doesn't work so it's very possible that he will just plop himself down in front of the TV. I mean usually during the day I can find some time so maybe I should do that. And I just feel bad putting more things in the TV room than are already there. But it's my space too. [00:08:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also I used to do them right before I went to bed and right after I woke up. And I can't really do that if I'm doing them in the TV room because I have to be like completely dressed and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So it's just going to take a little bit of —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actual effort.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actual effort. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I can do. For now I guess. And I guess it's really the only way to not —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they were really helping to protect you. It seems important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like and then I spent the rest of Tuesday with the heating pad on and stuff. And since then I've been feeling better. But also since then I haven't really tried to do much more. And like today I was kind of pushing it since I had my purse and my knitting bag and was walking from where I parked the car which is <i>way</i> down the street. [00:09:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how did you feel walking here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt okay. I'm just sort of afraid that by the time I'm walking back it's going to hurt again. And at which point I won't really have any option because it will be the car is over there and I need to get to the car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. But you were okay walking from there to here. You have 50 minutes to sit and rest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least physically rest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you were okay on the way over you should be okay on the way back. Because you do have a break in between.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'll probably be fine. (inaudible at 00:09:37) shouldn't have brought my knitting bag. But I always end up bringing more things than I need but if I don't then I don't have what I need. I'd rather have more things than I need than less than I need. But if I'm going to injure myself then—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be a time to try a different strategy. You're thinking more carefully about what you really need to limit the schlepping of stuff that you don't really have to carry with you. [00:10:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other forms of exercise that you can do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Besides walking?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you've enjoyed in the past or have tried in the past?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could go contra dancing but that requires having a ride to contra dancing. Though I guess I could steal Sydney' car if he doesn't want to go. Like he was interested in possibly going. But of course that's even more — a lot more strenuous than just walking. But it requires going out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. And requires a little planning and navigation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then there's — but I mean it's also really good exercise. And if I did it like once a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And you enjoy it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It would probably be good. And I mean I used to do swing dancing. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Swing. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't really do that now because I have conflict on the night that they have swing dancing, so that doesn't work. (pause at [00:11:10] to 00:11:18) I definitely don't like running or jogging. Which I mean I guess I'd be carrying less because I would be running or jogging. But I don't really like — it always makes me feel short of breath when I've been running for too long. And I guess less when it's hot out but I don't run.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a little bit more stress on your body too if you're not used to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doing things especially where it seems like your back is prone to injury.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Swimming would require a pool membership. Which costs money. It was also require a bathing suit that fits which would also cost money. And I'd rather go contra dancing than swimming. [00:11:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. So focus on those things. Focus on maybe figuring out what time that you can go contra dancing. And figuring out some times when you could go walking with nothing in your hands to make it as stress free as possible. To be as balanced as possible. Sometimes carrying something actually gets your body a little bit off balance. And to be as safe as you possibly can be. A time when you can just go take a walk. Not necessarily combining with other errands. And that way you can be wearing good sneakers. Not be carrying anything that you don't need in your hands. And taking advantage of the nice weather finally. And the time that you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I feel like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for mood and anxiety as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The best time for me to do that would be Shabbat because I'm not usually carrying anything other than my keys on Shabbat. Because I have no reason to carry my purse. So. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's coming right up. And you can probably find some other days when you can just have a half an hour that you don't have another commitment to go take a good half-hour brisk walk. That's a good chunk of movement. We've talked before when you were sort of addressing weight issues in the past about trying to think of ways to increase movement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah that would be one. Because I do not want to start going to a gym or something or that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And exercise doesn't have to be in a gym. Especially this time of year when you're not having to navigate icy sidewalks or snowstorms.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can just plan — find a space in your day when you have a half an hour to go take a walk. (pause at [00:13:54] to 00:14:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the other thing is the whole job situation. And Sydney actually had his first round interview. And now has a second round interview for the job he interviewed at Yale. So he very well might have a job soon. That's just sort of frustrating because he applied to one job. This was the only job he actually had applied to so far. And he got the interview and the other interview. [00:14:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) different fields.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've been applying to many jobs. And like on this week I applied to two administrative assistant positions. I'm just afraid that my cover letters aren't good enough. And it feels really inadequate to be like — my experience being an office assistant was from 2008 to 2009 and now it's 2012. And that was like a really long time ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel very silly having that be my primary experience. But it is my primary experience. And so but then I feel like I have to put in something else. And like you know. Pretend that my library stuff is making me more qualified to be an administrative assistant. And in some cases it might be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. But it's not your direct experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it just seems like I'm writing bad cover letters or something. I don't know — they might be okay cover letters for all I know. [00:15:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has Sydney read it? Since his seems to be successful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Well I mean —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very different field.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a very different field so he hasn't read it. And I just — because like rather than waiting for him to be able to read it I'd rather send it out while I'm motivated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean these are jobs that I care about less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have no clue if they're going to consider me or if they want someone who has more immediate experience. And if that is the case then like I'm not going to get any of these jobs that I'm — like I don't know why anyone would consider me. And —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're smart. Which they can tell from some of your experience and degrees. So you can pick up whatever is required of you in the job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just a balance between stating the obvious and like — whether or not I actually have to write, "Oh this gives me the ability to interact with (inaudible at 00:16:32) people. And work unsupervised." Like all those very specific things that they say should be able to be inferred by what you've written. And then whether or not you have to go back to spelling it out. [00:16:43]</p>

<p>And like I feel that the archives stuff I don't have to spell it out because it's a little bit more advanced anyways. But with a more basic job I feel like I have to. And then I feel like it's really bad writing. I finally got the hang of writing cover letters for archive stuff and now I have to figure out how to write cover letters for this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And— but it's the only way. I didn't see any library jobs that I wanted to apply to this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you applied for two administrative assistant positions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I sort of like went to the jobs siteand have the open a billion a tabs of all the different ones that look interesting. And basically keep those tabs open until I apply for them or decide not to apply for them so that way it's sort of like you need to look at this many more jobs. [00:17:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: These are ones that have been listed in the past week or so. And I still have a bunch of tabs open. But one of the jobs would've been really good. It's like an administrative assistant position at this library. And one of the things is helping archivist. And I was like I can do that. But that one had been posted on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. And so I'm like — I got a letter.</p>

<p>They're like, "We're still reviewing applications. We'll let you know if we want an interview." But I don't know if that means I actually do have a chance. I guess if they'd found someone they would've been like, "We found someone."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. You would probably have gotten nothing or a thank you but we've already filled this position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the fact that they did send you something saying — they're not going to take time to send you something if they're not going to bother to look at it. [00:18:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's a fingers crossed still.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that one is only 22 hours a week. So it'd be like perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well it sounds like it actually fulfills some things that you're looking for. Somewhat related and not too many hours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then it would be enough to support myself off of. But without having to devote my entire life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd still have time to dye yarn and walk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then I — yeah. The other thing is I actually found out last night slash this morning that the grant that I thought was going to start in July could actually start Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which means I can start doing that stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get a paycheck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get a paycheck. Feel productive for a few weeks. And then — yeah. After (inaudible at 00:19:38) Adlers' thing was moot anyways because the hours that they would need coverage for were hours that would not have worked for me anyways. So. But yeah I told them, "I decided that I don't want to do it. It's not worth the small amount of money that I'd be getting for this short period of time." [00:19:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't actually tell her about the whole — actually I don't want to do this also because I'm annoyed that you treat your workers this way. And don't — annoyed doesn't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Annoyed (inaudible at 00:20:11) a little bit mild for how strongly you felt when you were in here on Monday. You were expressing some pretty strong disappointment and anger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I didn't express any of it to my Mom. Because even I did — even if I had a job right now — it's not going to do anything. No matter what.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm not saying that you should necessarily express it to them but I just think acknowledging for yourself how strongly you felt about what you learned about your father's decisions, your parents' decisions in this business.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it would be one thing if it was like, "Oh well we're not making enough profits and it really sucks but we have to do it this way." But my Dad seemed happy about this decision. And proud of it. And like, "Oh yes. We can exploit our workers and pay them less. And not offer them health insurance. And well if they don't have health insurance it's their own fault." Even though it's really my Dad's fault. So it's the whole attitude. [00:21:10]</p>

<p>And just finding out that my Dad really is a jerk. And I wouldn't want to work for him. (pause at [00:21:16] to 00:21:23) And therefore I'd rather have them go shorthanded because it's their own fault for not hiring people full time and giving them health insurance. Or paying them a competitive wage such that they'd want to stay at the hardware store. It's their own fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I still have a job. I mean I didn't think things would magically change with sending out two cover letters. But — and it was hard. Because I can sometimes be motivated for short periods of time but then I lose the motivation and then I don't want to do it anymore. And —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then it's hard to keep doing it anyway. [00:22:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like today I have to cook all the things. And I guess I can like maybe between things being in the oven and stuff work on another cover letter. I doubt I'd be able to finish more than one more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe that could be a reasonable goal then. Finishing one more before Shabbat starts tonight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which I'll probably — I mean I haven't even gone grocery shopping yet for some of the things I need. So it's like — what I'm making shouldn't take that much time but I'm just worried about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Well you'll be out of here at 1:20.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or actually earlier because I started sooner. So it buys you ten more minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I would imagine this time of June Shabbat doesn't start till later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It starts around eightish. A little bit after eight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have a lot of hours between now and then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Enough time if you are organized. Certainly enough time to grocery shop, do one cover letter and get that sent out, and cook. Because you've got seven hours. [00:23:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just that I have a bunch of different things I need to put in the oven. And also Sydney is making challah, which is going to have to go in the oven. And they can't all go in the oven at the same time because if it did — well it's not all going to fit. And like we don't want to do what happened last time when we had two challahs in the oven. The trays were overlapping so the one on the bottom ended up getting kind of burnt because the heat got reflected back down. The one on the top was fine. So this time we're going to have to do [challahs] —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Both on the top rack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both on the top rack. So one at a time. (chuckles) So. I mean well his dough has to rise and stuff anyway so I can probably do my stuff before (inaudible at 00:23:51).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I mean it's about thinking things through and doing it in an organized fashion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because there is probably — with that much time, with seven hours to play with — or almost seven hours to play with. To be able to sequence things in a way that you can get them all done. [00:24:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you're waiting for something to cook or if you're waiting for the bread to rise, something else can be done in that time. Whether that be preparing something else to go in the oven or sitting down and writing your cover letter, or having something in the oven while something else is happening; if you think it through there is plenty of time to play with to assemble things in such a way that you can get those three tasks done. The shopping, the cooking, and one application cover letter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And one (inaudible at 00:24:36). Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do things in a way that they expand to fill the time you have or you can organize it in a way that you can sequence it. Put it together like a puzzle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. All these different administrative assistant jobs, there are tons of them. So like theoretically I should be able to get one — if I applied for all of them. Not that I'll actually be able to apply for all of them but if I did —. [00:25:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's enough out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That there should be one for me. And the other problem is also — yeah. Some of them I see and it's a job that I could do but it says three years experience. And I'm like I don't have three years experience. And then do I even bother with that one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well if there are a bunch out there pick the ones that you're able to apply to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I sort of like put that one on the side. Like maybe I'll apply to it later. But I'm going to apply to the ones I actually have experience enough for first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and ones are a little bit overlapping at least with library stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's really the only one that was overlapping with library stuff. But the other ones are just normal administrative assistant-y things. Scheduling meetings, answering phones and all that. And most of them are full time. Forty hours a week. I guess I can also save up money while I'm working 40 hours a week until I — and then if I find a job that's in my field and less hours then I'll have some extra money. This all assumes I can even get one of these jobs (inaudible). [00:26:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. You have to go on that assumption.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just so — because before I was all like — I even thought of course when I graduate college I'll be able to find a job. I am qualified to do these jobs. If I apply to them surely I'll get one of them. And now it's like most of the time I don't hear anything back. So maybe there all these people who have associate's degrees in business administration or whatever who actually are specifically qualified for these positions. And they're all running around unemployed trying to find jobs too. And I'm competing with them. Like I don't even know who I'm competing with for these types of jobs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is not something that you have control over. Knowing it or not knowing doesn't give you any control over it. You can only control your piece which is what you apply to, how many things you apply to. And trying to sort of control your application. Make it the best application you can with what's true for you. You don't have an associate's degree in business admin. [00:27:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or whatever it is that they do. Like I have other degrees.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just not relevant to the field. And some of them say like, "Oh well education beyond high school can count as experience." Those ones are like better because —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Because you have that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I have that. But—yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you have your goals set out for today. And then you start over with a new goal for Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How have the thoughts been? We haven't checked in on those for awhile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For the most part they've been okay but I've also been like at home for most of the time. And not like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now that [takey] is over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah [takey] is over and not really interactive with other people most of the time. Except for my housemates and Sydney. And so we're kind of — I forget whether or not they were flaring up when I was at my parents' house. And annoyed at my parents and stuff. I don't think they were that bad though. So. (inaudible at 00:28:49) good. So I guess being on the lower (inaudible) is actually fine. [00:28:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well certainly in these circumstances I think if they were really bad at your parents' house you'd probably remember that. So the fact that you can't remember makes me think that they were no worse than usual or certainly not enough worse just to really stand out to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean if I get a job they'll probably start being worse for that but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah well it's a new situation. It might be a trigger. New people and a new atmosphere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd have to get through the job interviews and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Get through that first.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how are things feeling between you and Sydney?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay. Like he's starting to feel better. Like the new dose of Albutrin is definitely helping him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He hasn't been on for that long. Like for about a week at this point. Yeah because he got the prescription last Thursday so he's been on it for a week. Like his libido still hasn't come back yet but he's still stressed. Now we at least found a solution for his housing situation because —. [00:30:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well we — I asked my housemates and they were fine with it. Since we found a new housemate for September or he's moving in halfway through August, nobody is living in that extra room for July.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So he's going to stay there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we're renting out the guest bedroom to Sydney. And that way it makes up some of the money that Aaron is losing by not having that room being rented out. And this way he can — there are a few possibilities of places that Sydney could move into August 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So if Sydney has a set plan for what he's doing August 1<sup>st</sup> then he can rent out the guest bedroom. And Andrea was actually looking for — they needed a new housemate for August 1<sup>st</sup>. And he had mentioned before and I was like, "Oh no Sydney need a place for July 1<sup>st</sup>." But when I called up Andrea a couple of days ago it turns out they hadn't done anything to even start looking for a housemate yet. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>So Sydney is going to go over there and meet the housemates. And then there is also this other person who is an alum of Cambridge College. Because Sydney had posted on the Amherst board which I think he would have thought of it sooner. But he finally thought of it so there is someone who has an apartment that is between Yale and the Square. So —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good location.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that one is also August 1<sup>st</sup> so —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he's got some good options.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he has some good options.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A good place to be in between.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think it's better — because when you respond to people on Craig's List and you're trying to be a roommate with someone, you're competing with all these other people and you've never met them before and stuff. And if — where if you at least know one person then —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it's a little bit more personal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So and I think — I haven't really. I've only been to Andrea's place once and I've only really seen the living room and the kitchen. So I don't really know what the bedrooms are like but the rent is really, really cheap. And like it's 660 a month. [00:32:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess plus utilities but utilities don't run that much. So it's like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. And could still be shared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's less than he's paying now. And he wouldn't have passive aggressive roommates. Because it turns out his roommates are really, really, really passive. Like there was a sLinda that he hadn't told me. Like was when he first moved in they didn't have a cooking rotation. And he had asked Crystal what the deal with the cooking was. And she was like, "Oh we'll figure it out eventually."</p>

<p>And then I guess Crystal and Linda ended up doing most of the cooking. And one day Linda like made dinner. And Sydney had sat down to dinner. And was like, "Oh I didn't make enough for you because you don't cook enough."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As opposed to telling him he should be cooking more often. It turns out actually they did make enough. And when they went — like (inaudible at 00:32:58) eating leftovers. But like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's a really — that's mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not passive aggressive. That's aggressive. [00:33:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's aggressive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems so to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well sometimes they're passive aggressive. Okay. So yeah. His roommates are between passive aggressive and aggressive. One of them is okay but the other two aren't. And so. The fact that they had been thinking — he had been given notice in May but he hadn't been given any heads up like, "Oh Crystal was thinking about her boyfriend moving in." Or anything like that. So two months is some time but they could've him more notice than that. But they didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So now that he has an exit plan at least now. And he knows he has place to live for July so it's no longer —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Not as stressful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stressful. And so he's also more okay with being at his place because he didn't want to — like he didn't really feel safe at this place. So like once he —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:33:56) really uncomfortable situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And now that he has the interview. (inaudible at 00:34:00) I was so glad that I (inaudible) in when he had gotten the rejection letter. And I was like, "I think it's a mistake." And both times, both the rejection letters, were mistakes. [00:34:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the first one he had got in an e-mail, "Let's set up a phone interview." And then he got — they were going to schedule a phone interview. And a couple of hours after that e-mail exchange he got, or less than an hour after that e-mail exchange, he got an e-mail saying, "Sorry but we're not interested in pursuing your candidacy at this point." I'm like that's an automated e-mail from H.R. I don't think it's — .</p>

<p>I think having the actual offer for the interview — they would have told you. They wouldn't have offered you a phone interview if they didn't. Well then it turns out he had the phone interview. And then they were scheduling an in person. And he got another e-mail. This time from the H.R. at the law center place that he was actually applying for as opposed to bigger Yale H.R. that was like, "Thank you for your time but we're not interested in you." I'm like, "Well he scheduled an in person interview for you. I think this one is also a mistake." [00:35:04]</p>

<p>And Sydney really didn't believe me. I'm like, "Just send him a thank you letter anyways for the phone interview. Ask him if the in person interview is still on." And it was. I guess they had an old H.R. person and a new H.R. person. And the old person left and the new person didn't know what was going on. So he got that e-mail in error. And so now he has a second round interview. This time he didn't get a rejection letter. So. That was good. But I was just like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those were really unfortunate mistakes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm sort of glad that I was able to convince him to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He had to go through those interviews. Show up for them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean the phone one was — it actually was also because it was supposed to happen — it was happening on Memorial Day. And he was going to be called. And the call was supposed to come around eleven. And he ended up not getting called until like two or something. Because it was Memorial —. [00:36:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really making it nerve wracking for him, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess because the guy's kid was sick or something like that. And so — but having that after having no response and after having the e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes you question their —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So he was really relieved when he got the phone call.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I hope that goes well for him. And I hope some of luck wears off on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because — I mean even if one of us. Like if he has a job at least that means that whenever we go out to eat he'd be the one paying for it. At least until I get a job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. We had agreed whoever got a job first would be the one paying for going out to eat and stuff. So I won't have that expense. I'll just still have my normal expenses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also just nice to have some success.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But the job that he's — equal time. It's a year appointment. And possibly could be extended because it's to do this very specific project. But the fact that he has a second round interview I think he has a very good shot. [00:37:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's encouraging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I've never had a second round interview. Though I don't know that I've ever applied for jobs that have second rounds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Every field is different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I've never actually had an in person interview for an archive job. Just had that one phone interview. But yeah. I'm just still worried that I'm not (inaudible at 00:37:34).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Keep putting things out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you're worried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish there were more jobs in my field. At least now I'll be able to put this grant on my resume.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. You are gaining experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm gaining experience and I'm getting paid for this grant. And it'll be about a month's worth of expenses that it's paying for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All good things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can feel a little bit better about things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you had had the idea of maybe looking for other grants for which you could apply. [00:38:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I haven't really done much of that yet. And I guess because it seems like the small ones are just so tiny. And the big ones are take a year or so to get into action and stuff. So I haven't really done much of that yet. And it's not enough — I don't know. I guess I can spend a day doing that at some point. But I haven't really done that yet.</p>

<p>Like one of them I'm just like — feel like the granting agency is kind of a failure in that they (inaudible at 00:38:45) they were the ones who provided the grant for that museum class that I had last semester. That was like — where we really didn't end up learning anything. And I was like, "Why are they funding this? It's not teaching us anything. This is the worst taught class ever. The teachers treat us like high schoolers and don't actually tell us about assignments until right before they're due. And don't bother putting them on the syllabus or anything." [00:39:14]</p>

<p>And those teachers are trying to find (inaudible at 00:39:19) less funding. And I'm just like — I mean I don't know. There might be — and it's also there are different grants in summer. People are eligible for some in summer because they're all for specific purposes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a lot of them are museum things and stuff. So. But I guess our archive is attached to a museum so—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you'd be eligible for that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe we'd be eligible for them. But we have to like put it together and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it might be a worthwhile endeavor even if it's a small amount for while you're going through this process still.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the other thing is I still have to worry about the whole health insurance running out in August thing. And there is the open enrollment for Health insurance. Like at least right now I'm earning little enough that I'd be qualified for it. But —. [00:40:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes that might be something that you want to be really on top of. Getting an application. Having stuff to go right away so you can get that application in the —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I printed it out. I mean there is the open enrollment period. There is the one ends on June 22<sup>nd</sup> and that's for coverage for July 1<sup>st</sup>. And then there is the one that is in July that is for August 1<sup>st</sup>. And I don't want to get coverage before August 1<sup>st</sup> because if I have two insurance plans at the same time — which I'll still have for a few weeks since it ends August 14<sup>th</sup>. Then if I do anything during that period of time both insurances will be like, "Oh the other one should be paying for it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And thus nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So do the one for August 1<sup>st</sup>. It's not much overlap.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other thing is that it doesn't mention anything about prescriptions. Like it mentions covering mental health and stuff but not prescriptions. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. I don't know what the prescription plan is. Or if it's separate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it is I didn't find any information about it and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well —</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then what would the process be for getting an out of insurance provider for — like if I was trying to get coverage for sessions with you? Would you just do all that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Once you — it's a combination of what I do and you would do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So once you had the insurance you would call them and have them send me the appropriate forms. And I fill out the forms for the out of network request.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And fax back and forth with them until we get an answer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the first thing you need to do is get your membership sort of i.d. number so that I can apply on your behalf.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. How long does that usually take?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like sometimes forever. And by forever I mean weeks. Sometimes it happens pretty quickly. [00:42:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay so then there might be some weeks that I'm just not covered?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what happens if they're going to cover it, it would be retroactive to the date that you started. So you can gamble and keep seeing me until we get an answer, knowing that if we get a negative answer you end up paying for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or if they end up covering it then they'll cover it retroactive to your start date.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or we can take a couple week break if you don't want to take that chance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you get all the information — if you do things ahead of time so that you're ready to send in your application you probably can send in your application with a start date. So you can have that stuff ready to go and actually sent in before August saying that you're applying for August 1<sup>st</sup> or August 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They might be able to do that. I'm not sure if they can start mid month. But you might be able to do that. And you want to have your stuff ready to go. So this is something that in July we want to be really on top so that you're not having a lag. [00:43:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I should probably call someone there and talk to them about it. But —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well or at least — I mean they won't be able to give you an answer about whether they're going to cover — whether they're going to be able to cover me out of network before you actually have their plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of part the application will be me writing about what your treatment history has been, why it makes sense for you to continue with me rather than transferring you to somebody else. And they're not going to look at that until you're actually a member. And they're not going to take time for someone isn't actually on their plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can certainly have all the information ready to go so that you can send in your application. And you can be ready right away to make that call to get the papers sent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it usually successful? Or sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes. It depends on what their criteria is. So I can't make any guarantees. In the past when it's been successful to get permission it's somebody with whom I have a long history. [00:44:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean because the longer the history is of the provider the more it makes sense to continue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a wealth of knowledge and we have a relationship that's been built up over time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that bodes well for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that doesn't guarantee anything. You're in Andover and one of the criteria that they usually look at it is it possible to see a provider that's in network.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You happen to live and be treated in an area that has a number of therapists.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not somewhere where there is one therapist for every hundred miles. So that's they're kind of balancing (inaudible at 00:44:52).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) anyone else that you've sent an application in for — you're also in Cambridge. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) Exactly. Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I mean we just have to try it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. It probably also has to do with whoever gets it and what kind of mood they're in when they read it and stuff. [00:45:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I don't know how many different reviewers they have. I mean obviously they have their criterias they're looking at but it's also (inaudible at 00:45:10) subjective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we will —</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really annoying that they don't have that criteria list online that you can look. And obviously you wouldn't be able to get their exact decision without talking to them but at least get an idea of whether or not you think they'll approve it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And I don't have access to that. I'm sure they keep that private for a reasons.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just really annoying. And I'm like should I just apply for Blue Cross out of pocket? But that's like $400 a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let's — keep applying. You may have a job by August 1<sup>st</sup> and not have to worry about this. In case that you don't, we'll have this stuff ready to go so that we can facilitate the process as quickly as possible. Do what we can on our end. [00:46:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So do I wait till July to send this in or try to do it now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think if you have the forms filled out in July and have it sent in mid-July that's probably plenty of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But have it ready to go so that you're not searching for the appropriate forms and downloading them July 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. The appropriate forms are already printed out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course I realized after I'd printed out fifteen pages that only needed to print out maybe like ten of these pages. Because a bunch of the pages at the end are supplements for specific things for like long term care, or disability or trying to get U.S. citizenship. Or proof of citizenship if you don't have it. And stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have the stuff you need. It sounds like you had a question about prescription coverage so that might be something you could research while you have time now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though they don't seem to have information —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't have (inaudible at 00:46:56).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a lot of goes around in circles on their site. I mean it's just really annoying. It goes in circles.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Yeah. So maybe that might be a phone call that you get prepped to make. [00:47:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not today. But in the coming weeks so you get those answers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we stop there for today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we're on for not this Monday I know because you're away but the next one after that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the following Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the 18<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the 18<sup>th</sup>. Yeah. Normal time. [00:47:21] [End of audio]</p>

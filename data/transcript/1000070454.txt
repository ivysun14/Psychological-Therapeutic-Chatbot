<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: This is the sixth interview. This is the sixth interview.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (recording begins abruptly) and we were talking about (inaudible 0:13) in the Orient like a male or a female (inaudible 0:24) pretty interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't been to college for a long time, but it was pretty interesting. I learned a few things (inaudible 0:37). I might go back and finish school. Strange things have been happening. One of the reasons I went to the psychology class is because my sister-I don't know if you've ever heard of anything like this-we don't even know. Something, I don't know, kind of psychosomatic is happening with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She has a-she's had this inner ear problem for awhile. She was out in San Diego and she wasn't doing anything and she was alone for eight months. Her husband was working but she wasn't really doing anything and her husband's family is kind of neurotic anyways and she supposedly has been talking herself into all these sicknesses and illnesses. She's gone to a couple of doctors and one of the doctors suggested that it might be psychosomatic or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said it stemmed from family problems and she didn't say anything else. I don't know. It was pretty interesting to me because she asked me all about therapy. I think she was thinking of going to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst. I think she wanted to go to a psychiatrist. I think she has more confidence in them. From what I knew about what was happening, I said maybe therapy ought to be better for you. [2:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel is happening with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if-see she dropped out of college to go to San Diego. My dad was really mad about it when she stopped and everything. I think it's because she's starting up again with school. I think something's hiding with that, but I'm not really sure. It's really an interesting problem but she won't say anything more than it's a family problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's pretty troubled, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of went with her today, then, helped her out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she said she gets these really dizzy spells in the afternoon and everything and I just thought if I went with her I could see what was happening. It really got me the other night, like I told you; she wanted to know all about therapy and stuff. It's kind of funny because I tried to tell her-because after Adrian was born what I was doing. I had a lot of time and I began thinking a lot of things. And I said my problems were sort of mental but I think hers kind of drift toward the physical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like she's troubled the same way except that it expresses itself differently. Are you concerned about her? Or just more or less curious about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little of both. I don't know. She always kind of surprises me because you think she's very-I don't know-just callous about things and she's taking this whole thing very hard. Maybe she needs more attention than she really pretends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She always looked like she was stronger than you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or she didn't care about things. If somebody did something, big deal. But, I don't know. Maybe deep down she really is the complete opposite of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like now that she's troubled; she's leaning on you a little.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't-well, I guess maybe it's more my folks. But, I don't know. I think I've just been seeing people in a funny way lately. I don't know if it's me or them, but they-everybody just seems so-I don't know-like they're falling apart. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like my girlfriend, the one who recommended me to get therapy, she just-when I go and see her and everything and talk to her, she just feels like any minute she's going to have a nervous breakdown or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's really having to hang on hard to hold it together. [04:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and she keeps-she keeps saying things like she's okay and she knows that she's functioning a hundred percent. She's above average as a person and all this. When I see her and when I talk to her it's like every-you know, like-for-she just, you know-falling apart as a person. I don't know. Maybe it's me-why I relate to her or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of seems like all the people around you are really struggling to hang on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I don't know. Maybe it's just the way I see it. Maybe it's not really happening-like I'm not sure about it, you know? She goes to a therapy session, too, and she kind of recommended the whole program to me and she was telling me it was really strange-first of all, I think, as a person, I don't think she sees herself all that realistically-but anyways, let me tell you. She said she was screaming and yelling at her therapist and everything and in a way we were talking about how we related to our therapists and stuff. She said she related to her therapist as a close friend and I guess they're about the same age anyways. She wanted to relate that way. </p>

<p> I said, "Well I think that I relate to my therapist as a therapist to client or whatever you want to call that" and I said that I prefer it that way for certain reasons because I told her if I thought if I got too close it-you know-I'd-I don't think it would be..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be hard for you to be able to talk? [06:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-I wouldn't-I don't think I would improve or just be able to-I guess see things as they really are. Because, you know, friends are friends but I maybe I need the authoritarian-type figure, somebody who knows more than I do. But it was interesting because my girlfriend said that she saw her therapist sitting there and-first of all, after they became friends-first of all she saw her as this big authority figure but now she realizes that her therapist is a girl like she is and they have a lot of things in common. But her therapist knows more than she does about psychology and that type of thing and she, the girl, doesn't like it for some reason. She's now in a position where she's competing with the therapist. [07:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like she doesn't really want to tell her anything or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. I don't know. She said she felt very hostile, maybe to the therapist. She thought the therapist was making her feel that way, too, where she was the client and she didn't know as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's making her feel like she really didn't know enough to tell her what to do with her own life or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't think her therapist was going that to be mean or downright nasty. I think it was just the feelings that my friend had. Because she's a psychology major, too, you know? And every-like I said, every once in awhile she'll come out and tell me what happened in her session. Like I said, she's screaming at her therapist or she cried and everything like that one time. I think I said "I think maybe you need new therapist" or something like that. [8:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really so different from the way you would want yours to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, first of all I don't-I didn't want it to be where I'd be competing with my therapist, you know? Because I think it's defeating the whole purpose of me coming. I don't know. I think she just treats everybody that way, though. I have a (coughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should I get you a glass of water? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Would you? Do you have a cup or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure I can find one. [09:08] </p>

<p>PATIENT: (coughs) Thanks. It's just one of those things like you get with your stomach growling really loud. (inaudible 10:45).</p>

<p> Like I said-I just started seeing people...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like their other side to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like there are more sides to them than you could see before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I kind of get scared, though when bad things happen to them or they appear like something's really changed in them. I guess that goes back to the thing that I didn't want people to change. I just wanted to be the one. [11:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like being afraid that if they change too much, everything around you will just come crashing down. You won't be able to count on it to be out there anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, well, I don't know. I guess-well, with my sister, I don't want to see anything bad happen to her. Like I don't want to see her get real sick or... Because she's real close to me. But, I don't know. My girlfriend is just-because, like, you know, I valued her as a friend for so long. She was a roommate of mine awhile ago. But I don't know. She's changed so fast that she really can't handle it and I don't think she knows it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like if she changes too fast, she'll be out of control or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I just see her kind of as a-you know when somebody's who's taking drugs like heroin, for example. That their face becomes real drawn and just real sickly and everything. Even her appearance has become that way to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's really suffering a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a lot of time I think of-she brings it on herself in a way. I'm just beginning to think that the way we are, everything that we do or just everything we say, anything like that its' all because of our parents. I really believe that. I really feel that the situations and the incidences and the things that have happened with our parents. I think in a way it's kind of doing this to her. Because, you know, she's just lost her sense of balance. I don't think she really knows herself or what to do anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like it's fixed so she just has no mind of her own anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She has a very strong mind of her own, but I don't know if it's really her mind because she always says to me that she wants to do one thing and she wants her life to be a certain way. Everything-her reaction and everything like that-is the complete opposite and she can't really control it deep down. Although outwardly she's a very strong person. I don't know, maybe it's a mental type thing, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like even though she wants to do one thing, she always does what her parents would want her to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Like in this case it's not what her parents-it's the-I guess it would be the exact opposite of what her parents would want her to do in a way. But because of things that happened to her when she was younger, it's just turned out that she does them this way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you can't get together with what you want to do and what you do do as long as you have a real strong pressure on (inaudible 14:27).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like you know what I'd like to learn more about? I'm not saying that she's insane or anything, but, I don't know. She has, I don't know, something that-that-in her mind that kind of makes her mentally a little-I don't want to say abnormal, but something in her mind that makes her not normal. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know if you can call it insanity or something but somewhere in there there's kind of an imbalance or something. Like myself, I don't know what you think, I don't think like I'm insane the sense like psychotic or anything like that. I may be hung up or really neurotic or something like that, but I know that I'm not really crazy in the kind of way she is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really a difference. Some of the things she feels that you just can't relate to anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And little by little I'm beginning to realize that in her situation and other people's situation that sort of they're not really responsible for what they do because there is this thing in their mind, this imbalance and they really can't control it kind of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of makes them do things (inaudible 15:52).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I could never accept it. I just thought it was the person trying to mean or something or doing it that way. But now I'm kind of beginning to realize that they really can't help it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Everybody has that experience, I think, sometimes. More or less. Sort of feeling like you just can't help doing something even though you know you shouldn't or it isn't the best thing or it isn't even what you mean. And then sometimes if you see somebody doing that a real lot, you start to wonder about yourself. Because you know you have that same problem sometimes but all you can see is that they do it more than you. [16:36]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, today in the Psychology class I said I was really getting interested in it and you probably know because you're a psychology major, but they were talking about id, ego and superego. I guess the id is the person, the party that's demanding and wants everything on the spot, that type of thing. And I was kind of wondering where-how an insane person, what part of the id or superego or ego or whatever-what part of the insane person that would stand out more. Or which of those three things would control the insane person. I think it might be the id. I think that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes the-what happens is those things aren't really in balance somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are in balance, you say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're just not balance right. Because everybody has all three of those parts if that theory is right. And I guess it's just a question or working things out so that you can do the things you want to do that your id is asking for without losing control from your ego or your superego.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If, say a person was kind of insane or something or whatever, would the id be in control ever since childhood? What would happen? [18:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of varies a lot...</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of a sudden.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People don't usually change all that fast.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it would be something that was building up ever since they were little?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not necessarily. For some people it seems like they can trace all their problems as adults to things that happen in their childhood. I guess for most people it seems like they can't trace it. But it may be that it doesn't really bother them until they get older, you know? Like sometimes bad things could happen when you're a kid but you could be a well-adjusted kid and then when you have to be an adult then they become problematic where they weren't a problem before. That's why most people have a real hard time when they get out of late adolescence into their early twenties, because it's a whole different thing to be a happy adult from being a happy kid. You have to be on your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do more people kind of freak out when they get older?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a hard time-a hard transition to make, to be an adult and to be responsible for yourself and not just obedient or something to someone else. Learning how to rely on yourself, sorting out what you can trust in yourself and what you can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just-I don't know-I just keep thinking-I'm trying to apply it to different people around me and stuff. I don't know. In the Psychology class I was really thinking about Adrian and if I made certain plans to do things so he would turn out one way would it be okay or what if I just let it go along as it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of plans were you thinking of making?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well today he talked mostly about sex. I guess he was talking mostly about girls but like with-you know-like, one of my girlfriends told me that Adrian would turn out to be a homosexual because he was just raised by a mother. There was no father figure around and all. I told her at first, I said "You're crazy" but then when somebody says something like that you start thinking about it and so I guess I was just kind of thinking today what could I do to make sure that Adrian turns out to be a normal male, that type of thing.</p>

<p> And I really didn't know. I came to all these goofy conclusions in my mind and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what? [21:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'd never let him try on any of my clothes (chuckles), you know, things like that. Stupid stuff. I wouldn't let him play with my purse and things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard not to worry about that, I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I guess, you know, I'd think about it anyways if somebody hadn't said that-that statement to me. But I have another friend whose dad died when he was really young. I don't even think he knew him. He was raised by his mom and he turned pretty well-adjusted and everything. I guess he's a Conscientious Objector. I don't think he's perverted or anything-he's going to the priesthood-something like that. He's twenty-seven and he's still a virgin and everything. But he seems to be well-adjusted and responsive to men and women and stuff like that. So then again I realized I think it's just the person's environment and maybe even the mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that puts a little burden on you in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I guess. I don't know. I don't want t go out of my way-at least I don't think I want to go out of my way to make sure that he doesn't try on my clothes or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really seems silly to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but like, so many absurd things really happen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, from movies or stories that you see, when kids play younger and they play grown up, I mean, they try on their parents' clothes and get all dressed up and that type of thing and I have all these thoughts and I'm the only one around or something and Adrian really does love to try on makeup and all that type of thing. I don't know, it's kind of weird because, in a sense, everybody that meets Adrian and talks to me says that Adrian is all boy. He's crazy about trucks and that type of thing. He won't even touch a little doll or something like that but I just think something twists or flipped and come out (inaudible 23:54).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like, so far he's all right. You're afraid suddenly he'll just change and he'll want to be just like you or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I-well-I guess sometimes I think about it, but I think everything will turn out okay. But it just-it's these thoughts I've been thinking about, it's kind of strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what your mother did that other time that got you so angry with her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think at the time I was just kind of being super conscious about being kind of liberal with him and everything. Now sometimes, you know, if he wakes up in the middle of the night and he won't fall asleep right away I put him in my bed with me and he'll go to sleep. But as soon as we move-I've got to break him of doing that. He'll have his own bedroom and then he'll stay in his crib or else cry it out for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really afraid that he's going to get too attached to you and somehow that will warp him and he'll end up being just like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He-well I-he is really attached to me now. It's getting kind of unbearable for me because he always wants to be around me and if I just pick up a magazine or I want to write something, he gets really upset and he'll come over and push it away and want to sit on my lap. Or if I hold-touch someone's arm or something like that or put my arm around someone like my parents, my sisters or anybody like that, he comes over and he pushes-he takes my arm away from them and will put his arm around him. It's cute, but I know it's bad, too. [25:46]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really afraid it means that there's something wrong with him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not wrong with him but I think he's just being-becoming really attached to me and that he should just, you know, I don't know-realize that I can-I guess he's kind of young-but there are other people around and for them and for him and for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of it is so you wouldn't be so tied down by him. How old is he, anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's just a little over a year. He'll be fifteen months Saturday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All that I know about that is that kids are supposed to be very heavily attached to their mothers when they're about one year to almost three years.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been reading as many books as-Dr. Spock and all that type of thing. And I know they're supposed to be but I can't help wondering if it's really all that all right because his dad isn't around all the time, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's really sort of like every time he does something that's confusing you're always going to have to wonder whether another kid who had his dad around would do it too or something.</p>

<p> But I think the hardest thing for a kid at that age is if he doesn't get to attach himself like that because it's a normal stage and then they outgrow it after. The only way they get messed up is if they aren't allowed to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because that's just a thing they go through. They're very attached from about one to two and half. They want to be there all the time. And then if you let them and they feel real secure, then they'll move out of it normally at two and a half or so. But if you keep pushing them away, then they just need it more and more and more. [27:38]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't really pushing him away, but sometimes it annoys me because I feel like I want to be free and alone for a few minutes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 27:50)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I have to take him all the way downstairs when I get my mail and everything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's real hard to have a little kid and not have any time to yourself. It's really a hard job being a mother.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's been getting up at six-thirty, seven lately. He'll come over and I'll have one eye open and he'll try to open the other one. He scratched the whole side of my face here (inaudible .28:19). I was reading that they say a parent is supposed to get away at least once a week to be by themselves from their kid and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's a whole lot easier if you can get off on your own every now and then. It's a pretty overwhelming job to have to be on every waking minute like that. [28:42]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a real hard part about not having his father around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well like even when Robert's around Adrian always-he still wants to be with me and everything. I don't know if it's because he doesn't know Robert or he just doesn't get along or can communicate in his way. It's doubly frustrating because there is someone there-do something with him. And the baby still wants to be with me and everything. Robert feels frustrated because he doesn't think the baby likes him. (inaudible 29:20)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's hard for you to see a way out of this at times.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like when I take a shower or something and Adrian is there crying and everything. I don't like to see him cry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 29:35) You really want him to be happy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's so nice. I got-you know, like-for his birthday somebody gave me some presents late for him. They gave them to me in the evening and he had already gone to sleep. So I gave them to him the next morning. He saw these big packages and I kind of showed him that they were for him. He was so happy and excited. It was so cute. He was trying to talk but he makes sounds and he looks up and everything. I took him into the living room and he was rushing along, he couldn't wait to get at them. He was kind of moaning as I was moving him to the next room. It was the cutest thing. He was so happy. I really loved that moment. It was like Santa Claus had come during the night or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really could feel like you'd given him something beautiful then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or especially, I just love to see the smile on his face. He was really excited. I don't think I've ever seen him that excited. Oh boy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My throat is just sore. Feels like sandpaper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. You know you were talking bout-thinking about taking away some of his toys and stuff and making sure he always plays with trucks and I was sort of thinking as you were talking about something you told me about your own childhood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you were always encouraged to do girl things, you said. [31:31]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really can't remember too much about it but I think because there were so many girls that we probably did. Like my mother is very feminine. She always likes the house clean type thing, that type of thing. But I don't-the only toy I ever didn't really let Adrian have was a gun, I think. It was an old dirty one anyways. My mother had found it. Usually I let him look at most things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really the way you believe now is to let him do his thing but I guess you have a certain amount of pressure from your mother's ideas about restricting him to boy things and being worried if he gets girl things in his path. You have to sort of keep reminding yourself to let him do his thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The pressure, the trouble comes in when she says things like "Adrian, you can't play a little doll because you're a boy" and stuff. I mean, at least he could look at it. I mean if there's nothing harmful. He just had a lead-screening test where they drew blood from his arm and they asked if he had ever-if I had ever seen him chewing on anything. There are some things in there that you'd never suspect have lead in them. Because maybe dye or something like that. But I think sometimes my mom forgets or she doesn't really know for sure. </p>

<p> It was funny, he had the needle in his arm-he had the blood drawn and it didn't hurt him when the needle went in. I guess it had to stay in it seemed like about five minutes or something. I didn't realize that the baby's veins are much smaller than adults and everything and the blood trickles through maybe two or three drops at a time. Adrian was getting nervous because there was this thing sticking in his arm and it was pulling up his skin. It really looked horrible to me. I thought I was going to faint, you know. And he was starting to cry and get a little nervous and wiggling a lot and he didn't like it. I said, "Can't you take it out?" and she said "No, we don't have enough blood yet." Then he did start crying and he was getting a little upset and I said "Can't you take it out yet?" and she said "No" and finally everything was okay. It was strange and they put a bandage. For the next couple of days he kept looking at his arm. After the bandage was off, he saw that it was kind of black and blue and everything and he kept looking at his arm. It was the first time I've seen him remember anything or know about something that's happened before and it just kind of got me. I think it was traumatic for him in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he's-now he pulls up his shirt and looks at his arm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he's making sure it's all right or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he remembered. I was just kind of thinking would that have some kind of reaction on him or do something to his mind a couple of years from now or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really worry a lot about his having some kind of bad experience now that's really going to suddenly crop up later and mess him up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, for some reason, I don't know why. I think maybe-well, I guess-because I feel a lot of guilt about him and everything. Because I was thinking about giving him away and all that type of thing. I just feel like he's so beautiful and perfect and everything and it all turned out well in the hospital, I really didn't deserve it because I was so stupid about things beforehand.</p>

<p> I just feel like something's going to happen. I don't know when or something because I'm just like that. I really didn't appreciate everything that happened. [35:48]</p>

<p> COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like you were thinking of not keeping him, almost like you're not sure that you deserve him now or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because-it wasn't-I don't know, it was kind of like two levels of wanting him. I don't know if you understand. A part of me wanted him. I guess maybe the mother part or the part that loved Robert or something. And then another part of me didn't-like the part that wanted to be free and still go out and do things and have fun like that. I don't know, it just-I just kind of feel guilty at times about that because at times I really wanted him but other times I didn't want to be a mother or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It's really like in a way you always wanted him except part of you kept saying it would jut be too much of a burden or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really didn't know at the time how much of a burden it would be. The burden would be the part about not being free, you know. But I think my mind was made up from actually when I was in the hospital and I had the cesarean section, you know, because it's stupid when you have that, you can only have three children in all if you have the cesarean section. So part of the-well I had already made up my mind before then, I guess you know, when I went in that I'd really want to keep the baby and stuff. But after I had the cesarean my mind was kind of made up for me because it would be really stupid of me to give a baby away when I can only have two more and everything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of became more precious or something. You couldn't replace him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I had to keep him in a way. I wanted to and everything and I was kind of talking to myself and God or whoever and I said I kind of understand after having the baby in your stomach nine months and carrying it and all that type of thing, I kind of realized what it was then, even before I saw him, just when I heard him cry in the operating room. But, I don't know, now my mind is still separated on the fact that I believe women should be allowed to have abortions. Because maybe-I don't know maybe I know what it is to have a baby in your stomach and that type of thing, but I still think that women should be allowed to have abortions. Maybe I might have had one if they had been legal and all that type of thing-if I had known more. Maybe I wouldn't have even had a baby if I had known more about contraception and stuff. But anyway...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard when you're young to know what the best thing is to do. It's sort of like you made your decision and it turned out so well for you in so many ways. [38:54]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was kind of just a side to the memory thing, like now I keep thinking if I had given Adrian away and he was with an adoptive family or something. He's really just a beautiful little boy and everything. I really don't think I would have done that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like being afraid every time you enjoy him or look at him that he's so beautiful that the hand of God is going to reach down and pluck him away because you weren't always sure. And I guess even now you sometimes have moments when you're not sure-just really afraid of getting punished for the unsureness. It makes it hard to enjoy him when he's at his best.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I have this feeling that for some reason-maybe it's because I've been taught you don't get something for nothing, you know. I get this feeling that good things just don't happen and that's it. Or I think that for all the bad, there's good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're going to have to get punished with something to get (inaudible 40:01).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much punished, but something happened to make it all joy and sorry and to make it all (inaudible 40:06).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must make it hard when you're enjoying him because then sort of adding up all the bad things that are going to happen to get at you for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think about it so much when I' m really enjoying him, at the precise moment. But when I start thinking about thinks, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's probably hardest when you're thinking any kind of unsureness or remembering any unsureness and then you must really worry about something bad happening or something when you feel guilty about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like he does something and I yell at him and that type of thing. I feel bad because I've done it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess probably you feel bad because it's sort of a moment when you're not really loving him at your most...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's that unsureness that you feel guilty about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I think I have a distortion of the whole thing in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of having Adrian and not, excuse me, not having his father around. I guess what I said before, not really knowing if I' m doing something or something is happening because of me or because of outside things or something else happening. Do you know what I mean? [41:32]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of. It's sort of like even though you do what you think is right, you're never sure if it would be like that under other conditions or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 41:45)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of sounds like every time anything goes wrong it's sort of like you really start blaming yourself a lot or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not every time, because sometimes I know I'm doing things right. It's just every once in a while something happens to me and I sit and think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's hard to know that you're doing the thing anybody else would do even with a father around or something. It's hard to know that he's coming out the same way he would with a father.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's something I think about most. How much influence, say, would Robert have? But like you said before, I realized that-I think with babies up to about year or two years old that their mother is their greatest influence on them. But I still wonder how Adrian would just be if Robert were around all the time-if he were even to be closer to Robert and stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What? If he were closer to him? Or...? How I would react? Well, I guess it would be okay with me. I mean, I don't know, I think I'd like to have Adrian know and like as many people as possible. I think it would be good for him just to meet a number of different people-to know them, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of makes it less demanding on you, too, if you don't have to be his whole world for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess it would help, too. I don't-I think as much as you say about mother being the main person that the baby wants the first years, it's still hard for me to accept it because like I just feel like my freedom is really down to this. [43:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like being trapped a lot of times.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it would be the same way with anybody. It was (inaudible 43:48).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess every time you have one of those difficult feelings or painful feelings about motherhood, it just gets sort of doubly hard because you always wonder if it would have been the same way if you had married his father or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just as far as time goes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I imagine all kinds of women feel like they're trapped in a little box with a one-year old child. But then they wouldn't be wondering, I suppose, what you're wondering and that makes it harder for you I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's hard like you said and I think about-so that's the main thing it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course, when there are rough edges, you're going to be thinking about it. When everything is just swimming along, you don't think about it so much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (coughs) I think last time Robert was in-I think I'm kind of resenting him because he wasn't giving as much to Adrian as I was as far as just feeding him and changing him, but again, this is the situation. Whether mothers are supposed to do this and fathers aren't or if it's because Robert is not around most o the time. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like in a way you wish there were some guidance from somewhere about how it usually goes and how it's supposed to be so you wouldn't always be wondering whether it would be different or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, like I told you, I've been reading all these books but some-for some-for obvious reasons I don't really believe it and trust it. Like I said, since his father's not around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're sure in a way that it must be making some basic difference in his life. [46:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Even though it may not, there's some reason I feel that way. I guess I think a family is a father, a mother and the baby. I think a lot of women raise their kids without fathers and it's no big deal, I guess. But for some reason, it is bothering me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard for you to imagine what a family without a father would be like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even now, they're letting single people adopt babies. Like a single man or single woman. I guess I should just be grateful that Adrian was okay, but it seems like I just want more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just want more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like the family type thing with what-two parents and a kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like in a way, to turn that just a bit, you're really grateful to have such a nice kid and everything but it's not really enough for you either to just have a nice kid. You sort of need a husband around, too, to go with him. [47:08]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or-I don't-I don't know, not so much the husband, it's just like the father role. I don't know-I think I just want to make everything as good as possible for Adrian with his father and everything. I am really thinking more of Adrian in this case. I guess maybe with a husband or just, say calling it husband and a baby I just feel less free. But if I said it like a father for Adrian and everything it just-I just-I think...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really just sort of like everything would be easier if it was not just you and the baby but a man who was there, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it would be. I don't know for sure, but I think it would be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that word husband really turns you off a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't turn me off but, I don't know, maybe it's Robert as the husband or something. I don't know. Maybe it is the husband, I don't-it's like I keep thinking I-just lately I hate being just the-I don't know, a housewife or just keeping the house clean and everything. I really hate it. It's not anything great or fulfilling or anything like that. I always thought it would be. I always said to these women "God, what could be more creative than setting up a house all the rooms and cooking real nice meals and everything like that" and you're just putting all your creativity into the meal and just doing all these exotic things and stuff. It's really a drag, coming down to it. So, I don't know, maybe using the word husband and everything just makes everything...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel like being trapped as a housewife.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. But like a father for Adrian, I think, it just-it kind of centers more around Adrian and, I don't know-I don't know-maybe it sounds more like a companion than for being (inaudible 49:15).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Less like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Less like-I don't know-just-well, I guess when I think of husband and everything I keep seeing all these family situations that are unhappy and everything. It's beginning-no, it really is-a husband and like that whole type of thing is really beginning to seem bad to me and just brings an unhappy connotation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its sort of like when you imagine sort of an ideal world for yourself it's you and Adrian and this father who Adrian is real close to who is a like a friend for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like my companion or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess that father is somebody who doesn't make you have to be a housewife and stay home and cook and all that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe it's when I talk about it or something that it really bugs me. If I was just doing it and nobody said anything about it, I think I'd be able to do it and accept it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 50:23)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, you know, making the meal, taking care of some-I don't think it would bother me then, but for some reason when I talk about it now I use all sorts of (inaudible 50:35).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like in a way you always thought it would be so neat and now you don't think it's neat at all but you're saying you'd adjust to it and it wouldn't be so awful. But it sure wouldn't be terrific or great or anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) If-I don't know-like I keep wanting the relationship between me and the man to be, I don't know, more exciting than just a husband and wife keeping house and that type of-taking care of kids. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the main point about husband is that it means there's nothing happening between you and him emotionally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's just-it's just from everything that's happened to me lately like relating to Robert, it just-I don't feel like-like I'm doing as much with myself with him. You know what I mean? I just feel like I'm controlling cooking the meals for him and that's the only part I'm relating to him. And with other people, all these other parts are coming out. Of course I don't cook meals or take care of their house. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really, in a way ... [51:53]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would just like to get a part-something where they all fit together. I guess everybody is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like wanting to be able to be yourself with all your sides with somebody and when you think about husbands what you imagine that turns you off, but it sounds to me that the husband for you is somebody who makes it impossible for you to be most of your sides. Just the main side or something. Do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Still-I don't know, I've just seen so many situations where it is just a rift. I think everybody has.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there are a lot of situations where (inaudible 52:34) and some people find other ways to do it, with luck. [53:43]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, with the other ways I've seen it, it just doesn't seem-I haven't seen that many, actually. I think I've seen very few. But it just doesn't-it kind of seems unreal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like, I don't know, something is wrong somewhere. It's not going to last or something like that. See, I've...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that like intuitively true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, what I think is I've been conditioned so much and to expect certain things to be the way they are. Even with certain words-husband-that type of thing. Yet I keep putting all these different labels on things and-I don't know-I don't really want to but it just happens and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort f like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I can't really-I can't really live my life doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you really want to get free of thinking things will always be the way you've always known them to be. It's real hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, I feel like I'm kind of living that way now, without putting all that many labels on-or at least I feel I enjoy living without the labels, but it always creeps back again. But I do. I, myself, always end up putting the labels on things. I don't really like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think the point about the labels is sort of like when you apply a label it's sort of like making your life into the way you've always seen lives be or something? It's sort of like snapping back to what you're used to or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of. But everything that's happened to me I just really-I don't know, it just happened. It wasn't really planned or I didn't say I want to do this certain thing or live this certain way. It always ended up kind of by accident and just feeling highway robbed and not really knowing and not being able to say that I'm doing such and such. It kind of all happened accidentally in a way. I guess a lot of times it was pretty enjoyable. But it frustrates me because I'd like to know-I'd like to be able to control what I'm going to do and to do it and to enjoy it, too. But it just doesn't seem that way [55:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really sort of like you really wish you could look at the things you've done on your own (bat ph 55:18) and say "Well, look I did that.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, add a notch to it and know that I did. But it's never been that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I deserve credit for that and when I make a decision in the future it's going to be my decision and I' m going on with my own life or something. I guess sometimes you feel like that a little, too. Sometimes-other times you've been here when you've talked about Adrian, you've said that you sometimes have moments that you're really confident of the way that you've chosen. But it's still like you don't really have someone you can argue back with-like this is my way and don't pull me back when (inaudible 56:00) [56:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I-like certain things you kind of feel that they're right, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's just like a matter of knowing right and wrong like the baby or something like you've done something you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...anybody would know whether that it's right or wrong and that type of thing. So there's no question there, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like it would be nice to have that kind of confident knowing that your way was your way or something. That you picked it and you were doing it and you were responsible for it or something. Then I guess the labels wouldn't be so powerful for-for you, but... I guess those labels are really your parents' way of pulling on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I wouldn't mind them so much, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really now it seems to me like that-that business about the husband thing is really sort of like all the husbands that you saw in your life, they really have a pull on you. When you think of husband it's real hard not to think of it the way your dad was, or something like that, and to imagine it some other way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. Or even the stereotype. Like even today in the psychology class, you know the example they always give-or you hear so much about the middle-class husband. He's loves his wife and everything and then he goes out and cheats on her sexually and stuff like that. I mean-you know-for exam-the teacher, he didn't really have to use that example, but that's the one he picked and everything. Like that-that-that throws a bad shadow on the poor husband again, too, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least for me it did. He could have used wife or something but he picked husband which is, I guess, in our society and culture-that's the more obvious one to pick. But I just thought it was a bad thing to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, he-he-he put a damper on the word husband (chuckles) because he said here this-he told a story or something about the husband who went out and cheated on his wife and stuff. [58:21]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just sort of fed right into your fears that husbands are really bad all the time anyway, something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it just did something to the word.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like husband is really sort of a tyranny for you, where you don't get to be yourself at all-do your thing. You sort of get locked in this little box with somebody else doing everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I think so many people though have done it to-done it to-I think a lot of-just TV has done it and all these stories. I'm sure a lot of times that they've done it in good humor and stuff but it's really getting to be something. Like even women's liberation is coming up with these things against men that's affecting them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really seems to you like it would take an enormous amount of control and stuff to be able to break out of that mold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. It's just-I don't know. Maybe I have these-I'm just getting bad feelings about love, too, because all these people that I know that have been married three and four year and the husband or the wife will come to the other-like my friends, even, and say they don't love each other anymore and the only reason that they're staying together is because of the kids. [59:54]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me in a way, when you were talking about what you used to think of housewives. Remember you were saying you used to tell other women how it was the most wonderful, creative...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In those days, in a way, you probably really bought that husband role, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, you know, everybody-the first thing you do when you get out of high school and college-well I think a lot of girls do it... I mean you say you want to get married and have a family and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of wanted a husband then who would lock you in a box with your kitchen...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and go out and do everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...at the time, you know, because I didn't really know any of-I didn't really know how to cook then either-and do anything. I didn't even make my bed at home and stuff like that. I don't know (chuckles) it was just like I was talking about something I didn't really know about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that was-that was the way to do things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm thinking is that it's probably pretty hard though. It hasn't been so long ago since you've thought that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's probably a couple of years. [61:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty hard to feel confident in some other kind of ways thinking of that when it's been so recently. In a way, though, you're saying that there are a lot of things that you used to believe two years ago that you don't believe anymore. And you wish you could be more confident of what you do believe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh... I'm not-I think mostly getting back to the husband and everything, I think if I met someone or I knew someone that I felt more of a full purpose in life, I probably would want to settle down and get into the family thing again. So I don't know, I think that most people if there was someone they really liked and wanted to be with...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you would want to go back to that sort of housewife thing again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't know, being with a person and that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Sort of like the only way you can imagine you would be with a husband is to sort of be the way your mother was or something. Even if it was somebody you felt like a full person with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep wanting it to be more, but thinking that I-in most cases it isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true enough. But I gue-I guess the real question here is how you would want it to be for yourself if it could be. What you want for yourself even if nobody else in the whole world ever wanted it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you see this-even this question is-it's kind of like a couple of years ago when I wanted the family that we were talking about a minute ago, excuse me, and at that time I didn't know that then. Now I think this might be the case again. I don't know what this other thing might be either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess in a way the hardest part of the thing you're going through now is sort of like rejecting old ways and just not really being sure what the substitute is or something. Wishing you could be more sure of it. You've heard me saying this-I know what I don't want but I don't know what I do want. It's always that way with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. It seems like it's such a short time ago that you gave up all these other ideas. There's bound to be a period where you're re-settling and figuring things out-finding out what the new way of looking at things means for you. [65:52]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just have a feeling that twenty years from now or something, I'll just go back to the way I was brought up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it really has a strong pull on you. I really hear that. It's just sort of like as far away as you move there's always this rubber band that you're yanking against pulling you back and back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think my dad was like that a lot. I think after he had his fling or whatever in college days and stuff, he's gone back to being really conservative and kind of that way. I don't know if I really want to but I just have this feeling-or maybe it's a fear-that I'll probably go back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess there's a lot of fear in that of just reproducing your parents' lives in a way. One way or another getting pulled back by the stuff that's inside you to-just sort of not having the strength to hold onto yours and finally getting yanked back into it. That makes it real important for you when you're not sure of why you're doing things the way you are, that gets you real upset. It means they can pull harder or something the other way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I think kind of like I know why-like why I said I'm going along doing these things and I don't know that I was going to do them but I kind of enjoyed them in a way. More so than I would if I was living in Oak Park in a way (chuckles). [65:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like saying well you have some things you're pretty sure of anyway and it gets better with time, I guess. It must be better now than two years ago. And maybe with time you'll be able to form some real confidence about your way and you won't be so worried about (phone rings) Well I guess we'd better stop. Hello? Hi, I'll call you back, okay? Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 65:58)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no. Anyway, before I evict you, how did that last sound to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way, I guess it's the way things are (inaudible 66:10) I don't know, I've just-I don't know-everybody-you keep talking about yourself and saying things and all this stuff but in the end I-what you are is just what you do from day to day kind of. You know? I'm thinking about how much it-you think about things that-or try and change. I think we are what we are, like kind of final. I just-you know-I think I'd like to learn more about psychology, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was going to ask my sister if I could borrow her books but I think I am-I'm going to try to read up on more stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like it's-in a way the real issue is sort of how you get what you're thinking to have anything to do with what you do or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: .I'd like my mind and everything-I'd like it to be the same thing, you know. Because I don't think it's ever really been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like so you could get it together so whatever you're thinking really made you do what you do or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you do-are you like that any? Do you think that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm more like that than I was when I was younger. I'm sure not completely like that. It seems to me like in a way...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess you'd be-if you were-you'd be really pretty straight and sane and everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. It seems to me like the hard part is when-is sort of sorting out what you want and where you are and who you are and then once you really have that clear, it gets easier to pull it together with what you think. It's hard when you aren't real sure of what you are yet. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, like I told you before, it's been going away from that for me in the past couple of years anyway. It's kind of like why I came to therapy because it was getting harder and harder for me to determine things. [68:27]</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so that's all out of the way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I got it all written down.  You're exactly right.  So how you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I was going to say thinking about when I got started with you here this time and I remember calling you, and you know, we had this going a couple of years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we quit, and I thought when I first came down here this time, I, I got the appointment by saying something about like feeling a little Mickey Mouse watch was going to just fly apart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I said something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I remember you saying that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so here we are a couple, 3, 4 months later, and I was thinking maybe that happy pill you got me going on is having some effect because I don't feel that way anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I, I had kind of a scare the other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which has nothing to do with you and I, I don't guess, but I was trying to get from A to B in my car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've made the trip from A to B a thousand times before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it just didn't come in my mind how to get from A to B.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I kind of followed my nose and it all turned out okay.  And when I got to B, I wanted to go to the bank, and there was a big parking lot.  It's kind of divided in half.  I went in one half of it, and it's a separate building and the separate building where I thought the bank was was a hamburger joint.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I recognized that, but then I had to turn around and go into the other half of the parking lot and there was the bank, but, uh, then I wanted to go see a friend of mine in the afternoon, and I've been to his house hundreds of times—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I couldn't figure out how to get from my house to his house, and usually it just happens automatically, but I, I just didn't feel it was going to happen automatically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had to kind of think I was at his house coming back to [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then to my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that made it okay.  Then I could find my way there.  As I say, I kind of scared myself.  God.  It seems to me I've heard things like that about Alzheimer's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, Alzheimer's or sometimes we just have those what's called senior moments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm [AGE] and I thought Jesus.  Well I'm making the two, um, my primary care physician now I was told as a result of a blood test a year or so ago at the [DEIDENTIFIED] that I ought to see a nephrologist, kidney doctor and so I found one.  He happens to be down at [DEIDENTIFIED] and there aren't too many of them in town, to tell you the truth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he's also an internist, and he's a Filipino, but I told him about this Alzheimer's thing and geez, right off the top of his head, he started writing on one of his prescription tablets, told me to take it down the lab, get all these blood tests.  There were about 6 different blood tests he wrote down just off the top of his head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That were the first indications, if they showed up, of Alzheimer's.  He said after we get the results of that, we'll worry about a CT scan or MRI or whatever.  He said, I said I understood there were some medications nowadays that could postpone it or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said yeah, well we'll get the results of this and let's see the blood tests say and we'll then go to the CT scan and MRI, if that's appropriate, and then we'll go to the medications if that's the case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now this is the nephrologist?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He surprised the hell out of me.  He's a Filipino, and as I say, he just wrote these blood tests out right off the top of his head while I mentioned Alzheimer's, and I was surprised.  Uh, actually it's funny, he's a Filipino and I asked him if he ever heard of [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] he said yeah.  He said he's very famous back home.  He was born in the Philippines, and I said well [NAME OTHER] was a classmate of mine at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well [NAME OTHER] was sent there by the Philippines.  He went to [DEIDENTIFIED] 4 years.  I think he went back to the Philippines and over a period of time he became chief of staff of their army—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then he became President.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he's famous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And by me relating that to my primary care physician I think we've kind of become buddies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But anyway, I think he, he amazed me by writing down these 5 or 6 blood tests right off the top of his head, and so I'm kind of impressed.  Actually he's been very good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With most of the problems I've taken down to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, uh, I'm very happy with him.  It's hard to find, the [DEIDENTIFIED] is worthless nowadays and they don't, it's not a hospital anymore, and so they've got 5 or 6 doctors out there and they finally told me I got a primary care physician out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I've seen a couple, anyway, I was just relaying all this to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe Alzheimer's is in the books, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's possible for any of us, [PATIENT NAME], but I think there's so many other possibilities as well.  I'm glad he's checking.  Have you gotten the results of those blood tests?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I have an appointment with him I think next Thursday or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was just on the docket.  When that happened, I called his office up and they gave me an appointment within a couple of days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which, uh, I've been able to do in the past, which is nice because a lot of these doctors you get a menu before you can even talk to a human being.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm so sick and tired of that crap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pardon me, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  So let me ask you this, you were going to have a CT scan of your abdomen I think too, after our last appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did that show anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, well I told my primary care physician downtown that my bowel movements had changed.  So he sent me to get a colonoscopy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the guy that did it is right next door down at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that didn't show up much of anything, just a polyp and that's normal and they checked it out and it's not, but I said well if there's nothing there, well I said maybe we ought to get an abdomen, and somehow I, his office is like pulling teeth, this GI doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's an Indian, and if you finally get his office manager on the phone, well all she says is well I'm away from my desk now, leave a message.  Anyway, I did get an appointment.  Somehow I got the, my nephrologist had sent somebody next door from his office, one of the girls—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Answer the phone, will you, and they answered it, and I got an appointment.  Well, then he, I took a stool specimen in to him that day, and he wasn't even interested in looking at it.  He just wrote out a couple of things on his computer and one of them said go down to the lab, and then get this abdominal—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	CT.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	CT scan, which I was able to do at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I already had one with my primary care physician and I thought he was doing my abdomen and he was doing my chest, but they combined the two.  Anyway, after all of that, they found out I've got 2 aneurysms right here in my groin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the major artery that goes down to my legs apparently.  So I've been referred to a vascular surgeon.  Well when I called up a vascular surgeon, the [DEIDENTIFIED], we'll provide you with names of specialists.  I call up and they started telling me, the girls in the office, what all that would be involved, and they said something about an ultrasound of your carotid arteries and I said well somebody just did a, they call them endarectomies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm remembering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she said oh well, if you've been, when I'm going.  I looked up on my calendar and oh, that was only a couple of months ago.  You'll have to go back to that guy, that surgeon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I've got an appointment with him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To see if there's anything to be done with these things in my groin.  I, I've never heard of that, but that turned up as an incidental outcome of the CT scan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they didn't find any cancer though in your stomach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they didn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or your chest.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Find anything in the intestines or stomach, which was nice to hear I guess, yeah.  I was a little worried for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know you were.  I'm glad that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But at [AGE] what the hell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ain't going to be here forever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not forever, but it sounds like they're finding you're pretty healthy.  You could be here for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my physical health seems to be pretty good, uh, other than that change in bowel movements and I guess it was the primary care physician at the Air Force Academy, he prescribed some Colace.  You ever heard of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a stool softener.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I take 1 at night and 1 in the morning, and that seems to have gotten things moving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, yeah, I'm glad because things were getting kind of, I was wondering what the hell was going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was eating, but I wasn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Weren't going, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Producing much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, huh.  So your spirits have been pretty decent lately, would you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has your mood or your spirits been okay lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well as I said, I think your Lexapro has kicked in a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't feel like I'm going to fly off the handle anytime soon.  I've been pretty relaxed except—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The thing that worries me the most is I forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hell, I got upstairs and I forget what the hell I went up there for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I guess that just goes with age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can.  Um, how's your sleep been, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't sleep any better than, well that's not true.  Uh, I usually go to sleep pretty good right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've got a little routine I go through that makes you sleepy because it gets monotonous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I see this and you go through 5 things around the room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That go away, the bureau, the dresser, the windows and the closets, and then you go to right here—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you list 5 things, locomotive, truck, cars, my neighbor's motorcycle and thunder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then you go through I feel my head on the pillow, my hand on my head and if you got repetitiously and pretty soon you're asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's boring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And once you get to sleep, do you stay asleep through the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, uh, that lasts 2 and a half, maybe 3 hours, and then I oftentimes get up and take a Tylenol PM, which will put me to sleep for another 2 to 3 hours.  And then about 3:00, uh, I wake up again and I go down in the kitchen and make myself a hot chocolate.  My son said hot chocolate's got caffeine in it.  That's a stimulant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said well, whatever.  I mean I'm going to get a hot chocolate and sit there in my chair and talk with my dog, who's on the floor and have that nice hot chocolate and put the cup back in the sink and go to bed.  I'm good till the dogs come wake me up at 6:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, that's kind of the routine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like it's working for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, are you taking the Ambien at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I cut those pills up with my pen knife.  They're hard as hell to cut in the cutter because they ain't round, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have resorted to that a couple of times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, maybe I'll take a half of one of those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Instead of the Tylenol PM.  You know, I've got, I've got them.  I haven't thrown them away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's fine, and when you take them, they work okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, they work pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Okay.  Um, how's your appetite been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I just thought of that this morning before I was coming down here.  I had some stuff on my mind and all of a sudden, it hit 9:00.  I said hell, you better go get some breakfast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I remembered seeing a half a banana in the refrigerator and so I went and got it and cut it out and put some cold cereal and cream on it and came, but I almost forgot to eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I get up at 6:00 with the dogs.  I give them something and get a cup of coffee or two, and, um, like I say, I had something else on my mind this morning and 9:00 I said oh hell, go get something to eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, sometimes I usually remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And dinnertime is kind of hard to forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean I don't think I'd starve if I didn't eat, you know, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not that interested in food.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [PATIENT NAME] are you getting any enjoyment out of the things you're doing each day, or do you feel like you're just going through the motions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the thing that I was thinking about this morning, I've got a big model railroad layout in my basement—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I built it years ago.  It's been my hobby, and, uh, it's pretty elaborate.  A lot of time and effort went into it, and money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they have a monthly meeting downtown of model railroaders, which I used to go to, but I don't anymore.  Uh, it's a long trip in town, and the guy who's the president, just gets up there and mumbles.  I can't hear him.  My hearing isn't, so I don't go.  Anyway, one of the guys that I made friends with and who's pretty active, he sent out some e—mails to all the members.  It wasn't necessarily about what was going on in the group, but I had an e—mail.  So I just sent him an e—mail and I said hey, tell the guys at the next meeting that if any of them want to come out here.  Most of them have been in my house and seen my layout, I said tell them if they want to make the trip out to [DEIDENTIFIED], they can come and help themselves to whatever they want to take home because I'm not doing anything with it anymore anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, shortly after he made that announcement at the meeting on Friday, uh, a guy that came to a meeting, he was at my house one night when we had an open house.  He came up with an idea.  He wanted to organize some kind of big swap meet.  That's where we'd get together and sell and buy stuff, and our group has been doing that here and there maybe once a year to raise some money, but he came up with the idea of doing it up in [DEIDENTIFIED].  There's a lot of model railroad groups up there and here in the [DEIDENTIFIED] at the big hotels.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I never thought much about it, but anyway he called up, and this guy is keeping going.  He's going to have a big swap meet down here what used to be the Sheraton.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What used to be the Sheraton on the northeast corner on the [DATE] of this month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll be darned.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he said well, why don't you just bring all your stuff down to the swap meet and sell it instead of just giving it away.  So I thought geez, that's only a couple of weeks away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, that's what I've been thinking about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm thinking about how I'm going to get all this stuff on this layout down to that swap meet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  That could be a challenge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I'm trying to put all that, that's what I was thinking about this morning.  That'll keep me busy for the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well [PATIENT NAME] have you been having any suicidal thoughts recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I've given that up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually I think those happy pills have given me a kind of, and I got a, I think I told you a little maple leaf stuck on my deck—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doors.  My glass doors [INAUDIBLE] my deck and I got it from that guy [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I told you about that I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It says let go and let God.  So I've kind of convinced myself that whatever is in store I'll just accept and if I get locked up in some Alzheimer's place, I understand you don't know who the hell you are or who your kids are or anything else, so grin and bear it I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, hopefully it won't happen.  Do you have any problems with the medications that you can tell, any side effects?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm taking 6 or 7 of them, and every time I get one, you get a thing from the pharmacy and I read those and I think oh God, because they all seem to say that they could be conflicting—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I ran them all by the pharmacist at the Air Force Academy the other day.  I told him I had heard that they have access to someplace on the internet or something and they can do that.  So he sat right there while I stood at the window and did it.  He said no, there's nothing up here that shows up as conflicting.  So, I don't know.  I'm kind of hesitant to take more medications because I can't help but believe some of them aren't fighting each other, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think you're doing fine with what you're on [PATIENT NAME].  I don't think we need to add anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, if I get this one for Alzheimer's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it delays, I guess I'll be forced to take that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See what comes of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and [PATIENT NAME] do you know how much you're weighing these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I, I haven't lost too much weight.  Yeah, I've been, every time I go to the doctor's, they put me on the scale.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A hundred and seventy five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One seventy five.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should weigh 160 I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you look like you're doing pretty well at 175.  Well, let's not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I lost weight there for a while, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, you're doing so well, let's not make any changes.  Let's leave things just the way they are, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I'm taking that Lexapro and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess I'll just continue to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, we don't want to stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have to send off for it, but that's not going to put me in the poor house, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, it's working well for you, and if we stop it, you're likely to slip back into depression and we don't want that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what, have you ever heard of B12 deficiency?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what it can cause.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Depression, nerve problems, fatigue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, there are a lot of things.  Have you had your B12 level checked?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's a DO in town here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know why, but I got an appointment with him a while back, and he ran a blood test—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it showed up my B12 was at 267 or something, and it should be 400 or more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Have you heard of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, he prescribed a B12 shot for me every month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And some doctor at the Air Force Academy prescribed a B12 shot for me 10 years ago, and I took it every month for 8, 9 years, and every time I went in there, the nurse or whoever gave me the shot, were you feeling any better, and I said I don't know.  I never knew I was feeling bad, but I stopped, and it wasn't until [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] down here ran this blood test 2 or 3 months ago, I've gotten a new prescription and I'm getting a B12 shot every month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think that, uh, is probably doing what, I just heard something about it on TV the other night.  I wasn't paying much attention, but I heard something about B12.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the adverse effects it can have if—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know why I'm not getting enough.  Why am I not getting enough?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't know.  Some people can't absorb it sometimes, but that's why they give you the shot.  Sometimes if you, if you were to take it by your mouth, sometimes it doesn't get absorbed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what they said, a shot goes right into the bloodstream.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I eat a healthy food.  I've always eaten healthy food all my life which is probably why I'm [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  It may be an absorption, but I'm glad you're getting the shots because that can help a lot, both in terms of not just your mood—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was getting a shot.  I got, I'm about the third one on a whole year's prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I had about the third one this month and I write it down on my calendar, get a B12 shot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I try to coordinate it with some trip—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm making out the Air Force Academy again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  That's going to be real important.  I'll keep checking on those two with you, and making sure you're getting those because that can make a big difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, from what I hear and what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] turned up, I never had anybody that I know of except maybe that doctor 10, 12 years ago at the Air Force academy picked up something on a blood test, but I've never heard of anybody said hey, your B12 is low, we're going to put you on shots.  This doctor just put me on and I took them for 8, 10 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Well, I'm glad you're getting them.  Well, let's do this.  Let's check back in about a month and see how you're doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My guess is you're going to feel at least maybe better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the next 3 weeks, whatever it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, we can do 3 weeks or 4 weeks, whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think everything's going along pretty—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Well, I've got either, uh, let's see, in 3 weeks, I've got a time on Monday at 11:00, which is [DATE].  Do you know if that would work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have to look at my calendar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to pencil it in and you can check when you get home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, pencil it in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you a card too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Give me a card and when I get home, I'll compare, look at my calendar and give you a call.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it doesn't work, then we can then go from there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it works, you don't need to call me.  If it doesn't, give me a call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I won't.  I won't call you.  I'll call you today or tomorrow if it's a conflict or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, good.  I'm just glad you're feeling better.  That's the most important thing, you know it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I say, I take the happy pills [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  It's about time, huh, that you start feeling better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Put this on my calendar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, we'll see you later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All righty.</p>

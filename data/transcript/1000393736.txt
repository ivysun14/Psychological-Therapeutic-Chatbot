<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) I was just thinking about the fact that while I was waiting, or just before you came actually, this—, I was overhearing a discussion about the astronauts, and—.  I don't know there was something about a plan that I hadn't before.  And then I was just thinking about the way I've reacted to this, and I don't know whether I would have anyway, but (sniff), I don't know, somehow I f_, I felt today that that has provided me with something to think about so I won't think about something else, because I had a r_, uhm, well it's, it's harder to remember it now, but it was a very vivid dream.</p>

<p>And I was in that state where I almost knew I was dreaming it and could stand back from it while I was dreaming it, and yet it was real.  And it was about MSCZ.  And I knew when I woke up he'd be there the way he really is, but yet in the dream it seemed very real the way I was dreaming it, and then when I did wake up, it w_ was different from the dream and the way it usually is.  But yet there was a hangover from the dream, that's been with me all day.  And, I don't know, I keep feeling that worrying about the astronauts, I think I'd be concerned anyway, but, I don't know, somehow I feel as if it's also a good outlet.</p>

<p>Because really in effect, in the dream I was losing MSCZ, and I—, there was something—, I don't know whether we were on a trip at one point and that we'd gone to PCHN, and there was some woman there.  And it turned out that it a the CHN woman that for some reason he'd started to write to, no knowing her and then their connection grew.  And I don't know whether this particular a_, detail came from the book I'm reading, which is of a man gradually becoming more involved with a woman when he doesn't intend to, first not knowing her.  And, uhm, I knew all along it was because, and it was I think in—, at one point in the dream I think he said it was because of the way I've been the last year with him.  But it just, I think it was just this way of rejecting him and pulling in myself that—.  Well, the thing I was describing yesterday, I guess, the feeling I had over the weekend.  And then at some point in the dream it wasn't a CHN woman, which had been the one he'd written to and was becoming attached to, but it was the girl, FNI, the girl who was on the trip with us.  This, just a few weeks ago.  And I just had this feeling, once it was her there was absolutely no hope for me.  And, and so I'd lost h_, MSCZ, and then when I woke up (sniff, clears throat), I don't know, there was still, not so much a feeling I had lost him as, I was in real danger of losing him, when it's not, doesn't seem to be that way at all.  Because I think lately I've been making him happier, but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that, and I don't know what this means except that the dream was on my mind when I got up.  But, uhm, this was the first morning for (exhales) I don't know how long that I did not start wondering if I were pregnant or not, and wonder if the way I felt had anything to do with being pregnant.  And I don't know whether I've imagined feeling sort of queazy or if I really do or if I would anyway.  Because I hate getting up early, except I did while I was on vacation, too.  (pause)</p>

<p>Eh, I also just started thinking about what had been on my mind yesterday at the very end.  After you said what you did, and I was thinking about it and, I don't know, I guess I've—, because I've always wanted to have signs that I'm coming along rapidly or something, I felt depressed at the thought that here's the same old problem that I want something I can't ever have, and not accepting what I am and (clears throat).  And, I don't know, I had just been thinking, too, about the fact that sometimes lately, I don't know exactly when, but I had been thinking that I was making some progress in accepting what I was.  And it just seemed then that I'd hidden it better from myself.  That was all.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, this was sort of a feeling in the dream, too, but I don't know whether they're connected or not of yesterday, when I was thinking about that.  Thinking I don't know what to do because no matter how much I think I'm being honest or trying to handle things, the next thing I know it turns out I wasn't trying, I didn't want to try or there was something else I wasn't being honest about or wasn't seeing.  Because even though I knew those things in a way, you had to tell me and I didn't know them really until you told me except it wasn't any surprise when you told me.  It wasn't anything that I could say, "Well, I don't see it," or "I don't agree" or "I don't understand"  because I did.  (pause)</p>

<p>Now the thought just occurs to me that maybe something about the fact that I couldn't do it on my own was bothering me, but I don't know if that's true.  Because something was—, kept coming into my mind about the astronauts.  That, I don't know, I've always sort of liked the idea that there might be something in numbers that is mystical, I don't know, anyway, out of man's control.  And it kept occurring to me today, they should never have numbered this one XPL.  And I don't know, because here I'm one moment saying I want control, and want to feel I have it, and don't want to feel I have to depend on help.  But then when I was thinking about that today, at one point it occurred to me, I don't like what's happening.  I feel very badly what's happening, except that I like the idea that there is something beyond man's control.  Because then somehow I think I was thinking I could—, maybe this is the way I sort of get rid of feeling of responsibility for myself.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I, I wonder about this, too, that the reason that I didn't say what I was thinking at the very end last time—.  I don't know if I would have said it if there had been more time, but I hesitated anyway because the thought immediately occurred to me, too, that another time when I was thinking or feeling depressed about what can I do or I'm just feel as if I'm getting nowhere, or something, you pointed out, in effect I was criticizing you.  And I don't even know now if that's what I was doing or am doing. But anyway yesterday I didn't feel I could face it if it were, I don't know why either.  Unless it was because you had just told me something that was helpful.  And yet maybe I resented your telling me, and so it wasn't very nice of me to have immediately become angry.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I wasn't clear about what it is that you didn't say at the end of the hour yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The feeling of, I don't know, getting nowhere, being back at a place I thought I had already gotten by or, thinking that I had begun to accept what I am, being a female really and that I don't have a penis and so forth.  And yet it seemed to me yesterday that what you were pointing out was basic to my not accepting I was a female. (pause)</p>

<p>Mainly I guess because I think if I really accepted it I wouldn't feel I had to make up for something.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You, eh, hinted that you were thinking about the astronauts because you didn't want to dwell on the dream.  What I notice is that, in fact, you have mentioned the dream, described it, said a few things in connection with it and gotten off it, rather than trying to, uh, understand it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think I still have that feeling when I think about it, that I had when I was dreaming it.  In a way it's something that could very possibly happen.  That's the feeling I have when I think of it.  And then what comes to my mind after saying that is the reason I f_, I must feel that—, when what I know is that MSCZ's been happier and that there's less danger of it now than there used to be, is because—, th_ I must have been having some thoughts that were partly being talked about yesterday, toward MSCZ that if he knew he would leave me.  And it just makes me think, too, of something that sometimes MSCZ's said when I have been rejecting him in one of my several ways and—, for the different reasons I do and he's sometimes said that I'll say, "It isn't you.  It's just the feeling I have," but he'll say, "But it is me."  (pause)</p>

<p>And what I think now is that, that sometimes I (exhales) I'm not—, I think I have almost a feeling of hate toward him because he's a man.  And has what I want and can never have.  And I—, it seems to be that's what's behind my being so bossy sometimes.  And I was just thinking about with the boys, too, sometimes I think I'm really feeling hateful toward them, and then I—, that's when I'm most bossy and managing and so forth, get in bad temper quickly and—.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think all these times I've denied it's him personally, if I ever didn't deny it then he would leave me immediately.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because I think at those times the feeling is that I want to destroy him.  And then I'll be the most powerful, which again is kind of making up for what I don't have.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that I don't know what more I'd ever want to say on this subject, because I feel as if I've said everything.  And then it occurred to me that practically every time I've thought something like that, it's turned out that I've stopped before thinking something w_, that will really matter.  U_ usually in terms of being hard to think, but—.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeh, there is something conspicuous by your avoiding it, in the dream.  You refer to the central feeling you had.  You've dwelled on that.  You've talked about it, felt it.  You mentioned the CHN woman and some association to that book you're reading.  But just one conspicuous absence in what you're thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The other girl? (pause)</p>

<p>When I think about that now it (exhales), I remember that in the dream, I don't know, it was almost—, somehow she became in place of, I think, this CHN woman who's nobody I n_, I don't know, I just sort of in the background somewhere.  It almost seemed like in the dream her head got bigger and bigger until the memory I had at the end of the dream is just seeing this girl and, and, I don't know, MSCZ wasn't even there anymore. (pause)</p>

<p>And, and the feeling that I was giving up in a way, that there might have still been something I could have done, but I had the attitude that there was nothing I could do.  And I think I put it in terms of if she wanted MSCZ, not in terms of if MSCZ wanted her.  (pause)</p>

<p>And just the feeling that with this threat there was nothing I could do because the more she wanted MSCZ and, and got what she wanted, the more I would become sulky and bad tempered and just very unattractive.  Almost on purpose to—, I don't know— (deep breath).  On purpose in that I wasn't going to make a fight.  Already feeling that she would be better if I tried to fight.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of the fact that in real life—.  In the dream the way we would be fighting, and the way she'd be attracting MSCZ would be in being interesting company.  Because in real life that's what MSCZ likes about her.  I don't think he finds her that attractive.  Except in terms of the fact she's a lot of fun to be with sometimes and is intelligent and just interesting.  And the I just started thinking about the fact that there are a lot of women, that we know, and it always seems, when it's couples MSCZ, in a way, likes the woman better than the man.  And I always feel threatened by that.  Even though it might just be just what it is there of enjoying the woman's company, finding her interesting.  And I think there's something, I don't know, on MSCZ's part, sexual, but I'm not sure it means it's a threat to me, but I take it that way.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because as soon as I know MSCZ's at all interested, just in terms of liking to talk with a woman, I always—. I think I start thinking I can't compete, or maybe sometimes, will I be able to.  But I think often a feeling of I can't.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I find myself wondering, how come you don't refer to FNI by name.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know why.  I have this feeling I never like using names.  I always find it hard to start.  And so, I know that and it— (clears throat). I know once or twice when she's come up I've thrown her name out, like today I did once and it was almost like I think then I've done it and I don't have to keep referring to her after that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is that just here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I hadn't ever thought about that, but (hesitates) I think I say her husband's name more easily than I say hers.  Or at least I know I feel sort of self-conscious.  I think I of_, I often do when I use names.  And what, what I think of is—, the reason I think I feel self-conscious is because I think that no matter how well I know people, because I know, we know, this couple very well at this point, I would not easily fall into some affectionate nick-name or, I don't know, a less formal way of speaking to them or addressing them.  She's called FNIZ by some people.  I know I'd never say that to her. And then, and then it just makes me think of FYC, that my parents used to call FYCZ or FYCZ and I never did.  Or I remember once or twice, I guess I thought, "Well, I thought I want to be like my parents and be as familiar," and FYC made it very clear to me she didn't like it.  But also I wasn't natural doing it, or at ease doing it.  (pause)</p>

<p>I wonder—, I was just thinking, too, of the fact that I never was called anything but FAJ at home.  But friends of my parents called me FAJ, which I liked, partly simply because that it meant a certain affectionate closeness to me that they'd want to call me by a nick-name.  And, then I was just thinking that everybody else in the family had a nick-name.  And I was the only one who didn't, from my parents.  And, I don't know, if that bothered me more than I used to admit or have ever thought.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I_, what I do hear when I hear my name, or imagine hearing it now, my parents calling, is a very unpleasant way of saying it, which is easy with the name FAJ and always because there's an unpleasant reason for calling me.  I was just trying to imagine how they'd call me if it were for a pleasant reason.  I can't think.  I mean I can't hear it said in a pleasant way.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about, again, that hearing the way my parents would speak to others as to me and it—.  I think, I don't know, it doesn't seem that I'm just forgetting all the times they spoke my name nicely, but I really think there was a lack of warmth, compared to the warmth, and it was always very restrained, that they would put into saying the names of FYC or FNA or MLWZ.  And I was, I don't know, seeing that I was so unpleasant practically the whole time I lived at home, I can imagine it would be hard to feel warm toward me.  But still—.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking of something that occurred to me, oh, I don't know, I guess I think it a lot and I'm not sure why except maybe I find it gratifying right now to think it.  That I feel I'm the only one, that after questioning a lot of attitudes of my parents, or way of living, that has not just slid all back into them. And, and MSCZ would say if I start talking this way, "Well, it's because of me."  And in a way it is, in that he wouldn't let me alone if—, when I was inclined to slide back into them.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking that one of the things I was thinking when it was a question in my mind whether or not to feel seriously about him I guess.  Was—, how much was he like my parents, and, at one point, it seemed to me he was very much like them.  I remembered a conversation we'd been having, and that distressed me very much, because I wanted him not to be like them.  And, I don't know, I started wondering how much did I want MSCZ because he wasn't like them, and that I hoped he'd do what he did do for me, which was to, I don't know, not let me alone so I did get kind of free of things, things that I would question and would feel were wrong, but would still do and think.  And I suppose why I was thinking that when I was thinking about there not being any warmth on the part of my parents toward me—, I think there's more now than ever—, might have been part of it, that I was less attached to them.  So it was easier to make a break from it.  Because I know FNA and MLWZ have both tried, and it's very clear MLWZ's not going—, unless he changes suddenly—, going to make it.  And I don't think FNA will now.</p>

<p>And it still bothers me in a way, because somehow here they all agree and see things the same way, and so they're close, they're all part of something together.  And I'm just as not part of it as I ever was.  And it bothers me I think still, maybe not quite as much but—.  Because I always felt outside of something in my family, and, and I still am.  Now more my own choosing, but it's not easy.  Maybe it's not so easy now because, I don't know, I feel more clear on what I d_, I don't see the way they see things, and— (clears throat).  I gue—, I guess before there was always sort of a vague thing.  And I always thought, "Well, if I do something differently It won't be that way.  And now I know there's a distance that will always be there.  And I want it to be there, I think, because I don't like what I am and what I start becoming and thinking and feeling when I'm in this group.  But yet I still want to be part of it.  (pause)</p>

<p>I just was thinking that that's pretty far from the dream and FNI in it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeh.  Like FNI's the last person you want to think about right now.  What's she got that you don't have?  What does she have really?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, she literally has children.  (pause)</p>

<p>And the other that, the only other thing that I can think of now that she—, that I think she has, that always is, is somewhere on my mind, or often when we're together, is that she has an ability to take part of conversation so that she's witty sometimes, and interesting, fun.  She makes up her mind about things, and I don't know, there's an aggressive quality to the way she is that I don't have.  Eh, that in a way seems masculine.  And sometimes I think what it is is that she's better at being an aggressive woman than I am, which is what I want to be.  Because she is very, very bossy.  And I recognize there's some things that on one hand I want, I am jealous of her for that are very defensive on her part.  But that's the kind of defensiveness I guess that she's making up for something better than I'm making up for something.  (pause)</p>

<p>And again I don't know whether I'm sort of pushing this in but it does keep occurring to me that it's—, she's like the way I would have thought of my mother.  And I don't know whether I would have thought of that way if my mother just simply because she was so much older, has a head start on me or—.  And also she had my father and she had children.  And she was the one he wanted to talk to at night when he came home.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know why I decided not to say this, but I was thinking she n_, just along with everything else she was the one he wanted to go to bed with.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I know I must have felt very jealous and very inadequate in comparison with her, because—.  Just thinking about the feeling I had then, it was my father I wanted to be with, not my mother.  It was nice and comforting to have her around somewhere in the background, but not having what I wanted.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

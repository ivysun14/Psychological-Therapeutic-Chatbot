<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm excited that the things that we thought might be troublesome or out of whack...  were pinpointed so good.</p>

<p>MARGE: You know, it's interesting because I logged on to the web and I found the website that talks about the links between all of these conditions on peri-menopause... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ahh.  Okay.</p>

<p>MARGE: ...and it was all about how instead of trying to treat each system as if it were independent, especially with women....you have to see them all working together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>MARGE: And that low thyroid and insulin resistance are often common together.  And they talked about how some symptoms can be masked as adrenal, pituitary-adrenal problems and so I was so grateful that I had that checked that, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Had them all done, yeah.  Good.</p>

<p>MARGE: I know exactly what it is.  And they also talked about high levels of estrogen combined with lower levels of progesterone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Yeah.  That's good.  Good.  Who else came on?  Didn't somebody ding on?</p>

<p>SARAH: Hi.  It's Sarah.</p>

<p>MARGE: Oh, hi Sarah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did get an email from Michelle, you guys probably got it too, that she's not gonna be on the call tonight.  I can't remember if it was because they were driving to Utah or... but I expect everybody else, right?  I've talked to, talked to Ana and she seems to be feeling a little more human.  Ahh, her voice was still pretty raspy but, she sounds like she was feeling better and will be on the call.</p>

<p>SARAH: Good.	</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  And so, Sarah, how about the divorce papers?  Have you gotten them yet?</p>

<p>SARAH: I went into the office today, to the lawyer's office and signed the last bit-- so they are sending them to John and he should get them tomorrow or Thursday at the latest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so when are you calling him to tell him?</p>

<p>SARAH: I've sent him an email that they were coming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you didn't hear back from him, right? </p>

<p>HELEN: Hi.  It's Helen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey, Helen.</p>

<p>MARGE: Hi, Helen.</p>

<p>Helen: Hi.  Who's on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, Marge and Sarah and Josephine and now Helen.</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, okay.  You know, I called Michelle earlier and it rang and rang and rang and rang and she never picked up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got an email from her saying she's not gonna be in the call tonight.</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, okay.  And, and I talk to Kara last night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: And, ahh, she left right early this morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  So they are on a little second honeymoon, huh?</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah.  That's sounds like a great trip.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Oh, good.  Good.  So we'll miss her.  How are you doing, Helen?  You sound very upbeat and I'm delighted to hear that.</p>

<p>HELEN: I got the job!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yay!</p>

<p>MARGE: Oh yay.</p>

<p>HELEN: I'm shocked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're shocked that you got the job?</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah.  Sarah's on right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: Thank you, Sarah!  She's the one who told me about Business Debtors Anonymous.  I don't have debt yet.  I'm just an under earner and I suffer from vagueness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>HELEN: And what I've learned in that program in two short months is that the spiritual axiom to make enough money to support yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  </p>

<p>HELEN: I can't work full time because I have fatigue.  I have too much ADD.  I am too disorganized.  But the truth is I need to make enough money to support myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: So, it's God who is gotta provide the power... to help me to be able to the job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.  Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: Am I right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds right to me.</p>

<p>HELEN: You know there's someone in the BDA (Business Debtors Anonymous) who told me something today.  He said, "The hard part is getting it.  Working at it is the easy part."  And I remember when I got accepted at Yale.  I didn't go to Yale because I didn't think I'd be able to handle the work load.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my gosh. </p>

<p>HELEN: And I found out later getting accepted is the hard part.  Once you're in there, it's the easy step-- the easy part.  And so I've been telling myself that half of my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.  Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: What I found out later is that-you know, Yale is not any different than any other university you go to once you're in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>HELEN: I'm talking about as an undergrad...Graduate school would be different I assume.  But, uhm, it was like-- I, I've-- I mean, I wouldn't go and my father was so upset with ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: ... me because I felt I had too many limitations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ohh.  That is so sad.  Well it is sounds like you're letting go of them now.</p>

<p>HELEN: Well, it's gonna be very tough and, uh, you know, I talked about the balance and all that.  I have a friend in A.A.  He's been sober many years and I told him about what was going on in my life and that if I get this job, I'd have to commute everyday to SAN DIEGO  And he tells me he has a friend who's got an extra house up there.  This woman, I didn't even know her guys, called me the night before my biopsy and said, "Gee, I hope everything goes well for you with your, your biopsy, and by the way, if you get the job, I'll give you a key and you can stay at my house to cut down on the drive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't that amazing?</p>

<p>HELEN: And you know what, Josephine?  She didn't want any compensation except for me to pay it forward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.  Wow.</p>

<p>HELEN: That is God.  That is the program. And she's sober 27 years.  She's very spiritual.  She's a lovely lady.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.  Wow.</p>

<p>HELEN: -- and when I got that message from her the night before I went into surgery, along with Marge's email, it was wonderful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>HELEN: I-- Marge sent me an email-- to me saying, "You are gonna be okay, I know it."  Those two things let me know...that I was gonna be all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Wow.</p>

<p>HELEN: Anyway, that's, that's all I wanna say and now I, I don't have breast cancer and I don't have to look at debt for the rest of my life or how am I gonna live, you know, with this mounting bills.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good for you.  So I-- you're not calling it DA, Debtors Anonymous.  You're calling it something else, right?</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, BDA.  Excuse me.  The two were kind of linked together.  BDA is Business Debtors Anonymous.  So people who own businesses have their own group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>HELEN: And in-- I, I don't-- I think actually both of the meetings that I attend are BDA.  And I think they're kind of-- if you look on the internet, they kind of commingle them.  I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  All right.  Wow.  Well, I sure love hearing the upbeat tone in your voice.  I sure, uhm, love that you see the way of the Universe took care of you and helped out with that.</p>

<p>HELEN So hey, Marge, are you online?</p>

<p>MARGE: I am.</p>

<p>HELEN: You sent me an email about a week and a half ago and I just-- something about the email, I just-- you said you're gonna be okay.  It's gonna be fine and its like, "Wow!".  I saved the email... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah, I actually knew-- I knew that from the very beginning when you were talking about it.  But I don't know if you heard me on the call when I said it.  I wanted to make sure you got it again.</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, wha-- how did you know that?</p>

<p>MARGE: I just know it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's, she's our resident psychic.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah.  And you wanna know, Marge?  I believe that you knew it.  That's what was so interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: You know, that was what was so wonderful.  So thank you very much, Marge.</p>

<p>MARGE: Ah, you don't have to rely on me here.  You know.  Just like Josephine said, the tone in your voice is like, "Wow."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: What a gift.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: Anyway, thank you all for supporting me through all the cancer scare.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're welcome.</p>

<p>HELEN: You know, it was a heck of a, a couple of weeks ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right,  but it's sure been a pleasure to be part of the support team.</p>

<p>HELEN: By the way, this is the interview that I cancelled on and re-scheduled 'because I was so sick?  And I still got the job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you still got it.  Oh, and it sounds like one that you want, right?</p>

<p>HELEN: I'm selling coffee.  And I love coffee.  Coffee and organic teas and, you know, things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think it sounds perfect.  You sound upbeat about it.  It's probably gonna be fun.</p>

<p>HELEN: I mean, it's a base plus commission... </p>

<p>MARGE: Well, just remember, you know, you're working for God.</p></p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: Absolutely.  I'm working for God and, and I can't forget that.  You know why?  Because that's what I need to get me through the fear and take action.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, yahoo!  Before you came on the call both Marge and Sarah have some great things to share as well.  So, you guys want to just kind of check in a little bit more in general so you can save kind of more of the bigger stuff hopefully in the next few minutes when Ana and, uhm, Joan will come on.</p>

<p>MARGE: You go first, Sarah.</p>

<p>SARAH: Ok.  I was just saying that John's getting the divorce papers, probably by Thursday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Way to go.  It sounds like you did-- you put all of the work together beautifully.</p>

<p>HELEN: Will he be surprised, Sarah?</p>

<p>SARAH: Well, I sent him an email today that was very terse.  Just that, he would be get-- you know, just to let him know he's getting the papers that, you know, will be coming in the mail.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: So, I don't know and what I guess I've learned is that, for my serenity and sanity, I don't need to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>SARAH: So I was, uhm, advised by several people not to even get into the, "I love you," or "I hope we can work this out in a peaceful away, blah, blah, blah".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah.  This isn't about us anymore... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>SARAH: ... or our relationship.</p>

<p>MARGE: In this divorce papers, Sarah, uhm, is there anything about the financial negotiation or does that come later?</p>

<p>SARAH: Oh, that comes later.</p>

<p>MARGE: So this just basically gets you to-- it gets the papers to the court?</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah.  And there is a separate property claim, but it just says that I'm claiming a separate property but it doesn't say how much I'm claiming.</p>

<p>MARGE: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Well, you have walked through everything so far with as much grace and dignity as I've ever seen.</p>

<p>SARAH: Ohh!  Thanks for saying that 'cause it doesn't feel-- (laughs) I mean, I felt like today I was just thinking like it's been so long to come to that.  It's hopeful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you, have you had more interviews as well?</p>

<p>SARAH: I didn't get the job at the massage school.  And I'm waiting on the EPST job to find out whether they got the grant to hire me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.  And you're open to do the grant even though it would be temporary and less money than you want?  </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah, I'm trying to surrender on all of this 'cause if I start thinking about it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah, but it's a really weird issue for me.  Because I don't feel like I can really trust my own instinct around work).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Not yet.  Okay.</p>

<p>SARAH: ... I think it would be good to be working.  It would be really nice and especially if I can get something that was 30 hours or so, so I could do some massage school classes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>SARAH: That was the idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: I accepted one job 'cause of fear, you know, but I'm ready now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, just keep us posted.  I love the way you keep us posted and you keep us in the loop and it seems that it allows us to really be part of cheering you along as you go along the path.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah.  Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So..., Marge, you wanna repeat a little bit of what we're talking about when just the couple of us were online?</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah.  I, uhm, submitted a saliva sample to Dr. Ber, uhm, and today I got my results and it confirmed a lot of what Josephine and I had suspected might be going on with my body and it also gave me, some good news to... what came out was that I'm insulin resistant and that, uhm, my thyroid is functioning low and by the tone of the woman's voice, I, I kinda get that feeling that it's, it's pretty low.  And that my hormones are out of balance.  Specifically, uhm, I have low estradiol and progesterone and high-- what do you call that-- estradone or something?... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  There are three, three different estrogen sources.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah.  And, uhm, they tested my adrenals and they're strong and they're good.  Everything there is normal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's so great.</p>

<p>MARGE: And it's really-- I, I was just so excited about that.  And then I got on the Internet and I read about, you know, low thyroid and I just happen to bump in to this website that talks about the links between low thyroid, hormonal imbalance and  insulin resistance and how they all kind of exacerbate each other, and, uhm, kind of a feedback later on peri-menopause which is another thing I had suspected that's going on with me.  But what we're still validating is that it said that pregnancy itself can cause these hormonal imbalances... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... and you know, Jeffrey and Connor are only 20 months apart.  And I was breastfeeding for many, many of those months ... and afterwards.  And I just had kind of had tears because I felt like it changed my body, you know.  You've worked so hard and you've really, you've really been trying your best.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>MARGE: And Dr Ber's office also said because of the insulin resistance I had to eliminate sugar completely... and I'm so glad I had a place that I could take that to-- and she also said that they have some homeopathic drops that help lose the craving for sugar and carbohydrates and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>MARGE: And, uhm, she said, "You can take them whenever you have a craving," or, you know, "You can take them all day long if you want" and I thought to myself, you know, I, I don't really crave anything anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>MARGE: And so I said to her, "You know what?  I've pretty much cut out everything that's not healthy for me and, you know, I didn't feel the need to explain because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah, why I do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: I realized-- you know what?  I don't remember the last time I really had a craving that felt like the addiction ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's so nice.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... pretty amazing when you think about it... </p>

<p>MARGE: Uhm...  So it just felt, you know, it just felt really exciting 'cause I feel like--a grown up.  I feel like I've accepted that my body is a certain way and I'm not gonna let it suffer anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. What a compassionate way to look at it.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah, and also, a new gym opened up in town.  It's a women's-only gym and I started to hit some yoga and Tai Chi classes again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>MARGE: And you know it's just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>MARGE: ... lots of tears.  Lots and lots of tears both, you know, after class and, uhm, on-- and during down time and it almost feels like there's a deep psychic balancing going on, too.  And they have a really nice weight system and some machines that I can actually do-when the weather's bad, I can actually walk. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>MARGE: And they have childcare.  And the other thing is it's starting to warming up enough to where if it's not wet out, I can walk the kids to school again ... I'm just beginning to feel pretty liberated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmmm.</p>

<p>MARGE: Uhm, so I just-- I, I don't know what to say.  It's gonna be really interesting to see what happens once I start taking the drops.  Uhm... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The homeopathic stuff is usually fairly subtle but pretty powerful...</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm so glad you got tested-- everything that we would have guessed showed up as needing help- I love the way you responded to the fact that there were some imbalances. </p>

<p>MARGE: I'm just getting that like, uhm, I need it!  You know, that confirmation be-- I have my thyroid specifically tested by my doctor.  My GP ... through the blood... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... three years-- and every year it comes back to this-- what's in the normal rate.</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah.  Hey Marge... (crosstalk) Excuse me.  I had mine done and I always test normal and I have Hashimoto's, which is an autoimmune disease. </p>

<p>HELEN: So it was just normal.  Maybe you have Hashimoto's.  Have you heard of Hashimoto?</p>

<p>JOAN: Hmm, Helen, my thyroid always tests normal in the blood also.  </p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, well.  I-- what happened is that I had it tested for like four years and it always tested normal range but I knew I had low thyroid.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: And so then I went to an endocrinologist and he said, well yeah, you did test normal but you have Hashimoto's disease which even though it's present, it's not doing the job.  So... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>MARGE: So, I mean, this is the same doctor who looked at me when I told him and I said, "You know, I, I'm kind of suspicious that I might be perimenopausal."  And he said, "You're too young."</p>

<p>JOAN: (laughs) (crosstalk) How insensitive is this specialist!</p>

<p>MARGE: You know, that what I'm learning is that insulin resistance affects my thyroid-- my thyroid affects my insulin resistance imbalance and being pregnant and nursing... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... You know, my age, the fact that I was pregnant later in life.  You know, all these things are sort of converging and-- I am peri-menopausal.   But, you know, by treating all of it, I can get back to be, you know... being vibrant again and, you know-- anyway, it's just to me, it just feels like a, a miracle.  I feel so relieved.</p>

<p>HELEN: Marge, I have a question.  What happens, uhm, between, ah, now and six weeks ago when you stopped ha-- having cravings and stopped eating the things that were, that you were uncomfortable eating?  What happened?  What would... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>MARGE: Well, it could have-- it could have been, uhm, it could have been longer than six weeks ago.  When did we start doing individual session again, Josephine?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmmm.</p>

<p>MARGE: That day I got back from England.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: So January... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: January.  Yeah, four, five weeks?  Has it been longer than that? Maybe. I don't know</p>

<p>MARGE: I don't know.  But something happened where I just kind of got sick and tired of being sick and tired.  And I think the other thing that happened was that when I had diabetes with both pregnancies, I feel like I kind of-- I had to grieve that.  You know, just being bodily and mentally different than others).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>MARGE: I think maybe God just tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Okay, girl.  It's time.  You know?  I want the whole enchilada for you."  And, oh, there's one more thing, too.  I had not actually meant to talk about it, but I had some disturbing dreams the night before and I started sharing with Josephine about, uhm, something that had happened to me when I was in the recovery home.   Now, she does know that I went to New Beginnings for about 13 months...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... well the long and short of it is that the director and I got into a dysfunctional situation almost immediately after I got there.  Uhm, I had some therapeutic needs that she didn't have enough training to address appropriately and she also began to scapegoat me in a way that was very insensitive.  And what happened was that I wouldn't leave the recovery home because everybody that I saw that left broke their abstinence, and I knew that I couldn't leave until I knew that I could abstain, uhm, you know, in the world, on my own-- I have to give up, and just be there until it's time to be somewhere else, even if that meant I couldn't decide when that was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>MARGE: And that was my surrender.  She really didn't get me and she was pretty cool in some ways but I was at the juncture where I really needed this exposure-- learning how to expose the addiction myself and how to talk about my addiction using a particular kind of language.  I feel like I kinda retreated into myself a little bit-- because I couldn't survive her scrutiny, you know.  She was very biased and she wasn't very helpful to me.  So, right at the juncture when I needed to learn a particular kind of self care, I think I stumbled.  And I think that's why it enabled me to even spend so many years questioning the way I was doing abstinence (slightly sobs.)  And also permitted me from getting the nutritional help I needed when that began to show up as an issue for me five or six years ago.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: Uhm, and what I've talked to Josephine about was that, you know, we started working together probably about a couple of months before I got pregnant with Jeffrey so, it was almost six years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>MARGE: And I told her that I think it really has taken this long-- for me to relate to the group and to Josephine in a way where I didn't have to hide or keep secrets or I didn't want too, anymore or even developed in the willingness to where I really wanted to go for it.  You know, I really wanted it-- I really wanted to live free of the disease because I just never trust it.  You know, the one time that I almost died and ended up in the recovery home,  I was always grateful to God forgetting me there?... (crosstalk</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... That I was-- I felt so victimized by the director and I watched her manipulate the entire staff so that I never felt like I could really trust the human people, that much.  Uhm, but what was really interesting is that that Josephine was writing for the Sober magazine back then. And I used to grab that thing.  Soon as they delivered it and I would turn right to her column and there was things in there, you know, and then Josephine's book came out I bought it.  But the addiction kind of stayed in the background there.  I just-- maybe I just didn't feel safe enough to really say goodbye to the disease completely.  I hope I do  now... (crosstalk).</p>

<p>JOAN: I thought you where there when Josephine was the director there, Marge?</p>

<p>MARGE: No.  I got there about-- what six month after Josephine left... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  I had been gone about six months ... </p>

<p>JOAN: Alright.  Hmm. </p>

<p>MARGE: And, uhm, I don't know if this all makes sense or anything, but this is what Josephine and I were talking about, about six weeks ago when it really deepened for me... it really dropped into my heart, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: I feel like I kind of stepped out of the shadow a little bit more- and I felt like I was a newcomer again.  You know? (sobs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MARGE: I feel like, uhm, (clears throat) I can sense the presence of God in my life.  And I feel like I don't know if I could take any part of this disease anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So great.  Yes.  Well... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>MARGE: It's just has no appeal to me anymore at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What a gift.  What a gift.</p>

<p>JOAN: What a journey, huh? </p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah.  I don't really blame myself.  I guess I did for a real long time, but you know, for God sakes, I was 21. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>MARGE: ... You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  I think you did marvelous under those circumstances... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>MARGE: (sighs) Me, too.  Considering I found out about the recovery home while I was in Boston. (chuckles)</p>

<p>JOAN: Wow.  I mean what were most of us doing at 21... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Exactly.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... I myself has been bingeing at that point-- and had no idea that it was an addiction, no idea that there was such a thing as recovery.  Certainly Boston didn't have any recovery centers that I know knew about.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: I knew about Weight Watcher that was it.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did an incredible job there under those circumstances there and for being 21.</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.  Thank you for sharing this..., it was really great. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: Thanks for listening.</p>

<p>JOAN: Who, who did the-- I came in a bit late, but who did the homeopathy for you?  Who did you see for that?</p>

<p>MARGE: Uhm, I sent my saliva in to Dr. Ber.</p>

<p>JOAN: Oh, to Dr. Ber  Okay.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: Great.  Have you talked to Patricia?</p>

<p>MARGE: Yes.  She's awesome.</p>

<p>JOAN: And she's funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  So how, how are you doing, Joan? Your, your e-mails have been so touching.  I think they touched all of us.  And some really... </p>

<p>JOAN: Oh, thank you.  I'm having such a hard time.  And the thing that I'm really, I guess what I'm excited about, you know, I could just burst in the tears right now, is that I've have some-- I've had a glimpse of what this freedom could be.  I mean, I don't think I've ever had it before.  And we got slammed again with another awful call about Deacon today-in terms of what he was doing out there.  To me, it's not relapse or-- but he's very dry-- he's a very dry drunken (clears throat) which is so hard to listen to 'cause it's tough that we had to listen to about him since eighth grade, really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... And I just, I just collapsed.  I mean, I didn't-- what is interesting is I'm having my lunch and I knew that this call was coming and so I'm-- I know I was kind of agitated about it.  And I almost started to do some add-ons to lunch and then I just started talking to myself.  I just started being like a mom to myself and stopped... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, good.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... and saying to my inner kids, "You know, Honey, I'm really listening to you.  I know that you're upset.  I'm here for you.  I'm not gonna turn to eating or food it is not what we need right now ...  just tell me how you're feeling."  I mean, I just really tried to bring all that mother energy to myself and it really helped.  That really... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very nice.</p>

<p>JOAN: I just put it all down and ate my moderate lunch-- But tonight I just haven't had any dinner yet.  I mean, I just have no appetite.  We have this call and I just-- I was supposed to go to this spiritual book group before this call and I just said, "Abner, you go on....I'm just gonna sit here and knit and, you know, just kind of take care of myself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good for you.</p>

<p>JOAN: So, I did.  I don't know.  I-- you know, it's just, it's just such a bumpy ride with him and I mean, I've adjusted to him being just so sad and just missing him so much and then so enraged with him I never wanted to talk to him again ... having adolescent sons is really tough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... Uhm, you know, just trying to let go and know that this treatment program is doing what they need to do and Deacon would do it in whatever way Deacon does it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: Just surrender that I have no control at all over this.  So, I guess, it's still like such a roller coaster.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes it is.</p>

<p>JOAN: Everybody sent me such wonderful e-mails.  Thank you so much.  They've really been helpful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The information about Deacon is really a fairly new piece to the saga.</p>
 
<p>JOAN: Yeah.  That was this afternoon.  So I was writing-- is, is Ana on the call?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ahh, I hadn't heard her come on.  She hadn't said anything.</p>

<p>JOAN: Oh. She sent a great email and when I wrote her back today, and I said, "This doesn't helps my grieving."  After the call I got out of the sadness.  I get more into mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: Who spoke to you from the treatment center?  Was it Deacon or was it... </p>

<p>JOAN: No.  It was just Jefferson who was his case manager who's the staff personnel who lives in the sober house that he lives in.   And he said that when Deacon first got there, he tried to normalize it a lot except that, you know, but Deacon has already done so many programs...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: A lot of the kids go there after a month or six weeks of wilderness.  And Deacon had that.  Plus entire year at a certified boarding school that works on this issue.  So, it's just so infuriating 'cause we spent so much time and money on this.   And, you know, our energy and our love and-- I mean, so many sacrifices.  And he had this DUI here which is such a huge deal and he showed up there, very contrite and sort of surrendered for about three weeks.  And Deacon is a very powerful kid socially.  He's very smart in a scary way because he's so verbal and able to twist things around and his logic is just unbelievable...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: He could be a wonderful attorney ... you can never win in an argument with Deacon... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: He's like so intelligent which is so maddening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: And, uhm, (clears throat) what he does is he really maneuvers socially to figure out what his place is.  And he becomes pretty dominant and a leader but in a negative way.  So now, we're hearing the same old story, after about three or four weeks.  And he started getting disruptive and he starts putting down the program and he starts, being disrespectful to people and he starts-- like he got kicked out of the group yesterday because he had many warnings and he was very disruptive and whenever people would start talking, he would start making jokes.  And I asked are the peers confronting him?  And she said, well not really that's part of the problem.  So I was just so demoralized 'cause we've been here enough now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>JOAN: I mean, I can't even tell you the number of these kinds of calls I've got since Deacon was in about sixth grade.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: And everything we've tried.  Nothing has broken through that and (sighs) so they're gonna clamp down apparently on the whole program.  They feel like they haven't been holding kids accountable enough.  So I think that would be very good.  But at some time, you know, if Deacon's gotta decide if it's going to work for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... Recently we said, you know, "This is for-- recovery's first in this program.  If you don't take it seriously, Deacon, this is the end.  You have until July-you're enrolled until July and if by July you're still like this, then you stay out there.  You'll come home for court but that's it."  And I'm, I'm happy that I feel that way so very strongly 'cause I can feel like we gave him all the opportunities... we went much further than most parents ever have to go with their adolescents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>JOAN: And, uhm, but you know, he's just kinda like--he's getting his old arrogance entitlement ways again.  And like, where the hell is his bottom?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: So we wrote him a very strong letter saying, "Don't call us.  We don't wanna talk to you.  We don't want any e-mails from you."  We're having this big meeting on Tuesday night with the staff-- it's the servicing they do after a certain period of time.  And he talks about his goals and I guess it was a very intense meeting because, you know, they hold them accountable, they really call them out and all that sorts of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: So I'm looking forward to that because I need to hear his commitment level, I really want someone to support us in this position which is we're not talking to him about anything except his truth.  That's it.  I'm not interested in his lies and his games, you know, the dry drunken stuff that he does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right on.</p>

<p>JOAN: Uhm, so this case manager which is very, very negative about him and I can understand why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: He has pretty much been willing to go to A.A. but he hates it-- he talks about how he hates it all the time.  We have other ways in which he is going to recover here 'cause a lot of kids of his age do hate it.  And he was very nice about saying, you know, this is often where they end up.  They come in, gung-ho, and then once they figure out the commitment involved, they lose interest.  But they're really committed to being here and then after about a month, they get in to, "I don't want to be here.  This is stupid."  Uhm, then we see if they're willing to do their work of recovery-- 'cause at this age, nobody can do it except him.  You know, we can't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>JOAN: So, it's just the same old pattern of behavior that is so-- it's just devastates me.  I'd feel collapsed when I hear this stuff.  It cause it terrifies me like, "Where the hell are they gonna go in this life if they keep doing this?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: He has so many incredible strengths.  He has such a fabulous potential and now he's-- but he's just very dismissive in group.  And Deacon got really mad and said, "You know, I'm really pissed at the prosecutor back home because, you know, there's no reason why I have to go to jail for this, you know.  If someone does rehab, that should be enough."  And he went on and on about how she's the problem.  And then the case manager and the therapist both went a little bit nuts about him simply blaming everybody else and not taking accountability for his actions-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... it's a miracle that somebody didn't get hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: And to be that cavalier about it, to see how much he's out of that surrendered place that he was in.  Look-- I mean, we wouldn't have send him if he had been like this.  We wouldn't have paid for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  So when you say that you don't want to talk to him, you mean that he can't call you in between the...</p>

<p>JOAN: He cannot call us or e-mail us until this meeting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>JOAN: I'm not interested in hearing what movie he's going to --  or he called us and tell us of all his lies, how well he's doing, oh yes, he's doing his work, ahh, or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: Ah, or yeah he's doing his meetings, but you know how stupid they are, like AA doesn't work for me.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: And then he lied about something-- he is asking some kids to send him money and I said, "Deacon, I thought, you're on a very strict budget there.  Your budget is part of the program, you know, you really, learning the life skills of managing your money... , "Oh, no we didn't get money.  People don't send us money.  I said, "I don't think so, Deacon." He said, "Oh yeah, yeah, no problem!" I said, "Well, your brother's not sending you money.  He doesn't have any money.  Number one.  And number two, I've told them not to send any money."  "Well, I know, but I just thought if he wanted to he could."  So we talked to the case manager and she said, "Of course not.  They can't-- we open all their mail.  We open all their packages.  If money comes, we take it.  They're not allowed money."  He knows that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: So that's just another one of lies that Deacon tells us and we just had a whole go around about his lies a couple of weeks ago.  And I think the worst and the most alarming things to me is how he's talking, you know, about his drug history in this kind of dramatic way.  This is completely against all the rules of all these programs...   And the fact that he's relapsed back to that is just extraordinary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, just remember, Joan, this is their expertise. They've been in business...</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah, of course.  But the counselor was very discouraging.  I got to tell you.  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But again, it's okay for her to be truthful with you and discouraging ... </p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... but they deal with this all the time.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is pretty common for them.  Adolescents are the toughest group.  You know that.  I know that.  And, uhm, you know, we could pray that they'd have a bottom when they're young, but you know, it's pretty much unusual, you know?  28 to 38 is more average and that... (laughs) </p>

<p>JOAN: You know, it's hard for me now Josephine ... </p>

<p>HELEN: Is that true Josephine?  Is it 28 to 30 years old that most people are more ready, you said?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: Except I see kids and this program's getting it.  And that's what's so hard.  That's like it's excruciating... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... to see the kids that go there and they care about it.  They care about the recovery.  I mean, I've seen a lot of kids in this program transform themselves.  Not my kid, of course.  But it is hard when you're around kids who really are changing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Some of them do.  That's absolutely true.</p>

<p>JOAN: But I guess-- that he's so contrary he has to take this other path.</p>

<p>HELEN: Joan, it took me--I came into A.A. when I was 21 years old.  And I was just an alcoholic-- that I was such a violent drinker and I didn't get sober till I was 29.  But I finally got it ...</p>

<p>JOAN: I know it...</p>

<p>HELEN: ...eventually because it was a decision of the "yes".  I felt I have lost everything.  Somebody-- an old timer told me that, "It's just a decision of yes."  And I started losing it and so he'll be ready when he's ready.  But I also told you in the e-mail about this  I delightful girl I sponsor.</p></p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.  I know.</p>

<p>HELEN: She's now eight years sober.  She's 25 years old, working on her Masters in Counseling now, holding on a job.  But they basically threw away the lock and key when she was drinking and using.  She was in a mental institution for two years.  She was totally rebellious.  Two solid years.</p>

<p>JOAN: Well, (deep breath)... </p>

<p>HELEN: I mean, she had mental issues and drug and alcohol addiction, too.</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: And, and they thought she was hopeless.  Her parents basically abandoned her.  You know.  </p>

<p>JOAN: No, I don't think that Deacon is hopeless, but I just felt very tired... I felt very worn down. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: You know we're all hopeless.  We're just not helpless.  The  AA book, the book said it-- we suffer from a hopeless state of mind and body.  But when we take the steps, we, we're no longer helpless.<</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>SARAH: So is it part of their job to confront him on this thing?</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: Well, they're finally threw him out of the group 'cause they've confronted him many times and he just kept, kept at it</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: And he's not taking it seriously and all-- with all that we spent and done... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: And so this meeting... this information is very important 'cause we're all in the planning stages for phase two.</p>

<p>SARAH: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: And Deacon is not a kid who hasn't been given a lot of opportunities to recover...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... and so we've been very clear with him, that if he doesn't take this seriously, that's fine.  That's his choice.  But we certainly will not fund any more phase two of the program and they won't put him in phase two like this, anyway.  So they really want the parents to know what's going on because we're on the planning stages.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: He's been there three months now.  And the first phase is six months, and, uhm, so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if they don't put them in phase two and he keeps being disruptive, what do they do with him?</p>

<p>JOAN: Well, if they don't put him in phase two, we're all done.  phase two is when you go live in an apartment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>JOAN: Sober apartment with other sober kids...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... and they have a job and you go to community college... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay</p>

<p>JOAN: ... and you still get a lot of support, uhm, but you, you're pretty much paying, you know.  You have to pay a lot of your own way.  But you have to begin at a certain level... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: I mean, he has all this work that he's supposed to be doing... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: This is called a core program.  They have a lot of steps that you have to go through.  And you know, he's not doing, he's pretty much sitting around and watching television, snoozing, going to the library and talking to his friends online and Facebooking.  I mean, he's not doing anything.  And, so whether she said that some times it takes longer than six months for kids to go to phase two (laughs) and Jesse) and I looked at each other and said, "Not for us."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: This is Deacon's fourth program... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right</p>

<p>JOAN: ... of an exorbitant amount of money.  So, if he blows off these six months, then, you know, we won't-- we're certainly-- I mean, a friend of mine's daughter just went to a, a Wilderness Program in-- for-- in Utah for kids, college-aged kids.  And she was refusing to go to an after-care program like the one Deacon's in and so, her mother said, "She's not coming home."  And the Counselor said, "Oh, don't worry.  What we do here is we give them a bus tickets to Salt Lake City and tell them where the homeless shelter is..." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. </p>

<p>JOAN: ... and I thought that was great...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. </p>

<p>JOAN: And I mean, that's basically what we say to Deacon, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: You're-Fine. It's your life.  You're the author of your life.  But you're not going home.  We're certainly not giving you a plane ticket.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>JOAN: Ahh, and you'll stay out there and figure it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, so far, you know, he hasn't had to be accountable for his life.  So this may still be a bravado, you know... </p>

<p>JOAN: Maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He'll get it.  Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: I mean, he's lost a lot.  You know, he's lost his graduation, he's lost his life at home, and he's really sad about that.  He's lost being able to be with his friends... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... but it's not enough to make any difference for him apparently.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So far it's not... yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN:  No. And so I guess I know that people get sober in their own time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>JOAN: ... and I know that there'll a lot of stories about people who do and people and who don't.  I'm just trying to deal with how these all feels right now. </p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah.  It's sure sounds like hell and it's confusing.</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.  I'm trying not to let it-- I'm trying not to, uhm, I'm just trying to figure out what do I need and I don't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... I felt so good when I'm really have such a strong recovery.  It's like feeling like I'm relating to what you're saying, Marge, once you said, "I, I don't really want to give this up."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: I'm really-- no matter what happens, I don't wanna take extra bite for uhm... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... so I guess it feels, you know, like lots of things come up to be healed still.  And .</p>

<p>HELEN: Are you going to Al-Anon, Joan?</p>

<p>JOAN: I don't like our Al-Anon meetings here and I've been to a bunch of them, I just don't like some... </p>

<p>HELEN: Ahh, yeah, I hear you.  I hate to say it, but, you know what?  Al-Anon is-- this sounds very judgmental, uhm, but it's full of fat-complaining women who are stuck.  </p>

<p>JOAN: That's basically what I've seen and I just...</p>

<p>HELEN: They are all compulsive overeaters... unarrested...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just go to get the theme... the principles.</p>

<p>HELEN: ...perhaps.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go to just to throw in a little balance, your wisdom...</p>
 
<p>JOAN:  There are good ones here in California even Michelle says... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But you certainly can find bad ones.  That's the truth.</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But uhm, but you certainly can find great ones too... </p>

<p>MARGE: That's what I been through here-- I'm sorry Josephine to interrupt you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I was gonna say there are some meetings that are just phenomenal.  So uhm, but you've checked them out you know and...</p>

<p>JOAN: I have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: Are there any double winners meetings in your area?</p>

<p>JOAN: No. I've never been to a meeting yet were anybody talked about any steps.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, my gosh. </p>

<p>JOAN:  ...just most of them complain about their lives.</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah, I gotta tell you, Josephine I've been to some of those meetings myself and I stop going to them and ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>HELEN: ... the way I get good recovery is in the double winners meetings...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>HELEN: ... and uhm, you know what, you might want to try to find one or start one.  All you have to have is a big book of a resentment to start with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>JOAN: (laughs) No problem there.</p>

<p>HELEN: That's all it takes. (laughs)</p>

<p>JOAN: I'm going to the big book step study meetings here--they helped me so much.  I can't say enough about how much those meetings helped and I'm doing the fourth steps and ...  So, I do feel like I get support there.  And of course, I get support in my spiritual community.  I think it's just wadding through it. ></p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is.  It is.</p>

<p>SARAH: One thing that came to mind that I heard at this Al-Anon meeting that I actually really liked is... something they were having trouble letting go and letting God with regards to like being worried about their uhm, son.  And some people offered to worry for them so they could like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>HELEN: Offered to worry for them?</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah, so that they wouldn't have to worry. (laughs)</p>

<p>MARGE: I'll worry about him for you, Joan. </p>

<p>JOAN: Thank you (laughs).  He'll give you plenty to worry about. (sigh) Oh, God. Well, that's-- so that's it.  But I, you know ... I just wanna be okay and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to encourage you to hang on to what you've worked so hard for which is your own abstinence and recovery...</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and that you worked really hard specially in the last six months, nine months-- whatever it's been to really face this impulsiveness that the addiction grew roots in your early, you know, your first year of abstinence... </p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... so that's it and you're really pulling those roots out and you're really finding that freedom ... you know, I had a client here the other day and she's in a group and she said to the group, you know, she's been sober awhile but not as long abstinent and she said you know, "if there is an atomic bomb tomorrow, I wouldn't drink.  I have no interest in drinking and I'm finally starting to get that that I could feel the same way about the overeating, impulsive eating or eating in between meals." 
JOAN: Yeah, I relate to that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ...coz, I think that I am, and I keep hearing everybody like Sarah and Helen about uhm, all that, you know, you've had all these hard things happening and yet you held on to your abstinence and that's kept you sane and I heard you say it, Marge.  It just really helps, it really helps me.</p>

<p>HELEN: Yeah, you know I gotta tell you Joan that for years-- Josephine promised me that I wouldn't yearn for my disease.</p>

<p>JOAN: Uh huh.</p>

<p>HELEN: I mean 10, 15 years ago when I met her and I thought yeah, not me, the only thing I can ever hope for is white knuckle abstinence in a thin body.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: You know it's pretty serious.  I don't yearn for my disease.  It's not the knee-jerk reaction, anymore... That connection has been severed just like it's been severed with alcoholism... </p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: ... and I never ever thought that would happen and Josephine kept promising me and I said, nah you know, I've said to myself what a wonderful idea.  I know it won't happen to me.</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah, well, thank you for that.  I mean, I've seen it with you.  I've actually seen it.  And you said it bunch of times in emails and on the phone that whatever may have happen you still have your abstinence and... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... you know, it's kept you so sane.  So I really-- I do, I yearn for that and I feel, I can see it.  I feel like I'm getting there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like you are too.</p>

<p>HELEN: And Josephine used to tell me and-- and I'll remind you she used to say, it--, the, the Helen who goes to meetings and calls me and works her step is not the one who wants to eat.  It's the disease ...</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: It's the addiction chatter telling me to eat.</p>

<p>JOAN: The disease, right, right.</p>

<p>HELEN: So you actually have no desire-- you have no yearning for your disease.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: Josephine says, you know this is her basic message...  "I have a disease, I'm not the disease."</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>HELEN: So you don't yearn for your disease, Joan?</p>

<p>JOAN: ... No, I know it's the addiction that tells me that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... you know I'm not losing weight and I think you know, uhm...almost 60 years old and metabolism changes.  </p>

<p>SARAH: You know what?  It's interesting, I really like what Michelle said this week about uhm...</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.  Wasn't that great?  That really helped me.</p></p>

<p>SARAH: You know, if I stay the same size, whatever, I just want my head to be peaceful and serene.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SARAH: ... what I realized is all these years of being in the addiction-- I've exercised or have done this or that, you know, to control my weight.  But it was always a temporary thing... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>SARAH: Now in recovery I can address my whole person, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: ... So I also wanted to say really quick now is that you and Abner are good parents.</p>

<p>JOAN: Thank you.</p>

<p>SARAH: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>SARAH: Really, really good parents and uhm... I think that-- you need to let that into your heart a little bit too, you know. </p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>SARAH: You know we all come into this life time with, you know, lots of different lessons.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>SARAH: ...you know, everybody reacts to different situations from so many different perspectives and...</p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>HELEN: We know...</p>

<p>JOAN: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, I, I know that when people would say to me when I was going through steps you're going through, Joan.  People would say to me you know, you've been a really good parent.  I would hear in my head what about this, what about that, remember when you did that wrong, and so I had to tell myself the truth which is I've done a lot right and I've done a lot wrong.  And one key to consider is what's wrong or wasn't the best thing for one kid, it might have been okay for the other kid.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you know there  just no discussion.  Done a lot right, done a lot wrong, period.  That every parent that's gonna be true, every parent.</p>

<p>JOAN: It's really true.  You know I get that and you know, I think what you said to me about the effort versus the result was really helpful... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... you said something about...  I got an A for effort and maybe an F for result... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... and that's really helpful because I think that's part of my grief... I really did try really hard to be a good parent... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... I mean, really it was a huge part of my commitment, my intention and my identity.</p></p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: And... the results aren't so great.  Okay, well, that doesn't mean I didn't do a lot of good things.  I'm sure I did...
 
COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>SARAH: There is a study that says-- this thing that children respond to is they see that the parent is continually trying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>JOAN: Right.  So what I've learned on this journey is I think I had a really nice family growing up and I think Abner and I are pretty good parents but I've also learned the importance of Neurobiology, I mean if you have learning disabilities and ADD and addictions and all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.  And I think that God gave you know, two boys with addictions and Neurology that seems to be out of balance...  and he gave them the best parents ever.</p>

<p>JOAN: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: (deep breath) All right, so anyway, I thank you all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: But I think am doing okay with my recovery.  And, I mean its, its like first on my list of priorities.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.  'Cause that's how it should be. Do not let him take that from you.</p>

<p>JOAN: No, I get that... I mean, the last thing I'm gonna do is let Deacon take that from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.  Good.</p>

<p>JOAN: I mean I do find myself standing at the cupboard-- looking in the cupboard, and thinking what am I doing here... I don't want to act like the addiction is an answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>JOAN: There are no answers in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Correct.</p>

<p>JOAN: And so I would sit down and knit, and read a journal and prayed a little bit and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>SARAH: Right.  It's like we're trying to rearrange the furniture to cure cancer some times. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: When's our next break, Josephine?  Are we meeting next week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.  We're meeting next week.  I think the break is a week after.</p>

<p>JOAN: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When is the call coming from Deacon's school?</p>

<p>JOAN: ... Ah, it's Tuesday-- (chuckles) that's interesting.  It's Tuesday night before our group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>JOAN: So I should be in there for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, good.  Oh, I'm glad we'll get you after the call..., hopefully... you'll be, you know, really protective of yourself... </p>

<p>JOAN: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... I don't know how long the calls go... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOAN: ... but we'll see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, and then Sarah keep us posted about anything with the delivery of the divorce papers so I'll have you in my thoughts...</p>

<p>SARAH: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, well, big hug to everybody...</p>

<p>HELEN: Thank you.</p>

<p>JOAN: Thanks.  Good night everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good night.</p>

<p>SARAH: Thanks everybody.</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, thank you.  Bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye.</p>

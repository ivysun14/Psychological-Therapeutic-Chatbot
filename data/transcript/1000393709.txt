<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (5-minute silence) I've been thinking about several different things and they all, it's almost as if they're just whirling around.  And every time I think, well, I'll fix on this, then something else comes into my mind too.  But it began with, uhm, picking up on my need to control things and, and what had happened Thursday night. And this weekend MSCZ just pointed out to me, that something I knew I did anyway, this pattern I have of, during the week I just have this thing in my mind, I don't want to have any intercourse and then on weekends, it's almost like I'm saying, well, now I have time.  And I, I can't really not, I can't really get out of it, I have no excuse.  But I'm the one who's made up my mind that we can have intercourse of weekends but we can't during the week.  And I don't quite understand why I have this attitude toward the time this way, whether it is just simply that it's an ex—, it's, I don't have the excuse on a weekend, whereas I do on a week.  And then I was thinking about the connection I make between, well, for example, MSCZ's penis, and urinating and, and the fact that my vagina is right near my anus and I just sort of connect everything, intercourse and elimination and things are dirty and just unclean or unpleasant.  (Pause) And also the way, on top of just working out a sort of a weekly pattern, I've also settled in my mind that there's only a certain way that you have intercourse, that one would have intercourse or, at least, certainly, that MSCZ and I will.  And I am very inflexible that way too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does, the manner you described before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so.  I can't remember how I — (pause) and it's, part of this is, is sort of I, I rarely approach any kind of sexual relationship with MSCZ in a playful mood.  It's almost like there's a goal in this too and so you'd better be very direct in trying to reach the goal and very businesslike and determined.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then last night something happened which really bothered me, uhm, partly because neither of us had thought, well, now we're going to have intercourse tonight and very often one of us will.  Sort of, either MSCZ's made up his mind tonight we're going to have it or I'll have decide that, since I haven't had it for a while, it's only fair to MSCZ that we have it or whatever my rationale.  And last night it just happened.  It was, it was much more spontaneous than it usually is.  And everything was going fine until suddenly it was almost as if I realized I was enjoying it and I just started feeling sick in my stomach.  And it just sort of ruined everything.  And I don't understand why I suddenly began to feel sick in my stomach because, up until that point, there was, I was, I was really feeling sort of involved and happy and it just was spontaneous before that point and then it wasn't afterwards. (Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: What comes to your mind when you wonder why that happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the first thing that just did was that I suddenly said to myself, look what I'm doing.  As if I were talking to myself, "Look what you're, you're doing, FAJ."  That way.  And then it, and then, following that it came to my mind that the next comment would be, "Do you mean you're actually enjoying this?" (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just began to think of, uhm, well, there's a connection with a question MSCZ asked me sometime during the weekend and also of a question you asked me after I saw "Romeo and Juliet"  and, and had, had a reaction to it and I guess to the scene where they were nude, making love.  And, uhm, well, in any case I was, I can't remember what you asked, but I was asking myself if I had imagined or been fantasizing myself making love with the person playing romeo. And then this weekend at one point MSCZ asked me if I had any sexual fantasies. And my reaction, both times, is no.  And yet I can't really believe that's true. And it, I just started thinking about the fact that so often when I see movies, I'll have a very strong reaction to, uhm, the male leads, without any, I don't, I'm not aware of any clearcut reason that I'm having this reaction, except that they're often very attractive to me.  And it must be because I am doing something like that, having some kind of fantasy about them.  But what I do in my mind is sort of replay different parts of the movie, which somehow keep alive this attraction that I feel and, and, ah, for, for a short time after I've seen the movie.  And I'm never aware of having any other fantasy.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As though what you, what you can do is to, it, well, you already said it, really, to go over the same, what was already there but you're afraid to have spontaneous versions of it z____.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm.  And, and it's sort of fooling myself too, what — I don't know, the attraction obviously must be that I, I'm thinking of myself in a relationship to the person in the movie but by going over the movie, it's almost as if I'm saying just simply, he, in this scene, played it well or something. I'm sort of removing myself from it, justifying my attraction in a way that isn't really true.  And the thing about "Romeo and Juliet", which puzzled me is that while I was seeing the movie I didn't feel any particular attraction toward the boy who played the part of romeo. And yet, since then, if I've seen photographs of the 2 leads, well, the girl would make me think of the boy, I think.  I do sort of think oh, I'd like to see that movie again.  And it must be because I'm finding there was something attractive about the male lead. (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it strikes me that even the language that you use there, the male lead, is a slight way of removing yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's a little distant.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think I said male lead partly because the person who played it was just a boy and I find it hard to admit that I have any fantasies at all and especially if the person I'm having them about is a boy and not a man. Which might be why I didn't even admit he was attractive, during the movie. (Pause) It's interesting too because I was thinking about, well, the kind of actor I find attractive.  And the ones I can think of right now are always, well, they're playing parts that make them seem sort of masterful, either in an aggressive way or in a quiet way.  But still, that they control things, they know their mind and even if they're with a very willful woman, they still have a certain integrity and control.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What is it you find interesting in that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't, at first I thought there was no connection.  Because I was thinking of things like different times I've seen Steve McQueen, he's always been very attractive to me.  And he's usually playing sort of a rough and, well, tough guy, kind of thing.  And then I thought of, of a I guess it was Alan Bates in, uhm, "Far from the Madding Crowd"  he was very attractive to me but he was entirely different role.  And I think this time, when I saw "Gone with the Wind", I found Clark Gable very attractive. Only that was, I think I reacted to that in a much more personal way than to some of these.  (Pause) And I think I found it interesting too because I used to think it was just a matter of looks.  And, well, it has something to do with, I suppose, why I find their appearance is attractive.  But then I thought that I used to not like Clark Gable's looks at all and somebody like Alan Bates as far as I can recall isn't that outstanding one way or the other.   And Steve McQueen is almost ugly, in a way. (Pause)</p>

<p> And Humphrey Bogart just came to my mind, although I haven't seen very many of his films, he sort of has the same thing, whatever it is, that I do find attractive.  And when I think about it, it is always, if I'm reading a book too, it's the character that in the end has control and makes the woman submissive to him if she isn't to start, uhm, that I find an attractive character in literature too. And so I think my fantasies are always sort of my being submissive to these male figures and being dominated by them.  Only I think somehow in the fantasies, they have a very strong interest in me, it's not tyranny.  But I like being submissive in my fantasies to whatever character or movie hero it is.  And then in real life, I can't do it at all. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it makes me think of my father, who was just often, in my mind, a tyrant.  And I never, I so often didn't feel he had any feeling for me or love or anything.  Just simply, he wanted something a certain way and so we were all supposed to be very submissive to this will.  And it just made me want to rebel.  (Pause) And it's the same thing now with MSCZ.  Sometimes if it's sort of a battle of wills over something and he's saying, "But I want it that way," then it just, I get very tight and I just have to say, "But I don't.  And can't you consider what I want too?"  And I, I just have no realization of how much — I might be asking him to consider an awful lot more what I want than he does.  Just simply his saying that makes me have to react against it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you recall any of this kind of idea last night, when you suddenly felt differently during intercourse?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Were you in control in the sense that you were on top, as you have described?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umhmm</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you weren't thinking about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not consciously.  Maybe I was underneath but (pause) well, one thing I was aware of when, now that I'm thinking about it, I realize I was very aware of this although at the time it didn't seem to matter, and that was that because the whole thing was so spontaneous and was so pleasant for MSCZ, since he usually has to sort of fight me half the time, he was, in a way, letting me have my way as long as I continued to be happy in what was happening.  And so he just naturally let me be on top.  He made no effort to have it be any other way.  And so perhaps in a way, although I knew he was — well, in a way he was submitting then.   Maybe that's what bothered me.   But if it was that, it must be more than that too.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But the other thing is, even if, if it is true that I was (analyst coughs) because he was submitting, if he hadn't then I would have fought him and, and so I'm sort of in, again, a corner.  I don't want to be su—, I want to be submissive, I guess in a way, but I can't seem to let myself and I don't want MSCZ to be submissive and yet I can't respond to him when he's not being submissive.  But I think that's something about why, in the end, Thursday night I felt a certain, well, I don't know, it was so mixed up, but in a way I felt good after he just said, "I've had enough and, and you're not going to get away with this, the way you're acting."  Because then he wasn't being submissive to my being just really nasty.  (Pause) And in the morning what I really was, was submissive.  And the only thing that made it hard to be that way was sort of a feeling of I'll lose something if I am or lost pride, or something of that nature. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking too about the fact that, sometimes when I'm really pushing him to be angry at me and even if we're having a kind of fight where I'm wanting to hurt him physically, he's never — I've, I've sometimes sort of been afraid, well, he is stronger than me and he could hurt me.  I've been sort of afraid of it.  But I think I'm much more, I fee—, I feel some kind of a pleasure out of the fact that he is much stronger and I like something to happen so I'm made aware of it, very immediately aware of the fact that he's much stronger and, and even though I might be frustrated at this sometimes, if he can just hold me and I can't even move, there's, I think there's something I like very much about that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you feel, perhaps, that if you lost control, he'd be able to control you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) No, I was thinking more in terms, well, perhaps it is a — well, I was just thinking in terns of, if he wants he can make me submit physically because he is more, he's stronger.  (Pause) I could hardly even think about thinking in terms of, if he, if I lost control he could control me because that immediately made me think of a parent and a child.  And so often I know I do think in those terms with him but I just didn't, imm—, my immediate reaction was I can't think in those terms about MSCZ right now.  Because I think what I've been feeling today is more the kind of submission that I sense I'd like is something that isn't a parent and a child.  It's more natural to a woman because this man is somebody who cares about her so it isn't that what she wants and thinks won't be considered but still the person in charge is the man, not the woman.  But practically, or realistically, I can't, can't seem to act according to this feeling at all. (Silence)</p>

<p>I just suddenly started thinking about, uhm, it was probably the confusion I have between what's masculine and what's feminine.  Or, uhm, I was thinking too in terms of how today it is, anyway, confusing, just the fact that women do so many things men do, just in the kind of jobs they can have.  And it made me think of, for a long time, I think this is when I was in high school, I used to dream that what I would be was a foreign correspondent to a newspaper. And somehow, just writing on a newspaper appealed to me and then the glamour of being in all these foreign places appealed to me.  But when I think about it now, it seems like a very masculine kind of job to have, both being on a newspaper that way and then being away from home the way one would be.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And probably it had to be in foreign countries because when I was in college and I had to, a way that represented to me a certain kind of freedom too, the fact that it really came to terms with what I was going to do, I felt very confused and very tense about it all and, and practically hysterical at times. And then finally I sort of ended up thinking well, I'll be a teacher because I can't think of anything else.  And, and yet I still held going to Europe as some kind of an escape from everything.  So when the chance came up during my senior year at college, I was very happy to give up any plans to study to be a teacher and to just escape this country and everything that meant.  But somehow I think during that year I found out you can't really escape it.  And as a result, Europe has never had the appeal to me since.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean, you found that out in PEC.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, just because I was away for a long time, long enough so — other times I'd just been away in the summer and everything was very romantic in a way.  And there weren't the cares that you would have no matter where you lived during the year and I didn't really have to face up to the fact that I wasn't different in europe than I was any place else.  But when I spent a long time somewhere, especially with things that happened in PEC I think I had to admit to myself that things hadn't changed just because I was out of the United States.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

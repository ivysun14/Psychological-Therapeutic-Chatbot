<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow it's been sort of a fucked up couple of days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well at least I've had a good sense of humor about it at least though. This is not good. But I've (pause) sort of been on this ... this is unlike me that's the reason why I'm so like I notice it so much. That is I do all kinds of things that are somewhat self destructive towards me. Like doing things that are not (pause) (sigh) like staying up really late such that, you know I'm exhausted. Doing things that are not really of any major importance. Sort of (pause) (sigh) this is so funny because I actually coined a term for this. (pause) This is the time of year where a lot people that I know that write fiction have actual novellas coming out from November and I know that I am really, right now really sensitive to like things that are very sad. Normally I like reading things that involve, you know the whole spectrum, that kind of thing. But this ... I knew about that and I actually told a couple of people that, I kid you not I just coined this term, my unread refractory period is too long right now and therefore I'm going to have to put this off for a few months to read this novel. Well I've already done two. One of them got me balling so badly that it you know it's like that whole like (pause) (sigh) it's not just like normal crying it's the I can't tell like what is now snot and what is now tears kind of crying. I can't actually say words.</p>

<p>(00:01:48)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're really balling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really balling. And I knew it. I even told people that I wasn't going to do this specifically because I knew that having read a couple of things that I'd been really overly sensitive about this. I knew that ... I'm not one of the people that usually runs away from that. However (pause) I just knew that it wasn't really productive to be like the bounce back that the unread refractory period. It's like read it and being able like snap back is way too long. I mean even just now I'm thinking of some of the plot lines and they make me feel so freaking fat. And so it's like (pause) I'm pissed off at myself for having like no self control (pause) and I really ... I have such amazing will power for so many things in my life that when I decide I'm just not going to do something, I won't do it. (pause)</p>

<p>(00:02:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) it's ... I'm (pause) between just that and other various things that I've been doing that have not been especially in my best interest, I have been sort of (pause) how do I explain this? I've been sort of burning my ... like basically wearing you know the patience thing with my boss right now. And like I did some things that like really ... like I really probably shouldn't have with my boss because it was the easy way out on something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things that bugged her?</p>

<p>(00:03:18)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I put her in a situation she was kind of pissed off about. Because it was just easier than trying to explain the whole truth about what was going on. (emotional). So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Long story. We're in the process of doing a video editing class that we're all supposed to be doing. I know that the class ... I know it but I actually don't have a video camera. I just don't own one. My phone isn't even up to date enough to have one. Although I do a lot of video editing, I don't actually have a video camera to do my own like little bioptic. Plus quite frankly my life is really not (pause) I could probably start bothering people to borrow one but I think that it's just too grim to have to really want to work on. And so I sort of been (pause) well I was actually sick. It really was, I was actually sick but I could've dragged my butt in there to ... because it's not like I need talk to customers or anything like that. I could have been sweaty and had a fever. If I wanted to be there I would have been there. That kind of thing, you know? It just ... do all kinds of things that are unlike me, you know? And (pause) I got really confused because it's like not my usual (pause) method of operation, I guess. Like I stopped biting my nails one day. Like I just decided, "Oh my gosh this is gross." I just stopped it. I can even tell you when it was. It was approximately between February or March of 1996. Like I stopped using opiates. Like it took a good two weeks to really get it out of my system but I like ... I can say that I just stopped ... just stopped it because I knew there was going to be a problem for pain.</p>

<p>(00:05:00)</p>

<p>And I just decided that I was ... I planned the days off and I sweated it out and it was terrible. Really, really terrible. But (pause) I just ... I knew that, you know that it was going to become more of a pain in the neck than it was worth. I just stopped it for the pain. Just like that. You know I have lots of habits that I just stopped (pause) and behaviors. And so it really freaks me out that I feel this way. So ... (pause) and so that's pretty much what's been going on with me. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I thought of the (pause) most disturbing part of this is not feeling in control of yourself to the extent that you used to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't feel like I'm really doing anything harmful per se but ... you know I can sort prided myself on having more willpower than the average person about things. I mean I gave up most of the ... you my twenties for academia, you know? So (pause) instead of going out and having a goodtime so it's not like it's, you know? (pause) And then I hear people say, "Oh you know every once in a while you did this. You get caught up in a project, you stay up too late, that's no big deal." You know that kind of thing? (pause) That's not like me, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:06:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're (pause) paying attention to and giving the reins over to parts of yourself you don't usually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but those are the parts that are not going to be able to keep me going in the civilized world, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I might take some convincing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Up all night, sleep all day kind of bullshit? No, you can't do that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being sad when you're sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sadder than (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knowing that something is going to make me depressed for days, knowing something that you know something particularly knowing that certain topics are to haunt me and therefore and doing it anyways? That's not really ... I mean it's really kept me from my focus. Like I can't focus on stuff, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not going to argue that this is all good or this is like all the way you should be doing things. But ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've seen other people really avoiding these things, it's not like that. Like my husband cannot watch certain things that are super, super sad or anything like that. Like we've never made it all the way through, 'Up'. Like I got teary but we just continue ... you know there was certain movies that we've actually ... I've gone out of my way to edit so that they are only the happy parts of the movie so we can see it. 'I dreamed of Africa' is one of them because I love the animals ... it's a story about storing a thing down in ... like starting a ranch down in Africa post World War II. I love watching the giraffes and the animals and everything like that but unfortunately about every thirty minutes or so somebody dies a horrible death. But it's really great watching the giraffes and the ... yeah.</p>

<p>(00:08:53)</p>

<p>So I've cut out all the really horrible deaths from the snakes and stuff because I like that film, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Plus the snake deaths are kind of ... watching someone die from that kind of stuff is really not cool. I'm not like really into ... I mean there's a couple of things that get me really like sentimental but I know I have friends who like avoid things that are so bad that they just can't ... I mean there's like whole swaths of things you can't do with them because of it's too upsetting. It's not like that, you know? I normally like ... I like watching a sad film from time to time because it's kind of nice. It's ... you don't really enjoy happiness without things being very, very sad sometimes, you know it's the spectrum. But right now I just know that I can't handle it, you know? I even told people I couldn't handle it, you know? It's not even things that are reflecting on part of my life, I mean it's about death and you know losing somebody you care about and things like that. These are not things that are really reflective of my own life. They're just sad.</p>

<p>(00:09:52)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually they are things like, you know (pause) the two that I read recently, one of them had to do with the fact that (pause) basically two people were having a relationship that was kind of ... not really a secret but a sort of an open secret. The other person ended up dead in relation to war. And the other person never really had anything to remember them by and sort of like (pause) the person who was left behind was the irresponsible one and then that person had to start doing jobs like going to office budget meetings and things like that. And basically had to sort of pickup and become the person who was gone in the relationship. Which sounds a lot less sad than it is. Trust me it really was, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what got you about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything. I mean it's told back and forth and every so often there are flashbacks and it's really sad stuff, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:10:57)</p>

<p>And it's basically the concept, you know this person that you know the person that they always thought they'd spend the rest of their life with is no longer there. And they never realized that they never took the time to really to have anything to remember them by. And that's pretty hardcore bad. On top of that that relationship really couldn't even really be told by anybody, you know? It's kind of weird and sad, you know? But maybe some things not really reflective of my life, per se, they're just sad, you know? (pause) I don't have any secret friendships or relationships in my life, you know? I don't even really, truly understand that. But (pause) the point though is that to me at least I feel like it's making it so that I can't really (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know something about loss.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe a lot of it just resonates with that even if it's not exactly the same.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I am (inaudible_00:12:14) I understand.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. Not to just to have it (pause) you also (pause) the way I see it loss figures pretty large in your life these days. And for a while now. And (pause) I think pretty raw for you. I think it's a pretty raw subject.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I believe so. I still don't necessarily know if making myself feel this way as opposed you're just sort of it being part of everything but going out of the way to make myself feel this bad is in anyway productive. I feel like I'm hurting myself on purpose.</p>

<p>(00:13:22)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You've referred to it a few times that it sort of felt destructive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean it makes me very sad. It makes it so I can't communicate properly. It makes is so that my ... you know it makes it (emotional) I know that I can't really function so well afterwards. I feel like it's keeping me from connecting with other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For how long?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Less than a week. (inaudible_00:13:45). (pause) Still ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It consumes your whole week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But it takes up a lot it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (cross talk) I'm just trying to understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a lot of my free time, yeah. (pause) But it's not the time it's reading it per se but it's definitely like ... you know if I've got time to myself and I'm not really otherwise distracted I think about things that are unpleasant like that and it's not really, you know ... (pause) I am used to having a lot more control over my life so this is a lot harder for me than what maybe other people, you know would consider to be like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I understand. I think ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You go to see a sad movie. You kind of feel bad as you're leaving the theater and sometime between then and you're going out with your friends to get dessert to talk about it ... you're talking about it but you're starting to feel better by the time you get home.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depression is often like bad feelings that aren't felt. This is why I'm (pause) not convinced, I wouldn't say I know either way, yet. (pause) That this is destructive more than it is getting in touch with things you've been feeling for a long time but keep pretty much under lock and key most of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't I schedule it though? (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh) I wish you could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I schedule detoxing from morphine, not morphine but like a morphine derivative drug. I scheduled it. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't understand there's a lot of things that I've actually scheduled in my life, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do. I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just who I am. I'm just so much trying to do it. I was born that way, you know? They try to make you utilize like the most time for this or that, you know? My dad brings his iPad into the dentist chair because, you know he may not be able to actually do any work but at least he can read like supreme court like findings and things like that at the same time, you know? And yes I got it from him, it's true. I know that I did. (pause) But it doesn't seem to negatively affect him that much. He's sort of made it work for him. But (pause) I don't like ... I understand the rest of the world is unpredictable but why can't I force myself on a schedule to like figure out that when there's like a long weekend, get this all out of my system and be done with it? (laugh) I know. I know it sounds completely irrational to say that but it's true. (emotional)</p>

<p>(00:16:43)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wish you could, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it would make this a lot more comfortable if you could do that. And certainly more familiar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's also really hard because like I've got a clinically, like life long clinically depressed person in the house who is currently sick but yet I'm ... I think I've mentioned the fact that I think that because he is sick he's feeling his symptoms a lot more than they really are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is not the same thing as faking it but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and like it's kind of hard because it's like I cannot be balling around the house (pause) I can't exactly, you know if he ask me what's wrong, you know, he's going to worry. And if I explain to him that I just read a really sad story. This is a guy who's never 'Old Yeller' or anything, or the 'Notebook' or any of the classically sad films. So he (pause) that's not like, you know it's going to be easy to explain. I told him about this today, you know? I even told him about the fact that I had, you know coined a term for the concept of how long it takes to get over something that's sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know as a graph.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he thought that was greatly amusing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The point though is that (pause) it makes it really hard because it makes the situation that much more complicated, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think you're husband's role in this is very important, actually. I mean (pause) what I think you're saying is (pause) he's completely, as far as you can tell he's completely unable to help you bear this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think he knows how to, you know? It's something that he does not have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you couldn't talk to him about being really sad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can. But it drives him down too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? (pause) Like he gets really down. He shuts down. He withdraws.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) He doesn't really have anything to contribute toward it either other than the fact it's kind of sad, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:18:59)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he actually like sit there and lose it or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, it matters what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. And do you get the sense from him or has he said that he'd rather not hear about it or does he want ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Occasionally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: try to be there for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it's something he doesn't need to know about like if it's a new story, he would rather not hear about it, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if it's very important to you?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perhaps. We actually talked about something slightly sad this week. Back in Cincinnati we were part of the Cincinnati Herpetological Society.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think you mentioned it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And one of the head people there is a zookeeper over at the zoo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And their Komodo dragon passed away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No names because whoever was the head of the zoo at the time said that they don't ... pets have names, animals don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the thing is that this particular ... a lot of things you need to actually call them by name to get them to get their attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well some things do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he called it 'no name'.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not a real name. It's not even anywhere on the books but that's just how they'd get his attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so when he passed away that was something both of us knew the Komodo dragon probably better than like 99 percent of the population that goes to the zoo because we had met it a couple of times like close. Which still sounds very creepy, I know but it really isn't that he was very unaggressive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Komodo dragons are cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're really cool but normally like people don't like (pause) get close to one with a gate open or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know that was kind of sad and so we, you know (pause) more or less we sort of took the situation of it being sad and sort of made it in to something kind of cute and slightly weird. Like saying you know when ... what do you do when that happens? You know don't send flowers. Do you send meat to the reptiles? Like we had this sort of a conversation to make it easier like almost (pause) childlike almost. But you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's easier. And with animals that's a little bit easier. We've made the joke about the concept of that we should go into business making condolence cards for sharks that bite people. Because you know one wants to see the shark after it's sorry. You know all kinds of things like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like (pause) yes this all comes from inside my head. At one point I thought about becoming a children's writer. You know like that kind of stuff and that makes it a little bit easier. When it comes to like more (pause) realistic things it's really a lot harder, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:21:50)</p>

<p>It's not something that you can ... it's harder to do that trick on something that involves people as opposed to like, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah it's easier to make light.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. On like animals and things like that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because you're already like stretching the imagination by discussing things on different levels, you know? (pause) I think at one point we talked about the fact that you know that it wasn't ... not to be sad about the extinction of dinosaurs. I came up with this idea actually that they're all in the witness protection program.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they're all still around we just don't recognize them. That was something from my youth. But we've talked about this before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That'd make a good kids show.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of a kid's book.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So like all kinds of things like that. And you know, so I think that both of us are very good at that but with real life people sadness types of things it's really not something that (pause) he's able to handle. Normally I am. I mean I'm sad, I'm upset but I sort of can go on. (pause) But lately I've just been so obsessing over details and ... you know the only time I can think of, this happened to me once.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can actually tell you that it happened in July of 1999.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I saw a movie that was so amazingly, emotionally stirring that it upset me for like a whole weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What movie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's called the 'The Polo Book' it's by Peter Greenaway. It's basically, at the time it was ... the way that they did the filmmaking, the movie making was pretty new and they had a lot of picture in picture and a lot of different ways of camera techniques and things like that which normally wouldn't be a big deal but the whole thing was actually about death and life and a lot of pretty darn profound things. And sadly enough the most disturbing part about it was the person who died ended up becoming ... first of all they killed themselves out of jealousy that wasn't founded. But then they ... a third person actually filleted them and made them into a book. Which is even creepier and weirder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's creepy.</p>

<p>(00:23:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so like there's much of like ... this particular ... and I'd never seen this particular director at the time but he is really good at like running the emotions. It's a very ... it was not in many theaters. It was ... It's a very (pause) artsy flick. But the concept was is this woman was basically was the star writer and she finally finds herself to be able to write and she basically when this guy kills himself she writes this book, she's living in Hong Kong, you know about her love him on his skin when he's buried. And this person who is also in love with him dug him up and cut the skin off and turned him into a book so that they could have this persons body with this (inaudible_00:24:46). Very disturbing. And (pause) you know like I said lots of things, I mean it had music that was extremely, you know moving. Everything about it was just ... it was the first time I'd ever seen anything like it and so like all weekend long it was pretty ... profoundly affected me. The fact that I can tell you when it happened shows like that it doesn't happen very often ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(00:25:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know at the time I'd seen movies that are not necessarily the exact same storyline but things that are meant to be extremely art house films that use similar techniques do not affect me as much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah this is really quite unusual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And even when I'm doing editing now the way that he did picture in picture, which was brand new at the time for showing similarities of events, is actually affected the way I do my editing. That was so impressive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I embarrassingly bought this movie three times and I don't know where any of them are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never actually watched in on DVD ... I keep buying it because I think that it's going to go out of print and you know and never actually watching it because ... you got to take time it's a lot to process at once. So (pause) but I think the last time that I actually like have (pause) like had something that I just couldn't get out of my head, you know? And I've had friends who have said that they've had that happen with books or movies before and I've read the same book or movie and it hasn't been that much of an affect on me. But, you know I guess everyone has different that they find very moving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I guess I'm really struck by is the similarity to the theme you were talking about where they're both to do with having things or not having things to remember people by. People that you've lost.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess so, yeah. (pause) I don't take death very well in general. (pause) It's actually kind of like one of those things where I've said a lot in my life that they need to find like ways to make animals have closer to human life spans because it's just not easy that kind of thing. (pause) I'm just not very good at that kind of thing, never have been. Because I don't have that much immediate family I haven't been able ... I've been lucky enough not to have as much loss in my life, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And virtually the first loss I had was one of the most profound people in my life, but I was seven so it's not, you know as impactful I guess. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was my grandfather on my mom's side. He was, you know ... well he was a mathematician as well. He was just a ... and the thing that's just weird because when other people describe him it's a very different person but he just you know was always showing us how things worked and that kind of thing. Plus had a very playful side of things. Like when my cousin and I would be over to visit he would make snapdragons talk and you know that kind of stuff. I mean, come on he made it out of Germany when they were killing people. So you know he had to have like a sense of humor about an awful lot of things but yet have a lot of determination. He passed when I was seven and I don't think Sarah who's four years younger than me remembers him very much at all. I do remember him. Though I wonder how much of it I have reconstructed to be the way I want too because of memory, you know? Because that just what you do for things when you're younger. But, you know (pause) but that was, you know pretty hard on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Harder on me than most people really thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) I guess I'm imaging the sort of shared interest in mathematics was a pretty big deal?</p>

<p>(00:29:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At the time I really didn't know it but, you know? He was just ... at the time I really didn't see it at that because he worked mostly in mines. I never really saw the things he did. But I did see that he had a lot of ingenuity in making and creating and finding things. And great love of animals, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People. (pause) But everyone else around me was pretty upset about losing him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I don't think anybody really got a whole lot of thought for what was going on with me, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean (pause) correct me if this is wrong but the sort of friends they've had loss in their life but I'm thinking of are ... I mean sort of like the of events recently but also your health, career stuff ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kids and (pause) some things about your marriage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also lost an aunt due to, you know, drug abuse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember that, you were a little older though then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No that was like, that was like October of this year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I for some reason I didn't realize that ... I didn't remember it was that recent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible_00:30:44) clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it happened like this October.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember you telling about it and telling me about how she saw you as compared to her kids and all that but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No that was just recently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sorry, I ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had the timeframe wrong. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyway she was not really (pause) with us for a longtime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... (pause) I mean it's funny because it's like, you know it wasn't like she had been abusing for a very longtime, but like at that point when you just ... you taxed your organs that badly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:31:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Nothing could be done. (pause) Oh yeah if you have a history of abuse too, if you're in any pain at all they don't treat it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's another reason why I don't ever want to go down that road.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to ever be the kind of person who after coming out of like surgery they don't treat pain. I don't ever want to a person who like she was in a coma and she was in a tremendous amount of pain and they didn't treat it. So ... (pause) But you know I have had a lot of loss? (pause) Which is (sigh) (pause) I spent a longtime wallowing in the loss. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah. Like the early part of the 2000's. If you want to I can go back and look at this. I had this journal that I was supposed to writing about all kinds of stuff but mostly was me talking about how upset I was about my husband acting out and occasionally I would go look at it just (pause) to see what things were like back then. It was pretty bad. It was pretty bad in my head. The thing that was even worse was the fact that I knew that I could leave ... I actually wrote in there that I could leave this out and it never will be read because I know that it wouldn't even dawn on him to look into anything. Not because I'm not negative but he was so like in his own world that he would never even think to himself, "I wonder how she's handling it? Why don't I look at this now?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... (pause) (sigh) The (pause) but yeah I spent a lot of time really being upset about it. I felt like when I was going to the sanon meetings it was making it worst. It kept ripping it raw over and over again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Partially because of the fact that had to take care of all these other people. (pause) But also having to tell the stories over and over again. It never got better, it never got okay, it never got, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like when I was doing it to them? No never got easier. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Found new ways to inflict this pain, you know? I think the reason why is because part of the dogma behind it is that you have some sort of subconscious thing in your life that you were looking for and you were seeking this person, like made, you know to be ... to act out in your life and therefore I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what in the world went wrong in my life that I was looking for somebody who had an addiction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is this kind of probably your fault?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh they go through your own recovery of codependent bullshit. Sorry I really did not believe in it and the problem is the more you say that kind of stuff the more they say, "Oh you're really in denial."</p>

<p>(00:34:31)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, "No swear to you I never had any like ..." maybe I looked at my history, I never had anything like that. I was with the guy for like six, seven years before I even knew; had even an inkling of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you know it wasn't until we'd been married for a while. So I just don't feel like I'm seeking that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's made me angry and it just (pause) you know? Talking about it here and other sort of things isn't better, it's just that I think that the self-help aspect of that is, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just really didn't resolve anything it just made it hurt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so (pause) (sigh) I'm just (pause) (sigh) I don't know. (pause) I guess I could be okay. When I'm doing this stuff it just feels like it's ... I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept the consequences of what I'm feeling right now and what I'm doing right now, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean the consequences I think I understand in terms of like probably practical consequences of losing days of your whole night and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And trying to go to work the next day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes (pause) the consequences of like (pause) you know pissing off my boss because I'm not willing to actually admit that I don't have a video camera and I don't ... not only do not have the money for it but after I'm done I won't need it not at all. And my life is to depressing to videotape, you know? (pause) That's opening up a whole can of worms that I just don't want to deal with. (pause) I'm sure she'll be like, "Here's my phone bring it back tomorrow." (pause) but (pause) it doesn't matter, you know? (pause) The problem is my boss cares too much. One of my seven soon to be nine bosses ... yeah they're having two more managers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She ... I believe ... she's never said directly but based upon what she said I'm pretty sure she lost someone very close to her due to Lupus related complications.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so she does not like it at all when I don't ... first of all she yells at me for not taking care of myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:37:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she also sort of yells at me for not being in touch with myself early enough to call in the day before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she thinks first of all put the business in danger but she's also like, "You can't just not like be ... like if you're sick now then you, you know, why are you doing this to yourself? What are you thinking?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know (pause) it sounds very misconstrued but really is she's saying it also on the level of if you're trying to get all the way to work and you realize you just can't make it that you're actually doing yourself a disservice as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so (pause) but she just gets very (pause) protective. She's one of the ones that doesn't really want me working more than twelve hours a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I haven't exactly told her I can't afford to, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) But you know it's nice to have somebody who ... you know is looking out for me at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Well who clearly cares.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She seems to know a lot without necessarily ... most people are not that in touch with that kind stuff. Like you look like you've been on steroids. You're a little swollen, is everything okay?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know before you go outside are you putting your sunscreen on? That's not normally but if she knows I've been out in the sun, she knows if you've been on steroids you can actually get sunburned in just like literally three or four minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can get really ... because your skin is really, really sensitive (cross talk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. So she's not really overly much but there has to be somebody in her life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She knows enough about organ failure and she knows enough about the autoimmune process that somebody died in her life, fast. Because she did ask me about like bone marrow transplantation that kind of stuff. Which they can do. It doesn't always work and it's not worth the risk for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ...(pause) because basically the concept is you'll make cells be okay afterwards. And it's like a one in thirty chance to go for a bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a one and thirty chance of curing yourself of autoimmune disease.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By a bone marrow transplant and sometimes it doesn't work at all or it works partially?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of it's just like complications and/or doesn't work at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh.</p>

<p>(00:39:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing. Because you're not that sick, it's easier when you're super ... when you have these other types of diseases or you're so sick that when they kill the bone marrow it's actually not that bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if you know much about transplantation, I grew up around it, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When you have a person that donates a kidney to somebody else ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The person who receives the kidney is actually much less sick after the surgery than the person who donates it, the donor. Because they've spent their entire lives being healthy and so that down regulation it take them much longer to actually, like a couple of years to get used to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like that. So ... (pause) If it works at all, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah so I don't know. I just feel like I'm just ... I'm not ready to take the consequences of all this stuff too and could drive my husband away. I could, you know (pause) I don't know. (pause) There's so much that I want to tell him about but at the same time I feel like (pause) sometimes when I talk to him about it I really wish like I could just go back in time and press the undo button and have like a, "Can we just like, you know do this ... can we just erase everything I've said and start again?" Occasionally that will work with him. He's one of the few people I can do that with. But (pause) almost never anything really emotional. It's more along the lines of something that I've said something completely and totally stupid about. But it just (pause) I don't know. It's just that I don't always feel like it's really all that helpful to talk to him about it because either he takes it badly or something I don't know. I mean I don't always tell it the right way, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:41:44)</p>

<p>I haven't exactly been known for my delicacy when describing things that are complicated and emotional. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well any which way it's too bad for you to not be able to like more easily share it with him.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. It's sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I could just see it's much harder to be alone in stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) it is. (sigh) At the same time though I think that sometimes it's ... it depends if I mean there's this whole cost/benefit analysis of things. There are some things that is totally much better just not to, you know (pause) to talk to him about. Because it, you know whatever happens, whatever come out of it is getting much worse than the actual benefit of talking about it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to think that in reality it's better to talk with him about everything. I'm just saying ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I usually do. I mean I hate when I feel like I am not talking to him about things because, one, I don't believe in secrets. But you know I just feel like that's the person I've chosen to spend my life with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I shouldn't feel like I can't tell him as opposed to where I choose not to because it's like irrelevant.</p>

<p>(00:43:12)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I share a lot of things and so ... (pause) And I mean some of it he, you know (pause) I don't know. Some of it he handles better than others.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) I think the problem is we been sort of going over old material I guess. A lot of things that happened many, many, many years ago that (pause) probably shouldn't be, you know really discussed anymore. Probably ... I don't know. I'm just really happy that he actually told me he's like, "I really want to talk to you this right now but I need to go to sleep."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that meant a lot to me because back when we first started dating he felt like he couldn't say that and he would fall asleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so ... that actually was really helpful. It just took twenty years to get there, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now. Booked up on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I will see you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is session No. 17 Client 0518-014, Session No. 17, 0518-014. March 11, 1971.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm working sort of, more or less. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had a paper or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I wouldn't exactly say I was all together but I am certainly working. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just thought that you look really upset or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was upset earlier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As a matter of fact, it seems like if I look at you you're going to cry or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it about your work or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I was crying before, that is why I look like I am about to. I don't really want to talk about it right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you don't feel like you want to do this then we can make another appointment for next week. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no; it's fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm glad you're here.</p>

<p>[1:40]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>[2:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must have affected you a little, made it hard for you to talk? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just, it seems artificial even more, like if you are upset, why should you have to listen to me. It would probably be nicer to like just sit by yourself instead of having somebody come and talk to you about something that isn't very important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't feel that way, really. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm projecting all over you then. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you're feeling that it's crappy because you are imposing on me and I must really want...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was a little heavy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also I just really don't know where I am today. I have to stay a while. I feel like I've been play acting all day or something, I don't know what I've been doing. </p>

<p>[3:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's different than being spaced out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it comes from being spaced out. It's a calming way of dealing with it. Just lots of things seem artificial, just lots of things seem artificial. </p>

<p>[4:07]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>[4:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a talk with - I don't know, the thing with Jobe is just getting complicated. I told you about Jobe?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Have you been being the way you don't like with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I have been being real honest with him but I just - I can't tell how much or I can't tell what's happening. I mean I haven't - I really care about him a whole bunch and I want to be involved with him and I just don't understand why. And I think that is probably because everything is not nice. I mean when things are all nice and lovey and stuff then I say I don't like them. But they are hard and I feel artificial a lot of the time. And he tells me that. He just told me that today and that just always gets me more involved. And it's a really weird existence because Jennifer has moved out of my house and so it's just Diane and Tanya and I. And I never talk to Tanya I don't think I have said more than a paragraph to her in the two months I have been there. I have been there since September and I probably haven't talked to her one full conversation worth; just "Hello;" that's the only thing we ever say. And Diane, I am beginning to talk to her again but I am really leery of trusting her because the same evening we will have a talk, like last night we had a talk, and then an hour later she yelled at me about something. I feel like she is not a real friend. You know, and I think the only reason she is talking to me at all is because she is pretty lonely. And she really doesn't'; have any friends at all. And that just seems a little bit strange; and Holly is gone.</p>

<p>[6:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So no one is there who you can relax with? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I don't feel uptight with any of them anymore. I don't feel that badly. I just don't feel quite; you know. And Holly is gone and Jennifer is really having a hard time; she is like, very upset and she has just withdrawn completely into herself and she is really not admitting or talking to anybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jennifer who moved out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And so I can't, and she really has to cut herself off from everybody and get her head together; that is what she feels that she has to do. It is not personal against me, she is probably cutting me least off, but she is still cutting and it is just like there's no real friend around. And I know so many people, you know, and I just know more people than anybody I know and have more like quick friends. No one I honestly want to be with, except that always brings me back to Marco who in my head I am always just incredibly - I mean I just care about him so much. And I never see him. I just saw him today in the library and we had the beginning of a nice talk. We were talking about therapy. He was talking about LOLA therapy; he talking Franco's course. We started raping about different kinds of therapy and then we starting talking or he started - no I mentioned talking about working or something and he started teasing me and I got this real incredible anger that I could hear in his voice underneath the teasing when he started doing it, all of a sudden it just got incredibly uncomfortable and it started out really nice. </p>

<p>[8:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He wanted to cut you or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it wasn't even that kind of anger it was like bitterness anger. It was more, it was less active and harder to deal with because it turned to bitterness and soured already, you know, and that really upset me. And I just walked over here. I had a nice walk over. I talked to Tye who is real nice. But that really upset me that, like, all these relationships with people are so tenuous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like even Marco who you have been counting on in your head. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've known that I couldn't really count on him and I know that he is very one way and I know that I will always love him but there is absolutely nothing I can do about that, I just always will. And it almost doesn't matter how he feels about me anymore because I am just so - you know. But it's just, you know, it just really starts to amaze me that a number of the people that I really care about, like Marco and Diane both, you know, have this. I've had this super fucked up relationship with them, each to the point that they both, you know, there have been good times but there have also been times that we hated each other. I mean, I've never felt like I hated them but they certainly pretty much despised me and it seems very strange that - it is very disconcerting, you know, that there is basically something icky going on with the people I love and they end up...</p>

<p>[10:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Despising you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, it is more than hating. It's not hating, that doesn't sound right for some reason despise sounds right, because it is very - because it is a real connectedness. I mean, like it is a very intense thing, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and to me despise has connotations of contempt too? Which I guess is true for Melinda. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's true but it is contempt and respect both at the same time. Because I think that in lots of ways he really respects me and in lots of ways he is dangerous. Yeah he is. And the same way Diane is. But there is also respect there too. It's not - it's both of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not pure contempt? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because they see lots of things in me that they both appreciate and feel very alike to, you know, but there are other things that - I don't know. And I don't know what to do with them and I don't know how to resolve the thing with Marco and I feel really powerless. When I figured, okay it will take a year of not being around each other at all and then we will be able to talk again, you know after that whole break up thing that first year, and this is like three years later and we still, you know</p>

<p>[12:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It didn't' happen that way like you thought; it didn't heal over. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I really have this very scared feeling that I've lost him and he is really - I mean comparisons are odious granted but if I was to do it anyway he is the single most, I mean he is, like he is the only person in the world that I can every conceive of marrying. He is the only person that I can say that I would want to spend the rest of my life with and I never said that about John even though I was living with him. And, you know, I loved him and it was a much fuller relationship in lots of ways. Marco was the person I felt most strongly with, even more than Diane. And, but they are certainly the two most important people; John too. You know, I think things are okay with him, but I don't' know, he's across the country so I don't' have to worry about him. That is just like very ugly to me that that is what ends up with all that energy, that is just so. And I don't know what about me made it be like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just this ugliness in you must have - there must have been something in you to have caused it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, something in the combination of us that caused it but I am certainly a big half of the combination. I don't know what it is and I don't know how to get to there. But I can't understand it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't fit because when you look at yourself you don't see that kind of ugliness. </p>

<p>[14:33]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I see lots of ugliness but nothing that would be so completely irredeemable right, something that - I don't' know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet there must be something very foul there because you can tell by its fruits.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much with Diane. I guess with Diane I always think that a lot of her was fucked up but with Marco I really respect him so much and so ultimately I really see him probably as the finest person I know. That I just really have a feeling like - and he, I've also always thought that he knew more about me than I did; that he could see through lots of the shit that I fed myself. And Diane is just as fucked up and she, I don't feel like she is - I mean I don't really emulate her being that much. She excites me or something about her really captivates me but it is not because she is nice and clean and pure and good it is not any part of that. Something just very interesting and crazy about her that I like, but she is like one of the biggest hypocrites I know. So I don't - with Marco I just have a feeling there must be really icky stuff in me that he always sees very plainly and it makes me unapproachable, and makes him not wanting to be involved with me. </p>

<p>[16:53]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is why he backs off from you and why he feels bitter towards you. That is the perception of the... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and some of it is that I also really hurt him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he also thinks that I am very cruel. </p>

<p>It was really a weird week too. This guy Ross Vineman. Remember when I told you about Ross Vineman(17:26)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He was that one from that whole week that I felt so exhausted; when he asked me to sleep with him. He literally went berzerk and I have never seen that happen to anybody or not anybody that I have been somewhat friends with. And it wasn't like drug induced, he was really, and he still is, he was like wandering around mumbling and laughing and seeing things and he was sitting there and having conversations. He stayed at our house that night because we were scared to have him go anywhere. And he was standing there having conversations with people who weren't there and he was talking about flying saucers and having tea parties. He was really case book out of it to the point that you couldn't communicate with him and he would go "HEEEEEEE!" And then he would start talking to someone who was right there and then he would break off and curl up in a ball and look around. And he was really like that for about three days. And now he is more coherent and now you can talk to him somewhat.. He still likes to do things blind and like from some other galaxy and he is just really brilliant so he knows and rattles off all these scientific terms and is like talking to these spaceships. But I have never seen anybody really flip out like that. I mean I have seen people get mad and depressive and things like that but I never saw anyone get crazy. And everybody was really worried about him and nobody quite knew what to do and it really made it very clear. And lots of times what we did, for a while, was just talk to him, you know in his, or at least the only way that we knew, like we got as spaced out as he was or almost and that was fun because you know that was like tripping. And I think it helped him because it made the chasm not as, you know, but basically it was very weird. </p>

<p>[19:28]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it frighten you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah it did. Just that this reality is so tenuous, you know and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you walk near the edge and you may fall off one day. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know if that would ever really happen but I guess in some way I am scared that it might. </p>

<p>And I was also very scared that nobody could really do anything for him. He was so far away that nobody could really touch him. And when people tried to he just got really suspicious. And he was very distressed and it really scared people. He was sure that everybody was trying to take his heart, that was what he kept mumbling and stuff like that and people having control of his body. And all those things were a bit vaguely familiar. </p>

<p>[21:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit vaguely familiar to you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well the thing about not having control over your body. I felt that a lot and I think it was probably in a different way than he meant it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But still it was a little bit eerie to hear him talking in a crazy way about something that didn't sound so different from you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I also just kept on coming back to how much nobody could do for him, I mean, you know, that was also really scary. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just couldn't help. Something like he could just come to disaster and like you just have to sit there and watch. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And at one point when he was at our house that night that was the worst night and he was explosive, absolutely explosive and crazy. Just - and there was just I didn't know what to do. </p>

<p>And I think I've decided not to go to school next fall. I read a whole book yesterday and I have no idea what it said this morning when we came to class and talked about it. I read it so I would be prepared for the class and I just had no recollection of any of the book. I mean none of it sunk in, none of it and I read the whole fucking book and I don't know what it said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Freaky. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not any of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the name of it is about the only thing I remember about it. And as he would read the passages I would like recognize that they were familiar but none of what they meant sunk in. The same thing happened to me on Monday. On Monday I was working at the library and I had been working for five or six hours and I was just getting to the point of being out of it and this guy came up to me and starting asking me something about a period card catalog and I really just snapped out and I was just like standing there repeating periodical card catalog, periodical card catalog and I could not - I mean I could say the words and I could hear the words but I just wasn't getting to hear and I couldn't understand his words. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was like they were just words and they didn't' register?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and that is happening on all fronts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On all fronts, like you are out of kilter? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel out of kilter like that now? Or I don't' know weird or spaced?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit spaced but I don't feel out of kilter that much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your words have meaning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The words are - it's not, I don't feel that strange right now. I feel spaced and my voice is kind of distant but I'm not that gone. </p>

<p>[25:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because it is like all this scary stuff and yet right now you are not scared by it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although I am a little bit anestisized. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean coming in here always magnifies however I am feeling. If I was feeling, and I didn't realized I was feeling spaced, but I am now. Because Marco upset me a lot; so I just can't get out of it. </p>

<p>[26:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like what have I done; what did I do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or why won't it just stop, right. </p>

<p>And it was like Jobe; Jobe is basically a really nice fine person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And how come I can't somehow get it together. I mean, I don't even, we don't know what we want it to be he is not depending on me to be a girlfriend and I am not expecting him to be a boyfriend and we are not sleeping together and it would be okay and I would like it if we did but it is too involved and it seems right but neither of us - like he is not any more or less involved in me and it is very even and that feels really good. But lots of times I like come up to him and don't have anything got say and I'll try, I mean, I can't imagine walking up to someone and having a loss for words. I mean why is it that I have to, you know, that is just such a strange thing because I don't know. And I always feel like we start a conversation instead of just being with each other, it is still on such a strange level, it seems so babyish and infantile. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to watch yourself start the conversation? </p>

<p>[28:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I watch myself start the conversation and of course we are both sensitive enough so we know what is going on and the self consciousness makes it even worse. I mean the unspoken self consciousness. And that is just so strange and I don't know how to - -Are you cold?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's chilly in here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like, I don't know how I got, or regressed to that level because there is like some lack of friendship there if you can't just walk up to someone and start talking; right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it's just all these things and I guess it just seems weird not have Holly around to talk about it all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is sort of like you have no one to go home to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I haven't explicitly said that. I know I am nodding my head and saying it is true but I probably don't even want to realize that it's true because it's too upsetting. It really is. </p>

<p>It is real true. And I'm just so much not into work. I mean it just amazes me that I have all this stuff to do and I can't sit down and do it. And day after day after day I resolve to do it and then don't do it. Or if I read it I read it so I don't understand it at all. And I just feel, I don't know. And I finally thought of a paper topic that I would be interested in doing but I have, like, all this material to read and I - there is just no way that I can do it. And it is essential that I have to do it right away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Panicking. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not even panicked right now I'm just at a loss. </p>

<p>[31:12]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've got to do it and you know you can't do it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think it's a good idea to leave school?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.</p>

<p>[31:44]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>[32:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you take the way I said it to mean I don't know but I probably think you shouldn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I take it more that you didn't want to think about it or you think that you should think about it whether you should talk about it. More like a policy decision. It wasn't that you didn't know it was just that you shouldn't try to give me advice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that is probably true. After we said it and I started letting it filter through my mind I thought about you and thought about how good it would be to have a rest. And to come at it freshly and I thought that it's so drifty not to be connected and not to have something to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's it in a nutshell. I just got a very funny feeling that whenever you coughed or something it is just something in you that is trying to come out or something. And when you coughed it is really violent and really, I don't know. (inaudible 34:51). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't really recognize that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you water that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm afraid you can now. I have sort of given it up for dead. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Was it an avocado?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was a beautiful big one but it didn't get watered enough over vacation and it never was the same. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it looks like it was, was it bigger than this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was real big. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Had you been growing it for a long time? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was four years old, I didn't - I had only had it three or four months. My friend had it for a lot longer. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oops, that's not what I meant to do. It looked like it was dead anyway. </p>

<p>I don't' fauna; I don't' know. </p>

<p>It seems like a lot of the lessons I've learned is not to depend on people and not to. I don't know. I was thinking about Diane and how that we talked last night and we had a nice talk and then -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then she yelled at you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't yell she just said some or made some pissed remark about when I bored a book from her or a pencil. Somebody called me and I wanted to take his number down and I took the number down and ran into her room and got a pen, took the number down and then just as I hung up the phone rang again and it was for Tanya and I was bringing it into Tanya's room and I was going back to the living room to get the pen and bring it to her and she yelled, "Why aren't you bringing me back my pen." She didn't need it; it was just an extra pen. She was using another one but she has this big thing about I don't return her things. </p>

<p>[37:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was just going to get it and I had my hand on it when she did it and was like, I mean she is still is more trying to get me then help me. I mean if she had given me another half second I would have been in there with her pen but she is still jumping at it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel kind of baited by her? Like if you give her an opening she is going to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, exactly and I know that, like Jennifer talked to me today </p>

<p>(Phone rings)</p>

<p>[37:51]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello -</p>

<p>Hi, who is this?</p>

<p>Oh hi, </p>

<p>Could you call me - or are you at home?</p>

<p>Yeah, can I call you at about 5:15?</p>

<p>Good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just like I knew that she was asking because she wanted to make sure that I was not getting too involved with Diane. I mean I wasn't getting too caught up with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jennifer was asking you that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Jennifer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was asking you what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she was asking about how I felt about talking to Diane. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I told her that it was real nice but that I was leery and she said "Good." It was like she was being protective but realistic. And she was like you have to realize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you protect yourself a little more? I was thinking about the incident like I wish you could have said our snapped back at her, "You bitch, I had my hand on it." Like that might make you, I don't know, if you could blow up too then it might help </p>

<p>[39:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know but instead I always get defensive. Instead I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know but you should say, "I had my hand on it Diane."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That is how it always comes up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess because I am afraid to be angry. Also it's like not a natural thing; my natural reaction at this point is....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know it is a much better way I know that because being angry is stronger and she can or I can like or she can slam her door or I can stomp my foot and I know that it ends up the next day its fine because you have gotten the energy, or your hostile energy out that you had to get out but you respect the person and I know that there is something just very - I put myself in an underdog position by not being able to get angry. But I don't know how to. And sometimes she is the person that I have been able to get the most angry with but that is only after months and months of letting her step on me. You're right but I feel very artificial, like I am cultivating it. And I like - do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. I can easily imagine myself saying the same thing to someone who said what I say to you. That is a twisted sentence but, if someone said to me what I just said to you I can easily imagine myself saying the same thing but that's not how I feel. I don't feel angry; I want to make it all right. I want it to be all right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right; and I know that, I know from other people that there is anger there and I know that somehow if I could be angry it would make the situation a bunch easier and less fucked up because it would let us both be angry at each other and then we can make up. And it's worse if I do what I do but I also, that is also my natural reaction. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was thinking about what you said a while back about your parents and how if they are angry it is like taking the love away. I don't know if it's like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Nobody every got angry; they never got angry. I don't ever remember my parents screaming at each other, ever. I mean throughout all my childhood I can't remember them having a yelling fight. It was never that way. And I just never knew how to scream at anybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when Diane yells at you after you have had that long talk it is sort of like betraying your talk or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I didn't let myself get, I mean all of the time I'm flavoring everything with a certain wariness which but I just think that it is unfortunate that I am that way now. So, I would like being able to be completely and utterly. And now I just have to suppose that it is not going to be real and she is not going to be consistent and she doesn't really care and it is out of loneliness or out of something else that she is talking to me and that gives me real concern. It like the lessons that I am learning are just not very pleasant learning lessons. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you going to write about that? Does her yelling at you mean that she - her positive feelings for you are not real? Like it could I guess? You know for her is that what it means? </p>

<p>[44:04]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. With other people I can see how I can easily misinterpret it because of the whole, my parent's thing. I mean if anybody gets angry I automatically think it must be but when Holly does I know that basically she gets mad too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you said, you are basically friends. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and she basically is rooting for me you know although she had a right to get angry at me and we have gotten pissed at each other before</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But with Diane?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Diane, yeah, there is also something basically hypocritical about her. Like she professes all this sensitivity and interaction and this and that and when it really comes down to it she is like, she really does a remarkable job of pushing people off of her universe. She like is incredibly judgmental about people. If she doesn't think they are cool then she just won't have anything to do with them. And like, lots of her actions are very opposite of her philosophical framework that she pretends to uphold. You know and it's just like. And just, she really, there is just a certain shit before you talk attitude that she has. She really enjoys being harrassable. You know that what kind of shit is that or what kind of way is that to relate to people. I don't think. I mean, I am attracted to it but I also think it is rotten</p>

<p>[46:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like your feelings are being used or something as her playground; well, playground isn't it but it's like ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like for a small pleasure she is willing to trample on you, which makes you bitter. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am bitter and I am also nursing my bitterness too. Because I am really scared that if I let it out, if I stop it all then I will be in love with her and that will just make that whole horrible situation all over again. So I am really holding on to all my suspicion of her for all it's worth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because if you didn't then you could want her so much and care about her and need to be cared for by her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I know that I said I will loose things in that other place, well now I really feel like this was a very far away and as I'm saying them but I really think she's a hypocrite and I really and I feel very distant from what you are saying but I know that in other ways I have felt close to that although right now it just seems like, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>47:24</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess I also like wonder. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonder?</p>

<p>[49:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like spaced and grumpy and feeling sorry for myself and then I like stop feeling sorry for myself and then I see this guy walking around and it really upsets me. There is this guy and I don't know what is wrong with him but he is on crutches and he - I guess he has some disease but his body is completely distorted. And his movements are all completely spastic and he can't you know he can't control himself at all and his body is like utterly grotesque because it is twisted around so much. And then I like, I've seen him everyday for the past couple of days and I just keep on, I mean think about having to deal with that and being like that and never being able to escape it even the slightest thing you do being an incredible effort and have people always look at you and be slightly grossed out at you and I don't know. There is this conflict and then I feel like no matter what is wrong with me I have it so much better off and I am being utterly self indulgent to even spend an hour or two hours a week talking about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were sort of stretching back like that I thought you looked ugly and tired and like, I don't' know, just like very tired and bitter human being. </p>

<p>[51:36]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I feel like, I'm also disgusted with myself because I am just coming in here week after week saying the same things and not really getting anywhere and I really feel like I am sitting in a puddle today. And I can't even....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just going round in circles. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I can't even make any sense of this. And I can't, I don't really like talking to you but in a way I am at a loss without talking to you. And I never not look at somebody so much as I don't look at you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so it is almost like you are just going through the motions hoping, but I guess that isn't the center of what you meant though? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not trying to really understand what you just meant when you said that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No big deal, just a distraction</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel real yucky. Just yuck! And I am disappointed in myself and I just don't' even have that much energy. Maybe it's just today and I'm making everything seem bad because I'm feeling weird today. I'm just tired. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you can't do it and you should do it and you should be picking yourself up and starting to clear away some of the mess only you're not really. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And talking about it is not helping me either. Is it supposed to help me? What is successful therapy suppose to do? I mean because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like I don't know how to help you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why does it help? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It gets things separated and untangled. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes things clearer. </p>

<p>[51:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then it still doesn't have any movement to it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I assume that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That once it's clear then you will move on? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With the recent - what feels like to you total inertia or weariness is from fucking around in the tangle. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so once it gets cleared up then? I guess I really haven't cleared anything up have I? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I mean, well, I feel embarrassed to say I don't know after like - but really I guess what I mean is that - </p>

<p>PATIENT: That I know only? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is certainly true that you would know a lot better than I.</p>

<p>[55:45]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't. Yeah, you could know. I would know better but you could know. I don't know what I understand. I certainly feel, I was thinking about last quarter and all the horrible things that happened this quarter and all my spaceyness still wasn't as bad as the quarter before. The quarter before was just utterly and incredibly miserable. And I feel like this is just so painful to recover but I don't know if the pain, if this is even recovery maybe it is just getting sick in some other way. At least I don't think that I was ever this spaced and I am always spaced out. But also -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like I know why you are spaced. It is perfectly clear to me why you are spaced. You are spaced because you have more stuff to deal with than any human being could possibly deal with. I mean it is like there was this thing with Ross Vineman (ph 57:16) that is an enormous shaking, shattering, and like that was enough to digest in three weeks or something but it comes on top of the FBI and on and on and on. I don't see how you can - you would either have to be sort of the kind of person that thinks non-stop or else you would have to be spaced that is what it seems to me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's nice to hear. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like maybe it isn't something strange or is wrong with you or that you are basically fucked up or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right; which I hadn't even really considered, that I wasn't. I guess that is just on top of it. And that's the thing that I also wonder how much I am dealing with any of this. I know that I think about it haphazardly. I know it is really there and I know I was just like super upset about Ross Vineman (ph 58:51) and all that night I couldn't go to sleep because he was in the other room because I was worried he wasn't sleeping. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you've got things happening too fast for you to be able to think about them productively. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But then in another way I just also like worry about them and then put them away in a kind of unproductive place. I don't keep them out and figure them out and put them away or scratch them off to experience file. I think they just - - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hang around? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, hang in limbo. I don't. I can't like deal with it and package it and put it away. And that is really what I have to do and that is what life is about and there is in some basic way that I am not doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, tying up the threads and the package so that they are tied for god sakes and they all have to be left in open storage or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But lots of the things it seems like, a lot of my relationships, if I could get them figured out would help. Like if I could get it together with Marco I can't help but think that it would help basically in some basic fundamental way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it would be like having a nice clear relationship. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and also a really important one to me. And I know that I just still care for him and he matters to me more than just about anybody and that could just be something good, you know. And I keep feeling like it could be a whole bunch easier. Maybe I have no idea what I am doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are wishing for it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you would be wishing for it too, like too how about everything is all right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh well. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I see you tomorrow or are you busy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ummm? Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have all of my time free tomorrow. There is not a single time that I have anything particular to do. But if you are real busy then that's cool.</p>

<p>[61.39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I can do it; I just can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tuesday at 2:00 or 5:00?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either one, let me see. Tuesday, 5:00 is good; then I can get a lot done. Did you (inaudible 62:58)? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very little. Is that what you are doing your paper on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are like incredible misogynists. It is very essential in Faust and I was trying to figure out why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is interesting I didn't know that about (inaudible 63:16) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 63:20) is just so much more vehement then Leche (ph? 63:23) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Leche (ph? 63:16) seems to have this big thing about power and shit like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, stupid. But all very anti-feminine stuff, </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyway I haven't thought about it enough but I just thought that would be interesting to do and the grant is interested. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that is a good idea. That is a really neat topic. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I felt good about it, too. Like days of fishing around and not having anything to write about</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel a little like a mafia man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, with that hat and coat. That really is a mafia hat. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I found it in someone's cellar a long time ago. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You usually don't find such nice things in people's cellars.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's pretty skanky if you look on the inside in it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it looks nice on the outside. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A whole lot of things do that aren't. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client number 1429-110, interview number seven. December 17, 1970, therapist Dayton. Client number 1429-110, therapist Dayton, interview 7, December 17, 1970</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hello there. How you doing? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm reading (inaudible at 0:00:32.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh wow. I just, I should probably read something else before I come here because it always takes me a while just to get my head on straight when I get done with something like.. Can I just ask you a question? What, what specific area are you in here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm in educational psychology officially but this work that I'm doing is clinical psychology. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and is that like cross fields? Or where would your degree come out? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My degree will come out of the Department of Education. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And like what sort of things will you be doing then, counseling? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The same thing I'm doing now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you swing that from that Department? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, there is, there is, see there are three departments in which you can get training in clinical psychology.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Education, educational psychology is usually in the Department of Psychology and they call it clinical psychology. And in the Committee on Human Development which also is like clinical psychology. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The Committee on Human Development? 0:02:07.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's another department. Which it doesn't have..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Out of what school is that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's in the division of Social Science. It's a very complicated kind of administered set up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that in the catalog? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The Committee on Human Development. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Isn't there a way also a backdoor through like administerial?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes we have students who are, people who get clinical training or students in religion and personality in Divinity School. 0:02:40.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh so then you, how about through the School of teachers? I mean do you ever get (inaudible at 0:02:46.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Less of that. I don't know why that is. We get very few people who come here from STA. Now the further complicating fact is that the area of clinical psychology is probably going to be done away with at the end of this year. There will be no clinical psychology. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then what will they do then? Will they just drop it from the..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What form of therapy would be done then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It may not be done any place except over in Billings. The Counseling Center is closing on June 30. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How come. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the University is primarily interested in maintaining its reputation as a research institution. And not enough research to their way of thinking has come out of the Counseling Center. They're interested, they're not interested in training and in service so much as they are interested in academic scientific research pursuits. 0:03:57.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. So in other words next year they won't have the program. It won't even be around here any more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Now it's possible that there will be some kind of training program but that's not been clarified yet. Like a multi disciplined clinic of some kind. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well then that thing is really for all practical purposes you know of no use then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's not. Because it hasn't been clarified yet. Now the Psychology Department currently is thinking about setting itself up in four, with four areas of concentration. Psycholinguistics would be one. Social Psychology another. Biopsychology another. And a research in personality and psychopathology the fourth. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And where would Psychotherapy fit in? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's the question. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be slotted somewhere though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not necessarily. It might be that people would have to get training outside, not within the University. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well that's some news. In other words then all the courses that were even offered in the Department of Psychology having to do with psychotherapy wouldn't be around here then, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably not. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Which means that if you go to the School of Teaching you couldn't take, there would be no courses. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there would, there might be courses at STA.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I just, I came over from there today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was talking to some of my friends there, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And their psychology courses are taken from the School of Psychology. They have a you know [a deal going back home.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:05:53.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. That really, well, I'll look at the catalog some more. It seems really strange that they'd do that though. Well, where was I? I think last, last week I departed something on a note of, what I can't, I remember the last thing was that I you know I kinda like to have things easy and happy most of the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't, I don't remember what quite, what I was talking about quite before that. I thought you know I thought about it this week but I can't... Oh. I can start. Here it is. Sylvio, this girl came to get her tickets and that was no big thing. All she did was ask for the tickets. Or ask why she hadn't got them. And I said you know that I didn't buy the ticket. And she says, "Why not?" And I said, I think I said I don't, I didn't think you were interested or something like that. And she said, she just said, "Oh." And that was it. No big deal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:07:54.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, like no huge flare up or anything like that. And she just kinda walked away. So we had all kind of past (ph) but nothing, nothing much happened. I don't know if I wanted something to happen to me either. I don't, hmm. Today, I don't know. Today was kinda, I still, I still have this thing like a, which I've really been wondering about is, and it's become like in the last four months more and more so. I couldn't, like I had an appointment with a kid for ten o'clock this morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Out in Pimmville. And we were supposed to run around trying to find a house, another place for him to live and a job. He's 17 and it's, well I could see you know that it was going to be very difficult to get that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was out drinking last night again. So when I got up this morning I didn't get up until nine thirty. And then, and then I couldn't get myself moving. So I called up and told this guy that I wouldn't be there until twelve. So I sat around and I thought for about an hour. And finally I got out there around twelve but the message never got through to the kid. So I talked to him for about an hour. And it was ok talking to him but I don't, you know I felt shitty number one because I'd overslept. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Number two is because I didn't really want to go out there. And it's been this way in a lot of things. I have to make myself. 0:10:03.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Force yourself to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And after a long period of time I might do it actually. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But only because you feel obligated and guilty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and then even you know because I think it is because I know I can get away with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like one of the reasons I wanted to get and eight to five kind of job was that, that I would know that I would have to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it seems like when I was on vicarage I wouldn't have to do it. Therefore you know I would sleep until like eleven in the morning. And then I'd feel shitty. What I can't understand is why, why I am that way. Later I do things like atonement you know. I'll sit down and think to myself, "Ok, now you know this is the way it's going to be." Or I'll make resolves or I'll try to do something you know to make myself feel like I've kind of evened the scale.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like with this thing I'm getting back into school now. I, you really hit it on the head last week when you said you know, "You like it easy and you like it, you like to be happy." I think I took it this way that I don't usually very, very much at least externally in what I do. And it's almost...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I, my moods don't, you know like externally don't change that much. I don't, people don't think I'm usually way down on anything. 0:12:12.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, what I was going to mention with this job thing now. I came here once again like I was going to have this all done by the end of December and I was going to have it picked out. And I was going to decide what I wanted to get back into school and what I wanted to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I'm really afraid to get back into school because it's really like the last, the last shot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't really, I mean if I screw this one up..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the end. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I mean then I might as well figure I can continue to do what I'm doing or else get into something where it won't cause me to have to look at myself so damn much. When I was in public aide I never had to look at myself that much. Mostly the things weren't, like the kids, it wouldn't be personal kinds of problems. And it's also, it's also you know New Years resolve time. And I'm an idiot for that. Because I did it last year you know so I can, I can almost see again where I'm going to be doing the same sorts of things. I really do type things up. I write them down and then I, you know like compare them. I've still got the ones from last year. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Which you kept or broke? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I made 20, see when last year like, I kept some and I.. I was successful on some of them in various ways. Like I typed this up last January 16, I started this job where I'm at now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I had off from the second through the sixteenth. Well I didn't have any money so I had to stay home. So I read a lot. And slept late. And I typed up all these resolutions. I think there were 24 of them. One was learn to ski which I did. Another one was to learn to sail which I tried. But I can't really do that too well. One was to lose weight which I did. One was to get into therapy. I didn't formulate that at the beginning of the year but as I got into the job I said like, "You know I want to get into therapy." 0:14:34.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Blew it on reading. I didn't read. For some reason or another I don't read. You know I read novels and I read, once in a while I'll pick up a book. But it's rarely that I do consistent reading. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean reading professionally? Profession related? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like this week I started some of Erikson's stuff and I got Jones thing on Freud and that was two weeks ago. And I've only read maybe fifty pages and I had to bring the books back. But I, you know I don't, it struck me too like last week I think you mentioned like I go to bars probably because I might be bored at home. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know why not, you know why not get out of there. And I think what I'm worried about like going back to school...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that the same, when I was in school I was a jock. I was in the gym most of the time. And then when it came time you know like we've got a big paper due the next day, then that night I'd spend all night cranking something out that was you know, that would get me by but was a pile of shit. And I mean I can, I'm afraid in one way that that's the kind of thing that's going to happen again you know when I go back into school. So I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll be playing ball until the night before the papers are done. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then go write a shitty paper again. You're getting by but you're not really satisfied or happy with it. 0:16:03.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and see what I don't know is like why I wanted to do that. And I, at home you know at home it was always, I can always remember my Ma telling me to do things, you know. I would be sitting on my ass or I'd be goofing around and my Ma would tell me ok you know, get such and such done. And then I, then I would get it done. But I would never move until somebody would tell me to move. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like right now I'm looking for somebody to tell me to move. To tell me to get this done. And it's still not me that's moving. It's not me getting it done, it's somebody telling me to get it done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like when my supervisor at work, once in a while she'll say you know, such and such has got to be in. Well then I'll get it in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not the one you know that, you know I still don't feel that I'm the one that's, like right now I'm not the one that's deciding really on what area I want to get into. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know whether it would be psychology or whether it would be social work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And the thing that bothers me is that I kind of sense that underneath you know there's something that I'm not even getting at you know that makes it so. And it doesn't want to come out unless I've been blocking it out so it can't get out. I don't know, the strange thing, I can't get anywhere. A strange thing happened like, not really that strange. But it was different. I saw this movie Joe downtown. With my friend Susie. And it's got this ending where, where he's you know he's, I don't know. Have you seen Joe yet? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I won't tell the ending, it..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's all right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well let's just put it this way. It's got a killing ending. I mean literally. And I started thinking, you know like I said, "I don't really know like what anybody's capable of. I don't know what I'm capable of." Because I've seen myself in some straights where I wouldn't recognize my own behavior.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt, I had this weird feeling that I would like to kill Susie, the girl I was with you know. And it was you know it was just, like I don't know if you've ever had feeling. That, you know, what would just, what is keeping me, if she was knowing what I'm thinking, you know. And you know it was almost like what are the controls that are underneath me..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That stop you from killing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I you know I didn't say anything. But it was, it was a, it was a kinda a very uncomfortable sort of thing that you know. I says, well you know I.. I said you know I wonder if I really, you know if there's something about her that I really don't like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know that I don't allow myself to feel. It's like I don't, I don't really know like really what's under everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. It sounds like you're saying that you don't really understand what makes you tick. Like what makes you do things or not do things. 0:20:00.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it, yeah. I think it's that and I think it's the idea that underneath you know. whatever the unconscious is, is that I'm something different, entirely different than what I am externally. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That there's a lot of stuff smoldering inside that external smooth surface. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a pressure cooker. It's really boiling inside but when you look at it on the outside it's just cool steel or something. It doesn't, you can't tell that all that's going on inside just to look at it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I, it's that and then it, you know like in this instance it was, it was kinda scary to me. And I wouldn't rule it out..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would erupt, it would come out without your knowing what it is and how to control it. Are you indeed capable of killing Susie? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I told myself I wasn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're not sure you believe that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I could. I think I can admit the thought..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think I also have to believe that my control, see the thing of it was, it was you could see how the thing in the movie developed. It was two people in a certain kind of relationship at a certain time in a certain instance and boom. It was like in cold blood. That sort of thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:21:55.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and I just kept you know I asked myself the question. You know what keeps you, you know given the certain right kind of circumstances, what would keep me from acting in a similar way? And the only think I could say was that I don't think I would . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but I couldn't.. Well the other question was what I, what I really, maybe I don't really like Susie at all. There's something there that I can't, I cannot really understand because.. She asked me one time if, if I held it against her that I met her at a bar. And I really wonder if I you know if I don't, she.. The other night I was, I was, on Tuesday I was walking down to the bar and I saw I think it was her and two other guys go. And I had that same feeling again as I did the other time you know. She's kinda, you know like moving out on me again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, maybe I better, I'll try this now. The one time when you mentioned about Sylvio and why, why I called her Sylvio. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think you, I think you said that because my, you know it's why you know like why did I, in other words this is the reason she was mad at me. I'm treating her as one of he boys. I think this was the intent of the way you said that. 0:24:02.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok but my reaction was not that. I don't know. I can't remember if I said this before. My reaction was in some way I'm not really a man. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words, it took me a while to let it filter up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But my, my thing, my thing and the thing I felt the old you know, what was that about now kind of, you know I felt myself being guarded. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think it was some, I thought it more to be, well I don't think it was homosexuality but it was in some way having no conception of the you know like what it means to be a man.0:25:09.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. If you were more of a man you would treat her like more of a woman. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's, I think that's what really you know, I think that is part of what [leads out of it.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the initial thing because I remember...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's, like it's fuzzy the distinction between men and women is what you're saying. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I really.. I don't know why I've been you know like I treat them the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 0:25:41.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: But back there, the reason, the reason I just remembered that is because I felt this kind of guarded thing and usually on that it would give me some kind of clue that maybe there's something there that's I'm slipping by that I shouldn't be slipping by. I don't know, it doesn't.. Well, the only thing I like this time when I, when I talked to Susie.. I can look her in the eye you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no big problem but, this is the Susie that I had the squabble with. I'm trying to get why the look in her eye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can look her in the eye, man to man huh? No problem. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I don't yeah. Sylvio I still got to use that name. I still can't consider that she's, that she's a woman. I really, I can't even think, there's certain girls I can think of as a woman but Sylvio I honest to God cannot think of her as a woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Well why are you trying to force yourself to think of her as a woman?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because she's got a skirt on. She's got two legs. She has long hair. She wears lipstick. She's got breast, half way. She probably has something between her legs I would imagine. But she doesn't act you know like a woman. 0:28:00.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's a woman supposed to act like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She doesn't flirt at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She, she's very, I don't know why I get on Sylvio all the time tonight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She really bothers you doesn't she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mention her all the time but I think the reason I mention her is because of the couple of incidents that I had with her. The only thing I can think of is I see something of myself in her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. What is that different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the thing that comes to my mind right away and I've always thought this is that I see something of the rigidity or unspontaneous kind of person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In her. Maybe to a greater degree than in myself. But it's very clear that that's what's there to me, you know with her. And that's what, you know, that I know for sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: At least I feel that for sure. I don't know about other things. Maybe it's part of the fact that she's (inaudible at 0:29:36.0). Walking straight back again through Sylvio. Well, I call her..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I called Sabrina by her last name too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it that Sylvio is aloof and cold? Like you feel yourself to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sylvio is professional. 0:29:58.9 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not professional. But Sylvio is professional. But she's professional in everything, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Except in a woman.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I'm sure she's professional there too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't flirt, you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I think she's professional as a woman. I think she's, I think whatever professional means, like a certain ordered way. A certain control. A certain proper way to do some thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I would picture her even you know I would picture her that way even in bed I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A certain proper procedure should you know, proper methodology.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Everything laid out and done properly. The way you would like to be professionally but aren't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I wouldn't want to be professionally that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But maybe less relaxed or less sloppy about what you do in your work. More organized. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I always, I'm everlastingly making these attempts to get organized. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it's like what you, it sounds like you're saying to me that she's more of a man than you are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in your business or your vocation maybe you're a little jealous of that. You'd like to be like that. She's got it over you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She has it over me in some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Otherwise I would feel no, no anxiousness at all. 0:32:03.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it is that she has over me. I really don't know. Well, (inaudible at 0:32:37.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, don't stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing's coming. My mind just shifted to something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, but I'd like to pursue this thing with Sylvio if you don't mind. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok I'm willing. I, nothing is coming into me though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Well how about this part about her being better looking than I said [I worked] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now she, she gets her work done. She gets it done. I would like to get my work done the way Sylvio gets her work done..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I would not like to be the kind of person Sylvio is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So there are some things about her maybe that you're a little envious of and there are other things about her maybe that you dislike. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's fair. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part that you're envious of is her orderliness, her getting the job done, her following through with things. 0:34:11.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're all right on the money because she really..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All things that you should do and maybe that any man should do. And man should do. Parts of you dislike her. The other manly characteristics that she has that she shouldn't have. Like maybe she's too damn organized. She should be more scatterbrained. You want her to..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Once in a while, yeah, once in a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She shouldn't be so concerned about work. She should pay attention to men and flirt with them a little bit in order to be more like a woman. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She doesn't know how to flirt. I'm convinced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She doesn't know how to flirt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So some of her manly characteristics with things that you want more of which makes you think that in comparison to her maybe you're not as manly. But in other ways you know she's, she's too manly and that's not the way it should be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it seems like the first part I, but you know that catches on with me. As those qualities being things..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That whatever it is to be a man you know is. Honest to God I don't know if I really know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What it is to be a man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I must have learned it from my Ma. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that, oh geez maybe that's you know..0:36:03.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much of a man..</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean that's, that's screwy because my Ma is a man too. My Mom has had a you know run the house, make decisions, tell me what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Provide fro me, send me to school, take care of me when I come home..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All this stuff. And she is, she is a woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not a man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, so if I'm looking at her you know like this is what a woman is, you know things get all balled up. So I guess a woman has always been for me like what is you know, what is the opposite of those things. And yet when I'm attracted to a girl I'm usually attracted to somebody who is you know like independent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A decision maker.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Like Sylvio. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but usually with some kind of warmth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, she comes on so strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she loses her warmth, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my Ma didn't have that much warmth either though. Well if what I say is right then I don't, I don't, I didn't, I don't have a pattern. I don't know. I must have patterned myself after my Ma. But if I did that then I came out like, I would come out the reverse of everything that she was. I mean she's very industrious. If she's got, if she's got, maybe this is it. If she's, if she has her house to clean or if she's got like she puts up the Christmas decorations. She wants those things, she goes crazy on that.0:38:24.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She wants them up. She'll schedule time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Four days in a row and she'll get it done and it will be done. Or if she's going to have a party, she will have everything done hours and days beforehand. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'll stay up all, you know not all night. She'll stay up until one o'clock, you know. Cleaning house, getting everything done. And then she's got it done. And I'm the opposite. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You stay up until one o'clock avoiding those things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh hell yes. I'd stay up until one o'clock watching television and then I'd you know wonder when it was finally you know that I couldn't put it off, I'd do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I would have come out like her, I would have been a, you know I would have had a number of manly traits if those are things..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That men are supposed to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like she, it's like I want to do those things. Like I want to order things but everything that I thought that I do is, not everything but many things I do, it's the opposite. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got, I well, I thought this morning, I said, this is one of those things I was thinking. I said one, I said why am I not moving? Why am I not on the road, you know? Like I was sleeping with this one girl last night who I've slept with a couple of times and she works at the office. She got up. She left for work. And I went back to sleep. And I slept until 9:30. And I knew I was going to feel shitty. And I got up and then I couldn't, I could not get myself going. And I says, why? You know I said, why can't I move? And the only thing I could remember ass that if I don't do it, somebody else will. Like when I was at home, my Ma would always do it if I didn't do it.0:40:28.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if I would delay. She'd be, she'd be the one who'd do it and then I would feel bad about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I would sit around watching TV. I remember that. That's just a half ass example. I would sit around and all of a sudden the dishes would be done. And then I'd finally, I'd feel guilty. And I'd get up and be going to the living room or to the kitchen and I'd want to you know help out. My sister and I always took turns. And I says, I guess why did I say that? I'd go into the kitchen and I would, you know they'd be all done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I would feel really shitty and stupid. And I think my Ma did, you know make me feel kinda dumb about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the way she always would get me moving was to say, "Ok, I'll do it." And then I'd, that would, I'd get mad and I'd, I wouldn't show it. I'd just get up and I'd do it. And without no one there, I don't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I can do it for like short spurts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But without anyone making you feel guilty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or without anybody telling me. It's like somebody's got to tell me you know to get off my ass. To get moving..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or else you're done. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I sit. Or you know I'll sleep. Or I, or something, what makes it difficult to understand is that I'm not consistent. You know once in a while I will do it and then I throw the, ball up my whole situation. 0:42:03.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did you do it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when I, you know I lost the weight. I surprised the hell out of myself. But I think you know I, for one month I lost 35 pounds and I said I was going to lose, well that's what I said I was going to lose. I you know surprised the hell out of me. And the only reason I can think that I did it, because the girl I was dating I had broke up with her and I kinda used the (inaudible at 0:42:25.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. What do you mean you used it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I used, I used the fact that I had broken up with her, that I had told her I was going to lose the weight, and that I was, I would be damned if I would not lose the weight. So I mean there was something, it's always outside of me that, that keeps me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Another (inaudible at 0:42:47.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not, it's not, it doesn't come from within me you know from, from you know it, it's like this way in everything almost. I always, I react. I you know, it's like I've said all along. But like if that's you're whole you know, that was another word I was thinking today too. That I am a dependent and it wasn't passive. I kinda shy away from passive. I am a dependent kind of person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A dependent reactor or something like that and you know if that's the way I really am and if it's because that's what you know, when I was little that's the way it happened. Is that, you know is that really then what I've got to come to accept. That I am this way. And if that's so, then I wonder you know if that's so. I think I keep doing things, setting up things to try to prove that it isn't so. 0:44:34.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Trying to say you know you're not really that way. You know like you're not..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Constantly trying to prove things to yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That I am enslaved to no one or nothing. Because that's one of the things that I, I don't want to be dependent on someone. And maybe that's what I really usually turn out into being. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I you know if I get dependent on someone or if I you know, like if I get involved with someone I don't know how to be you know like I don't know how to exchange with them. I tend to just depend on them. I don't know if that's bad or good to depend on someone. I really don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you really asking I wonder whether that's manly or not when you say is that bad or good? 0:46:02.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's doing what I always do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only I don't admit to myself all the time. That's always looking for the guideline. Or looking for someone to tell me. I think really if I, like when I ask questions in class or wherever I am..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really what I'm asking is what should I do here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I want someone to tell me what to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for guidance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tell me..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell you what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just to tell me, well to be my mother I guess. To be my decision maker so I won't have to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Next on Thursday is Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I doubt that either of us is interested in meeting at that time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I'm going to be gone to Iowa. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So what should we do? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well let's see. I think I'm going to leave on Wednesday night. I'm just trying to, how is your schedule on Tuesday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's ok. We're gong to have a little party here Tuesday afternoon, I may not be completely sober. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. (chuckles) Yeah, we're having ours tomorrow. Why don't we do this? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't come in in the morning, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No not on Tuesday. 0:47:59.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wednesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I, maybe I better..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about Monday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My problem next week is, Monday we practice for this concert. And we start practice at seven. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, if you leave here at six, you can get there at seven. It's on the loop isn't it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to remember if there's anything else. Ok, let's try Monday at six. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Five.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean at five, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm going to take the next week off between Christmas and New Years, so we won't meet then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok, all right. Right, you guys have quarter break. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that doesn't matter. It's just that I'm taking the time off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: God, so they're going to do away with the Psychology Department.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no. I didn't say that. I said the Clinical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's, I think I read a deal like that. I don't think I was supposed to read it downstairs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One on (inaudible at 0:49:29.1), huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah some, general meeting or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They said that the University is telling the Department to get it's ass in gear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And set up their own program?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well good seeing you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All righty. So long. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, take it easy. 0:49:52.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3 ½-minute silence) I was just thinking about today and uhm I suppose sort of generally how things — when I was thinking in particular different periods in the day and my reaction to the way the boys were reacting or acting.And I think I was thinking of it partly because somehow I had the feeling that I was sort of sliding back from how I'd felt yesterday when I was at school.  Because when I came in this morning I had found I felt annoyed at my assistant.And I think I knew why to some extent.  But I, I don't know, I just kind of took it as a general attitude on my part.  But when I was thinking about the rest of the day today, it didn't seem to me I still had that feeling.  And it, I don't know, makes me think now it had something more specifically to do with the fact that my assistant was in FBS's room when I came up and there were things that had to be done in our room which she hadn't done and I think the superficial annoyance was that uhm, just because I wasn't there she shouldn't not be doing them and I had gotten there kind of late today.  But I think underneath it, what really bothered me was that she was in FBS's room.  And they're all in there having a good time and I wasn't there.  And since things weren't done I couldn't go there, I had to stay in my room and work.  And so, so it seems now as if it were really a jealousy or feeling left-out that made me feel annoyed or mad.</p>

<p>(Pause) And I was thinking too that well, it was kind of a mixed thing because she hadn't done some things that I'd already explained to her before that I wanted done, uhm you know, just sort of generally.  Anytime she ran things off on the ditto machine, I'd shown her where to put things away and uhm she hadn't been doing it.But usually I would just do it and I knew that it was partly my fault because I hadn't stopped right away the first time she didn't and just said, "Do, do you know where to put things?"  And so today that had, I suppose with my other feeling, that came out.And I think I showed that I was annoyed that she hadn't.  And I was just thinking now there could have been other ways I could have handled it so that I don't know, it wouldn't be like attacking her.  Because it was almost like attacking her,the way I made it clear that I was annoyed that she hadn't been doing what I'd asked her to.</p>

<p>And I don't know whether this has something to do with it, but I kept thinking of how I'd felt this morning when I came into school, uhm, ah, with a dream that I had when I — it was before I woke up this morning.  And I don't remember again what was actually happening in the dream except that it was MSCZ and me.  And I, there may have been other people too.  But I didn't wake,wake up feeling particularly upset.  And I remember being sort of surprised that I had dreamed with MSCZ in the dream because generally I don't, or at least I'm not aware that it's MSCZ if I do.  (Pause) And when I recall, try to recall the dream itself, it just seems it had something to do about MSCZ and me being together.  Now, I just can't remember any other details about it, but I kee—, I do keep associating it somehow with how I felt when I did get to school.  And I keep thinking there must have been something in the dream that did upset me even though I didn't wake up feeling upset.  (Pause)</p>

<p>For some reason that made me think of uhm something a boy told me today.  Uhm, I was just wondering how — well, first of all I was thinking of his experience of a dream or, or a type of dream he,he was telling me he had.  He had a rubber figure, wire inside it so you could move the arms and legs.  But it uhm, it was some kind of a monster type figure or had different animal features.  But put together it was really quite grotesque.  And he was playing with it.  He had to stay inside today when the others went out and he just said suddenly to me, "You know I dreamt last night that this came alive and killed me."  And then he went on to say, "I often dream I'm killed and then it's a surprise to wake up in the morning,"  or something.  I mean he was talking about the transition that you have to make after a dream of that sort.  And then I was just wondering how,i suppose,normal it is for a child of 5 to dream something like that or what it would mean.</p>

<p>(Silence) I started thinking about uhm — I don't know how I got on to it, but 1 or 2 things that we didn't do today at the end when things were quite rushed.  Ah, and then of a boy who had brought in a little, one of those little slide viewers and had had one of those circular things with different slides of one of the past moon shots on it.  And how again there was so much that we were doing today.  He had just a few minutes to tell the boys about it and I kind of rushed him; he's the type of child who likes to take quite a long time to talk.  And he talks very slowly and very deliberately.  And he said the things that were essential and then I realized that I kind of cut him off and that I could tell from how he was acting he had more to say.  But I just knew there wasn't, because of my plans, time for him to say more.  And from there I, I just thought I wish I could remember what I talked about yesterday at the end.  Because I couldn't remember and then I just suddenly remembered or at least what I remember talking about at the end was that I didn't like anybody being aware of my vagina or my breasts.</p>

<p>(Silence) And that made me think of a woman at school who I've always thought of as quite feminine but in a charming kind of way.  I me—, uh, it, I always enjoyed talking with her and being around her.  And it just made me think it's just — I, I'm not even sure I know what she does to be feminine.  Except it's partly to do with the way she dresses and the way she moves and things like that.  And I, I, when thinking about it, I think even if I did start understanding what she did I wouldn't want to do it or dare to because somehow it would call attention to me as a female.  Because, I say that because it made me think immediately that if somebody saying FAJ had a good idea about such and such, I might feel somewhat embarrassed but I like having that kind of attention.  And maybe I'd like it in a feminine way, but then it's something I'm afraid of.  Well, I suppose it's also because I'm not completely sure how to do it either.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then after thinking about this woman I started thinking about one, this woman who is a librarian.  And uhm from thinking about her I started thinking about a 2nd grade teacher who's — also seems to me to be quite feminine in another type of way.  But well, in any case, I think of her as being quite feminine.  And I think I'm I was thinking then in terms of the fact people are always saying how nice she is with the boys and how calm, how good she is for some of these difficult children who are quite emotional.  And I think I think of it almost wishing that that could be said about me and that I could be feminine in that way, just like I'm sure I'm wishing I could be feminine in the way the librarian is.  And both made me think of myself being kind of noisy and sort of mannish or awkward the way I walk and — (clears throat)</p>

<p>It's interesting, I hadn't thought of it in this way before, but today I just felt kind of ugly.  And I know when I was getting ready to go to school, at one point I just thought, well why do I even really try today because I'm not going to like whatever I do anyway?  I mean not that I didn't, I just threw everything on.  But I was thinking I shouldn't really spend much time because if I let myself I'd spend the whole morning trying to get ready because I would just never be satisfied, because I just had this feeling about myself today.  And when I thought of it just now I was connecting it with yesterday and what I ended on.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which in turn you uh some way connected with your cutting the boy off.  I think that was the phrase you used even.  And then you thought of that after you thought about the boy dreaming of the monster.  And you thought of that instead of being able to remember the dream you had.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I can't, I sort of lose what I was doing when I get back to the boy and his dream about the monster.  Except that it was a boy being killed, I don't know whether that was it.  (Silence) I started thinking again about my assistant and how I'm unhappy with myself when I feel the way I did, as I did today about her and then treat her the way I sometimes will.  And I'm sure even if I'm trying to control myself she feels it.  And that made me think of oh, somebody came back to visit today and she was asking how are different people who were working in areas where she had been involved.  And I don't know, somehow I was getting this feeling that, what if people really knew how people who work under me feel, assuming that right now FYLR must not enjoy working under me if I'm treating her the way I am.  I don't know, it seemed more sensible at the time that she might find out than it does right now when I think of it.  But anyway there was this feeling I might be found out.</p>

<p>Then I thought of something else.  Oh I know.  Then I started thinking about,it was almost as if I wanted somebody to come back to see me who would then kind of like be assigned (sic) everyone else that I wasn't so bad to work with.  And that made me think of my last year's assistant and I began thinking, the fact she did come back one day and, and it would happen to be a day that FYLR was absent.  And then uhm, she and I had planned to have lunch together and when she was there she suggested, I think I said this before, that why doesn't FBS join us?  And since FBS hadn't arranged it ahead she felt she shouldn't.  And I was feeling she shouldn't.  But also I know I was feeling I didn't want her to anyway and I was glad I had that excuse.  And I began to think of the fact that FEIZ invited MSCZ and me to her wedding but then she also invited FBS which made me feel again sort of jealous, as if I don't want to share this relationship with FEIZ now.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I, I was just thinking that there's also this feeling: for instance the girl who came back today uhm was somebody that I knew and like but not terribly well and she and FBS had had a certain rapport because they both come from the south and know people from there.  And so I know that, that in,in a way they know each other better, although I don't know that FBS knows her that well either.  But anyway there's a certain tie that there isn't between the girl and me.  And yet the feeling I had while she was there was that because FBS is friendly with her in a specific way I have to be friendly with her in a specific way too, as if we were competing and I was making that into a competition too.</p>

<p>And then just thinking too about the fact that the girl at one point was mentioning the supervisor last year and where she is now, which I hadn't known.  I had—, I hadn't realized she was with any other school now, and I don't know that everybody else who was there at that point knew either, but it seemed like everybody else did,to me (chuckle), making me feel sort of left-out.  And then uhm she said that the supervisor had written her a note and I kept thinking well it must be because this girl had a baby over this summer.  But the note went on and on talking about what she was doing and how she had enjoyed working with this girl last year, and so forth.  And that really bothered me too because I was thinking that again I was left-out.  She hadn't said to me she'd enjoyed it and I was thinking she probably didn't.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it made me think of how rigid I'd been with the supervisor last year.  And then just now it seems to me in thinking about how things are with FHYZ this year, that it's almost,it's not quite the same, but it's almost as if I'm reverting back to that same kind of relig—, rigid relationship that I'd had last year.  And I don't know, there's something built-in about whoever is my supervisor and I guess an assumption I'm being criticized or, I mean I just, it seems I, I lose any perspective when I'm with that person.  Or I was just thinking, I used to have a good time with FHYZ and liked joking with her and things like that and I can't do it now, because I don't seem to have any sense of humor at all with her now.  And I can pretend to and sort of fake it but yet that's not the feeling inside me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Somehow saying that made me think of again what I ended with yesterday and I, I don't know, somehow a more basic feeling that I'm talking about.  And how in one sense I suppose I don't want to think about it, but in another way I do want to get at what's behind these other things.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What's hidden.  Certainly one thing you say, in a number of different ways, is there are quite a few women that you feel have something you don't and you feel left-out, jealous, envious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well that just made me think of my mother.  And I suppose, specifically, that she was the one that was having intercourse with my father and she was the one who went into the bedroom with him at night.  And no matter how she was at other times, how much he was mad at her at other times, she was the one that had him.  But then I get all confused because well, in one way she is undeniably a female figure but in another way she's so unfeminine.  (Pause) And I suppose I think to myself too or I ask myself, if what I wanted was a penis, then why would it bother me that my mother was having intercourse with my father.</p>

<p>Well the way I answer that to myself is that I think it, it always seems to me that what I wanted first was attention from my father because of me being me, a little girl, and then the fact, since I didn't get that, that I wanted to be a boy.  So that just kind of leaves me being jealous of everyone.  And feeling I'm the only one left-out, which is literally how I felt in my family.  (Pause) And if I think, when I think about school too it seems sometimes I even see it that way at school.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

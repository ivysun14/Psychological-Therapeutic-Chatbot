<p>Scharff: Okay, Phil.</p>

<p>Phil: Hi.</p>

<p>Scharff: Hi. I'm open to discussing whatever is on your mind.</p>

<p>Phil: Stress is a good thing. I don't know. I feel just overwhelmed right now. I have a month worth of classes left and probably about two months of work left, it feels like. So I'm not very good right now at budgeting my time and figuring out when stuff needs to be done, and it's just, it's just frustrating.</p>

<p>A few of us in some other.... A group of us that have the same classes and it seems that we're all overwhelmed right now. And you know, I know that, like, I've got a test tonight after this and I know I've studied for it and I'm fairly prepared, but then I've got a test tomorrow night that I've totally not prepared for and stuff like that, and it's.... I don't know. It's just getting to me that, the amount of work, it seems....</p>

<p>Even when I do do stuff it seems like the pile left to be done hasn't gotten any smaller so I don't know. It's.... I don't know. The good news that I got last week, I'm, I found out that I had.... I thought I had like seven credits left, or seven classes left to take before I graduate and I only have 12 credit hours, which is four classes left to take before I graduate. And it seems like I've been going to school forever and I just kind of want this semester to be over, and I kind of want more time to do my work and stuff like that. I don't know if that's a topic to talk about, but....</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, sure. What are you actually doing in your time? You're coming here to school, but I know a lot of people who come here to school are also working.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I have, I work about, about 29 hours a week, and I have....</p>

<p>I'm in, I'm at school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and you know, I have some time while I'm here to do some work and it feels like, like on the weekends, I know I need to study but I haven't been doing it. Well, I did it last weekend. I just don't seem to get as much done as I would like. Some of my, one of my, one class, I have this computer class. We've got to do spreadsheets and stuff like that, and each assignment takes like six hours to do, and I've got like one, two, three... like five left before the end of the semester. And you know, some of us have talked to the professor, and she's just like, "Well, I know they take a long time, but that's why I didn't give you too many." It's just like, man. I don't know.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, let's be clear. You're not telling me it's any harder for you than anybody else.</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: It's not that you're really slow at processing things.</p>

<p>Phil: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Scharff: You, you have a lot else to do.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: And then plus you have to find time to do this and then, I heard you mention your wife earlier, so this means you actually have a family life that you have to invest in as well.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. And I don't know. If.... I don't know. Like last weekend, Saturday, we went, went up to Milwaukee and had some fun with some friends up there Saturday night to a dinner/dance type thing. And I actually got, I felt kind of sick that day, and I got sick and then I slept from like Saturday night until like Monday morning. I slept pretty much like 36 hours, getting up to eat, and I was up maybe like five hours total in between time. And so I was pretty wiped out from that.</p>

<p>And you know, I just didn't want to get sick, and I wanted to have Sunday to study and instead I slept and stuff, so. You know, these things that come up in life, I guess.</p>

<p>Scharff: Slept because you were ill or slept because of the cumulative tension?</p>

<p>Phil: I was ill. I was just sick.</p>

<p>Scharff: Because you were ill, you just lost that day.</p>

<p>Phil: Yes.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay.</p>

<p>Phil: I had some sort of flu thing that seems like more than one person has around here.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, you were planning to have some fun time with your wife.</p>

<p>Phil: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Scharff: How is she taking this enormous work load that's on you right now?</p>

<p>Phil: She's encouraging me to like take care of myself. You know, to study and also to, to have some sanity time, you know. By.... We had scheduled that, like two months ago to do that so that was...</p>

<p><BR>... prior to getting overwhelmed, I guess. And I don't know. This weekend, my parents live up in Madison, Wisconsin, and my sister's pregnant, and they're having a shower for her. It's like a co-ed baby shower. And they kind of, my mom asked me if I wanted to go, and I said, "Yeah," and they rearranged the date for me so I could go, and it's this Saturday, and I don't want to go. You know, I'm just.... Don't want to go. But I don't have....</p>

<p>Scharff: You don't want to go, or you can't go?</p>

<p>Phil: Well, I... I want to stay and study. I'd rather not travel six hours-three hours there, three hours back-and then however many hours. It's Saturday night at 6:00 and, you know, I'll probably leave at about noon on Saturday to go up there and then come back early Sunday morning. Stay at my parents' house.</p>

<p>Scharff: But is that a loss to you or was a co-ed baby shower not like high on your list anyway?</p>

<p>Phil: I have no idea. You know, I was just....</p>

<p>I told my mom to leave it up to fate for the most part. I said, "Mom, the 29th is the day that I can be up there." You know, just kind of.... Because she wasn't organizing it; somebody else was. I said, "Leave it up to fate. If I can go, I'll go, and if you guys schedule it on a weekend that I can't go, you know, that's fine, too, you know." It was originally scheduled for the 22nd and my mom got it rearranged for me so I could be up there on the 29th.</p>

<p>Scharff: So now you have an obligation, you feel.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. It's kind of, feels like a pain in the ass right now.</p>

<p>Scharff: I see. Well, is your mom the kind of person you can explain the problem to?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, she's not.... I don't know.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, like what would happen if you said to her, "I'm running out of time here. Can...."</p>

<p>Phil: Geez. Dealing with my mom.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. Tell me about your mom.</p>

<p>Phil: It's just easier just to go. I don't know. It's easier just to go than try to deal with talking to my mom, I think, right now.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have a good, good relationship with my mom, and I can be able to be up front with her like that. And sometimes I just, it just doesn't work that way. I don't know if it's my side or her side. I kind of am real hesitant about talking to her and then I get my back up against the wall, and then I like, blurt stuff out and it sounds like I'm like giving orders or being cold or rude. You know. And that's how she takes it. And that's how, before any of that, that's how I think she's going to take it, so then I'm just like, "Well, this is how it's going to sound anyway so-" You know. I'd rather just get it out there. And then it hurts her feelings sometimes. And it, I just hate hurting my mom's feelings.</p>

<p><BR>It's like not up there on my list of fun things to do, so. So for this weekend, even though I don't want to go, it'd be easiest to, easiest for me, in my mind at least, to go. I don't know if that's just me not wanting to study or me....</p>

<p>Scharff: So you'd rather take the stress of running out of time to study than face the stress of upsetting your mother.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: She must be a formidable person when she's upset.</p>

<p>Phil: No, she's not.</p>

<p>Scharff: Like does she fall apart?</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: Or does she give you a guilt trip or like, how does she make you feel this way?</p>

<p>Phil: I feel guilty. I don't know if she gives it or if I make it, but I feel guilty. So, it's....</p>

<p>Scharff: But do you feel she has a particular need of you? Are you a special child to her?</p>

<p>Phil: Well, I'm her youngest kid. My sister and myself, yeah. So....</p>

<p>Scharff: And you're the only boy.</p>

<p>Phil: Mm-hmm. So.</p>

<p>Scharff: And you don't live in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: And your sister does.</p>

<p>Phil: Yes.</p>

<p>Scharff: And how often does your mother like to see you?</p>

<p>Phil: Well, she sees me right.... Last summer she saw me fairly, at least once a month. During school, it's less than that. I saw.... My parents came down here at the beginning of the month for that awards assembly that we were talking about before. I invited them down. And that was only the second time. I've lived down here for a year and a half, almost two years. It will be two years in August. That's the second time that my parents came down together. And then, I forget when the last time I was up there. It was probably.... I was up there a couple of times this semester, just for the day.</p>

<p><BR>Scharff: Well, although you're terribly out of time, I take it you must actually be doing all right grade-wise.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: If you then get an award. The award is sort of a scholarship, you said?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I've got two scholarships and I've got, I got a list of awards: National Scholar. I don't know what they were. I was on the dean's list the past two semesters.</p>

<p>Scharff: What do you mean you don't know what they were?</p>

<p>Phil: It sounds.... Okay. I was on the dean's list twice. I was, two scholarships....</p>

<p>Scharff: For what.</p>

<p>Phil: Money scholarships that I applied for.</p>

<p>Scharff: For current courses or for future?</p>

<p>Phil: For current.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay.</p>

<p>Phil: That was just, you know, I applied and I had, I filled the requirements of....</p>

<p>Scharff: You had the qualifications. Yeah.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, the qualifications of grade point average and financial need, and I applied.</p>

<p>So I got two of those. And I had, there's some other stuff that I don't know what the.... I got a little plaque and it says all this cool stuff on it that I got.</p>

<p>Scharff: What does it say?</p>

<p>Phil: I just told you. I don't remember everything.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, I'm very interested in that. You don't remember because it doesn't....</p>

<p>Phil: National Merit Scholar Award. I don't know. There were like four or five things on there. Two of them were dean's list. Two of them were the scholarships, and there might be two other ones, one or two other ones. National All American Scholar. Not National Merit Scholar. I don't know.</p>

<p>Scharff: That's very interesting that you don't know what it is.</p>

<p>Phil: It wasn't like....</p>

<p>Scharff: Maybe you don't know how big a deal it is. Or you don't want to know how big a deal it is.</p>

<p>Phil: No, it was a big deal. It was pretty cool.</p>

<p>Scharff: It sounds like a pretty big deal to me.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, well....</p>

<p>Scharff: But I have a feeling you're kind of blowing it off, like "don't get too interested in this."</p>

<p>Do you think I'm sounding too much like a mother?</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: Wanting to know about your successes?</p>

<p>Phil: No. I just don't know what they are. You know. I, the ones that meant a lot to me, I know what they are, but I just got something in the mail today that I briefly looked at and put aside, so. I was nominated by somebody here at the school to.... I think it was All American Scholar, and I have to respond by May 7, May 9, something like that. I just put it aside, and I'll look at it later, you know. But....</p>

<p>Scharff: So there's a huge contrast then in the accolades that are falling upon you. You don't even know what they are. On the one hand, and this feeling that you'll never get through this semester. Trimester, I think here it is.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, I guess they're trimesters. Well, that's part of it, too. I've been.... This is my one, two, three....</p>

<p>This is my fourth semester here at Governor State, and I used to be a C student where, before when I went to school, and here I have a 4.0. I'm paying for my school, and I'm married, and I have more incentive, I think. And I'm doing well in school.</p>

<p>Scharff: Because your family life is more stable, maybe?</p>

<p>Phil: Probably.</p>

<p>And now that.... I could probably just coast throughout the rest of the semester and do all right, but I want to do better than all right.</p>

<p>Scharff: You want to get the 4.0, keep it there.</p>

<p>Phil: I'd like to keep it, yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Of course.</p>

<p>Phil: I'd like to work for it, you know. You know, or at.... It's kind of.... I don't know if it's pathetic, but like at, it's kind of stressful. My wife and I have talked about this. She's a good student. She's a professional now; she teaches. But the, what does she call it?</p>

<p>The trade-off or whatnot between, you know, a B or an A/B, or you know, a 3.9 or a 4.0, you know, if you got less than or something, we were talking about that, and it's, like the perfectionist idea of, "I need to get a 4.0," and stuff like that.</p>

<p>Scharff: She thinks you're a bit driven.</p>

<p>Phil: She was, too, and I am, yeah. It's, I guess it's a good kind of driven. I'm not, I'm doing a lot better mentally, I think, this semester, than I have, especially last year about this time. I was, yeah, I had a different job last semester, and I was going nuts with the job.</p>

<p>And with school. And this semester, I've got a decent job that's related to my major and, you know, things are, things are looking good on the horizon for me, in my opinion. And you know, whether or not I get all As this semester, I don't think, in the big picture, think it really matters.</p>

<p>Scharff: But what is the big picture? You graduate when?</p>

<p>Phil: I'll graduate December of this year.</p>

<p>Scharff: And with a qualification in what?</p>

<p>Phil: Management Information Systems.</p>

<p>Scharff: What, is that computers?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Computer networking, stuff like that.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. So then you'll be....</p>

<p>Phil: Marketable, hopefully.</p>

<p>Scharff: Very marketable. Yes? At a good salary. In this area.</p>

<p>Phil: Santa Fe, New Mexico, hopefully.</p>

<p>Scharff: Oh, you want to move?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>Phil: So. My wife and I have talked about that, too.</p>

<p>Scharff: So part of this pressure you describe, it's not so much that you can't handle the work.</p>

<p>It's that you want to do the work very well in the limited time available to do it, but most of it all, I think it's that you're desperate to be finished. You'd like to be free of school and off working.</p>

<p>Phil: A little bit, yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Only a little?</p>

<p>Phil: Well, there's that idea on one hand and the idea that, "Oh, geez. I'm going to graduate and have to like get a real job." You know, the fear aspect of like being done with school.</p>

<p>Scharff: Oh.</p>

<p>Phil: So.</p>

<p>Scharff: What reasons do you have to worry about work? Have you had bad experiences?</p>

<p>Phil: No, I've had fairly decent experiences with work, but I don't know. I've always had jobs; I've never had a career, so.</p>

<p>Scharff: Jobs, just passing the time with jobs.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, I guess. Right now, I guess my, the job that I do now is more focused, so it's more toward my career goals.</p>

<p>But I've worked at gas stations, lumberyards, repaired furniture, worked at the bookstore here. You know, I've had all sorts of different jobs, you know, while in college.</p>

<p>Scharff: So you know how to get to a job, do a job....</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Put up with a job, put up with people at the job. You have the experience. So I wonder what the.... It has to do not with working, with having a job. It has to do with having a career, going somewhere or....</p>

<p>Phil: I guess. Just the whole concept of graduating, sending out resumes, getting... looking for jobs, perhaps, I would hope, getting offers for jobs and then just starting off, I guess.</p>

<p>You know, I don't know what I think. I think... I need to know more. I don't know. It's, you know, I don't know exactly what type of job I'll get with my education. A gentleman that's in this internship with me, he just got a job offer in Denver, and it sounded fairly decent, you know. And, you know, being.... I'm 26, and some of my friends from high school have quote, unquote, "real jobs," or you know, they've graduated college and gotten, gotten jobs that their degree, you needed that type of degree to get. But you know, I haven't yet. I guess I'm a little scared of that.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, you think you're highly marketable but you're worried no one will want you.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I know I'm highly marketable, and I know I'm scared.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, you, do you have maybe a legacy of feeling that you're a bit of screw up?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Uh-huh. But what's, what was that, tell me about that time in your life.</p>

<p>Phil: That time?</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah.</p>

<p>Phil: I don't know. I've said this pretty much on everything here. I've been sober for about six and a half years, and I was a fairly large screw up in college. I didn't quite fit in in high school, you know, that type of deal. I was, I was on some sports teams, but I didn't fit in with the jocks and I didn't fit in too many places, I'd say.</p>

<p>I've had some periods of time where life hurts, you know, and a lot of people made fun of me for various things.</p>

<p>Scharff: Really?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: For what?</p>

<p>Phil: For what. I was a pretty good wise ass at certain points in my life. You know, because they're kids, because I was easy to make fun of, because....</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, you're saying you brought it on yourself.</p>

<p>Phil: Sometimes, I'm sure I did, and maybe other times I was just there. I don't know. It's....</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, see, one thing I notice is that I feel you're rather hard on yourself. You say you've got to drive yourself to get that 4.0. You make it sound as if you can't really manage what you have to manage, although the evidence is you're managing just fine.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, I'd say so.</p>

<p>Scharff: So if these people have a go at you, they're only confirming what you already think. I don't know where that feeling about yourself came from. Have you come to understand that from the previous sessions here?</p>

<p>Phil: No. I've looked at it, you know, that inferiority feeling or that insecure feeling, low self esteem, whatever you want to call it. You know, I've, I've noticed it and, you know, up until I got sober, I wouldn't have ever noticed it. You know, I just kind of played along or what not, and you know, I remember, I don't know what was going on in college, but I lived with a bunch of guys and two of my roommates were like picking on me one day, and I just snapped.</p>

<p>And you know, we got into a big wrestling fight until finally we settled down. But... I just never knew. So as far as where I am now, I've come a long way. You know, I was, didn't know what I was going to be. Didn't know why I was going to college, wasn't getting very good grades. You know, I did get kicked out for drinking and stuff like that, and that's what has helped me sober up.</p>

<p>Scharff: You mean that you learned from that?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Yeah. First time I went to college, I got thrown out.</p>

<p>Scharff: So it's all the more precious then to be here now.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: How do you maintain your sobriety?</p>

<p>Phil: Going to meetings.</p>

<p>Scharff: How often do you have to go?</p>

<p>Phil: I don't have to go.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, how much do you need to go to keep up your sobriety, that's what I'm asking. Some people go seven nights a week.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I used to when I lived in Madison. Down here, I go Sunday, Thursday, sometimes Friday and then I go to a meeting on Saturday, so three or four a week.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. Yeah. So that's another quite large time commitment.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: It's important for your stability.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, I see you have a lot to fit in.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, and it's.... Sleep was lacking there for awhile. I don't know if that was part of why I got sick or not, but I feel I'm on the upswing, even though I still kind of sound sick right now.</p>

<p>Yeah, I do have a lot of stuff in my life. I do have a lot of things or balls that I'm trying to juggle, I guess, whatever you want to....</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah, but you're almost getting to you're quite proud of yourself to be in a position to be juggling it, I think. To be where you are after where you've been.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Yeah, I'm glad I'm in college. I'm glad I'm married to somebody that loves me and that's a wonderful person. And I'm, I'm glad I didn't just, you know, give up and stay working at the gas station for $6 an hour.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. Do you understand why your wife loves you?</p>

<p>Phil: Do I understand why?</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah.</p>

<p>Phil: Not always. Not completely, I don't think, no. We talk about it, and she loves who I am and how I treat her and things that I bring to her life by being me.</p>

<p>Scharff: Which is what?</p>

<p>Phil: I make her lunch in the morning. You know, I think of her. I do sweet things, I guess. I, when we talk, I can hold up my end of the conversation. I'm a feeling person. She likes that.</p>

<p>Scharff: One reason she loves you is that you're able to love her.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. And, and she allows you to express this feeling side of yourself.</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Which maybe the guys would tease you about. Could I be right on that?</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, sure. Oh, yeah. My old college buddies, yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: The college buddies you have now maybe aren't inclined that way.</p>

<p>Phil: I don't.... You know, I was living with a house full of guys back then. Now I live with my wife and the....</p>

<p>Scharff: The opportunities for teasing aren't the same.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. At this college, too, people are, for the most part, are more mature. And the people that I have gotten close with here understand, they're more real in that sense. You know, they can feel and express feelings and talk about being overwhelmed in school, too, I guess. You know, the partiers, the drinkers, I don't talk too much with, even though I do have classes with them. You know, I don't engage in the frat talk or whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>You know, the weekend war stories and whatnot, because I don't have those anymore, luckily.</p>

<p>Scharff: Luckily. You feel you kind of just got, got away with it. Got over it in time.</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, I'd be in jail by now if I'd been drinking.</p>

<p>Scharff: Really?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Did you have a few brushes with the law?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, that's what.... I had a third degree felony charge that....</p>

<p>Scharff: What exactly is that?</p>

<p>Phil: "Risking and/or causing a catastrophe" is what the charge was. It was.... I was....</p>

<p>Scharff: Drunken driving?</p>

<p>Phil: No, I was, I was in a blackout and I left the fraternity, and I don't, I went into my freshman dorm-this was sophomore year-and apparently on my way in, they had two propane tanks outside the head RA's room, and apparently I banged them together or off the wall until they leaked or something like that, so.</p>

<p>Scharff: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>Phil: If I had been smoker or something like that, you know, that half of the building and myself would not be here today. So it was fairly serious.</p>

<p>Scharff: And you didn't know it was happening?</p>

<p>Phil: No, I..... Intermittent blackout and somebody was chasing me, and I found out it was a cop later, but I got home that night. Nothing happened that night. It happened a couple days later, and then about a couple weeks later, the whole thing came to a head, so to speak, so.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay, so this is, this is something that's on your record.</p>

<p>Phil: Theoretically, maybe at this point.... I went through, I was on probation for two years and then it, it should be wiped off my record at this point.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay. So the reason I'm asking is, you sounded so reluctant to believe that someone would want to hire you even though you know you're highly marketable.</p>

<p>I wondered were you thinking that a prospective employer would know this history and....</p>

<p>Phil: I'd tell them if they wanted to know, you know.</p>

<p>Scharff: So you feel pretty secure about this being in the past, then?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay.</p>

<p>Phil: Most everybody I know knows I am sober, and if they ask, they know what happened.</p>

<p>Scharff: You've really come to terms with this, then.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: But I think it's left you feeling a little bit shaky about your worth.</p>

<p>Phil: Well, that....</p>

<p>Scharff: Or maybe that preceded the drinking, that there was a shakiness there to start with.</p>

<p>Phil: I think there was a shakiness there to start with, too. I think drinking really helped me fit in, because it made me feel a part of, you know.</p>

<p>Scharff: You could fake like you're a regular guy.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Whereas, whereas really, you're a sensitive person. Or what? I'm not quite getting the sense of you as an adolescent.</p>

<p>Phil: I think, I think I was a little bit less mature than most people of my age group. I think I, I didn't really understand like life or school or anything. I didn't know the purpose of it. You know, I just always wanted to have fun, and you know, I didn't study. I played sports. I, you know, I got through high school. Same thing in college: I didn't study. I played sports. Here I am finally studying, getting through college, but you know, I didn't know what I wanted to be the first time I went to college. I didn't.... The people in my town, I just, you know, my high.... I went to my fifth year high school reunion, and I don't think I'll go back to any of them. You know, I just don't.... I don't know. I got....</p>

<p>I can't like pinpoint like a day that like, where I didn't feel like I fit in, but I, you know.... I had.... I don't know, man. I just, I'm responsible. I have values. As far as that part of my upbringing. I used to mow lawns all the time. I had a paper route for a number of years. I'd babysit. People thought I was a nice person that way. I don't know.</p>

<p>Scharff: So, so in many ways, you were a good kid, but there was a part of you that wanted to behave irresponsibly.</p>

<p>Phil: Well, yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: [INAUDIBLE]** yourself and [INAUDIBLE]**.</p>

<p>Phil: I got, I got along better with adults, I think, than with kids, for some reason. Like the adults saw that I was smart or a good person or responsible or what not, but the people in my own age group, just, you know, I wasn't, I don't know how many friends you're supposed to have, but... in high school, you know, or junior high or whatnot. But you know, I had a, I had a small group of friends, I guess three of us that still communicate now and some other intermittent friends, I guess, I'd say. You know, I just.... "Grow up, Moose." My nickname's Moose, by the way. "Grow up, Moose," is something that I can recall hearing.</p>

<p>Scharff: So you were just a late developer then, you might say.</p>

<p>Phil: Maybe that's.... Maybe we can just rest at that. I don't know. You know?</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, I wouldn't be willing to rest at that. I'm sure you would have known that. Well, why... what would account for that late development? Were you, first of all, were you late physically developing? Was you puberty late?</p>

<p>Phil: I think so.</p>

<p>Scharff: So that's one thing that boys can make a lot of fun of.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah, I was, I was.... Going into 9th grade, most people are 13; I was 12. I graduated college at 17, or graduated high school at 17.</p>

<p>Scharff: A year younger all the way through.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. So that, that could have been part of it.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. And then earlier you said you were your mother's last child; you were the baby.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. There was only two of us, so.</p>

<p>Scharff: And she's, she's not really hanging onto you, though. But she expects you....</p>

<p>Phil: She's hanging on. She's trying to [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p>Scharff: ... do some things.</p>

<p>Phil: She's trying to.</p>

<p>Scharff: She is. Well, tell me how because she wants to see you once a month.</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, geez. She.... How is trying to hang on.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah.</p>

<p>Phil: You know, not letting me be me, I guess. I was telling her once I was going to wear a, a dark shirt with a tie and a jacket. And she's like, "Oh, god. Dark shirts don't look good," or something like that, and it's just like, oh, geez. This was on the phone. I was just like, "Okay, Mom. Whatever." You know, and she's still tries to tell me what the best thing to do is, you know, instead of letting me just go out and do it, trial and error, being a person. She still wants to hold on, I think.</p>

<p>Scharff: Did she have any reason to think that you wouldn't know the right thing to do or couldn't take care of yourself?</p>

<p>Phil: Would she have any reason to? Not that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, was there anything that happened in your childhood that could have drawn out her protective motherly feelings? Were you ill, for instance?</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: Were there difficulties at your birth?</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: No.</p>

<p>Phil: Not that I'm, I mean, I was a kid. No. I don't, I'm not.... Nobody ever told me about it if there was.</p>

<p>Scharff: And you said there were just the two of us. Was there an intention for there to be more of you than that?</p>

<p>Phil: My aunt told me that my mom had an abortion, but I've never talked to my mom about it. And....</p>

<p>Scharff: Would that be before or after you, do you think?</p>

<p>Phil: After me, I think. You know, and that's, that's a family secret right there.</p>

<p>So there's, there's, I'm sure, more than one.</p>

<p>Scharff: That's a pretty powerful thing, isn't it? Your aunt told you this.</p>

<p>Phil: My mom's sister, yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: What are you supposed to make of it? Why she thought you ought to know this?</p>

<p>Phil: Because my aunt and I have a relationship like that. I don't.... I forget the exact context of how it came up, but you know, she says, "Make sure you don't tell your mom about this," and I haven't. And.... I don't know. I'd say my family's fairly dysfunctional with family secrets.</p>

<p>Scharff: You mean there are others?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Do you know what they are or do you just suspect?</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, there's, there's some that were late in coming. Everybody knows now, but you know, just my...</p>

<p>... one aunt, the guy that she married, sexually molested my three younger aunts. My dad has five sisters, so one of his older sisters, her eventually husband, sexually molested his three younger sisters. And that one, the one aunt that married this guy, you know, she died five years ago, and she wouldn't believe it, you know. So.</p>

<p>Scharff: So that's a very painful thing on that side of the family.</p>

<p>Phil: yeah. That's on my dad's side, and then I guess that, the thing about the abortion with my mom, that's another secret. You know....</p>

<p>Scharff: That one's much closer to home, though. I mean, what kind of thoughts does it stir in you? It stirs a lot in me.</p>

<p>Phil: I guess, "hypocrite" is a good word.</p>

<p>Scharff: Hypocrite.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Is she a religious woman?</p>

<p>Phil: No. Not necessarily.</p>

<p>Scharff: But why do you say "hypocrite," then? That it was a secret, maybe.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Like, I.... I don't know. If it's.... Number one, I don't know if it is any of my business. I can see that point of view, a little bit. But with her.... Stuff that my mom says or does, you know, she'll.... Now that I'm doing well in school, or I did well in standardized testing and stuff like that. She'd say, "Oh, I always knew you had it in you," you know.</p>

<p>"If you just applied yourself," or something like that, and I just want to say, "Screw you, Mom." You know.</p>

<p>Scharff: She's really rooting for you, but you'd like her out, to stay out of it.</p>

<p>Phil: She roots and digs, it seems, at the same time. Like, "Good for you," jab. That's how it feels to me.</p>

<p>Scharff: And it feels dangerous.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I, I don't know how open or honest I am with my parents. I don't think I tell them everything anymore. Just for safety or just because I don't want them to know, or....</p>

<p>Scharff: You mean you don't tell them about your plaque or the awards and stuff?</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, they were here for that. I invited them down for that.</p>

<p>Scharff: Oh, yeah. So you don't, you don't exclude them completely. Just from some things.</p>

<p>Phil: You know, I just, I, my wife and I just joined Debtors Anonymous, and you know, I'm not going to tell my parents about that.</p>

<p>Scharff: Is that, now is that something you're ashamed of?</p>

<p>Phil: A little bit, but you know, I don't want to get financial advice from my parents when they aren't financially sound themselves.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay. But you were telling me you have a job and you're paying for school?</p>

<p>Phil: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Scharff: It's like, how could you not be a debtor?</p>

<p>Phil: I could not use my charge card as much.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay. Your problem, or you have a, it's shared with your wife?</p>

<p>Phil: We both have it.</p>

<p>Scharff: What are you buying?</p>

<p>Phil: What we thought we needed, I guess. I don't know. We haven't used our credit cards in over a month and a half, and we're doing alright now. Before that, you know, I'd charge clothes, charge gas, charge food.</p>

<p>Scharff: You mean charge basics or....</p>

<p>Phil: There were basics, and there were, you know, we'd go to plays and stuff like that and charge that, and go out to dinner and charge that.</p>

<p>Scharff: You mean, live just a little better than you can really afford?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Consistently.</p>

<p>Scharff: Mm-hmm. But you're not talking about enormously ridiculous expenses. Like a big vacation or expensive car....</p>

<p>Phil: No.</p>

<p>Scharff: No.</p>

<p>Phil: We just, we had to rent a car twice, unexpected car repairs.</p>

<p>When we first moved here, we bought a lot of stuff on the credit card for the apartment. You know, we had lamps; we bought new lamps. We had towels; we bought new towels. Or whatever. I can't exactly remember what that was back then, but on a regular basis, we spend more than we earned.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay, well, it's like the overuse of alcohol in a way. It's a, something gets a bit out of your control and then leads you into harm's way, but like the alcohol, you've taken steps to end it by looking for support among others with the same problem. It does imply that there's a part of your personality that you're still working on, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I.... Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: That you, that you're impatient to have things. You're tired of being 26, and living like a poor college student.</p>

<p><BR>Phil: That's part of it. I, I get, a buddy of mine got married last year. You know, he, he graduated college in four years and has a job and he and his wife bought a house together and stuff like that. And I compare myself to my friends that way sometimes, and I get a little bummed.</p>

<p>Scharff: You're a bit behind.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. And then....</p>

<p>Scharff: At 26 you feel you should have a house?</p>

<p>Phil: I'd like to have a house. I'd like to have a lot of things. But I, I also know that I've done things in my life that they haven't. My sister got married four years ago, and I-in Vermont-and I hopped on my motorcycle and was gone for three months. I left two months before the wedding, and got up to Vermont for the wedding, and then a month afterwards, made it out to California and stuff like that, so.</p>

<p>Scharff: So you've traveled in the States.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I've done stuff like that. And I'm sober. I've got to always remember that. It's, you know, I guess, I always look at things as tradeoffs. You know, I could be working full time, but not getting my potential pay, and what not, and instead I'm going to school, doing something that I like to do, learning things that I like.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, it's geared to the future.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: But you would like it now. That's what you're struggling with.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. I'd like to be up-to-date with classes. I'd like to graduate today. I'd like to buy a new motorcycle. I'd like to do lots of things.</p>

<p>Scharff: Have fun.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Move to Santa Fe.</p>

<p>Phil: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Scharff: Listen, I didn't want to finish without addressing this matter of the abortion secret.</p>

<p>Phil: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Scharff: I agree with you it's none of your business what your mother did with her body or what decision she made. I think, though, it does have implications. I don't know what they are because it's never been discussed. But I mean, it has me wondering, well, did it mean that she and your father really wanted this child but couldn't afford the child, so therefore she had to have an abortion? Did it mean that this was an unplanned conception and an embarrassment to them, that they had to get rid of this child? Did it mean....</p>

<p>Phil: I think partially it was right after I was born, she got pregnant again.</p>

<p>Scharff: Too soon.</p>

<p>Phil: Too soon, and then financially, also. Those were two of the factors.</p>

<p>Scharff: Right. Okay, so this was a conception soon after your birth.</p>

<p>Phil: Mm-hmm. I think so.</p>

<p>Scharff: So then she has to get rid of this fetus and make room for you, basically.</p>

<p>To be able to afford you and be able to take care of you, give you your full time as a baby, as you might say. I mean, it wouldn't be stretching things too far to say that she could have had feelings about taking that loss, or what she did, that might have led her to be particularly attached to you because you are the child she had left at that time.</p>

<p>Phil: Could be. Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: I mean, I don't know. The only reason I'm saying this is to suggest to you the value of discussing it with her. Now I realize you'd be betraying your aunt, but who is more important? I'm really asking you: your mother or your aunt?</p>

<p>Phil: Who's more important? I guess my mom's more important is the answer I'm supposed to say.</p>

<p>Scharff: You're supposed to say. But maybe your aunt's meant a lot to you and I don't understand.</p>

<p>Phil: It's....</p>

<p>It's easier to talk about life with my aunt than with my mom.</p>

<p>Scharff: She's more open?</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. Even if she doesn't agree, it's, like it's easier for my aunt to not agree with what I'm doing than with my mom to not agree with what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Scharff: She doesn't give you the jab.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah. And this is your mother's sister.</p>

<p>Phil: Mom's sister. My mom's older sister, yeah. She's only got one sister, but she's older.</p>

<p>Scharff: Was she a better organized person than your mother? You were saying there was something dysfunctional about your family.</p>

<p>Phil: Was she better organized? In....</p>

<p>Scharff: Is her family less dysfunctional, let us say?</p>

<p>Phil: Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p>Scharff: No.</p>

<p>Phil: Probably not. I don't know. Just....</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, perhaps the appeal was just that she wasn't your mother. Wasn't quite as close in on you.</p>

<p>Phil: That could be.</p>

<p>Scharff: You do seem to feel that your mother was too close in on you.</p>

<p>Phil: Yeah. But yeah, I do feel that. It's just like, "Back off for a second." Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: And you haven't talked much about your father. You feel he didn't protect you enough from your mom? Get her off your case?</p>

<p>Phil: Do you feel that? Not right now, I don't. No. I don't. I don't think, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Scharff: Okay, well. We're about at the end of our interview here. Do you think that you've felt weary of letting me get too close to private areas of yourself?</p>

<p>Phil: Today? Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yes. Would you like to speculate about why?</p>

<p>Phil: Would have been easier just to talk about other things today.</p>

<p>Scharff: Because you're under stress?</p>

<p>Phil: I don't know why. Just because that's always easier.</p>

<p>Scharff: Yeah, it's always easier. But....</p>

<p>Phil: Growth is....</p>

<p>Scharff: Underneath all that stress there may be some, even though your life is going well, there may be some unhappiness that you might really want some help with. And as you go through these progressive interviews, you might be getting closer to the point where you wish you could open up a bit more. And you know, it's me today. Maybe next time you feel more like doing it? I don't know.</p>

<p>Phil: I do the best I can each time, and I know that like I'm here to try to get a little bit better, so it's, you know, I might reluctantly talk about stuff, but I talk about it. You know, I don't, I didn't really hide anything from you.</p>

<p>Scharff: No. No, I noticed that. You told me things I didn't even ask. Yeah. But still there's a feeling of keeping me at bay just a little bit.</p>

<p>Which you, which you do in a very charming kind of way.</p>

<p>Phil: Thank you. I don't know if that's a compliment or not. Probably not, but.... I had a charming way? What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, you smile, and you're quite engaging. And you deal with the studio people in that same easy manner. Yet, when you meet with me in this, it's a sort of a peculiar intimate situation, there's, there's naturally some reluctance. Because A) it's not really private, and, B) you'll never see me again. But I'm just giving you the feedback that I sense something of that feeling of imminent intrusiveness where if someone like me might get close to you, the next thing you get's a jab.</p>

<p>Like I'm asking you about your awards, and in a very charming way, you said, "I don't really know what they are." You know, like you blow it off. And I now think it's so that I would not come in and say, "Well, I knew you had it in you." You know? Something nasty about it that you might expect from me if I knew too much, of how much pleasure you're actually taking in how far you've come. Things that you feel good about, but you don't want to be too boastful of them. It's almost as if you're still a bit surprised about where you're at and what you've done for yourself.</p>

<p>Phil: Sometimes, I am. Yeah.</p>

<p>Scharff: Well, we're going to finish, I think.</p>

<p>Phil: Okay.</p>

<p>Scharff: Thank you for talking to me.</p>

<p>Phil: Thanks.</p>

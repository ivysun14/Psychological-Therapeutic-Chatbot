<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where would you like to start? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess one thing is like I got a letter from the property management company that if I wanted to renew the lease since I only did an eight month lease until August 31st. I need to notify them by June 1st, and the rent was going up from $1,375 to $1,400. I talked to my mom, and so she said, don’t sign it. If you don’t get a job by the time your lease is up, you need to move back. They don’t have enough money to support me anymore. So I’m just – It’s totally understandable. I wish they hadn’t let me move into this apartment in the first place. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess ‘cause I’ll have to move again. And I assume that if they let me move in that it was going to be okay. I thought they knew that I probably wouldn’t find a job right away. I’ve got a prospective part-time job, but it wouldn’t start for a few months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that part of the equation with your parents, or do they know about that? [1:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I asked about it. Because the thing is, it’s like, $15.00 an hour, 20 hours a week, which is actually just about as many hours as I ended up getting at the museum and $2.00 an hour more pay, and it’s a work from home thing. So, no gas or anything. With that, she said, she had to talk to Dad. I don’t know that I actually have it yet. Basically, it’s – When I was at the wedding, I was talking to my friend, Leslie about how I was between jobs and she – I guess a bunch of her friends, she’s directed them to – Nokia has this Internet research thingy where you’re doing things with their apps and trying to make their application better by checking the accuracy of locations and stuff like that. </p>

<p>And so, it’s something that her mom’s been doing, and her mom really likes finding people for the job, and they look for people with graduate degrees. They are also looking for people who are between jobs and stuff like that. So pretty much exactly what I am. So I was like, that sounds really good. [3:11] So she gave me her mom’s info and then I e-mailed her mom and her mom was like, you sound like a good fit, you know, like the X person. And so I e-mailed the X person. The thing is that like, because this is so popular, there is a two-month queue which Leslie told me about going in. So I won’t find out for another two months if I’ve got it. And they do train you and stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have to wait to get the answer for quite a while. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I’m not sure. I’ve seen help wanted signs in places. I’m not sure if getting a retail job would also be enough, because I assume it wouldn’t pay enough to pay my rent, even if I worked 40 hours a week. I guess if it paid $10.00 an hour and I worked 40 hours a week, I could conceivably make $200 an hour more than my rent. Not $200 an hour, $200 a month more than my rent. And that wouldn’t quite be enough to cover everything else. [4:25] Like, I don’t know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like a conversation – you need to sort of find out really what the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I need a real job, which only gives me ‘til June. And I guess if I find one by August, I can move into another place, but I need to find one by June, though and to not have to move again, and I don’t see that happening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you been applying for things this past week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I’ve just been so busy getting ready for Passover, I didn’t have a chance. And like, Friday we actually went down to Connecticut to get the kitten that we were adopting. [5:14] And I – Saturday was Shabbat and I didn’t want to apply to jobs on Shabbat. Sunday we were doing all the grocery shopping and Monday we were also doing all the grocery shopping. And we were preparing for the Seder. We actually – Sydney cut himself really badly on the finger. We ended up in the ER. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow. Is he okay? </p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s okay. I had called – It’s good that I had called. It’s like, I was trying to see if the Yale Vanguard in Wareham is a three minute was from his place would see patients for that sort of thing. They got me to the clinician. The clinician had me have him run his finger under cold water for ten minutes and compress the wound and elevate it above his heart level. [6:08] Stuff I would not necessarily have known to do all that before going to the ER. There was a two-hour block in which the finger could be saved, and so we got him in in time. Yeah. That was kind of hectic and it’s also why I’m incredibly tired this morning, because the Seder lasted late because we started late. Luckily his friend Janet came over and Melanie also came over. And so as soon as they got there, they came right as we were about to needed to be going. So it was like, we took over the food while we went to the ER. Most of the cooking had been done. But I didn’t get to bed until like, 3:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is very later. I don’t know. Now I’m scared of having to move back in with my parents, or having to move again. 7:13] And I just don’t – I don’t know that I’m going to find something. It’s so hard to make myself apply for one of these positions. It seems like, you know, there may be something I can do, but I don’t feel I’m an especially good candidate for any of them. And there’s one I need to look a little bit more into it and see if I’m an actually a good candidate where I at least know someone who works in the department. Like, in that networking. It might already be too late for that one. It’s like a digital thingy. I always feel weird with applying for digital stuff. Because, you know, they say, have experience with digitization and I have experience with the stuff you do after you’ve like, scanned the pages, and I don’t have scanning experience, so I feel like, scanning experience is something you can get like, you know, it’s something you can have undergrads do. So it’s not like it requires extensive training. So I don’t know if that really counts as digitization experience or if I’m mis-selling myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it’s your job to sell yourself. [8:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s my job to sell myself. It’s not my job to mis-sell myself. I don’t want to – I mean, I guess that’s where the interview comes in, to see if you’re actually qualified. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: Yeah. And also to gain more clarification. So it’s something what your – in this particular instance. You’re picking apart phases, parts, digitization experience. You have some. Do you have experience with every single phase of it? No. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have experience. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it might mean I don’t have experience, because digitization might be only considered the stuff that’s scanning -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See how you’re picking it apart? That’s the piece that you can talk about in the interview and find out more. But the first phase is more broad than that. The cover letter doesn’t give you a lot of room about specifics, or for them to ask really detailed questions. They’re giving you a broad sketch. Here’s the types of things we want you to have experience in. And I think the first phase is to answer the broad questions in the way that you can. And if you get past that – I mean, you’re not going to go into the interview and say, I have tons of experience with scans. [9:42] If you get an interview, you go into the interview and say, I feel confident that I could learn to scan appropriately. I’ve done this piece. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that’s one thing if it’s a thing required of a job or that’s the main aspect of the job. It makes me a little bit more worried. And this is, you know, digitization assistant or whatever. Maybe even like, head of digitization. Or probably not head of it. I don’t think it would apply to a head of position. But, you know, where the digital media librarian. That’s probably closer to what it was. It was a few days ago that I saw this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can say what feels true for you. I’m not telling you to lie in a cover letter or resume. Say what feels true for you. But it sounds like what you’re actually doing, is you’re talking yourself out of having to apply, because you’re not sure that you meet exactly what they might be thinking. And I think what your job is, is to present yourself and sell yourself. Talk about what your strengths are. I’m not telling you to misrepresent yourself. There’s a difference between selling yourself, which is making the experience that you have and the ability and aptitude to learn what other things you might need. [11:02] That’s what selling yourself is. It’s looking at what you actually have, and making them aware of what your strengths are. It’s not misrepresenting. And you can talk about what you have experience in without necessarily having experience in everything you think they might want. Highlight the good stuff. That’s what advertising is about. And cover letters and resumes are about advertising your good stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I want a job. I feel bad spending any money right now. So even something part-time would – Like, even if the part-time job weren’t enough to keep me in the apartment, I’d still at least not feel bad about spending money on things that aren’t like, rent and food. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would give you a lot more freedom and independence, which is what you’ve been seeking. [12:06] You do have to go through this process to get one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I still have to write the person from the Worcester Polytech library. I just don’t want that commute. And I don’t really know if that’s – I guess it wouldn’t hurt to e-mail her. I don’t know. I think at this point it was two or three weeks ago that I heard about the crazy – the person being fired and the crazy upheaval. I assume it would have all been settled in the course of two weeks. It’s just so hard to get the motivation to – I mean, I guess writing her a letter is a lot easier than writing a cover letter. I guess I could -</p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: And it’s not committing yourself to a commute. It’s seeking information about what might be available. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m just wondering if I should go the route like – So when I was actually working at the hardware store for the days that I came in when my parents were in Jordan that was in Connecticut. I actually enjoyed what I was doing. And I think most of the reason I hated being in the store growing up was – Well, A, they had a really, really old, out-of-date, horrible, horrible point of sale operating system for their cash register. So if you messed up, you had to do all this crazy stuff. [13:27] Well, I guess it wasn’t crazy so much as wait for someone with proper authorization to come and fix it while you have a line of customers waiting to t be checked out, which puts pressure on the cashier. </p>

<p>And so that, plus my grandma, you know, who wanted me to do things like vacuum the linoleum floor which, you know, it was a pain in the butt to do. We felt really silly. Why are we not sweeping and mopping the floor. And you’d be clicking and clacking on the tiles. Or if like, I had some downtime like, if I was working back office, she’d be like, oh, do something else. She wouldn’t let anyone else have any downtime at all. Always being on my feet when I was at the register and stuff. I need you like five minutes every so often downtime. Just working for her was like a nightmare, but I really liked my actual manager, Lily. She was the one I’ve been working with now. [14:36] And maybe I should like, just go into the working at the hardware store and taking over the store when my parents retire in a few years. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s a valid option, correct?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s a valid option, though it feels like a bit of a waste of two master’s degrees. And I’m not sure if I’d also have to get an MBA. I probably – My dad got an MBA, but then again, before that, my grandfather and his brother were the ones who owned the store. I don’t even know if my grandpa when to college. I’m 99 percent sure he didn’t have an MBA. I’m like, 90 percent sure he didn’t go to college. And I think the same is true of Uncle Wyatt. [15:30] So they didn’t have MBA to work at the store. So maybe I don’t actually need an MBA. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whose decision would that be? Whose requirement would that be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess my dad’s. Actually, I don’t even know if Harry has an MBA, and they co-own the store. I think when my dad got his MBA it wasn’t to run the store, it was to do accounting stuff which doesn’t even – Wait, well he had CPA stuff, too. My mom also got an MBA and she was working for Mobil Oil. They didn’t get it because of the hardware store. So it may just be completely tangential that they have MBAs. But if I did that I’d possibly have to live in Connecticut. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you envision your life with that path? How would that feel? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I wouldn’t mind the day-to-day work of going to the store. Then it would be whether or not Sydney would come with me to Connecticut. I think he doesn’t want to leave Boston. And just, there are so few people my age in Stamford. And I think it’s a better place to live when you’re maybe a young family or something like that. And the Jewish community there. I guess there is a conservative synagogue and a reform synagogue, but the main Jewish community that I know is all like, super orthodox. [17:09] I guess if I wanted to have the hour commute, five days a week, I could live in New Haven or possibly if I did something south of Rhode Island like New Port, yeah. If the hardware store was in Rhode Island, it would be a lot – a much easier decision to make. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: I notice that you’re including Sydney in that. Is that something that you’ve been thinking about? Whether or not you want to stay with him or not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean the whole thing that I left unsaid was that if I did break up with Sydney, I don’t know that I’d be able to find someone else in Connecticut. Because, you know, the Jewish or converting to Jewish men my age, that have similar interests to me. I don’t even know if there are any of them in Stamford. I’ve never met any of them in Stamford before. [18:09] So I think it would be. And there are less job opportunities in general for people. So either way, whether or not I stayed with Sydney, it would probably mess with my dating life. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what’s your gut sense as you think about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. On the other hand, it’s like guaranteed income, you know. I mean, I guess my dad had to take a pay cut in one point in life in 2008 and hasn’t gotten it back, but he still like, making somewhere between $70.000 and $100,000 a year, which it would take a while for me to get that as a librarian or archivist. And that assumes finding a job in the first place. I mean, it’s not a decision I’d have to make right now. And I could continue to like – I guess I could keep it in the back of my mind if I continue fail getting jobs in my field. [19:17] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you’d have to make a commitment to try to find jobs in your field. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s just all my friends are up at New Haven. Then yet a lot of my friends have moved away. But I have two friends in Connecticut. Two. That’s it. I guess the living in Connecticut thing probably outweighs any benefit from even if I actually like the work and stuff. And they’d only give me the store if I actually wanted to work there. They wouldn’t just like, have it to manage it. Otherwise, they’re selling it. I feel kind of ad, because it’s a family business. I really, really don’t want to live in Connecticut. And Stamford is nice enough, but there’s not a huge crowd of highly educated nerdy people that hang out together and stuff. [20:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel like you have that here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have that here. It would just be really hard to make friends there. I guess then that -</p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: That sounds like your answer. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then that’s really the way to sort of sift through it and see how you feel, and then basing your decision on those feelings that come up. It sounds like you feel pretty hesitant about the idea of moving close enough to make that job feasible and wanting to commit, really commit to the store in a way more than just managing it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and there aren’t any like, good places. Like, you know, there might be – there’s in between there’s Rhonda which has a big Jewish community, but I want to live in the city. I want to live where there’s public transportation and things to do. I grew up in suburbs. I don’t have any interest in living in suburbs. Even providence is a city that seems kind of somewhere between city and suburb. [21:54] ‘Cause like, there’s lots of residential areas where people have single unit houses with lawns. And there’s also not much public transportation. They have a bus system, but I don’t even know if it really goes to place I’d need to go. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you’re ruling that out, you need to rule in something else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know what that is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it starts with pursuing the few options and writing that e-mail or letter to the person at WPI, and seeing what comes of that. You know, it’s not committing to something yet. But opening up that line of communication and then really following through on any job postings you see that you are, you know, a somewhat match for. I don’t think you need to restrict yourself to applying for things that you feel you’re the perfect match for. Because there’s a lot room for interpretation. Sometimes, they don’t have one particular candidate in mind. Or sometimes, the description is a little bit hard to really know exactly what would be a good fit, and not to talk yourself out of things. [23:23] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It would be really nice to have a permanent job. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: It would feel like a relief, I bet. I imagine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It just seems so far away and impossible. Like I’m not capable of getting one, you know. Or just like the market is so oversaturated here. Because it is. And I don’t really know what I have to offer or any other archivists here, especially the ones who had permanent positions and stuff before. You know, and I don’t even know that I’m that much more qualified than the people who are newly coming out of library school. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You certainly don’t sound very confident. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I was really good at my job when I had my job. But it was a really easy job. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you hear how you talk yourself down? [24:22] </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was. I had pretty much one responsibility for 80 percent of the time I was there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, that’s what they needed done. That was the project. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Real jobs have like, lots of different responsibilities. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: Some jobs have more variation than others. You don’t know that you wouldn’t be good at something else. What you know is you had that job in the field and you performed well. That’s good. It doesn’t mean that you wouldn’t also do well at something else, or that there isn’t something else that might be focused in that way. [25:12] </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s true. I mean, I’d rather in theory have a job with different responsibilities. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be less boring. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Especially like, when I got to the point that I was working on the creating new arch records and typing things up. And then, you know, after a while, my hands would hurt. So if I had a job with different responsibilities, then I could, you know, switch over to something that wasn’t hurting my hands. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Think about the possibilities of how things might work, rather than thinking about how they might not. Because you don’t really know. It’s going to be a constant process of seeing what’s out there. You know, you can’t look out into the future and know exactly what’s going to appear next week’s or next month’s job postings. [26:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m just so depressed an unmotivated. I need to like, at least now I know. I think if I get out of the house and go to a space that like, you know, like a café or whatever, I’ll probably be better at getting something done. And now I actually have to do that, because when I open up the laptop and put it on my lap, the cat will often run across the keyboard, pressing keys. And he could make all sorts of typos in my work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a place you’d like to go? Do you have a coffee shop?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess like, there’s – I don’t know whether or not. I think probably coming down to at the square would give me the most options. Maybe like, the Starbucks, like a really big one. There’s also the Panera on Porter that’s really close by. They have smoothies there. So there could also be. There are a few options. [27:11] </p>

<p>Yeah. Maybe creating a little bit of routine to get to one and get used to the idea of spending an hour or two looking at what’s there and writing a cover letter. It’s just now I also don’t trust myself. You know, I feel like when I write a cover letter, I want to send it out right away while I still have the motivation. But on the other hand, because I did have those typos on my resume that time, I don’t know if I really can trust myself to send anything out that will be good without like, proofreading it. Ideally, like, you know, it’s one thing to have people proofread your first few cover letters when you’re getting used to writing them. But ideally, you should be able to like, once you have text that you use for a lot of things, be able to recycle it and send out – You know, write a cover letter in 20 minutes. [28:11] I read online a good cover letter should take 20 minutes. Cover letters always take me longer than that, and even longer if I have a – I don’t even know who I’d have look at it at this point. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who would you trust to look at it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I would trust Kim, but she has a job now, so I wouldn’t think she would have the time. I guess possible Bridget, since like, she’s just doing freelance work. So she would probably be willing to look at cover letters for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe start with one. There’s this one job that you mentioned. Rather than planning out how it’s going to go for everything, maybe getting yourself going with one. And ask if Bridget might read one. [29:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really wish I could do this all without – I wish I were good enough at proofreading my own work, but then I always – I will inevitably miss something, because I’m used to seeing everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s hard to proof your own work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ve just gotten so many e-mails. When I was having a good run of applying to things and then like, at this point I was getting something from all of them. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: It’s frustrating not to go positive responses. I know it’s hard to keep going. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s hard to make all the cover letters sound excited. And so I sort of fell back on ones that were less excited and were to the point and got all the information out and with those cover letters, I think they weren’t good enough, and that’s why I didn’t get interviewed. Or, it could be that they didn’t feel I was a good enough candidate. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you make the other ones sound more excited? [30:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I talked about – I was sort of basing it off – Like, there was one that I found online that – but I can’t copy and paste it and stuff easily with Google mobile. Starting off talking about how excited for the position and stuff and how I’d – The thing with that cover letter that I – the thing that had been the model for a good cover letter is they don’t really get into their experience or anything like that. It’s just like, as you can see from my resume that I’d be a good fit. And here’s why I’d be excited to work for you. But also, I’m not even sure if that works if, for the hiring systems that you see find keywords of things. You know, so it’s like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you could maybe put in a few. As you can see from my resume, I have experience in – And maybe put a few of those key skill words. Meshing a little bit. And then maybe showing your enthusiasm. Like, I’d be really excited to learn, and maybe some of the things that you think the job would might provide you with new experiences in. And get some of that keyword stuff in there to cover that angle, while also showing that you’re interested in a specific position. The things that you have that match the specific position. [31:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess the ones that I did that sounded like those were the one that had the archeology experience and the one that had nautical museum experience. And the rest of them didn’t have anything particular that I could pick up on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Content wise. What about skill wise? Because there’s the content, and then there’s also the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I had the skills for all of them, I thought. I think. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because this is something that you’ve been working on, I’ve been doing a little bit of reading. And one of the things that I noticed talked about in a couple of some of the sort of, you know, who gets hired job searching stuff for this current age. Is that because so many people are applying online. People apply to a lot more things. Positions get a lot more applications. Looking for ways to make yourself stand out. So most people are going to talk about the skills they have that are specific to the job, right? [32:54] I mean, that’s pretty cut and dried. So also, having a little something that shows about your unique personality interests to make yourself memorable was something that was mentioned a lot. So talking about some of the interests you have outside of the workplace. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I can see why that would make sense, but I’m wondering how that would play out in terms of, yon know, it should still at least be somewhat related to like, a skill that’s like transferrable, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know I’m sure – I’m just kind of relaying some of what I’ve read. And it seemed to me like, one of the things they were talking about was they just want a way to remember people. So not necessarily – Yes, absolutely, if you’re thinking about a cover letter with a few paragraphs, that most of those paragraphs, you know, those first couple of paragraphs are about this specific job. And the last one is sort of like a getting to know you paragraph. And, you know, in addition to my time at the job, I’d also love to spend time doing blah, blah, blah. You know, just as a way to create a little bit of a personal connection. [34:17] So I don’t know if this is something, or you’ve certainly have talked to other people that are doing this and have read other examples -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s all stuff I’ve heard before. And I could see it working. I could also see it coming across as gimmicky. I mean, I guess it wouldn’t really hurt that much to try it a couple of times and see what happens. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe try playing with writing it and see how it feels for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I’d need to – I mean, I guess like, knitting and swing dancing are probably like, safe interests. Yeah. I could probably. I mean, ‘cause knitting has a whole attention to detail and stuff. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: Yeah. So maybe finding ways to connect it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to see it in a cover letter to see how it works, I think. [35:16] ‘Cause there’s a part of me that’s highly skeptical. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear that. And you know, I’m not a career coach. I know that this is something that you struggled with a long time before you got the whaling museum job and you’re back in the space. So I tried to do a little bit of reading to see what people are saying. ‘Cause it’s certainly – this is a common problem in today’s job market. And people are – lots of people are feeling stressed out about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I’m just wishing like, wondering if there is a field that’s easier to get into that doesn’t require moving to Connecticut. I’d rather work as an admin assistant at like, random place X here than move to Connecticut. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that is good to know for yourself. [36:10] In the beginning of the session you were kind of talking about moving to Connecticut and working at your parents’ store as a possible option. And it sounded like, the more you think about it, the more that really doesn’t feel like a good option for you. But it’s not an option to not have a job past June, really. So if that’s not going to be the direction you go, then really working hard to secure yourself some position that keeps you in this area is your task. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m just not sure if it’s possible. Especially like, I don’t think I’m going to make the June deadline, so I think the August deadline is the more realistic one to aim for. Just ‘cause like, if I sent out ten cover letters this week like, I’d feel like it would take a few weeks to get to the interview stage. [37:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that puts you in May.</p>

<p>CLIENT: May. And then, you know, probably a few more weeks to get to the finding out whether you got it stage, which would take us to June and the deadline for – I mean, I guess it is entirely possible that no one will take my apartment right away and I could like, still get it. </p>

<p>TEHRAPIST: With that timeline, it’s also entirely possible that if there was some- If you did apply to a bunch of things and got a possible response, you could know by June. </p>

<p>CLIENT: By June 1st though?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are details that nobody can predict. If something’s open now – But the first part of that sentence was, if I sent out ten, you know. And it’s not that ten is the magic number. It’s that, if you sent out cover letters. Because it sounds like what’s actually been happening in the recent past is that you’re not seeking out jobs. You’re thinking about jobs. [38:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ve read like, descriptions of jobs, I just haven’t put them into a cover letter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Reading descriptions of jobs doesn’t get you a job. Doesn’t get you an option for the job. You have to contact people. Wanting a job. Reading job postings doesn’t put you anywhere in a position to get you an offer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you want – If you really want to try to meet that deadline or even try to meet the August deadline, you have to put yourself in the position to get an interview or an offer. So that’s what we need to focus on. What’s going to get you to motivate, to take that step of actually job seeking. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it’s the motivation of not wanting to move to Rhode Island, even temporarily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have to translate that into action this week. Even with Passover, you can still do work on Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, Wednesday night. [39:19] So really, just Thursday and Friday. I mean, I guess Thursday and Friday is enough time that I can actually like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are two full days that you can take active steps. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even Wednesday night. You’re not going to have a ton of hours, but-.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, think it would like it wouldn’t be – I think with the holiday is like at 8:00 and I was like, hoping to go swing dancing, because I need to get the exercise, too. So I think (inaudible at 39:59)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn’t realize it was that late already. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is. Thursday is rehearsal, but not until late. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There’s plenty of time. And if you go to that coffee shop and focus, it doesn’t have to be a ton of hours. It needs to be a productive, focused time to take some action. And I think if you set yourself up for success by getting out, being focused, not taking yourself out of it. You can do it. So shoot for that both Thursday and Friday to actually have some active product in the direction that you want. Why don’t we wrap up there? I know we have it scheduled for (inaudible at 40:53)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So next week you’re out of town. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next week I’m out of town, and I think we scheduled for the 28th at 2:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me see if I have that on my calendar. I should. It is not on my calendar. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that work for you? Monday, the 28th at 2:30? And then, for May I can do that sort of regular Monday at 2:30 spot every week except for the 26th, which is Memorial Day and I’m out of the office that day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I’ll see you in two weeks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. </p>

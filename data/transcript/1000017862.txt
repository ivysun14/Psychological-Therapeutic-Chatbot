<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't even know where to start today. Maybe from last night. You know I was telling my girlfriend last night 'cause she's becoming pretty close to me and she said something about her father - she found out her father, she thought was her father really wasn't her father. Her sister showed her out of spite. And you know this got me thinking about my father. And I said you know it's very funny 'cause I don't know my father. And she said well that's not that funny if you worked at night and I said no. I don't care if he worked at night or not you know. And then that set off something else so that like not so much last night but this morning I thought of it, see her foster mother, she loved her foster father when she was there. Her foster mother said I don't want you talking to him, I don't want you near him, 'cause she was jealous. And that got me thinking too. One time my mother, I can remember my mother saying, "Leave your father alone." And I don't remember whether it was just because I was making noise in the house or because I wanted to talk to him. But I remember her saying, "He's sleeping, he's got to go to work. So make sure you stay away from Daddy." And I can remember that, that she told me almost the same thing only it probably wasn't out of jealousy but just, you know because he was tired. But I'm thinking that you know like maybe I felt something that my mother was trying to keep me away from my father. And this is why I felt that way towards my mother but you know that might be a little bit about how I feel about my father too, that I really wanted to get to know him and I never had a chance to and I felt like I missed something on there.</p>

<p>And then I can remember when my father had his wake two years go, three years ago. And everybody was - like his cousin who had lived with him when she - or he had lived with her when he was - until he got married, until he was about 40. And like I had never seen her. And I was going on what, 17. I had never seen the woman. I said, "Oh, well you know like I don't remember you ever coming and visit." "Oh, well, we couldn't make it." You know. And then she comes to me after my father's dead and she's half crying on my shoulder. I said to her, " You know like hell with you lady. When he's alive you don't come to see him."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "You don't come to see us. You don't do anything like this. And then when he's dead  - " And then I thought, then I was kind of guilty, I felt kind of guilty at the same time 'cause I hadn't made any effort to get out to see my father either. 'Cause he'd been in Philadelphia and I was on the south side when he went into Philadelphia. And I haven't seen him like in two years. Or just about that long. So I was kind - it was like sort of a mix, my guilt feelings and the feeling like you know like what did you ever do for him or whatever?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now you know like in 30 years - you don't know my father any more. What are you crying about? So I was real calm and conservative - I didn't cry at all. Not at all. I couldn't cry. Until they went to close the casket and they said do you want to say like you know your last whatever? This is why I know I had a feeling for my father so I must have known him more than just not knowing at all. 'Cause I came up and I remember saying, I kept crying, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy." And I started to bawl - I never cried to hard. Just like that it came. It just - out of nowhere. And I kept saying, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy(2:58)." You know. That's what I always called him when I was little. And then I cried again when they were putting him in the ground, or at the funeral. But I didn't cry in between. You know. And that's like, most people if they lose a parent, like they're really shook up and they're crying all through the wake and everything. Nothing. I felt nothing. I didn't - I didn't feel a loss. I went up to the casket before and nothing. It was just like, well there he is. I take that back. I cried at the hospital too, I saw him when he was in a coma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But mostly it was just because he looked so awful and it was just the way he was breathing and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like you cared about him 'cause he was your father exactly, it was just  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really think that - I don't know. Maybe. Because I think I called him "Daddy" then too. But I can remember - I don't' know what I said. I think I said something about I'll never see him again. And that was after he was you know like, that's when they closed the casket. But I really think it was almost half faked at the hospital. 'Cause I could feel it. I could feel like, sometimes I know I'm sort of halfway feeling, halfway acting. And I could catch - I caught myself even then. But you see a lot of times I wouldn't, for a long time, I would play act and think that I would  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't exactly that it was an unreal situation or anything  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like when I was real - when I go to the dream world it's fine. But I would be able to - how can I say it? I would be half acting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like I tend to be very dramatic anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I sort of dramatize things. So - but when they closed that casket I had a real feeling there. And I just - you know it just came, just out of nowhere. Boom. And it hit me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just that he was gone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess maybe it just didn't hit me, the full impact that he was really gone, he's really dead and I'd never see him again until they went to close the casket. And then it hit me, you know my father's dead. And that was like the first time I ever really remember thinking of him like in terms of father. You know like people would ask me, "Are your parents alive?" I'd say, "Yeah. My mother's here and my father's there." But it would be like - and they'd say, "Oh, you're lucky." And I'd look at them and say, "Why? You know I don't have them at home. I got one over here and one over there and you know like I never see them hardly." And I used to always wondered why people would say, "Oh, you're so lucky 'cause you've got both your parents."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'd say, "(laugh) yes I'm so lucky." You know. I never thought that way until you know like I lost him and then I felt like a loss. But it was funny because  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - then after, you know after that initial shock was over that was like it. I don't think I cried afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I had cried when he was going into a coma 'cause I was afraid more for my mother, see? I was afraid how my mother would take it. And my brother and I both went and broke the news and she took it real well 'cause she knew it was the best thing. He had brain cancer. If he would've live he would have been - they say he would have been paralyzed and completely - he already had a little problem mentally. He had had a nervous breakdown when he was younger and he stuttered. I always had a fear of that too. Especially when you know like - they even came back one year [ph] and said, "I think you should take therapy." Because I remember my father had a nervous breakdown, I was scared stiff it was hereditary. Said, "Oh, Jesus  - "</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: " -  that's all I need, I'm headed for a nervous breakdown. I'm going to go crazy." And I know now that it's not hereditary only a tendency because both my parents are very nervous and I picked that up from them (5:54). You know I guess. Unless it's not - unless it's just like environmental. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know too much about biology in that area. But anyway, we were talking too and she said something about my mother must have been very insecure because otherwise I wouldn't be that way, you know from early childhood. And I know that my mother lost her parents when she was three I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She lost of them and she was raised in an orphanage. But evidently she must have had love early because if she didn't she wouldn't have any to give. And if she wouldn't have any to give I would not have any  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I do. And you know at least I'm learning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's important. You do know how to give love.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I know how to give love. I really do. But I think it's been stifled for so long it's still hard. It's still hard to give but it's like, to me giving love is more or less like sharing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like wanting to do something and wanting to be there and wanting to help and wanting to be like a friend, and being open to people. But it's harder than heck to do when you're - you've like covered it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. 'Cause if I remember right when I was a child I was pretty lovable. And then it got to the point where I was up in a shell when I was about nine when I went into the stepparents' home's. Down in Springfield. You know you learn to be a sneak. You learn to get around cause it was a little place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it just got to the point where it was very hard, a very hard person. And it wasn't natural, that's why it was so hard for me. Because  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I guess if I had been raised really young like that - 'cause you know like my mother did have quite a bit of love in her, I think. 'Cause I don't remember, when I was little, I can't remember her being mean or anything. I don't remember her too much, but I don't remember her being uncaring. I don't remember her saying that she loves me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't remember her being uncaring either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like there was food in the house, there was this and - she must have - she must have cuddled me a little bit because otherwise I wouldn't be able to love at all. You know it's hard still. 'Cause like I'm still kind of paranoid of people. I'm afraid somebody's going to turn on me. But it's still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's still there that I feel like I like somebody. I used to have like a - a you know I think I think I told you that I got my  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - this was somebody, you know you're mine, and that type of thing. And I'm not quite so bad anymore. Like with my friends  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I share them more. But it was still the fact that - well maybe it's because I wanted something for me, partly. But partly it was that if I did have a person like this I could give to them. A lot. I mean you know like anything I could do I'd do or anything you know like if they needed me I'd be always there to help and things like this. But now it's sort of gotten a little bit wider, and I can do that with a lot of other people. I couldn't do that before. But it's still hard because, you know like I found out too that I used to do things that are really, like made people - even in the office, like fellas, this girl was telling me when I first started move - started working there, like fellas would say, like one guy said, he was bragging, he said, "Oh, I could have her go with me like that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And even though he was just making himself look bit I realized it must have been something I had done or the way I was acting in some way that I really wanted them to like me. And that's what I did, I did it the wrong way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what came up. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were worried that it was too easy or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like they would - they would think that I was too easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know they had that idea that I was easy or I was wild (9:00). And even my girlfriend said, she said that's why. I probably did. You know my other girlfriend when I told her about it, the one at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing) And you didn't want to be seen as wild.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't want to be seen - no, I didn't want people like - like, okay, some people have affairs in the office. I said okay, fine. But the problem is, is then your reputation goes  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you'll end up - like if I ever had an affair with my boss I know darn well what would happen to my reputation 'cause he'd say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know like to one of the other guys who'd get around. I'd get canned. And you know like right now with the economy the way it is if I get canned it's going to be hard to get another job. So it's just a thing like he's starting to understand how I feel a little bit more. I think. I hope. And he's not - let's see, he's not so demonstrative as he used to be. 'Cause I came right out and told him, "Please don't be - you know you're hurting my reputation."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I still have - let's see, how can I say it? Like I met his son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I could see it starting to well up in me again. You know like 'cause his son is really a sharp guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About 30 and he's a doctor. And he walks in and he's all like this, and he's about 6'6", or about 6'2" or so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I could feel when he walked in and I said hi to him and everything, I could just feel myself melting and I said, "Oh, no you're not! Oh no you're not!" (laughing) You know? And it was very hard to put up that, you know that baloney that you have to put with a fellow like, "Oh, yes sir." And you know the  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you're like boy, you're sharp. But  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you held back there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I held back, yeah. But I still had the feeling like I almost wanted to - almost giggle or something 'cause I felt like a little kid again. This guy was so sharp and so masculine. And I just sat there and went (laughing). But - how can I say? I guess it's sort of like an - almost an immaturity with emotion that I never really learned how to handle in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. That might be it because maybe I never had a man around enough to understand the difference. See I was treating men like when I was a little girl I had boyfriends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Always. Never girlfriends. I always played with little boys. But at that time you could be honest with a fella.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You didn't have to play these coy little games you've got to play now. And it's very hard for me to do especially when I like somebody. You know like, oh, I'd be like a puppy dog, a big lap dog.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know going on. But that's just it, I used to let like fellows walk on me just because I wanted them to like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'd do almost anything, you know like oh, please like me. You know please like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it comes back to my father. It's got to. It has to go back to my father because you know like who's the first man in my life? It's got to be my father. Why would I have to do headstands for fellows unless it was because I - you know I wanted like my father just to notice me at all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or to get near him. Now I know part of it is my mother. And I - 'cause I wouldn't remember that otherwise. You know like I'm saying, "Don't - don't - get away from Daddy. Leave him alone. Leave Daddy alone."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you - maybe you just needed some friends, some companionship. Someone to be with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That could be too. But see like when I was little I did have friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But they were all boys (12:00). I never had girls. This is one of the reasons I never learned to act like a girl, because there weren't any girls in the neighborhood, I hung around with boys. But I don't - I don't think that's all. I think part of it's my brother because I was jealous. There must have been something there. 'Cause otherwise, like now I look back and I say, I take judo. I guess you might call that being a tomgirl  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - or a tomboy. But - and I can feel it. Like I can almost imagine an attacker. 'Cause this is what Chang will say, our teacher. He'll say that. And I can almost imagine an attacker there. And I can really like when I punch  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - his assistant is who's with me anyways, always goes, well he goes like this and he's a third degree black belt, he goes, "Oh, I'm scared of her." But  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that's only because I like to be the best I can be at anything I'm going into, and that's all. I want the best form, I want the best you know - to make it more authentic what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And I guess that's the way I've always been. Again that's the thing I try to be trained, try to be best in everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is ridiculous. But that's the way it is. But you know it's got to be something, I know it has to be something to do with my father too because if I hadn't known him how could I have any kind of emotion for him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know you can't, you can't love somebody you don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know so there has to be something there when I was little that was said or done or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm having trouble understanding kind of what the point of what you're saying is. Like how is that for you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it still - it affects my relationship with men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Still. I mean I can  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how do you feel about it now? Like is it like there - something went wrong with you a long time ago?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now has to be fixed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that's the problem. When I was little it started. It probably built after I was older. But it started when I was a little kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like that first rejection of some kind from my father. And then my mother helping along by not you know wanting me near Daddy and things like this. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But right now you're feeling like, what? There's something wrong or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think that that's the thing that started me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something when I was younger started me in this insecurity with men. You know. And then this is why I got such a problem. This is why - I'm like a tigress when I'm with a couple of other girls. I like to be center and this is one reason too that my girlfriend and I, as close as we are don't get along. Because she likes to be center too. See she had an insecurity with her father too and she knew it. She went to therapy, she found out what it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she still likes - and she says, she admits that she still gets jealous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and she likes to be - she likes to have the best fella if not all the fellas talking to her or you know falling all over her. And I like at least a couple fellas. I don't care if I have all of them. I don't have that - I'm not quite that ambitious. I wouldn't mind just having one or two or at least the one I like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I wouldn't care about the rest. So if the rest of them don't even talk to me, who cares? I don't care. You know. But  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you do want to be the center there like you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like - yeah. I do like to be like the center of attention. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to go into acting. I was in a workshop for awhile. And I was thinking of going into acting. And I thought oh, well. It was fun but too many of the people really were (laughing) kind of really batty (15:03). Not kind of batty, they're really batty, some of the people in theater. But at any rate, you know like I stopped that. And now I would - I've always wanted to be I've always wanted to be a singer though. Ever since I've been a kid. Because I always liked to sing. It was  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was the first thing. I just liked to sing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I also like to make people happy. And I like to - sometimes - see what I would like to do if I ever went into it would be like a folk song type thing. And that would be like getting people to think at the same time either - in folk song and with inside - in between it would be like jokes and things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But all things that were relevant to you know like what's going on  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and trying to get people to think about them 'cause people just sit and they go uh-huh, isn't that nice? And nobody reacts to anything. But this is one thing I got from that. But see you know the problem with the men though is that I just feel like there's something wrong with me if somebody I kind of dig doesn't like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's one thing. You know  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There must be something wrong with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like yeah, there's something wrong with me because the people I really dig don't like me. And yet I can see why - well first of all sometimes - you know like it's hard for me to come to the conclusion that everybody can't like you no matter how nice you are  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - no matter you know, whatever you do there's going to be some people that just don't like you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's hard to believe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's hard to accept. You know, you know it logically when you sit down you say yes, logically I know this is right. And then you get to like a fella and he goes, and you go aaaahhhh, something's wrong with me! You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's really discouraging.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's very discouraging. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're kind of beaten down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you can't even try anymore, aren't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It came to that for awhile. For awhile when I was still Catholic and that I can remember that. And this was before I really knew there was something really badly wrong. I can remember thinking to myself well, if I die tomorrow, so what? I went to confession, I'll go to heaven. Who cares? You know like this place is so ridiculous, I said to myself, my life isn't anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not worth anything, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not doing anything. So what the hell's the difference if I'm here or if I'm someplace else, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I think about it now I mean all right, so we know death is inevitable, there's no way of getting around it. But like I don't want to die now, I wouldn't want to die. If somebody said would you take your choice of not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow, you know to you whatever's going to happen or die? And I'd say I'd rather find out what's going to, you know, whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like now - now I've got something sort of to live for. Like I've got a couple of ambitions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think once I get rid of this hang-up with men or at least I can somehow work around it, you know, it won't be half bad either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know it's a lonely feeling 'cause like I don't have any - I have - well, I shouldn't say I don't have any boyfriends. I've got a couple of them. But they're - one's my boss and the other one's another boss that I'm working part time for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're both in bad situations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's just, it's just no good. It's not going to work. Either way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's lonely because you don't have anybody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't have anybody that - first of all I don't really care about those two (17:58). I really don't. I mean they're nice, I'd care if they - I shouldn't say I don't care about them. I care about them as people. I'd care if they got hurt or something like that. But as far as loving them  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - forget it. I just you know, the one I feel sort of like a father about and the other one is, well, he's too small-minded in some ways. He thinks he's very liberal minded but, you know I talked to him for awhile and I says, oh, you're liberal minded, huh? But well he is in certain areas. But you know generally speaking it's almost like a front, like he's defending that he's still young and everything. And he's only 36, he doesn't have to defend it, he is young! But he doesn't believe it. But it's, you know, it's just a bad situation 'cause they're both married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's like - well partially I think it's a bad situation for me because I know there's no future in it. Neither one of them would leave their wives. They just want something on the side. So again what am I? Second best. You know? And so like I don't care. I don't care about them. I say okay, you take me to nice places  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you do this and you do that. Okay. Fine. I'll go with you. But don't expect anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't expect me to feel you know like feel any kind of real caring for you because I'm only second best to you, you think you're going to be first best with me? You're crazy. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I came - at least I got to that point. Before I used to be Jesus, you know, somebody be nice to me and wow. And then I'd find out they were married, it would crush me because I would say it was because, you know, like, oh I don't believe in doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's wrong. But it wasn't that. It was because I felt again, here I am second best. He's got a wife at home. He goes home to her every night. He takes me out maybe two or three times a week and that's it. You know, okay, so he takes me to a nice place. So what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's not really with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. He's not with me. He goes home to his wife. I go home you know to my roommate or I go home by myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know to myself. I think that that's very funny 'cause I just correlated that with some fella I went with and I couldn't figure out why it bugged me so much. Until now. You know like why it really bothered me that I knew he was married and I was going out with him. And that's probably why. 'Cause I felt that way about him too. But you know it's sort of a rotten feeling when you're - you feel like you've always been like that with men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You either get married men that like you and you know darn well you're never going to get them. You know. Or you get these - you get these goofy kids like this one fella I've been dating from the office. And he's nice. But Jesus immature. Unbelievable. He's 25 and I thought he was 19 after I talked to him for a couple hours - he's smart, he's been through college, he's been all over the world. And yet he's - he never learned anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably 'cause he sat on the outside and he just kept watching. He never did anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I used to do that. I didn't learn anything when you just sat and watched. And finally I got to the point where I said, this is ridiculous. You're not going to - you're not going to really learn until you get in and do something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About it. You know you watch TV and you say gee, I wish I was an actress, I wish I was this, I wish I did that. You get out and you do it and then you find out whether this is what's really great or you know like what really is and not this baloney that you present for yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's really funny but there's so many people now that - see I can't get over, now I'm getting to the point where I've got a little bit of self worth about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like people who have had all this other stuff and I say Jesus, I wish I had. Wow I wish I'd been to Europe already. Wish I'd been through college already. I wish I had. And I look at this guy and, what has he done with it? All this stuff that, you know, that he's had and he's never done anything with it (21:01). So you know it's - it's really kind of  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: But at least you've used what you've got.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. It's kind of consoling to figure Jesus, I've got nothing that this guy's got and yet emotionally, I'm a heck of a lot more mature than he is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he says he doesn't believe that there's any kind of a logical relationship. I said, you're crazy. He says, you're too logical. You should be doing this and that and the other thing. You should be emotional.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said baloney with emotion, it got me in trouble before you know. I'll let the emotion come after the logic is there. But see that's hard to explain too. Now I'm getting to that point I can do that. It's weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, the logic come first?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Figure out. As you're putting the fours [ph] at me again. Is this guy good to me, is this and that? Not just - like it used to be like an infatuation with me  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Sense of logic - </p>

<p>PATIENT: - that would last for ages.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're sitting back and you're thinking about it a little instead of just  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, just swooping in and saying oh, I'm madly in love.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Just 'cause anybody at all would pay attention to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what you were getting out of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or somebody was really gorgeous. And I was like oh, wow. Like my boss' son. I think he's gorgeous. But - although I know his father would never let him go out with me  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - because his father likes me. But say he asked me out, I wouldn't - I probably wouldn't go out with him. At least until he asked me out four or five times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he's the type that like girls go, aahh. And they fall for him. And I won't do that anymore. And it took, oh jeez, it took me so long to learn. And oh Christ. But see the problem is, is I still would like to do that. I'd love to go out with this guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd just love to do this. And I know I can't. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because....then he would be one of those people who wouldn't care enough about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. Probably. Because you know like most fellas are like that and I'm learning it finally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you know like you can't - you can't do it. But you really want to. You know it's like - it's like saying oh, I'm busy, and I'm not busy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and it's - I guess that's a big game that almost everybody has to play. And it's hard for you know, probably almost everybody to get to that point where they can do it all girls. But first of all I think that's a big farce and I don't know why fellas are so ridiculous. I mean that's again probably because I don't know fellas that well. I just didn't - I just didn't have fellas around me that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Little boys? Yeah. I had a foster father I couldn't communicate with too much. I loved him, which is funny. But I couldn't communicate with him that much. And  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The stepparents'home, forget it. My step-father had a mind like a peanut. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it was - he wasn't dumb.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that like he was 70-some years old and he still thought like when he was 20. You know. And I just, you know, like I didn't get real close to him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The mother I got a little bit close to and then she comes out with that baloney like, well I - you know where you're going, I'm worried about the other one. But let's see. And it's just like, I can't understand really why I don't understand men that well. Because I did have men around me. But some girls  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you never really had anybody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right. They were there but they weren't there. I can't remember - like she was telling me last night, my girlfriend, and this got me thinking. She said you know, my step-father never had - who had used to talk to me until my step-mother said that and then we hadn't had a conversation in almost three or four years (24:00). And I said to myself, do you remember even your step-father sitting down and talking to you? Or taking you anywhere, or doing anything? Just with you? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. The boys sometimes, yes. He'd sit down and talk to the boys, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was always with the mother, never with the father. And I used to care about him too. That's why it hurt so much when he started to cry one day. 'Cause I was a bitch. Boy, I was a terrible kid. So was - well, so was - there was a problem there 'cause she was going through change of life too. So we were both on each others' nerves like anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you just didn't get anything there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then - yeah, and then like right before I went to leave, I still cared about him 'cause I know when he started to cry. And I'd never seen a man cry I don't think before that. And I started to cry. And he said, if you ever hurt her again. You know, like again. You know like, sorry kids. You know? (chuckling) If you ever hurt her again, I forgot what he said, he would kill me or you know, something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, almost like you'd say to - you wouldn't say that to a daughter, first of all. You might say that to somebody who's like a boarder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? Like well, you're here today, you're gone tomorrow. You know, who cares?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were his daughter and he said that!</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was his daughter. I was his daughter and he said that. You know like, I don't care. My wife is important but you're not. And you know like when I think back now  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When I think back now I say, you know like, what can you expect? He didn't get me 'til I was nine years old. You know? But it still hurt. You're sitting there, you're thinking, you know like - and I can just see him saying that. You know like, you hurt my wife. You hurt her. You ever hurt her again - he just stood there here, I was a little kid, and he was sitting there. I think it was over some stupid thing like I swiped a cookie from downstairs that she had packed away for Christmas or something. And I went down - I was down there ironing or something. And I swiped a cookie. And I - I used to be scared stiff of this woman. 'Cause you like, she'd come in, what are you doing?! Ah! You know and the first thing you do is, being that age too, you're in the lying stage, you go, nothing! What are you doing wrong? Nothing! You know - nothing, nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't hit me!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, don't hit me! And she would, of course. But then she got real upset. Because it really hurt her. She just didn't know, you know. She just didn't know how to treat a girl my age and that. She'd had two daughters before. The one daughter, the older daughter, is now - well, she's 30-something. 'Course her mother thinks it's terrible, she's wearing miniskirts and [indiscernible] - yeah, Gertrude! Give it to 'em. You know but not so much of spite, but you're just like go on. Have your fun. You never had it when you were young. You were the one that used to have to watch Gillian who was only a year younger. You were the one that had to do a lot of work like I had to do. Go out an have your fun now. You've got a husband who makes good money and that. Go out and have fun. And - 'cause even when I remember when she was like about 25 and she had three or four kids she was very, she was very round shouldered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which usually is a sign of ill confidence too, you know, when you're like this all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And a beautiful girl. I mean she was a lot prettier than Gillian. I mean Gillian was nice and everything and Gertrude I didn't like at first. Because she was like this, she was very quiet and very defensive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's because she was the older one that had to do all the work. And the same thing as I had. And it just got to the point where, like, I felt like that's all I'm here for (27:03). Like there was no love. Just - just there doing the work for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. More like a maid than  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Than - than living there. And it really gets you. But now, like I'll probably go see her over Christmas. And we'll sit and we'll talk. Because she's very much like my own mother. Very much like my mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there was a lot of hurt then and maybe now you're beginning to try to explain it or think of why it could happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I remember when I left there the only thing I would say about my step-mother is I hate her. I said I hate her. I hate that woman. I just hate her. And I wouldn't say anything more. People would ask me you know, like about my other life and I don't remember sitting down and really having a discussion about it. I might say that you know she made me work all the time and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But nothing like on the detail.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - you know I said I can't stand that woman. I hate her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So once you were all caught in the hurt and the hate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then after awhile like when my father died she asked me to come up there. You know not to stay but to come up and see her. And when I did I asked her if I could call her ma again and I started to cry when I saw her. Because I realized there's still had been some care there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she really did care for me. She really did. But she just didn't know how to show it. She really didn't know how to show it to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So as a child you couldn't understand that but now you can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I can understand that she cared. The only thing I can't understand - well like my step-father kind of redeemed me a little bit when he dropped me off. I had gone up to see them afterwards. And I think it was a little bit spite, I don't care what, you know like now I can - I admit, it probably was a little spite. They're very staunch Catholics. So I came up with, I am now no longer - they said, you want to go to church? I said, no, I'm no longer a practicing Catholic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact I'm not a Catholic, I'm looking into Kabbalah. And I thought sure they'd blow - you know, blow their tops. In fact, I think maybe in a way I kind of wanted them to like with my mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think in a way I wanted them to say something. Not that I would go back to the church. But it would just be like saying you know I really don't want you to do that because in our belief, you know if you're a Catholic, you're always a Catholic and if you're not you're going to go to hell. I went through this before with my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyway. Then I felt kind of hurt, you know, 'cause they didn't say anything. But what they were doing is saying you know, like well you live your own life. You know like I'm not going to try to stop you, you're a grown woman now. But like the next morning my step-father dropped me off at the train. And he said, you know, even - no matter what you said, even what you said the other night, you know, he said, don't worry. He said - well he didn't say I don't care but he said, I'll still be your father no matter what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And then that made me feel good. It almost, for awhile, it actually made me feel like I really had somebody there like a father who cared. But I don't know. I just never followed it up. Maybe I should have and gotten back and gone to see them more. And I could at least feel like I had somebody there who was like a father to me. But he was - I guess I might say he was probably the only man I can remember loving as a father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause I still, you know like I still like him as a father. I can still remember him and I can remember sometimes like, the way he laughs. I can remember that. Sometimes I think about it and I can see his face when he's laughing. But you know like my own father, uh-uh. I can't remember anything. I can remember him stuttering something, someday. I think that was the day when he got the wrong candy. And that's it. Like, that's my father, you know, great composite (30:13). It's all I can remember of him. And it's just - it's just a weird, weird thing for me that I can't - I can't place my own father! It's like, you know it's like he's a stranger to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a person who should have been so important to you just is nowhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. Yeah. He's like nothing in my life. And this man who's only in my life for three years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And all right, so I was a little bit older. I was nine to twelve. I can remember a lot of things about him. I can remember like the way he walks, I can remember - you know like things like this about him. I don't remember that about my own father. Not even just his looks that much. Well I can remember his face pretty well when he was younger. But you know that's a weird thing with your own father. And I was not that young, I was eight years old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some people remember all the way back to three and I can, to about four or five. To you know like things that have happened. But just little incidents. And my mother was always involved, never my father. And that's, you know, that's something like - do you know when my mother told that story too, I don't remember her ever saying my father was in it, the one with my brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My brother running down. I don't remember her ever saying my father was in that. 'Cause he had gone along with her. I wonder if that's what partially hit me. I wonder where Daddy was, why Daddy didn't come along. Daddy and me, both of us got left out, son of a gun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But right now for you it's like you didn't get something you should've had.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. With my father. And yet I know there's a lot more than I'm remembering. Because I mean Jesus, I didn't have any talks with my own stepfather either but I can remember him being there. I can remember him coming home for dinner, I can remember - you know like my father had to be there some time! I mean he can't work seven days a week, I mean I don't think it was even allowed in those days to work seven days a week every week. He had to be home sometimes. And I know - I know he prob - I know he left for work before I got home from school during the wintertime. But what about the summertime?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Summertime I didn't go to school. I was home all day long. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like you'd really want to find out if he was there for you? Like it's really important to know that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It is. Because I think that's where all this hurt started. I think it started with my own father. I don't' think it was as late as my foster father. I think when my stepfather rejected me it was just sort of a - well sort of like a repeat action. You know it was like you cared and again, this man is not yours. You know. But I think I used him, my stepfather, more or less, because you know like I felt like if he died, I'd probably do the same thing as with my own father. But you know I did feel something there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did feel a real hurt. It was almost like that time when my stepfather said you know like, my wife this and that and the other thing (32:59). When they closed that coffin  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was a feeling like, you know, like you've really lost him this time. You'll never get him back. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess when you're a little kid and you lose something, you know and he's still alive, he's still - at least he's living. There was always a chance you'll get him back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But once he's dead there's no getting him back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you could never have him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it was like, like maybe I wanted to win him when I was a kid and I couldn't do it. But, maybe I thought maybe, I don't know, maybe I thought maybe when I was older maybe he paid more attention to my mother than me and I thought maybe when I was older he'd love me. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you just didn't have him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I never had him. I never felt like I had my father. It's funny. 'Cause I can remember even when people asked me about my parents, I'd tell them about my mother and they'd say what about your father? I said well he lives out in Springfield.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it. That's my father. He lives out in Springfield. And what? You know. Oh, I think he works at the railroad. Oh, what does he do? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like everybody else had a father and you didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And they'd be making, you know, like passing notes, like oh, my father does this, my father does that. What does your father do? Well, I don't know. I'll ask my mother, maybe she can tell me. But  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No one who belonged to you sort of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess - yeah because I think maybe most of my friends, well not Jodie 'cause her mother and father I guess got divorced or something or he died, her first father. Like she really didn't have a father either. Like I told, her second father came along. Her second father was real nice to her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then he died. And this was when everything started welling up because after he died there was nobody there to really love her. And she said he used to be so sweet to her. Even when she was a teenager he still used to tell her to come over and sit in his lap and talk to him if he was - you know if she was depressed or something. Come on, you come over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I never had a father to do that to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Never. It was just the type of thing like my father was just, I guess he was just there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. It was like  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And there was no cuddling, no, you know  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No warmth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at all. There was no warm loving. Not - I guess maybe my mother might have said things like, like if I asked her she probably said things like, well Daddy's working for money. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know for you and I and then Ed to keep everything together. And that  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that - that's real for you now too. I mean like there's no one for you now and there never has been. It seems.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. I think it's like that. At least with fellas. I don't feel like there's ever going to be somebody who's going to be special. Because I'll be too afraid if there is somebody who likes me a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I might like him a lot. I'd be too afraid to get into any kind of a relationship because  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you might lose him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And if I lost him I don't know what I'd do. You know I see all these people getting divorced and everything. And I think I'm chicken, I really think I'd be afraid that if I lost that fella I wouldn't be able to - you know I don't know if I'd be able to function.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's - it's a weird thing like, like I - right now I'm real brave. Like I say oh, Jodie's going away too. As a girlfriend, you know, because she's like the closest girlfriend I've ever had in my whole life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if somebody goes away that's really a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like if she leaves, I mean just thinking that, she's leaving, and Eliza my next best girlfriend. And she's leaving. They're both going together (36:01). And they're going to be gone for a year and a half.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think to myself, okay, I like Charlotte. Charlotte and I get along well together. And I like this other girl. And we get along pretty well together. But it's not the same. It's not like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like Jodie and I are almost like sisters. It's like the sister I never had. And my - well I do have a stepsister who's pretty close to me. But I can't talk to her. I mean it's not - it's a thing like I know she cares about me, like she wants me to come out there for Christmas and that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what are you going to do? They're going to go away  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: They're going to go away and I know. Yeah. I know I've got to stand on my own two feet now. And it's harder than hell because I've always been looking for somebody and really what I should be looking for is - is you know like all right, I know I have to find this hurt that, that's why I'm always looking for somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But after that I know I've got to get to the point that - that I've got to feel that even if nobody else cares a great deal about me  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll still have me. And that's enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you can't, like you know, if there's nobody else around, so what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There'll be other people coming into your life. There'll be, you know like there's things you can do for other people and you don't need somebody that's just - just yours. In other words I wouldn't need to get married if I didn't  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There will always be new people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know find somebody who I could live with. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you can count on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, almost like, I want somebody I can sort of count on but I don't want to be as dependent again as I have been. I don't want to be dependent. I want to be independent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to feel like - not selfish, not like I'm in myself and I don't care about anybody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the thing that I can give -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: To somebody. I want to get to this point that I can give to somebody and not - and feel like if they just took that giving and threw it out the window, I wouldn't feel so hurt like there's something wrong with me. Like I feel rejected or like I won't do it again 'cause I'm afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to be able to do this just because this person needs help so I'm going to help them. If they really need it and my giving whatever help I can give would help them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and they might improve.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or they might use it and start shaping up to their capabilities. But I don't want to feel - like with teaching or something like this, I don't want to feel like if they don't reciprocate it, they don't give it back to me, that I'm doing to feel real hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is why, the way I feel with fellas. I get to like a fella, if he doesn't like me back, boom. I feel real hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to be so sensitive to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I know that that's probably where it came from because of a rejection of some kind from my father. And then my stepfather complicated matters and then I go to another home and the stepfather's like, I mean he's not my father. I never thought of the other fella as my father. Never. Not even to this day. A grandpa maybe, nice. You know, 'cause he's like 70-some years old first of all. And I mean fine, for a grandpa, for sort of like a long distance type thing. Somebody who's  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - but not as a father. See Mr. Foley too, the first when I was at - where I was at, he was closer to my father's age. I guess my father was about, well, he's about maybe 10 years younger than my father, eight years younger. But he was closer to my father's age. My father died when he was about 65 years, he was a lot older than my mother. About 12 years. But you know it's just - I can't understand it (38:59). And another thing is like with my brother. You know what he did to me Sunday? I could've killed him, I was so mad. Partially for me and partially - well mostly for me. 'Cause I'm, all right, I'm hurt about it. He didn't call me or anything. He was supposed to come over to our house at 11. So Jodie said well, can we wait 'til 11:30 'cause we were going to see my mother and then we were going to an antique show 'cause I wanted her to meet, and my mother to meet this priest who's Anglican. But he's very nice and he's pretty sharp up here and he's very, he's very much in with the groove. And he's like 50-some years old but he's like in with the young people and he's trying to really put religion where it belongs. But anyway I tried to call him at 10:30, he wasn't home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tried to call him at 11:00, he wasn't home. Tried to call him 'til 12:00, so we finally went to a judo match and then I went down by my sister's. 'Cause I couldn't get out to the hospital. Not on a Sunday, you can't get out there on the trains. So anyway, I'm thinking to myself, you know before I left, first of all I'm just irritated 'cause he wasn't there. And it was - it was like it was hurting me and I knew it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause I said, here he is, the big lug, he's my brother, he finally says yeah, we'll go out to see ma, I want to meet your girlfriend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything is planned, my sister's counting us at a certain time. I mean we were going to stop over for the judo meet for a little while because my teacher wanted us to stop, my girlfriend and I. And I wanted him to see it. I wanted my brother to see a little bit of the judo matches. And I said we've got this whole day planned and then that bastard doesn't show up again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And it's like saying - and I don't care. My girlfriend said he forgot. I said yeah, he forgot. Bull. You know I don't forget things when other people are involved that I care about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah he shouldn't forget you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's what he was doing. And that's what I realized he was doing. It wasn't even the plans that were all made that bugged me. I said that's what it was. I said oh, the plans and I said, you know I wanted you to meet my mother and all this. She said well don't worry we can go out to meet your mother some other week. But that wasn't it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like saying Jane, I don't give a damn about you. You know we made all these plans, I said yes. I called him like Wednesday and said are you sure you're going to come out Sunday? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming out Sunday. He lives eight blocks from my house. You know he's got a car, everything. And there's no reason, there's no excuse for him to forget me. Not like that. Not when you've got plans made for the whole day. And he just goes, you know, nothing. So I haven't called him yet. I was going to call him and I was going to ask him, you know like let's make new plans. I haven't been able to call him. I just can't. I'll forget about him. You know but you know what forgetting is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I say yeah I'll call him later. And then later doesn't come. And it's just because, I think I'm waiting for him to call me and tell me what's going on because  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - if he's like me he remembers - sometimes I'll forget things. But not usually when people are involved that I care about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I do forget something, even with just an acquaintance or something I've forgotten to do, like bills I'm terrible with. You know, I'll get that out. If I have to call or if I have to write a little note of explanation, I'll do it. You know but I don't expect other people to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just - I was just so mad at him. Oh was I mad Sunday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like he really hurt your feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the only thing that's made me feel good at all is because I had told my instructor in the gym that I wasn't going to come so he was kind of snotty to me (42:03). And I felt hurt. So I walked in with my girlfriend and he said, oh, hi! To both of us. And she's his favorite. I mean he likes her as a girlfriend, the whole bit. And he took one of us by one arm, one of us by the other and he said, now listen, the class over here, you know. And I felt good because here somebody at least - and this fella who I don't really care about. I don't care if he likes me or not really it's just the idea that at that time I was so darned depressed, and that somebody who I admired at least, if not liked, came up and said hi, I'm glad you could make it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and here I was, gee, somebody cares I'm around. Son of a gun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's like somebody - but you know it makes you so mad because somebody you care about and somebody who's supposed to care about you doesn't give a shit like if you live or die. I mean really. He doesn't call me. I have to call him all the time. He's got my phone number.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's come over a couple of times like during the summertime, when I wasn't there. And instead of calling. You know that's my big brother for you. He comes popping in, Sunday's our only day to go to the beach. And we used to go to the beach every Sunday. And he'd come popping in without calling and he'd wonder why I wasn't home. But anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you really deserved that. I mean he's your brother and since he's your brother you ought to get something from that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think so. I think - no I don't think I even - you know in a lot of ways I think I'm selfish. But in that way I don't think it's being selfish. I think that's being you know, like it's showing care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To at least call me. I mean you know like it's not a toll call. He can call and say, can I come on, can I come over? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you want to go out to see Mom? Yeah, okay, we went out to see her once together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just like why? You know like why doesn't he - you know again it's like saying, like there's something wrong with me because he doesn't want to call me. You know like what's wrong with me? I haven't done anything to him. I'm not a wild, you know, running around woman or anything that he might be ashamed of in his old guy rights. It's just you know like what's the big deal? Why can't he be like a brother to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's my own flesh and blood. I care about him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I send him cards at Christmas. I send him gifts at Christmas. You know and his birthday come to think of it is coming up. It's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's got something real special.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And he doesn't remember. It's like - it's like I'm there but I'm not there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that like to him I'm nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's my brother. He's the only man that's still alive in my family. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And he's somebody I've always looked up to even when I was a little kid. He was my big brother. You know, he could do no wrong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Big protector. But he wasn't there anymore. He doesn't give a darn. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't count on him either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not at all. It's just, you know, all right I know I'm a woman and I shouldn't have to count on my brother. But I mean I don't mean I have to run to him all the time. I don't mean that he's got to be there all the time. All I mean is, you know like, I'd like him to call me once in awhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, say hi, how you doing? You know, what are you into now? Even if it was every couple of month, I wouldn't care. And he's got the car. I don't have a car.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't go running over to his house. Sure, it's only eight blocks away but he's in a kind of bad neighborhood where he's at (45:00). And I'm not going to go walking over there some night and say hi, how you doing, Ed? And I don't think - well first of all he's the fella and the fella should be more aggressive, not the girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if I am his sister. I shouldn't have to be aggressive with my brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He should come to you somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. At least call me. I mean you know like I hate taking the aggressive role even in - even as a brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even to my brother. I just feel like I shouldn't have to call him all the time. I mean once in awhile okay, he is my brother. He's an exception. I can call him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at least he should reciprocate and call me half the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like - it's like I make all the advances and he just, you know like he'll come so far.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's as far as he goes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like he wouldn't put himself out for me for nothing or nobody. And yet that other little foster girl, he gets her something for Christmas all the time. He's always treating her - of course she's younger. Okay. So she's a child, I'm not. But - but it's still like I see my girlfriend and her brother, the way they get along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and it's things like who - like they'll make excuses to go out and get a tube for the TV one time. Like and I think it was on Thanksgiving. And it was freezing out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like about 20 degrees that day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they went out and they were gone for oh, they must've been gone for close to an hour. They were walking because they wanted to talk. You know he had his wife over. He was even married. My brother's not even married. There's no - there's no reason for like there to be jealousy or anything like this you know, with another woman. And it's just you know like they'll do this, they'll go out and talk for an hour. She got on the phone to him, talked for an hour. He'll get on the phone to her and talk for an hour. But never my brother. My brother doesn't do that. He's just like, you know like he really couldn't be bothered. You know. Why bother with it? And that's what I think really hurts me. 'Cause like for awhile when I was in that one foster home he - he sort of almost hated me. I could see it. Like because I was hurting the stepmother and he liked her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he was very close to the stepmother's son.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - you know like one of the sons. And the sons were getting mad at me. She had like four sons. And I was madly in love with the one when I was about nine years old. It was so funny. But it was just the idea that, you know like he turned on me then. But at least it was like, it was like a hate at least. But you know even then I realized that it was more anger you know than anything else. And even though he was saying more than something about her I think even then I realized that partially it was because he cared about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know in some way, shape or form he did still care. But now it's like there's not even anger. There's just nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like, you know, it's like that's the worst feeling in the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd rather have my brother hate me than not even you know  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - notice that I'm there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like we'll get into fights about Kent State and things like this. And I think I bring that up just, you know, just as a subject to get him to react some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To say, yes, you're not just talking to somebody and telling them about your chef school or your - not chef school but like, you know what he does as a chef and all this. And I go yes Ed, yes Ed, yes Ed. That's like me sitting down and talking about running for two hours.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, who's interested unless you take exercise seriously or if you're interested in exercise or self defense or something like a discipline for the body or something (48:07)? You're not going to be interested in it. So why bring it up? You know like maybe bring in an anecdote that happened. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've done this a lot. Like anecdote, like the one teacher's funny as heck. But like this is just like he's telling me what he does all during the day and all this. I said okay, yeah, mmm hmm. So I went along and made it believe like it was very interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like he just wants an ear, he doesn't care about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Not like a sister but just like - right, like you said, just like somebody like - like I don't know what you'd even call it. I wouldn't think that a fella would do that with a girlfriend. I don't even think he'd do it with a friend. I don't know who you'd do it with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like somebody, just anybody who'd listen. You just talk like that because there's nothing in it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no substance to it. I don't care what you do. You do one thing all day long that's drab and I do another thing all day long that's drab. I wouldn't want to talk about my secretarial job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean there's not much to talk about. And it's just and that's about like all until I could get into something where I knew he'd disagree with me. Because then he'd at least be - he'd be there and he'd be with it and he'd be listening to me. And I'd be listening to him and we could  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you know like go back and forth and there'd be some kind of an interaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like real contact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 'Cause otherwise it's like, you know it's like that. It's like I'm sitting there and he could be talking to the wall for all he cared. I think half the time he is. But you know like I'd come out with things like afterwards, after I talked to him, I'd come over to Jodie and I'd say oh, Jesus he's got such a small mind. And I really hate it. Because you know partially because I see things and I think we went through this before that I'd like him to see my point in a way. Pardon me. But in a way it just bugs me. It just bugs me period that he's got such a small mind and he's my brother. You know because part of it's this: I used to look up to my brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost like he was a god.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean he could do no wrong. He was - he was always twice as big as he was. He was always you know like the big protector, the big thing with me. He always was. You know I can remember somebody hurting me, he went after him on by boy, and gave him hell. But it was - and then I didn't know this but my mother said he used to give me gifts all the time. Every time he got money he'd get me candy, he'd get me this, he'd get me that. Everything was for me. I don't remember that. But she says he did that. So I'm wondering if he's not that guy in the dream. That's what I'm wondering you know about my brother. 'Cause he was always you know (noise). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like how big can an eleven year old kid be? He can't be wide. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me he was. To me he was a Steve Reeves. And it was just that you know being so strong and always looking up to him, and I don't remember ever, if I can remember if I thought he was smart too or not. But it was just that he was so great. He was you know like a big, great god. That's what he was. My big brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. And then to find out that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then all of a sudden he's toppled. You know? He just isn't that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean he's still big and strong and he'd a heck of a lot bigger than I am. And yeah, he does have broad shoulders now. He's about 6'3" and about 195 pounds. But he's just - I guess part of it's the illusion just sort of wore off (51:00). And it's just like, wow. He's not like what I thought he was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's not as great as I thought he was. And maybe my - maybe that's part of the reason I get like infatuated too and then it sort of wears off and I realize, oh Jesus. You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you build people up and then find out what they're really like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like - it's like a very romantic thing. Like when I saw Ben. You know, by boss' son. And it's the first thing I though, wow! You know you look up and you look from shoulder to shoulder and you think wow, what a man! And he's a lawyer so he's got to be halfway smart. And  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you think gee, but it's like an illusion because when you start talking to him, now I can even see, when I start talking to him, he was almost afraid of me! It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life. Here's this big, gorgeous hunk of man but because I was very you know, he was you know like what do I say to her? What do I do? It was the funniest thing I ever saw in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing) So you were kind of putting on an act and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was putting on an act and he was falling for it like I was some kind of a queen sitting there. You know it was so funny! But then I realized to myself you know like a lot of these guys are, they're just surface.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're real sharp. But you've got to get down to the real nitty gritty of it and then you find out it's not, you know, but that's very hard for me to do sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of times I see somebody who in my estimation is very attractive, and forget it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know again it's like, but sometimes it doesn't even take that. If there's a lot of girls around and only one fella, it doesn't take that. 'Cause he's a fella. And any fella if there's just one fella and there's a lot of girls, I've got to be the girl to walk out with the fella. Or I feel hurt. And it's stupid. Completely and utterly ridiculous but, you know, I do it. And I know I do it. And I think part of that came back from my brother too. I think part of it - I think a big part of it's my brother. Losing him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's even worse I think losing him because he was right there with me when I felt like I lost him. He was right in the same house with me. And I just felt like I didn't know him anymore. He started changing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [indiscernible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When I was at like Foley's he started changing in those three years. And when I left them, in fact I don't think I saw my brother for quite a few years. And this is why, this other little girl had time to move in as my, as me. Because I wasn't there. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you really lost a lot when you were little. I mean...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels, I feel that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kept going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like it was like - yeah, it was just like a circle. It wasn't just one thing with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure it's not. But I do think it came back, it started with my father and it built on my stepfather, it built on my brother, it built on the way I felt about my mother. And she kept telling me, you know I wish she would never have told me she was a rotten mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She used to tell me, I'm such a terrible mother. I'm just not a good mother. If you keep telling a kid that, how do you expect a kid not to believe it? Even after all they keep saying, the first thing I say now even - well not so much now but, like I said like a year ago I was thinking to myself, yeah, you sure are. And then you know of course the guilt feelings come up and I say, my god, what did I say? You know it's my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's about time to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'm not getting anywhere today anyway. I'm going around in circles. Hangovers are not the best things to have when you're trying to think (54:00). But it's just, I wish to hell I knew what started this whole thing. Because I don't think I'd be as hurt by the things that happened afterwards if there wasn't something that started the whole thing off. There had to be something that started it. And I do remember a little bit more about my father. You know like I did remember him, at least I remembered him being there and in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But things like I can remember my mother saying, don't go near your father, don't go near your father. Stay away from your father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. Isn't that funny. That's the first time realized who that guys was in the dream. Son of a gun, it was my brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's that same feeling in the dream. That feeling he gives you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think this is why in the dream I got to the point where I thought I needed an affair. And I just claimed in real life. So what I would do is then you know because I didn't have a man around. And I remembered it's so funny because I, you know like he would be the first one I said no, I can't like him. You know? And one time I was dreaming and I was supposed to be in bed with him and I said wait a minute. Somehow it just didn't work. And so then it was the blonde. It was the other one. Whoever the heck he is. Just the one that like never agrees with me. So I don't know who he is. We'll have to find out. Oh. Thank you and I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

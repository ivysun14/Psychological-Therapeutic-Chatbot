<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretty good.  I think we, last time, um, you were, said you were doing pretty well, it wasn't clear how much, how regularly you were taking the medicine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has that changed at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really, I take it sometimes and, um, I got my first report card—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I did good but I don't think that had anything to do with the medicine, I think, my mom thinks it did but I think I hardly put any work into it at all and I think I should have, I think I should have taken the medicine because I really can feel like I can't pay attention, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when you take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think it, I think there is, it helps a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean is there a reason you don't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you brush your teeth everyday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh God, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get to that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you took the medicine today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should just keep the medicine upstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, well if you don't brush your teeth every day, I'll give it to you.  I'm wondering if we should, um, maybe we should try, well, let's see what we can do, I mean maybe we'll want to try something else that works like around the clock so that you're focusing in the morning and you don't forget or figure out some way to make, you know, make yourself take it but I mean, but you can tell when you take it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's easier to pay attention?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, it's a really small dose but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can tell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  So what kind of grades did you get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I got, I got all A's and B's except, uh, Math which I got a C+ in, oh, and English I got a C+ also and that's the class that I really kind of think I could have definitely got an A but I just sort of didn't do any work so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this, these are the grades you usually get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're a little higher than usual.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh and did you usually do any work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now you did a little work—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In some of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I just, in English, I was unable to get myself to work on the papers because we have a paper due like every week and it's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you do it in the evening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, what I, what I do is I'll, it'll be due and I'll go to class and I won't do it and the next day I'll do it and it'll be 10 points off every time so I can't do the paper when it's due, I just sort of wait and get it with a late grade because I can't even start it if there's no pressure I guess because he takes 10 points off every day and then I don't know why I never just turn it in on time but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So theoretically if your mother came in there with a knife and said she was going to cut your throat if you didn't do the paper, would that be pressure?  No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess that would, that would probably work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, never mind, I'm, no, obviously that's a joke.  Um, but it's the pressure, it's not external pressure, it's the pressure, I mean it's not that kind of pressure, it's the pressure of it being due—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As opposed to something going to happen or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Correct.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean did you ever just not do papers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, I always do them eventually.  I can't stand, I always do all the work in all my classes eventually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just really late.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bug the crap out of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a different—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I have a friend who—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Different pace.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, who if he gets too behind, he just doesn't do any of the work and I could never do that because if, if I don't do it, I eventually get myself to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you lose 10 points—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even though there's not 10 points per grade, that's not right, you should lose 7 points or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, there you go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a weird system they have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should just do it on time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you do any papers on time for English?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I, well, yes, I mean the short ones.  If it's going to be something that I have to sit down and really take a half hour to an hour to just do it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a short one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a long paper, because I write them really quickly, I'm a very good writer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I still can't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be damned if you're going to get any recognition for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doing a good job.  Um, what would happen if you got A's on your papers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, I'd get an A in the class because that's all the class is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, but I mean there has to be some reason, you have to, there has to be something if every single long paper is taking that long.  Um, you must be an amazing writer, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's the amount of time I actually spend writing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I'll—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You think about it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll sit at my computer and I'll get really distracted and so, you know, it'll be like 3 hours but most of its not actual work, it's just sort of sitting there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it make, do you ever do it on the weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I've ever done homework on the weekend, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I wonder if you, what would happen if you took your meds and while they were still working, you tried.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I could try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just as an experiment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something that's not, that hasn't been due yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've never done any homework?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not on the weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's unbelievable, God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or I could suggest, you know, if you couldn't do it on the weekend, to try cutting school one day and do it during the week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What grade are you in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm a senior.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I thought, don't cut, then you have to take finals, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is a well, a well placed appointment because I have a test [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you know that when you made this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, my mom made the appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did she know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was going to say, she's in cahoots with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [LAUGHING] she didn't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Math.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In Math.  Well, I'm glad I could be of some assistance.  Um, all right, so we'll do this, we'll do, and you can get a letter or a note from, uh, somebody that you were here, yeah, I signed that thing already, very good—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, try taking Focalin, number 2, all right, 5 mg, so, okay, well I didn't see this before, this is from last week, you were irritable on this stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, are you more irritable on the Focalin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, um, that might have been something my mom said, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But how would she know, how often are you taking it, a couple times a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, there was, there was a while I was taking really regularly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And where—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like more at the beginning of the year and then I started forgetting more and more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But were you more irritable in the beginning of the year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't think it had anything to do with the medicine but I don't actually remember but I guess it's worth—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just watch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Looking into.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and are you seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now is there, I don't know, are you feeling depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I've been doing better, I don't know, sometimes I feel really down but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like, I mean do you, does not being able to do the work seem to make things worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, just when I have something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Due?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Due.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, I think maybe the depression would lessen, hopefully—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you were a little more, if you felt a little more confident in getting stuff done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, Focalin 5 mg, I think you don't need this yet but you may before I see you.  All right, do you want to make the follow up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, um, and, uh, do you want us to call your mother and tell her as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The appointment?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, give that to [NAME OTHER] and let's do this—</p>

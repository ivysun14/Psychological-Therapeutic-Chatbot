<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're good?  What's going on in your life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just started college and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're young for college.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I graduated early.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's a lot going on in the home I hear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my dad is, um, at, um, prison, and I have two younger sisters, and they can be a handful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do you feel about what happened with your dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, didn't affect me so much in the beginning, but towards the, like this past year, it has affected me quite a bit, financially; just basically my whole life has changed from that.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you cry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your life was more stable before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mom was saying too that sometimes it's a little, kind of disorganized or chaotic in the home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was more of the limit setting and set boundaries and stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, when he was there our house was like always clean.  The girls obey, obeyed like my mom and stuff.  Now they don't really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Obey.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Obey her.  Our house is pretty much a mess, kind of.  In my opinion, I think it's messy.  It is kind of chaotic in my house now that he's not there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel you have to take more responsibility to take care of your sisters?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Makes you feel a little burdened by it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel you have to take care of your mom too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some, just in the little things, like if she drinks, I find and take her keys, uh, just basically make sure no, like no cops are involved, like that kind of thing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But when she's not drunk, it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's better when she's not drunk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you know that?  That she's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the drinking, that's what we were talking about is the drinking for her is terrible.  It hurts everybody, her and the family.  We have to try to stop that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to give her some medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That might help a little, but, are you, are you drinking at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm trying to stop.  I have drank.  It was getting a little bad, but I stopped, and I'm trying to stop 'cause I basically don't, it's not only like I don't want to, I do, I don't want to, but I don't have enough time to drink anymore really, I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too busy with school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what are you majoring in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just taking my generals, but I'm in five classes right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's the most you can be in I think, and so I'm pretty busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you just started this January?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you graduated in December?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She has a boyfriend that's older than her, and so they made it so that they could go to college together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much long—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's why she graduated early and everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He graduated last year.  I grad, I grad, I, yeah, he's only a year older than me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does he study?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's taking his generals too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he's going to be a firefighter or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So are you going to go there for two years and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And go to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's pretty sad what happened there too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you know anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So she seems very responsible, but the burden of your drinking weighs on her.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you take antidepressants before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have, but then I, I stopped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one did you take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying to remember what it was called.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lexapro?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it help you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't see a difference.  It was only like 10 mg or something like that.  It was really mild.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the Wellbutrin you never took, that your mom takes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Yeah, I never took it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have problems concentrating or focusing in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I think so.  I think I still am fighting ADD, but my mom doesn't think that I am really.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's just because the medicine she takes that she stops eating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which medicine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Meta—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Metadate?  Did it help you concentrate when you took it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It helped me concentrate.  I did lose a lot of weight, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I, but I don't think, we went to a doctor, and they said I was still at a normal weight.  She doesn't think I was a normal weight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much do you weigh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right now, I weigh 106.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're how tall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	5'2", almost 5'3".</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Did you ever take Strattera?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  Um, Wellbutrin and Strattera are not as powerful as the stimulants, but they do help people concentrate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, if you're depressed, if you want, I could try giving you a low dose of Wellbutrin to see if it helps, if you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum, I just think, would that help me focus?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll help you, not as much as the stimulants.  Now, there are other stimulants though that may not have the same weight effect.  There's a new one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think there were other side effects that we didn't like either, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of the stimulants?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did your heart rate?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, didn't you have, or didn't you get some panic attacks or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but that's what they, that's what the doctor gave me because I was getting panic attacks.  She said that, like the, she, I think it was, it was some sort of ADD medicine that was also, they use, she said also they used it for depr, antidepression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Strattera?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe that's what it was, but also, I was taking Lexapro with that, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't see much of a difference 'cause I don't think that I'm really depressed.  I think I'm just like stressed out kind of.  I just think that I need to focus more maybe.  It's hard to like, it's, I don't know, hard to focus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about if I give you some Strattera?  Strattera is an ADD medicine primarily to help you focus, but it's not as strong as the stimulants, but it doesn't' have the same effect on your appetite or weight—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like a more subtle drug.  The difference is the stimulants force you to concentrate, where the drugs like Strattera more is like a gentle removal of distraction, plus there's a little bit of an antidepressant—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Boost to that as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that might have been what I was taking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Strattera?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe, I don't remember though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you know if I show you the pill?  Could you tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we could do either that or, or if you want to try it and see if it helps, and your mom, I don't know if you feel the Wellbutrin helps a little bit?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But didn't you not like the side effects to that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or is that the others?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I've not really noticed much side effects on Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's subtle.  I mean, mood boosts a little bit and you need to concentrate better, and so we'll try it.  If it doesn't work, I mean, you're healthy right?  You have—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No other issues, so if it doesn't work, we could stop it, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But for you, I'll, for your mom I'll get something that will help her.  You don't need something to help you stop drinking do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.  I don't have a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was telling your mom the two most destructive things to the human body as we age are alcohol and extra weight.  You don't have the extra weight—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is good, but alcohol is so destructive.  I call it the aging drug.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, it causes turmoil, turmoil in the whole family and so try not to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does your boyfriend drink?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only when I do.  He's, he's trying not to do it.  It's like, I'm more of like the influence to drink.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, try to substitute.  What, what helps is exercise.  Do you ever do any exercise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I try to.  I get a little lazy though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I would do that much more, and you have a calming effect too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It makes you feel less irritable, less stressed out when you exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think [DEIDENTIFIED] has a nice, uh, gym.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe you can find some time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even twenty, thirty minutes, just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Walk on a treadmill.  It'll help a lot.  But medically, you're healthy, so that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would try that, and then we'll go out and I'll show you the Strattera, and we'll either use that or the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we'll try it for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And maybe you can come back, and I'll give your mom enough of this medicine, see if it stops the drinking, but you got to do it.  It's not going to stop the drinking, it's just going to help you stop, but you still have to do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'll try it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then do you want to go two weeks, come back in a couple of weeks maybe and see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What happens if she drinks when she takes that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It won't hurt her.  It's not like Antabuse where you get sick from it, so she, it won't hurt her, but the purpose of it is you don't feel the same need to drink, cravings, so what I would suggest every time you have an urge to drink and, you know, if it comes even with the medicine, go for a walk, do some exercise.  Could you do that?  The whether should start warming up pretty soon maybe.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take her for a walk.  You ever take her for a walk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We do in the summertime sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The whole family, your sisters too, everybody should start walking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll all be less depressed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's really wonderful, exercise.  There's some great studies that compare exercise to antidepressants, and after five years, people who exercised on a regular basis, and just walking is the exercise they do, do better and are less depressed than people who take antidepressants, so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We have the perfect neighborhood to walk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, walking and exercise is a powerful tool to help.  You'll be amazed.  You'll feel less stressed.  You'll also be able to accomplish more, and just walk three or four times a week, you know, twenty, thirty minutes.  Or go over to the, uh, health center there and do a treadmill or bike.  Ellipt, they have the elliptical, have you seen those?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like a little machine you can work on and move your—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, it's like hard though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is hard, it's more, yeah, but the treadmill or the bike is good, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you do it with your boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we'll try that, and we'll do this, and then I'll see you in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, we'll try that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

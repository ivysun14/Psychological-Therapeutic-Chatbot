<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like the new clock.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Thanks. Yeah, it doesn't have batteries. I'm sorry about the short notice on tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There may be another one in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although [I might try to] reschedule that one, but I should know something over this weekend and can let you know something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, I mean, next week I'm good. And thereafter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I'm going to miss August 17th, that Friday, because my parents are going to be in town. I don't know if we've discussed my dad's opinions about psychology and psychiatry yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you've mentioned them, yes. They're not positive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No. (pause) I don't know what to talk about. I'm not even going to say whatever comes to mind. You could ask a question. That would make this much easier for me.</p>

<p>[01:06.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Oh, okay. (pause) Is it also difficult to know what you want to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. Sometimes I just draw a blank, but other times I've come in here with something I really want to talk about. If I have something in mind that I really want to work through, it's generally not hard for me to spit it out. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, I don't get the sense that you often come in with things that you want to talk about but feel real reticent about. You either have something on your mind or you kind of draw a blank for reasons that are not entirely clear, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>[02:09.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that happen elsewhere?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Do you want examples? Because I can come up with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that was my next question. Where or what —</p>

<p>CLIENT: All kinds of places. For example, well, I can give a work example and a church example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Our CEO is coming to do a lunchtime question and answer session, face-time sort of thing with the office in two weeks. And my boss asked us to submit questions for the CEO. I can't think of anything to ask the CEO, what the hell? I've been on the job for like two-and-a-half weeks.</p>

<p>[03:01.9]</p>

<p>But my boss really wants me to submit something to the question queue, and I just can't think of anything. Whereas, you know, in — and it's not that "Oh my gosh, it's the CEO. I can't talk to the CEO." Because I certainly had questions for this sort of thing in previous jobs. It's just if there's something I want to know, there's a question. But if I'm asked to generate one and there's nothing pressing on my mind, I just kind of draw a blank and I start getting anxious about not being able to come up with a question.</p>

<p>It's actually — the exact same thing happened, it's a very clear memory, of when I was in the eighth grade. One of my favorite authors was coming to my class to give a talk. And not to the school, just to our little enrichment class of 15 students. I couldn't think of a single thing to ask him. It was just really humiliating and horrifying for me at the time.</p>

<p>[04:01.2]</p>

<p>And then there's church. You know, sometimes the contents of the reading for that week or the sermon or something will set me off, and I'll just write a 1,000 or 2,000 word essay, sometimes entirely just off-the-cuff and sometimes actually researched and cited, and I will post it up on my blog. But then there are other times, for example this year during the entirety of Lent, our priest decided he wasn't going to preach. He was going to invite parishioners to give spontaneous sermons based on whether the spirit moved them, which led to a lot of crap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I'll bet they were thrilled with that approach].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it was just like people came up and said all kinds of things. Maybe one out of every 20 things said was actually edifying. The rest was navel-gazing boringness or offensive bullshit or this rambling I don't even know what they were saying. I also hate open mics at poetry readings. (laughter) (inaudible).</p>

<p>[05:07.5]</p>

<p>But no, I couldn't think of anything in the moment to say even though, as a general rule, I tend to have strong opinions. (chuckles) But, so — but I find not having something immediately obvious to say and the expectation that I will stand up and say something, just shuts me down entirely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like there's something about that combination of not really having anything and then having a performative situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[06:03.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, my impression is that somebody putting an open mic in front of you when you don't happen to have anything to say kind of pisses you off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that too. (chuckles) But I think more than making me angry, it makes me panic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Like — (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although you said it makes me angry, I don't know. I feel like I have a complex relationship with anger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>[06:57.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because there are all of these situations where you or my previous therapist Chrissie or Dave or someone will say "Wow. You look really angry. You sound really angry." [It's not how] I would describe my reaction as scared or tired or confused and not angry. But — (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we independently and consistently seem to read it otherwise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And also — I don't know. There are so many situations where I've been told that I should be angry, or I just feel horribly guilty about feeling angry and I don't want to feel angry. Like with my parents being the biggest and most obvious and most pressing one. (pause)</p>

<p>But then again, you know, if I'm just shooting the shit with my friends, it's much easier for me to talk about situations that make me angry than to talk about situations that make me happy, right?</p>

<p>[08:01.2]</p>

<p>Like if I'm hanging out with friends, it's much easier to say "Oh, look at the stupidest shit Mitt Romney did now" or "Oh my gosh, can you believe what my parents said?" instead of talking about the awesome book I read or the awesome concert I just went to. So, I don't know. It seems to be — I'm certainly much more comfortable saying that I'm angry than saying that I'm happy or content or excited. Those all seem more dangerous.</p>

<p>And I mean, the usually facile explanation is that my parents are crap at expressing emotions, and pretty much the only emotion they could express consistently was anger. So that's what I learned. But, I mean, I'm 30 years old. You'd think I would've learned some other emotional expression by now. (pause)</p>

<p>[09:11.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but — (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. I just rambled for forever, didn't I? (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Well, that's kind of the idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) So much for not having anything to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what's going on with the other person or the audience is also important in this, in a few different ways. It's my off-the-cuff impression that the inability of talking about being happy or enthusiastic or optimistic about something has more to do with those being more vulnerable.</p>

<p>[10:25.1]</p>

<p>Like things that put you in a more vulnerable position, especially if you grew up with people who, I think, would probably often stomp that out of you pretty good. Whereas being angry is safer, maybe. But also, I suspect it made a real difference actually. I mean, I didn't know this going into it, but sort of as this is unfolding, I have the impression that you're asking me to ask questions and I more or less started asking questions, that actually kind of changed things. I would suspect partly from the content of the questions, but partly also from my helping in the way that you asked me to help.</p>

<p>[11:32.8]</p>

<p>Like I might say, you know, being there for you in a way when you were feeling a bit stuck. And I suspect also, [if I may keep harping on this], but a bit more on your own. I imagine there's something about being on your own that goes with being asked to generate a question or generate something to say or stand up in front of an open mic and say something, that you feel — I'm guessing about this — somewhat distant or disconnected from the audience or the people who are asking something of you. And that it's reassuring when something happens to make you feel more connected, like asking for help and getting some, or something like that. (long pause) What do you think?</p>

<p>[12:53.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure. Are we still talking about being angry, or are we talking about my blank page fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems I was talking more about the blank page fear, yeah. But if what you're thinking about is more the anger thing, then we can certainly talk about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [We won't bemoan it].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to react immediately to your saying that it sounded like I was angry because that — but I've said my piece, and I'm not sure there's much more for me to say right now on that topic. Yeah, blank page. (pause)</p>

<p>It's definitely reassuring if I'm in a back-and-forth when someone else starts, because I don't feel like I'm wasting their time which, I mean, shouldn't apply here if I use the rational part of my brain, but that's not the part that's often in charge. But yeah, connectedness. That's something there. (long pause)</p>

<p>[14:48.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The particular worry is about kind of wasting the other person's time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) No, wasting the other person's time is one of many ways in which the other person or the audience can think I'm an idiot. (pause) Like if I say something completely irrelevant and waste their time, or if I say something offensive and piss them off which I guess technically, it's also a waste of their time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but it's —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The bad outcome here would be their thinking you're an idiot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause)</p>

<p>[15:59.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does sound like I think unconsciously you can feel in a somewhat combative situation in that the other party or person could be pretty quick to decide you're wasting their time or you're an idiot, and be very harsh in that way. And at least possibly that you could feel pushed and kind of annoyed or panicky that you're going to get that kind of response. Or maybe more that you're going to be sort of angry or harsh with them.</p>

<p>But it sounds like a lot of the kind of substrate of this involves a pretty combative or conflictual set-up, which I'm not saying is how you rationally appraise it, but at some other level it sounds like it feels that way. I can't imagine where this would come from, but it does sound like it may be part of how some things feel in the present. (long pause)</p>

<p>[18:13.2]</p>

<p>Which, if that's true, could have something to do with the feelings of distance, weariness (pause) and the way that the other person sort of responding helpfully or reaching out in some way could change things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Maybe. I'm remembering an incident that happened when I was — let's see, we were living in the big house in Alabama, so I had to be somewhere between fourth and sixth grade — this was during the first Gulf War, if you remember that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was like 1990.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, ish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ish.</p>

<p>[19:11.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this wasn't during the Gulf War. I'm sorry. This was during the Bosnian conflict under Clinton.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: '96 or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was before that. It was more between '92 and '93.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know why I try to fix the dates for all of these, but whatever. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I was somewhere in fourth or sixth grade. Clinton was president, so it was like '93 or '94, somewhere around there. We were watching the news because my dad thought we should watch 24-hour news networks all day, every day. He always had them on and would scream at me and my sisters who — at the time, I was in, I don't know, let's call it 11, an average of 10 and 12, which meant my sisters were seven and three. He would get very mad if we weren't paying attention to the news. And it was completely crazy. Like who expects a seven-year-old to pay attention to the news? Anyway, we are bracketing that and putting it aside. There was some news on about —</p>

<p>[20:12.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty bad for a seven-year-old. I mean, they've done studies showing that some news can be very mildly traumatizing even to grown-ups, so you probably don't want your seven-year-old watching the news constantly. But I hear you —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially not the craziness that is 24-hour cable news, right? It's one thing to watch the local news at 6:30, the 6:00 news on your local ABC station, but like 24-hour CNN, MSNBC — I guess MSNBC didn't exist yet, but you know, CNN was the first — whatever.</p>

<p>So they were doing something about arms embargoes against one of the parties who were in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina but not the others, and people were getting killed and there were these horrible pictures of mutilated bodies.</p>

<p>[21:03.6]</p>

<p>That week the people they were focusing on getting killed were all Muslims. So I got very upset and during the commercial I started talking about fairness and justice and how they were being discriminatory towards Muslims. I don't know. In hindsight I feel it was a pretty sophisticated argument for an 11-year-old to make, but I might be giving myself too much credit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my dad just yelled at me and said, you know, "That's so obvious. Why are you wasting my time? You're just repeating what I said last week." And he sent me to my room without dinner. That was just — (pause) I don't know why he wanted us to watch the news if he didn't want us to engage with it, for God's sake. Like — (long pause)</p>

<p>[22:36.7]</p>

<p>You know, actually, now that I think about it, I have these really strong emotional memories tied to the visual memory of each house that we lived in. The time we lived in the big house in Alabama which, like I said, was fourth, fifth, sixth grades, I just have all these memories of trying desperately to please my parents and getting smacked down for it. Just constant — like if I picture that house in my mind, I'm just overwhelmed by a sense of frustration and despair.</p>

<p>And then we moved to Kentucky. We were there seventh grade, eighth grade, and most of what I can remember is being alone and listening to Guns N Roses on an endless loop and playing lots and lots of solitaire and mahjong on the computer.</p>

<p>[23:33.7]</p>

<p>And then we moved to Missouri and I feel like the entire — I lived in Missouri for all of high school, and I feel the entire time was just mostly me hating my parents and desperately wanting freedom. So I guess — I don't know. I kind of think of that span of time we were in Alabama, that fourth through sixth grade, I don't know, as losing my blinders with respect to my parents. If that makes any sense. It's not exactly what I mean, but I'm struggling to find the words to describe exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As I'm understanding it, you gave up in some ways, like working hard trying to do things for them and please them with the idea that could reasonably be done?</p>

<p>[24:33.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I mean, I don't think I admitted to myself that was the case until I was in my mid-20s. That might be when emotionally I just checked out. I don't know. It's hard to tell in hindsight. You know, this was 15, 18 years ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely by the time high school rolled around, I was very cynical about the affection they would shower me with when I won shit. I'd bring home medals and they'd be like "Oh, wonderful" and I'd be like — the attitude would be "Fuck off, you don't really care" although when I was 15, I wouldn't have actually said that to my parents. But, yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[25:35.5]</p>

<p>And I guess, even now, I still want their approval, but I've given up on trying to win it, if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm also particularly mad at my parents this week because dad has been promising me that he would take us on a trip to New Zealand since I was 11. I realized around 16 or so that he was never going to fucking take us on vacation to New Zealand. But for the last, I don't know, six or seven years, every summer he makes noises about wanting to go on a big vacation. Maybe to New Zealand. Maybe to Hawaii. Maybe to Austria. He doesn't know where he wants to go. He finally said "We're going to book a trip to China."</p>

<p>[26:28.9]</p>

<p>And of course, he said this last winter, and he said this last summer, and he said that the previous winter. Each time I gave him the dates I'm free, and each time he decided —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't mentioned this to me yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: — it was too expensive and it was too hard to get a visa. So, well, he said "So when can we go to China?" and I thought he was just fucking around like he always is. So I said "There's this conference that I want to go to in May. These are the dates. I prefer you not book over these dates. But if there's absolutely no other option, I guess I could maybe kind of skip the conference." I feel like that formulation, like "I would strongly prefer you not do this, but if you have to, I can" — like most people would treat this as a blackout period, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I said to a friend of mine, you know, "When can we have a party or when do you want to" — like I've gone on vacations with friends of mine before. Like "When do you want to go?" "Well, I kind of want to reserve this weekend so I really prefer you not do it, but if it's the only one that" — like, I treat that as "Okay, no."</p>

<p>[27:34.1]</p>

<p>My parents went and booked for that weekend. They actually fucking booked the trip this time. For the one set of dates in the entire next year-and-a-half. I only set aside four days in the next 18 months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fuckers. Also, my sister called me today to say "You know how mom and dad were planning to visit you at the end of August? Well, mom called to tell me that she can't get those days off work, and she's scared to call you. So she wanted me to call you and tell you that you need to change your time off because" — it's like, they've been planning to visit me in August for the last three months. They told me these dates three months ago.</p>

<p>And after I tell them — like, yesterday I e-mailed them to say, you know, I cleared it with my boss, cleared it with HR, I have these dates off. There's nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>[28:35.4]</p>

<p>Bam. Next day. (sigh) Complete lack of respect for me. It's just — (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're being set up every single time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And I tend to think you're right] that you really, you know, you want their approval and you want things to be better with them. And — (pause)</p>

<p>[29:43.7]</p>

<p>You want this to be the time they're not going to set you up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sound like Charlie Brown and his damn football.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking the same thing, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, because you love them and look what they keep doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go ahead.</p>

<p>[30:26.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dave has a great relationship with his parents. I mean, they argue and his mother can be a bit much sometimes and steamroll over him. But on balance, his parents treat him like an adult and they have conversations. They treat him as an interesting human being with opinions and things to say and stories to tell. There's a give-and-take when they talk to each other. And I have a bunch of friends from church, friends who are my age who have great relationships with their parents.</p>

<p>You know, friends who are older than me who have kids who are late teens/early 20s, their kids are, I don't know, 10-ish years younger than me, who are also — I mean, they're struggling with it. What parent doesn't on that kind of borderline between adolescent and adulthood. But they're trying to treat their kids like interesting, separate, fully-formed people. It's just — I'm so jealous.</p>

<p>[31:30.4]</p>

<p>A number of my friends are having babies. I have all kinds of friends with kids anywhere from newborn to, I think the oldest one is four-and-a-half years old, five years old, something like that. And they're all just — better parents than my parents were. Like it's kind of gross to be jealous of a two-year-old, but there you go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not at all. I mean, in a way it's hard for me to say, but (inaudible at 32:06.1) [from what I've heard about your] dad and your mom, but he's at least [in your experience], I mean, he sounds really quite troubled and really pretty far out on one end as far as being able to pay attention to who you really were, or what was really going to work for you, or what was going on with you, what mattered to you.</p>

<p>[32:44.2]</p>

<p>I mean, as well as (inaudible), really quite emotionally abusive in a pretty consistent, malicious, destructive way. Maybe "malicious" isn't quite right. It doesn't sound like he was sort of intending to be hurtful necessarily, but —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe more malignant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cancer cells don't really have agency, but they'll kill you all the same, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Like that]. (long pause)</p>

<p>[34:06.5]</p>

<p>And I guess I'm saying it partly because I think you have kind of mixed feelings about wanting to believe that about them, in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's definitely true. (pause) I mean, I want to defend them. You know, when Dave says "Your parents were abusive" or "Your father is being an asshole in this instance," my first instinct is to defend them, that they did the best they knew how and they loved me and blah blah blah. But — (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>[35:03.1]</p>

<p>Dave made the point last night that, you know, they don't actually want my love, they want my unthinking, uncritical adoration and to live vicariously through me. And can you really say what they feel for me is love if what it looks more like is ownership than love? (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>Then there's another part of me that says for much of recorded human history, parents hit their children like their property and were very domineering and authoritarian, you know. We seem to have done fine and made cultural and technological and societal progress in spite of that, so it can't be that bad, right? (pause)</p>

<p>[36:15.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it can. I'm not saying for my part that they didn't love you. But even well before the age of enlightened parenting that we allegedly live in, I think parents were — there's always somebody around who was somewhat supportive of their children. I don't know a lot of the history of child-raising across the world. (chuckles) I'm sure there's a ton of variation. (pause)</p>

<p>[37:20.2]</p>

<p>I just get the impression in a very anecdotal way — and you may know a lot more about this than me — that there were often people around who paid some attention and were supportive of and cared about the kids. I mean, even if the kids were working in the fields from six or didn't get educations or didn't have much to eat or whatever. (pause)</p>

<p>[38:07.1]</p>

<p>We can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't even use that stupid lot where you put the card in—the lot right here. It wouldn't let me put my card in. Anyway, I've got to say it's pathetic. It sucks being this broke, but I'm still kind of proud that I don't have to ask my mom for help or anybody for help. I just get through it. That feels good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you're able to live for a good week without spending too much money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think right now I have like $60 to my name, so I'm like, "Well, what do I really need to do anyway?" I just get some coffee and . . . It sucks, but it's better than the way things used to be. [00:01:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there things you have to do that you're not able to do then? I guess parking is one of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd like to make payments on things, like my student loans. I have one fucking credit card—one; but it's always almost maxed out because I end up having to need it a little bit. That annoys the shit out of me. I'd just rather bang that out and just pay it so I can use it for actual life, like when I go out of town for the weekend. That shit is really starting to annoy me now; that I don't have this extra flexibility of like going to my friend's wedding in Europe. It sucks, but I'm going to put it on my credit card and just go and come back and pay it off. That's starting to annoy me. There's no easy way around that. I just have to figure it out. But, no, in terms of things I have to do, I guess it somehow gets done. It's not perfect, it's not great yet, but its way better than what it was. I pay the phone; whatever little bills there are I take care of. [00:02:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I mean. It feels like you're able to keep on top of the monthly expenses?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The rent's paid—or mortgage. Whatever the fuck. My cell phone; I put my mom on my plan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your cable, electric, insurance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have cable. Insurance, yeah. I don't have cable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All that stuff you're paying for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's why I'm broke. My insurance is kind of high on my car—$150. It's a lot. It's going to go down next month. [00:03:30] (pause) I'm going to have to figure it out. Like it's so hard, too. I'm so excited to do the grant-writing stuff, but it's not easy in terms of having a job, doing other things that I really care about. It's just a lot. I can figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something you eventually want as a full-time job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it would be a great little business. Hell, yeah. You're getting paid a couple of grand a pop. Once you have it down to a template, you're quick at it. You can do a couple at a time throughout the year. (pause) Also, I just don't know about the future. It's great now. Unless she just doesn't care and she's just happy. It's like a retainer. She just wants a couple of people who went to an Ivy League school, writing. It makes the school look, for accreditation and all that, like . . . I just don't know. We're going to write this textbook and then what? [00:05:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not sure about its long-term stability.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just not sure, unless there are going to be all these projects like online classes, I don't know. I just feel like, after another year or whatever, I just wonder. But then knowing her, she's employed lots of people for over a decade who should not be there. Considering that she loves me, I'm (chuckles) really not worried. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She has a history doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are just some people that work there that are just sleaze-bags. She has dopes, even though she's kind of a bitch. I can't figure this woman out. She's kind of bitchy, but then she's not. She's kind of hippy-dippy, but then she's not. I guess she really doesn't like firing people which I kind of respect in a way; so there are people that have been there over ten years that are just a waste of space. (pause) [00:06:42] My date went really well with Gwen on Friday. It was pretty cool. I see her tomorrow. She was texting me all weekend. It was nice. The physical stuff is awesome, but then yesterday she said some stuff about work and was just like, "I'm sorry I'm bitching about work." I was just like, "Ehh. You can talk to me about anything." Whatever. She was really cool. She was like, "Thanks. I feel like I already can talk to you about anything. It was so great the other night. We went to that bar and I loved that we chatted about all kinds of awesome things." I like that. It's a real, very honest and kind of nice thing to say. Normally people play their cards a little close to their chest. That was cool. She wants to cook me dinner tomorrow, which is cool. That's nice. [00:08:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're laughing about that, though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's cute. It's nice; cooking dinner in Springfield. It's cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Domestic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's neat. (pause) The wedding went well over the weekend. I gave a pretty awesome speech. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt good about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That kicked ass. The whole thing went well. It was funny because all that stuff where I was upset with my friends in the Kickstarter thing; first of all, that never entered the equation the whole weekend. I kind of like let it go because how can I be here and it's all great and very warm and everyone's happy and everyone's cool, and then think—you know what I mean? It just doesn't make sense—perspective. Yeah, it was a good weekend. It was really fun. [00:09:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean you have put that aside and it doesn't feel as important anymore, or do you feel like in that context it didn't have a place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know, we have four fucking days left. If none of these people gives, that's going to be kind of odd. I don't have the same kind of anger about it. I just feel like it's disappointing, but it's just disappointing. Whatever. I feel like I can't hold a grudge about it because then it doesn't make sense with my actual interactions with them. Do you know what I mean? It's going to feel disproportionate. I think it's weird and odd, but our interactions are very great and respectful and sweet. [00:10:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not sensing some other kind of retreat from you in any way. It's only this really right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not even all of them. Some of them mentioned it. Some of them were like, "Hey, man. How's the Kickstarter thing going? I saw the video." Really, I think I'm just thinking of Jess or Stu, but even them I don't think there's anything (chuckles) malicious going on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that who it boils down to you think, Jess and Stu?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because a lot of friends mentioned it, and gave—so, yeah, it's really just Jess and Stu. And even Stu has mentioned it several times, so maybe (laughs) it's just Jess. I don't know. It's really not a big deal. Plus at this point, it's neither here nor there. There are four days left. Unless they're going to give me like a grand, at this point as much as I fucking hate it, I need to either talk to my uncle . . . I've got to do it soon. I don't know. The other thing is if one of them agreed to do it and we got up to like $4,000 or whatever, the other statistic is more people start giving. The other feeling now with people is that their $15 isn't going to get this to $4,500. That's the fucking problem. I kind of don't want to ask my uncle, (chuckles) even though I'm going to give him the money back in two weeks. But there's something about it. I'm trying to think of a friend, somebody I could just ask. [00:12:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to ask your uncle because of your history?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just feel like he's always kind of off-and-on helped us—my mom, me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you for school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I just don't like the dynamic, kind of. He helped me with my car. A lot of that stuff my mom has paid him back or paid him back part. He's really a stickler about that shit. I would if I could. I pay back the loan every month from my account. It's a big deal and it isn't at the same time. It just annoys me. [00:13:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the agreement you have—that you pay him back over time through the loan through the bank?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's automatic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It gets automatically withdrawn?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. What happened was he never really gave me that money, per se. His money is in a CD and, because he does so much business there, they made an exception which sounds insane that that would be an exception—I'm giving you cash to give this person the same amount. It's fucking retarded. His $30,000 is frozen in some CD against the $30,000 they gave me and every month I'm paying that, so really his money is there. [00:14:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's just a guarantor of the loan. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. His actual cash is collateral. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your mom couldn't loan you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. That's where we are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if you paid it right back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because my mom literally whatever equity is just in the house. There's no pile of . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't have any extra?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has some kind of pension thing, but she would have to do shit to get it or whatever the fuck. [00:15:12] It's annoying. It's really annoying. There's nothing more annoying than feeling poor when you're not poor. It's just surreal to feel that other people would kill themselves to have a three-family house in a prime location that has hundreds of thousands of dollars of equity in it, but we can't touch it. Even if we were to apply for a home equity line, it would be tough—credit-shemdit, now she doesn't work, I'm the only one. . . it's a little bit unnerving. It's unbelievable. Otherwise, this is no issue. I would just give her some money, tell her to chip into the Kickstarter thing and I'd pay her right back. Who cares? (pause) [00:16:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's got to leave you feeling so alone with all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you just feel helpless when you kind of don't need to feel helpless. It would be one thing if we really were helpless, but if there was some bank that was willing to help out or something, this really isn't a big deal. We have tons of equity. I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your house is set up as three different families legally? Condos, in other words?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not condos, but there are three separate apartments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But a three family?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, three family. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never thought about selling one of them? [00:17:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've thought about that. My mom won't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her thing is that then that person—that's a condo. This has been our house all these years and now, if we have an issue with that person suddenly, they own that condo. We're losing control of our own property; and I agree the more I thought about that. What if they get up and sell it to somebody else? It's a condo. They can do whatever they want. You can't tell them to turn down the noise. There are things that are just going to start being issues. Also because we don't—sell it for what? The equity is all there. That's something that I might have to talk to my uncle and say, "Look, man. You might have to help us get this home equity loan because then we don't need you for anything." Then we can be set up and things can be taken care of without having to scramble and reach out to people. It's just ridiculous. That's something my mom wants to do. She's like, "Yeah." I'm working. That's full-time income coming in now, so it's not like—you know. Just having a line—not even the money, just a line so if we need a grant for this repair—okay, fine, here it is. That's something because I think it would absolutely happen if there were some kind of co-signer, someone really stable or whatever. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because now it's just about credit; it's not about anything else. I have a full-tine job, we have rental income, there's a shit-load of equity, so they're just going to be assholes about the credit score. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just a reminder of the ways that you haven't been helped all along to be in the position where your credit is such a problem. No one was guiding you through getting credit cards and, "This is how we build good credit," and, "Oh, you ran up your card; let's make sure we fix that right away. We'll help you." Just good parenting all around. [00:20:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They would just say, "Well, we told you not to get credit cards. You shouldn't borrow anything." It's very old-school like, "Didn't you see how we never used credit cards?" There's no malleability like it doesn't matter what you do, this is how things are changing and progressing. You don't know what college is like. You don't know that when you're 18 you're just getting credit cards handed to you. They just immediately want you to get into debt. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also they're not in the reality of modern life that establishing credit will actually help you buy a home or get a car loan or that you want to have a credit card to pay off every month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. Just live. Just live. Sometimes you have to do something and you need a credit card to get it done. That's just a fact unless you're so loaded that everything is just, "Who cares? Take it right out of my checking account." You're going to go away for a weekend. They don't understand (chuckles) this is life. The wedding—I had to do all this shit with cash, right? [00:21:29] All the best-man shit. Some of that I would just put on my card and I would have had peace of mind and just paid that shit off—$100 here, $150 there—chunks of cash. Bachelor party, sure. I just went out and took out $150 in cash. That's $150 now I don't have. I'd be like, "Oh, fine. I'm getting paid Friday. $150. I'm not doing anything. I'm fine." It's chump change for a lot of people, but that would make a difference. But when you're constantly having to use cash—do you know what I mean? Like the cell phone—$120, $100, $70—everything is cash right out of my checking account. I guess that's great that I'm not building all kinds of other debt, but I have a fucking job so I can have $500 on a credit card and just fucking pay it off. [00:22:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As long as you pay it off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Plus I'm the type where I'd pay more. Let's say I have a $20-minimum credit card, fuck that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no. I mean pay off the whole thing every month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I could I would. Yeah. If I could I would. What I'm saying is if I can't and the minimum is like $20, I'd be like, no, here's $100.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's what I'm saying. You've never even had them teaching you that running a credit card and paying it off every single month—the whole balance—for a year builds your credit. That helps you get in good standing. [00:23:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It actually doesn't. I did the research on that. Believe it or not, the weird, fucking equation you use is when you're paying it off every single month to a $0 balance, they don't like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It may have changed now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't like that. If you have $1,000 limit, they don't want you to have $900. That's not good, either, to be almost at the . . . they want you to have a few hundred, a rolling, and you pay big chunks every month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Regardless, however this changes, there is something they're not accepting that as part of the world to learn about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like why can't you just have a credit card and pay it every month? I don't know. (pause) [00:24:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If your father were here now, I wonder if you could imagine how this would be different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it would be a lot different. We had just closed on a store in town. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: On buying it, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's a grocery store, a big convenience store. We had bought the Corner Convenience Store with the building. It was fucking awesome. So, yeah, I think things would have been different. (pause) [00:24:59] It's not even that. My mom got a pretty hefty settlement from a lawsuit with a claim for sexual harassment. It was a class-action thing. She kind of didn't listen to me. I took her to the bank. I was like, dude, you need to take a chunk of that and just forget about it. Put it in some sort of fund, a mutual fund, and diversify. I don't know what the fuck they'll do, but someone at a bank that we trust who has done this for many years, and fucking forget about it. Didn't do it. Didn't do it. We paid off a big chunk of the mortgage. Okay, that's great. We did renovations. That's great, but money comes and goes. You can't just have a pile of money in your checking account unless it's constantly coming in. (chuckles) If you just have that chunk, come on, man. (pause) [00:26:11] Yeah, it's not an easy family, that's for sure, when it comes to that stuff. You know, my dad, that wasn't a smooth process with that store. He went back and forth. He was really stressed. It was like he didn't want to do it or something and I think he was scared. I don't know what the fuck. (pause) [00:26:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've never talked about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The store. What that time was like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just stressful. He had been injured on the job so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doing what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He worked in a factory. His arm got caught in a machine and it got really—I mean it looked okay but his muscle was all kind of—I don't remember . . . his grip and there was pain and stuff like that. That's when I think they decided what the hell? All these years they'd been doing this, they should do something else and be your own boss and all that stuff because my uncle has been doing this for so many years- even before he was married—with real estate. There was more of a team. My other uncle, my aunt's husband, knows about these things, so there were trustworthy people. [00:28:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your father had been a mechanic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was a mechanic, but the last years when we moved back to the city he worked like a machinist at a factory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he'd been working as a mechanic and . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They had a store. That's the other thing, back then if they'd just kept their fucking store (chuckles), but my mom got this job with a big firm. Whatever. But, yeah, he was a mechanic. In North Carolina he was a mechanic on trucks. (pause) [00:28:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mom—I guess I never understood how—was she actively looking for work around the country? How did she land the job . . .? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. She was a writer. She was a pretty unique person back then. There are not many Assyrians like that. They still aren't like her, incredibly smart, spoke Assyrian like no tomorrow, really intellectual, beautiful, all this shit. There's a Turkish writer who is a journalist who is the head of the Assyrian division of the corporation. A very sweet man. He kind of like spotted my mom's talent. My mom was kind of like the occasional correspondent already. She would send in reports, she interviewed people. He was just like, "You should be here full time. We need someone on-air," so I think it was just one of those things. I'm sure it was good money back then, government benefits and all of that, so you can't say no. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. And she really got recruited then for her talent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of as you did for this London thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was kind of like that. I think the difference, though, is because they're not savvy, someone else would have never left that job even with the sexual harassment. (chuckles) They would have found a way. They would have known what they have like, "Wait a minute. If I stay here, I'm going to make a shit-load . . ." Those jobs are getting exponentially, like all these grades because there's security clearance and all this shit. She probably would have become the head of the department or whatever. Who knows? [00:30:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Worked her way up the ladder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. She would have done really, really well, but to do really well you've got to have a certain personality and be savvy and understand. She doesn't have that. They're all just these oddly innocent people or gullible or whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the sexual harassment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the main guys was blatantly harassing her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I remember that. She'd be crying at home. My dad would be kind of upset. They'd be talking about what to do. She'd be very upset. [00:31:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do remember this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I do remember that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what he was doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Comments. I don't know the details and I never asked, but what could it be? Comments or being a little touchy-feely in the office maybe. But then it turned out that this was a problem all across the company, so it became a class-action lawsuit. It was huge. It was huge. She got years of back pay that she wouldn't have gotten. Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was she an active part of the lawsuit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She got contacted that there was this thing going on and there were other complaints as well about this person. She was like, "Yeah. Of course I want to be part of this lawsuit. I left my job, partly because of that guy." [00:32:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Partly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, I wanted to move back. Things just happened. I wanted to come back here. I wasn't happy there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You made that known to them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd come here for the summers and spend the whole summer here. I don't know if I made it known, but may be they all saw it. I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I'm wondering. Were they interested in moving here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe a little bit. They had some really good friends there, but I'm sure on some level . . . we were a tight extended family. Maybe my mom felt like, "He's away from his cousins and his grandparents." I don't know. (pause) [00:33:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like it's hard to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. It's like the L.A. thing. I feel like all of these things are so messy because there was no savvy-ness. There was no thinking and planning. I feel like it's all strange.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if it's as confusing to you as it is to me, if you know inside that it's hard just to say or you don't know, for example, why you moved back. You may have some ideas, but it sounds like it's not totally sorted out in you even. Why did that happen? What was the process of it? Who wanted to go? Who was resentful? Who had feelings about it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. I just know that as time went on, each summer I would not want to go back. [00:34:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: but you're not even sure, for example, did you kick and scream and let them know, "I hate it there," or was it an internal feeling but you never told them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even remember a major discussion. I'm sure there was maybe, but I don't remember it at all. At all. I'm pretty sure I was excited that we were moving back, but I don't remember it at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you told the story you said, "And, of course, the other part is because I wanted to come back, " but it's not actually clear. Did they come back, in part, because you wanted to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, they did. Over the years it's come up and they've been like, "It was better for you and, with the way things were going at work . . . " I don't think there was any resentment. My dad might have been, because when they came back, there was some family with my mom's, as happens . . . but I never felt they were upset with me. I never felt that. Maybe on some level, maybe with my dad, but I never sensed anything at all. (pause) [00:36:09] Whatever other shitty things, they always did want the best for me, private schools and pushing me to do well. The problem is, though, that's not enough, number one. And, number two, it's just very innocent. The states don't work that way. This isn't the old world where it's just that kind of innocent, homogeneous "leave your door open" and all the neighbors were all Assyrian or all Italian or all Icelandic or whatever the fuck. It's all about money here. It's all about you've got to somehow . . . that's why this country exists. It's the one place where no one gives a shit who you are and you can make money. You can keep reinventing yourself and switching jobs. You either take advantage of that or you don't. That's all there is to it; and they took advantage, I guess, because we're okay, but if they had just been a little savvier and had their eyes open, it would be very different. It would be totally and completely super-upper middle-class by now. [00:37:28] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. At 12:20? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: 12:50.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 12:50. All right, I'll see you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[00:03:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry I'm a little late. (pause) I think I need to get some (inaudible) from my car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to get...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible). My lips are chapped and I can't talk right. I'll be right back. I'm just parked right over here. [00:04:13] (silence) [00:05:54] Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Now I can talk right. If my lips are chapped then I can't talk.] (ph) Hi.</p>

<p>So Jessica (sp?) left on Friday, pretty much on time. We're late for everything so — (inaudible at 00:06:13) work Friday, like one or two in the afternoon. She arrived in Virginia on Saturday night. So she did it only with one night's sleep, you know, one night in a hotel, which was pretty cool. She didn't call me when she got in, which was a little frustrating because I was worried about her. I had to wait till the next morning and I talked to her dad. But I think she was probably just exhausted. She'd just driven ten hours or something straight. I don't know. [00:06:54]</p>

<p>First a mix of emotions. I miss her a lot. (pause) I don't know. [I want to know] (ph) — [the stuff that we said to each other] (ph) when we said goodbye was like, "Well first of all this isn't goodbye forever, and this isn't the end of everything for us." That there's infidelity and there's the drug use and that stuff, which are two huge issues in and of themselves, but beyond those we're — another one is just being able to be self-reliant, and if we can't be — I phrased it perfectly when we were saying goodbye to each other. It was kind of a hopeful kind of thing to say. [00:07:57]</p>

<p>As long as we are unable to be self-reliant as individuals, as long as we're not able to be able to support ourselves individually, then how we can expect to be able to satisfy that more together? I'm talking about financially, but otherwise as well.</p>

<p>I'm really tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you not sleep last night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I couldn't get to bed. I couldn't get to sleep. I did eventually obviously, [but it was like] (ph) 2:30 or something. [00:08:50]</p>

<p>So I don't know what's going to happen. I just know she's down there, and she is catching up on — she's just catching up with her dad who's there, and I guess she's going to start looking for work today, yesterday, I don't know — start looking for work. [It's too bad she has to be] (ph) in Virginia. It's just like I don't know what other solution there was, in terms of if we're going to move separate from one another, what do we do? Who is where? The obvious conclusion is she goes to Virginia and I stay here, which is exactly what happened.</p>

<p>On Wednesday of this week I'm driving up to Vermont, and I'm going to be staying at my dad's house for a little while. I don't know if I told you about how I'm going to paint his house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned that. [00:09:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So we've hammered things out, and he's thankfully not going to pay me a flat rate for the whole house. He's going to pay me by the hour so there's less — my folks always do these things where they like — especially family members. They set up situations which are supposed to be mutually beneficial, but somehow or other wires get crossed, there's miscommunication — it's usually them (ph) being a hardass because people are like hanging on to them — I don't know if I'm explaining it. Like he's the employer, I'm the employee kind of thing, and I've just seen it happen. My aunt, my sister and me — I mean, it's how they do these kinds of things. You know, "We're offering you a place to stay without rent. Room and board and food pretty much, and you paint our house and we pay you a flat rate." But here's the thing. It might set up some situation where — [00:10:43]</p>

<p>You know, I want them to save some money if they're having me paint the house, and I'm kind of in a not bad spot, but you know, in a tough spot financially in terms of employment right now. If I can go paint their house, sure, have them save a little money because I'm doing it. I'm happy to help out. But it's also cool that they're paying me. That's great. But they do something where like (pause) the actual price tag for having a professional painter come in and do it would be like say $4,000 plus materials, and they do something like try to pay me like $2,000. You know, it's like something like that, where I'm just like, "Well, it doesn't make any sense."</p>

<p>So anyway, I talked to my dad and figured out the hourly rate was the best way to go so we don't get in any kind of situation where anyone feels like they're being taken advantage of. Because that's I think the root of what ends up happening. That and my stepmother is just such a bitch about stuff sometimes. I mean I love her. She's been probably one of the most concrete, even-keeled people in my life. She always is. I mean, she's boring as all get out, but (inaudible at 00:12:09). She gives really good advice (inaudible) take some time apart from all — I mean, she calls things. Like predicts things are going to happen way before they do. Not predicts, but she's like, "You can come up here and stay with us for a few weeks, and Jessica will go down to Virginia," and that's what ends up happening. I don't know.</p>

<p>I don't think this summer camp thing is going to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want it to, but I received an e-mail from him saying, "I think I'm going to be all right for this summer, but give me a call when you're in town and we'll meet up." It's not the answer I wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you were really looking forward to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really am. Yeah. (pause) I don't know if there's any way to get — (pause) [00:13:19]</p>

<p>Do you have any questions? I don't know how much I'm going to be able to just talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you wanted to meet with me, so my question is sort of how I can help you in this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Just to talk things through. I have Timothy and that's great, but you also have the couple's perspective. I don't want to — like I said last week, I don't want me coming in here, if Jessica is coming back and she's in couple's sessions, I don't want anything — I don't think that — I think you're very objective. I don't think it's an issue at all, but I don't want — if I come in here and see you individually if that will make — create a situation where Jessica feels like she's at all — it's lopsided at all. Do you see what I'm saying? There's something to be said for you being the counselor of us as a couple, and not seeing us individually. But all I'm saying is right now I need to see people, and seeing you to kind of regroup after Jessica actually leaves is really helpful. So I guess that's how — if it makes any sense. [00:14:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah. I guess I want — yeah. There's two perspectives. There's me being your couple's therapist, and there's also the vantage point of like what — because I imagine there's a reason that you didn't ask for an extra session with Timothy and decided to come here too. So I wanted to understand (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's because you — Timothy has never met Jessica, and you've been in sessions with both of us for a while so — I don't know. I guess that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think — so go with that, because why — you know, that's clearly important to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Just continuity. I mean I don't know. It's just — I'm not sure. Maybe I do need just to talk to Timothy about this stuff, because he is my therapist. [00:15:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this isn't to say that I'm not welcoming you to be here. It's just to understand that there's a need that you're having that —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know that it's a conscious need. I think it's just one of those things where — we have a saying in the woodshop, or any shop you should have this saying, or any of our life maybe. "When in doubt, don't." So that's to say if you've got a problem and your machine is set up, right? When in doubt, don't. Okay, worst case scenario if you go ahead and do something when you're not quite sure, it's a safety thing, and you lose your finger. That's the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>The other one is you mess the piece up because you didn't know what you were doing. So you had a doubt about it, but you went ahead and did it anyway. There's several different things that can go wrong. So if you don't know, there's no stupid question to ask your boss, because he'd be happy to take the five or ten minutes off to explain something to you, or wait until next week till he's back to explain something to you, as opposed to go ahead and try to do it now and lose all of the time and energy that went into getting the piece to where it is before you messed it up. [00:16:16]</p>

<p>So anyway, I'm just thinking about this stuff. It's like if I — sort of the opposite of that, but I was talking to my stepdad or something, and he'd say, "Avail yourself of as many AA meetings that you can get. Go and talk to as many counselors as you can. Hash it out. There's no such thing as too much of this stuff." So when Jessica was leaving and you were talking about the appointment for next week, "Jessica is leaving so [you're not] (ph) going to be here on Monday," and I'm realizing (ph) "I don't think I'm going to be here on Monday either." It was like, "Okay, I'd still like to come." [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's think about what you need going forward, even if we just think about it for the summer. So yeah, I know that you were really sort of — are you going to be able to stay awake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't apologize. It's just —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I literally rolled out of bed [just a few minutes ago.] (ph) I almost always have coffee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think you'll need for the summer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the most important thing is I have — well, you mean emotionally or financially?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything. Everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose the most important thing (pause) — I don't know. There's a bunch of things that are tied for number one, you know? No drug use. [It's not going to be] (ph) I'm any closer to being back in with Jessica. [It's not that I'm going to be] (ph) any closer to having a date with another girl, not that that's the objective. It eats my finances up. There's that. [00:18:09]</p>

<p>Having a job. Got to have a decent job. If it's not — that's why camp solves so many problems, because it was a place where I couldn't use drugs. It was a space where I'd have a job and being paid but I wouldn't be able to spend any of the money. It's a place where — promotes healthy lifestyle, because by right now I'd already been up for almost two hours, you know? My old man wakes up at 5:00 in the morning, and gets to work at 6:30 or something. (pause) I don't know. (pause) [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How have you been doing with not using?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's better and it's worse. It's better, it's worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is it better and when is it worse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the worst when I'm really stressed out. It's an escape thing for me. I don't know. [I guess it was last] (ph) — Jessica didn't go to work during this last week — last week she didn't go to work much because she was packing stuff up. I actually ended up missing a day of work because I was helping her move things and pack the car and everything like that. She didn't go to work (inaudible) Tuesday or something like that. I went and I was by myself so I called my dealer and I got high. I think this was right when — we saw you on Monday, and at that point we decided she was leaving, right? But that was like the first day where I wasn't around her. I just had the freedom to do whatever I wanted sort of, so I did. [00:20:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you get the money when you need to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get a paycheck. I'm not completely destitute, but it results in us being completely destitute. It's sad. It should be a non-starter. It should just be a why do you think you have — like let alone what you're doing to your body, let alone what you're doing (inaudible) emotionally, [and also their shit.] (ph) Like how do you stand on two feet financially like that? It doesn't make any sense. The point is the last time I did it I think was on Tuesday afternoon, since I've been taking my Suboxone. [00:20:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much time passes between the thought that you're going to use and that you call your dealer? How long a time does that usually take?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's no time at all. [You think] (ph) I should stop and think and let it pass — it's like cravings. Stop and let it pass. I just take my Suboxone. That's the thing that really does it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, right. One of the questions is how to — what to build in so that even if there's five minutes — five minutes is a lot longer than zero.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Instantaneous, yeah. The inclination [and right to phone.] (ph) I should erase the phone number. That's what I really should do. But that's ludicrous because I can still look it up in my logs, you know, at sprint.com or whatever. [00:21:53]</p>

<p>I don't know. I went and met with Dr. Patton (ph). She's an addiction person. I was talking to her about it. I'm going to see her next week. I'm going to tell her about me using on Tuesday. I don't lie to her about this stuff. It's not like it's okay, but when I saw her last it had been at least six weeks since I had seen her, and I saw her last week, or week before last, but regardless, she indicated to me that — I told her a number of times I had relapsed, and she said, "Well, I'm really surprised it wasn't more given the shit you've been dealing with." I don't know — she's not advocating it. She's just saying, "I'm not surprised."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In addition to getting the prescription, does she give you techniques around — like what's the premise of your meeting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I see her for an hour at a time. It's like you're having a private session with an addiction specialist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kinds of things specifically do you work on? [00:22:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We talk things through. We go through the Big Book, the AA Big Book, go over different — basically different ways that Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous applies to whatever situation I happen to be dealing with. So instead of just talking with Timothy, where we're just talking it through and I can express myself however I want, all this other stuff, it's way more concrete because she's like, "Okay, let's look this kind of thing up in this book." And I trust it. I trust the book. It's not like — it's a text of modernity. It's not like a Bible, you know? It's something that makes a lot of sense in where it's coming from. It's the basis of the rehab program I was in, and it's the basis of when I go to those meetings. So anyway. Just talking about — what I talked to her about most recently was resentment. I had to deal with resentment. How to acknowledge the fact that Jessica's infidelity was nothing to do with me necessarily. It wasn't about me. She wasn't thinking about me when she was doing that. [00:24:17]</p>

<p>I need to go to meetings. That's what I need to do. When I've been most successful in not using has been when I've been going to the meetings regularly. There's a correlation. It's obvious. It annoys the hell out of me, because the meetings are dreadfully boring and I don't really like hearing about a bunch of people's problems like that. I mean, I do, but you know what I mean? There's camaraderie or whatever, but I'm not a very committed person for AA or NA, you know? I'm just not. I should be more so. I'm way more than other people, way more than Jessica was. Jessica hasn't gone to one single meeting since she got out of rehab last summer. Not one. And I'm not trying to compare myself with her, but the point is I go to them occasionally. But the points where I've had the longest stretches without using, like the two months and those kinds of things, have always been when I've been attending at least one weekly meeting. [00:25:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does anyone — does either Timothy or — I'm sorry. I keep forgetting her name, the addiction specialist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dr. Patton. (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dr. Patton. (ph) Do you guys talk about specific skills to delay the time between the urge and the calling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I use the Suboxone. [If I take] (ph) Suboxone I won't call the guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but you have to take the Suboxone. I mean, that's a theory, but that's not an actual practical step.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't want to not talk about the drug stuff because I know it's really important. I'm worried about Jessica being down there and her using drugs again. I'm really worried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's nothing you can do about that. [00:26:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I'm worried about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it really is important to understand what sort of is driving your use, but until you get a handle on this, nothing can happen. Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean like in terms of working on myself and that kind of stuff?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing. I mean, honestly, all the understanding about one's self in the world does nothing if you continue to use. I don't necessarily think that all the understanding about one's self helps one not to use. It definitely is helpful, but it's not the main factor, I don't think, at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:26:54) not using.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obviously, in terms of what I do, I'm not an addiction specialist. I believe very much in sort of understanding one's feelings. I'm not at all minimizing that, but until you get a handle on not using, nothing else happens. [00:27:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was doing so well. I really was. That two-month thing I was talking about? That's where I was at when Jessica told me that she was cheating on me, whenever that was — February or whenever it was. I had gone like two months. Then she told me about that stuff, and then — what's the correlation there, you know? I know there is one. [I'd gone] (ph) two months — like literally, my mom died, and in the wake of my mom dying I had a horrible relapse. Right after she died, I went and used a lot, okay? We went up there right after she passed away. Went up to Vermont right after she — right after she was hit with a truck, and we were there for the weekend. Then we came back, and then for like 48 hours I had a binge. It was just intense. Silly, stupid, but that's what I did. [00:28:18]</p>

<p>In the wake of that, I went right back, and I just didn't use again for the longest time. Then basically Jessica told me about this thing, and that's I guess all the excuse I needed or something. It made me so upset I was beside myself. So that's when I started using again. I'm not blaming Jessica. I'm just trying to identify it. (pause) [00:28:54]</p>

<p>I just want to know what are healthy ways for Jessica and I to be in communication or not, and how we need to define boundaries, and all that kind of stuff. That's what I really want to talk about. I'm not trying to say that I can't — I'm not trying to say the drug stuff isn't a problem. I know what you're saying. It's like you can't do anything else. I just — I'm doing so much better now than I was. I started going — like she's gone. She's been gone, what, three days now? Right? Four days? I just want a hint (ph) like — we talked about inertia in life. (inaudible) maybe positive inertia. Using drugs is not a good one. I haven't picked up since she left. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been okay since she left?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't called the dealer. I haven't used since she left. I've been taking my Suboxone like a good (inaudible). I don't know. That's hopeful, right? Reaction to your wife leaving might be to go get high (inaudible). I need to cut out that whole way of thinking, like reaction kind of stuff, because it's almost like I subconsciously later give myself permission because I let that be a reason that doesn't — okay sure, it's a reason, whatever kid. (ph) But it doesn't take my mind very long to say it's a justified reason. (inaudible) justify it, a huge modifier in that particular equation. It's one that I can trick myself into using. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In terms of deciding about how to communicate or when to communicate, what — this sounds a little more formal than I would like, but what are your goals? What are you hoping to do this summer with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: With Jessica? Or our relationship. I don't know. I really don't. I mean, I don't want — the goal is not to stay married. The goal is not to get divorced. Neither of those things are goals. I think what is important is that we — the goal I need to have — the goal that I have is to maybe to better understand what I want out of the marriage. [00:32:06]</p>

<p>And I think maybe initially right now I just need to figure out — hopefully come to the conclusion that we were right, that in order to be able to figure out what we needed from the marriage, we needed to step back from the marriage for a minute. Hopefully that's right, because if not, we're making a big mistake being separated like this. But everyone and their brother says it's a good idea. (pause) So I guess I should believe it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have doubts about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Totally over the weekend. I miss her. I felt really alone. Like really alone. Really lonely and sad. (pause) I know that she is too because she told me so much on the phone. [00:33:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your plan is to go to Vermont for how long?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's see. Right now the plan is to go to Vermont until the beginning of June, which will give me enough time. Well, end of June. Probably at the end of the first week of June I will be done painting my dad's house, and done doing the odd jobs he needs done around his house. At which point, hopefully I'll be going out to the camp.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought you said it's not happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you don't know? [00:33:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I received an e-mail from the fellow who had been saying it's very much a possibility, and I just received one that says, "You know, I think I may be all set for the summer, but when you come" — he lives — he and his wife, the director of the camp and everything, they live in the same town that I grew up in. So anyway, I'm going to go up there on Wednesday, and hopefully meet with him on Thursday or Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure. Not sure. But I was sure. It was kind of an about-face in his e-mail. I don't know. From saying one thing, like "We're going to meet up. This is a possibility," and now he's coming back saying, "You know, I may be all set," but still a "may." He's being too ambiguous. I wish he'd just be like "yay" or "nay," because he knows me. Maybe he needs to talk to me about what's been going on, like with my wife and stuff, because he knows that she's not going to be there with me. I don't blame him not wanting to have someone who's tumultuous on his staff. He needs staff members to be helpful and relieve stress, not add to it. (pause) There's a little bit of apprehension on my part whether or not I go there and be a wreck, you know? But I don't think so. [00:35:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would you do with Timothy in that? Would you suspend your treatment for the time being?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk) No, I'd come down once a month or something and have an appointment. Because I can get time off, and it's not that far away by car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the month of May you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I was more thinking — because you're going to be gone for —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, in Vermont, you mean? Yeah, well I'm even coming back down because I need face-to-face visits with my Suboxone doctor to get the prescription, and I have MGH (ph) doctor stuff going on. I'm just going to schedule them all around the same time. I'm going to come down and take care of all of them at once. It seems like the sensible thing to do. [00:36:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm just asking real practical questions about continuing your treatment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to. I have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other thing I thought about for you, but it doesn't seem like the summer is going to work because you're not going to be here as regularly, but there's some really good groups at the building where Timothy is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean in that building?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There's some really good groups.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know that building was a — wait, is this here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's it called?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the Institute for Psychotherapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So that's not where Timothy — it's in a building that's like a big, brick building, right? Okay, the place where Timothy sees me is a house. That's on University St., a different place but a few blocks away. The place that Jessica actually goes is to the psychiatric, or psychotherapy — the institute that you just talked about. [00:37:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. Well, I think I learned about him through someone I knew there, so I think he works there part time and then also —</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's really good by the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have a good — it's pretty solid. Maybe I should go there to go to groups. I go to ones in more North.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not AA groups or NA groups.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're psychotherapy — you have to go weekly. You wouldn't be able to go sometimes. You'd have to absolutely go weekly, so that's why I say — there's actually some very good groups there. They're very well-known for their groups, but it would be when you would be able to be here more regularly. [00:37:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How long are the groups — the group is always ongoing but you have to sign up for like eight weeks or something like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, people go to it for more than eight weeks. It's not like something you drop in on. But they have some great groups, and I'd be surprised if they didn't take your insurance. I don't want to guarantee it, but I'd be surprised if they didn't. But I have to — we just exchanged voice messages. I haven't spoken to Timothy yet, but I definitely would like to touch base with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Please do. How much time do we have left?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got like six or seven minutes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I don't know. I think it's the right choice (pause) for us to take some time apart. What do you think? Can I ask you that question? Is that fair?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do I think — I mean, I do have a thought, but what do I think — are you feeling not confident about this? [00:39:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like I'm not confident about a lot of things in life. But it seems like a really big choice, and a really big decision having her drive down there. She's done it. It's happened now. She's there. It's really hard to un-ring that bell, you know, and have her come back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you worried about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just miss her is all I think. There's other stuff going on I'm sure, but that's the fundamental root of it. I miss her, or I don't know whether or not it's a good idea, or maybe I'm lonely at night and during the day. She's always been there. For ten years always been right there. She's not anymore. (pause)</p>

<p>I've been talking to other friends of ours since she left though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For support? [00:40:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [I just made contact with] (ph) a few people, like the day that she was leaving. Only the people that I could be honest with and tell them what was going on. Like, "Yeah, Jessica is about to leave, or has just left. We're getting separated for a little while, but we don't know what's going to happen exactly."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are these friends that you can get together with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, actually they are. (inaudible at 00:40:34) they smoke pot. I don't smoke pot. You meant in terms of drug stuff, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I meant get together with socially so you're less isolated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, they are. It's funny because usually when you talk about friends and something like that if you're dealing with addiction stuff and have been talking so much about it, like "Can you actually hang out with them?" You're like, "Oh no, I can't because they use," or whatever. [00:41:02]</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see them. Anyone that I would call [are people I do want to go see.] (ph) One person that I had an extensive conversation with is the ex-girlfriend of the dude that Jessica hooked up with. (inaudible) have a conversation with her. That was good I guess. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I was asking in large part because everybody needs people in their lives.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so isolated. I really am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and the two of you talked about being isolated, so with her gone it seems really important to figure out ways in which you could be less isolated. [00:42:00]</p>

<p>(long pause) What are you thinking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just feeling sad. I just feel utterly alone sometimes. (pause) [00:43:14]</p>

<p>Kind of — I don't know. I think I'm just going to stop — I think being away from each other is going to curb my anger, which is probably the worst emotion of the ones that I was having. I don't like feeling angry at all. At all. It's the worst. Feeling angry, or feeling like you need to have revenge, or any of those kinds of feelings is really bad. Not having her around I don't think I'm going to — I haven't been as angry. I've been less — actually since she left I haven't been angry much at all. Just sad — sad and maybe a little crazy. I want to be careful that I don't take the energy that was going into being angry and divert it into feeling sad and then I get suicidal or something stupid like that. I don't know how that stuff works. [00:44:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know how you work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is your next meeting with Timothy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to schedule one with him right now actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just realized we have just a couple minutes left and I want to sort of talk about what you'd like to do in here. What would be...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd be happy to come — I would like to come back and see you again if you think it's appropriate. [Also if we can do] (ph) a counseling session with Jessica too, that might be more appropriate even, but I don't know if Jessica wants to do that, or if we can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah, we did talk about (inaudible at 00:44:47), but the first question is does she want to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know yet. Probably not immediately, but she will maybe. I can talk to her about it. You could talk to her about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't talk to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll talk to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm not going to call her and ask her if this is [your new relationship.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I'll talk to her about it. [00:45:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, in general, because Timothy is your individual therapist, it's good for you to continue working with him. Not that I don't want to see you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I [went to see him] (ph) (inaudible) all you gave me to see him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. I'd be happy to see you again. I think it would just be important to sort of outline what we do together if we met from time to time, [what would be the] (ph) main thing. So what would you like to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me think about it. In the meantime there's financial billing stuff that we need to go over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I e-mailed you after you paid me last time. There's today, but I e-mailed you the updated statement. And Jessica didn't give me any credit card information.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, her dad has a new credit card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, but she was going to give it to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she didn't give it to me to give to you so I don't have it. Let me talk to her about that. I talked to my stepdad yesterday. He has it all. I forwarded that stuff to him so he should have sent it off by now. [00:46:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you could check with that that'd be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course. Yeah, absolutely. The most recent e-mail you sent —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had the most updated information.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But none — does it include the appointments that I've already paid for?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It includes the — right. So I included what was paid and then the balance. It includes —</p>

<p>CLIENT: You got all the dates we ever met with each other?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, just all the dates that weren't paid for minus the money — because you didn't pay — the money you gave wasn't for two dates; it was for most of two dates. So I just did the dates, how much was paid of those dates, and what the balance is. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great. Yeah, so if you want Jessica to pay for part of it, or she wants to pay for part of it —</p>

<p>CLIENT: She will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you could e-mail me the next day or so, that would be —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll absolutely do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd really appreciate it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Feel free to be in touch. I hope everything goes well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope so too. [00:47:11]</p>

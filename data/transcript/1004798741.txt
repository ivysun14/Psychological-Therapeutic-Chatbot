<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had my hearing yesterday. And there's still one count outstanding so, those assessment damages, so the judge decided not to assess damages until the final count was decided. So he set a trial date for January 14. Which (pause) I guess I have to do a trial at some point and if there's any (pause) case or count to do a trial on this is probably a good one because it's,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: the woman's just crazy. But I haven't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're just so clearly in the right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's not that, it's just that she's so clearly in the wrong (therapist laughs). There's a slight difference, but I've got a lot of work to do as far as, you know, getting ready for it. [00:01:08] But (pause) at least now I'm getting up early in the morning instead of sleeping 'til ten which is huge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is huge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though I'm waking up all nauseous and full of snot that's dripped down my throat and puking that up (pause) which is pleasant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's happened the last couple of days. I'm supposed to go camping this weekend and see the bluegrass festival and I'm supposed to drive, and I'm driving my car yesterday from the court and all of a sudden this noise starts coming from the (voices overlap, inaudible at 00:01:56)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: this big scraping noise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooh. [00:01:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my buddy, who I was hooking up with for coffee, there's an auto guy in his office and I so he took me over there and they kinda, there was just like a plate rubbing but I need a new (pause) wheel bearing. (Pause) So I talked to my dad and basically we're going to get me a new car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean I've got my check engine light on,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: the air conditioning doesn't work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you put 2,500 bucks into the car in the spring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's like I probably should have gotten a new car in the spring, you know. But, you know, there's lots of deals now and I'm worried because, you know, another monthly payment I can't afford. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause), you know he said that, you know, they'd try to help me out as far as buying, he has to co-sign. You know there's no way I'm getting a loan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:03:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But there's kind of the, now I have to figure out what I want to buy and, you know (pause), have to look at cars and test drive them and do all that crap, you know, which, I don't know, just seems like one more (pause) thing I have to do. (Pause) Jess asked me for legal advice yesterday so I'm one up on her. She had these trials she needed me to review and I was having a really bad day because I had my hearing and I had a title due yesterday and they sent me an e-mail asking me when I was going to have the title in because they're closing today. And I get to the, you know, what I thought was pretty much the end and it turns out that they swapped two small pieces of land with their neighbor, which means I have to go run the neighbor's title for that small piece of land.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in doing so I found all these probates which means I have to go to probate court, and one of them is a storage case which means I had to go there today, request it, and it won't be available until after noon on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:04:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They had already asked for a one week extension so I think, I never heard back from them so I think they got the extension. (Pause) I have to go to the registry and deal with that today and (pause) have to pick Ian up at two-thirty, and pack at some point. I think I'm going to take him back to the apartment and give him the I-phone and the TV and do some packing and getting ready. Originally we were supposed to leave this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the woman (pause) going with (pause) got doored riding her bike, broke her elbow. And I guess she just had surgery two days ago to remove the hardware they had put in there. So I kind of went back and forth and I even told Jess I wasn't going to be able to pick Ian up today, I wasn't going to practice, and then they decided we're not going today we're going tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:05:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, you know we're going to leave, I'm going to sleep over their house and we're going to leave first thing in the morning. And, because I don't think the festival starts until like one o'clock. And (pause) I'm getting some nausea, probably from the Prozac, (pause) but I don't want to tell (inaudible at 00:06:09). The same thing happened with the Wellbutrin and I just kind of sucked it up and it went away after a while. But it's kind of making, you know (pause), it's weird it's, you know, it's like it didn't bother me at all when I was in court yesterday but when I was in the office it bothered me. And it's hard to tell, you know, what's the nausea from the drip and puking in the morning (pause), so I don't know. [00:06:40] (Pause) But I have to figure out how to get a cheap car payment. Then my dad's like, 'no you really should buy a new car'. I can't lease one, I put twenty-thousand miles a year on my car, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really need to get some sort of wagon or sports utility vehicle which is for the kids, you know, to deal with. Carry the kids and the crap, you know. Because I could probably get some small, little Honda or something, you know, and have the small payment. But, you know, that's not going to work out (pause) and I'm not buying a mini van.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) Tempting as it seems (therapist chuckles). (Pause) But my friend who broke her elbow I referred to personal injury, a friend of mine, so I'll get a third of whatever he makes or a quarter of whatever he makes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [00:07:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said we're going to make some money on it so (pause) that will be nice. (Pause) And this (pause) trial I'm never going to get paid on because they're appealing and it's just (pause) it's going to last forever. But (pause) I don't know. I'm kind of getting all of these little, itty bitty landlord/tenant cases which are more a pain in the butt than (pause) anything else. But I'm getting paid on them so (pause) good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish I had more closings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My buddy's getting really busy, his loan officer is busy, the guys I'm doing titles for are busy, you know I'm just not busy. I don't know what's going on. (Pause) I was in CVS, I was hungry and driving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:09:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: for a finance committee meeting. When I came out I ran into (inaudible at 00:09:09).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And (pause) I gave her a hug and she's like, 'you're all sweaty!' (Chuckles) I'm like, she's like, 'I ain't (inaudible at 00:09:23).' But I was wearing the same clothes from the day before and I rode my bike that morning. (Pause) She's looking good though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When doesn't she, right? (Therapist chuckles) (Pause) She's like, 'oh we need to catch up', I'm like, 'no you need to send me some business'.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause, client sighs). [00:10:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm kind of just, I don't know like, (pause) I'm already at the festival, mentally. You know? It's like I'm already checked out. I've got this title stuff to do this morning which is (pause) really a pain, you know. If I have to order one from storage I'm going to wait and finish that up on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I got another one for my friend that's closing next week that, I don't know. That might be storage too, I don't know. Can't remember if it was the 80's or the 90's but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you, are you missing the game then this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The game is Sunday night out of town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. [00:10:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I'll be back to see it, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's not a game here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And (pause) I think this year I'm not going to go to, usually I don't go to one game, I already sold my tickets to this game. But I think I might try to not go to as many games this year just so there's more money in my account.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pay for playoff tickets and next year if (pause), I don't know hopefully by next year things have picked up for me. Because my mom wasn't real happy about paying for the tickets. (Pause) I mean I feel like I'm just, you know, constantly asking them for money. They just sent me a six thousand dollar check and now I need a new car you know and it's just (pause) I'm forty-two years old. Now they talk about these kids graduating college and living in their parents' basement until, like I'm forty-two and should be living in my parents' basement, you know. Or your basement. Someone's basement. (Pause) I don't know, something has to give at some point. [00:12:17] (Pause) But things seem to be getting kind of (inaudible at 00:12:28), things seem to be getting better with Lucille and</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She said, 'you know you need to come by a couple times a week and see her'. I called yesterday, I was driving by and I was in the neighborhood, and Jess never answers her phone. And I was going to try and stop by. But when I went there on Tuesday (pause) she screams, 'da-da!' (Pause) But she's still, you know, (pause) I don't know there were times when she's been more affectionate to me, you know, where she hasn't been as much lately. It's like, you know, (pause) like she doesn't play with me as much. You know she used to give me a toy, or come sit on my lap, or bring me a book, or (pause) she really hasn't been doing that kind of stuff lately. [00:13:21] You know? And (pause) though she wants to kick the ball do that kind of stuff and if she didn't fall and cry every time. 'I'm going to getcha!' she likes that game. (Pause) But her (pause) her daycare posts pictures on the Facebook and so I've been downloading all these pictures of her and she's never smiling in them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's not a smiley, it's from Jess. She's just not a big smiler. You know it's not that she's sad or upset, she's just mellow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just that's, you know, she giggles and (pause) laughs and, you know, is a normal kid but—(pause). And I guess she was in talk therapy or is in talk therapy as well as speech therapy. Because he was telling me about all these different therapies, he's like, 'I like when I go and I talk to the lady'.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Does he know the lady's name? [00:14:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I probably should find out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm surprised they haven't been in touch with you. (Pause) Very unusual in child therapy not to make an effort to talk to both parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) Maybe Jess told them I was dead, (pause) 'oh they don't have a father'. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, chuckles) You know Ian is probably what (zipping noise, inaudible at 00:15:05) in that at some point. I mean that, yeah, if you're six years old dad died that sort of comes up as an important issue in therapy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I hope it warms up this weekend, I'm supposed to camp.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:15:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though my friend, the one with the broken elbow that doctor told her she can't camp so they got a, they ended up getting a hotel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they've got friends coming down so they've already got a couple of campsites</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: so they're going to come hang out at the campsites and then sleep in the hotel. I imagine he just doesn't want her sleeping on the ground or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I don't know. (Pause) My good friend Barbara is going on some horse riding trip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this Barbara from Facebook?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My Words With Friends friend. (Pause) So (pause) I noticed that (pause), you know she posted that she had checked in her trip, you know, I guess that's where her trip starts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:16:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really haven't talked to her much about it, I just read the Facebook stuff. And (pause)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Working at some sort of (inaudible at 00:16:51) maybe she'll find something simple and plain. Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I always notice it's like she, you know, all her friends that comment, most of them are female. And that when men do comment they're married men.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like, is she going to wake up one day and be like, 'alright (pause) I'll get you a shot'? (Pause, therapist chuckles) I don't know. (Pause) I can't let stuff go, just you know. (Pause) It's a fault I guess. It's why I'm separated. (Pause, sighs) Next Friday, you know, I'm going, to see that band play.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:17:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I put a post on Facebook, if anybody wants to go I'm going. I'm kind of excited to go because the opening band, one of the opening bands, I, and they have like a four dollar EP (sp?) and I downloaded it, it's pretty good. So I'm going to try and, there's two openers so they're the first one, and (pause) I don't know. I guess people go to the movies by themselves why can't you go to a rock show by yourself? Have a couple rockatonics (sp?), ride my bike, you know it's in the neighborhood I could probably walk. (Pause) And (pause) it's all new album, it'll probably, she'll probably be playing a lot of stuff from her new album which I haven't heard anything yet so (pause). But it'll be nice. I guess I could buy the album, but I'm so broke. [00:19:09] (Pause) It's like it's hard to believe that I have a six thousand dollar check coming in and I'm broke. But with all these taxes and shit I have to keep paying, and I have to end up paying rent, and (pause) health insurance, and malpractice insurance, that's all coming up, in a week, you know, it's like money's just not there. You know? And I think there'll be some money left over that I'll always be overpaying my rent. (Pause) So I don't pay my rent on the first it's an extra fifty bucks plus late fee, you know, (pause) interest. So I don't know. (Pause) It just seems so hard, you know, to make it. My friend said her last day at work today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:20:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of weird because, you know, she's on the news and she doesn't work a ton of state, you know, she was one of the top attorneys in the AG's office, but I think it's they're just laying her off, you know. (Pause) A lot of unemployed attorneys out there. (Pause) So I guess it could be worse for me (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) But it'd be nice if I could find another Claire, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Someone who could feed me some, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Totally, yeah you're still not really recovered from losing the referrals from her and from</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ray.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ray, yeah. [00:21:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm getting some from Harry, but it's just not enough, you know. (Pause) And October should be a decent month I got a couple, you know a guy buying and selling, and I've got, probably have a couple refis I might close. So it's like it's going to be an okay month, but the beginning of the month is when I need all the money, you know. And I'm actually kind of running the numbers and I might be able to pay an extra rent payment and catch up another month which will be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. This is where you live you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm going to be giving (pause) three months next week. I'm probably behind like six months though because I didn't pay this last month because of my (pause) insurance, you know, just I've got to start focusing on getting money then (pause) at least catching up (pause) when I have the chance. [00:22:34] (Pause) I mean I've got five grand in attorney's fees invested into this case already and it'll be—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the case that's gone to trial?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It'll be even more. (Pause) I put in my plea agreement that doesn't include a deal so if they want an appeal they're going to have to get me some money. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or find another attorney who will do it for free. (Pause, sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't sound quite as at the end of your rope.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have good days and I have bad days. The beginning of the week I was miserable and then yesterday I just, I don't know I mean I was a little nervous about the hearing or whatever but once the hearing was over it was just like a huge weight off my back. Went and had a couple of drinks with another lawyer friend of mine and they had some business for me. [00:23:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it Ben?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, a different attorney. And (pause) so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think stressed you out so much about the hearing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the unknown. I was worried, you know, and just, you know, like am I supposed to have a witness there even though it doesn't, you know I just, finding reasons to stress out. You know what could go wrong? You know? And (pause, sighs) I don't know. Like to a (inaudible at 00:24:45) the trial is nine in the morning so it's like I don't have all day to sit there and dwell on it, you know, it's just wake up and do it. And (pause) the hearing's at two o'clock, and I want to get there early so I get there early and I'm like number eight on the list and so they called me pretty quickly. And (pause) the other attorney's a sheister, just slipped this motion in and handed it to me right there at the hearing, which the judge agreed, he didn't even really listen to the motion he just agreed with her that we shouldn't do the assessment damages until we had the trial. [00:25:32] And (pause) I said to the judge, 'you know she says she's got damages but they haven't told me what they are'. You know this isn't like TV where, you know, things are a surprise, everything's supposed to be disclosed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she hasn't disclosed anything to me. And if she doesn't then I'm just going to have everything thrown out and she's going to have her client just sitting there, you know, ranting on the stand. I've got about fifty e-mails to go through to just show what a lacker (sp?) she is and now she changes her mind and doesn't cooperate and (pause). You know, they're saying part of the interference that they're complaint is that the first floor unit owner asked them to use the back stairs for the open house because she sleeps during the day, she has a night job, nighttime job, 'I don't want people going up my stairs', you know that's just (pause) not really interfering with, you know. [00:26:46] So the claim is that because of that they didn't have an open house. It's like, no you decided that it was better off to rent, and that we didn't, so you never followed through with doing the things to sell, you know. And they haven't disclosed the realtor as an expert, and basically whether they'd be asking of him is an expert opinion. And I'm supposed to get a report, you know, you don't just throw an expert at someone, you know right before trial.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I'm going to have his, all his testimony struck, you know, so they're not going to have a whole lot to go on. But I have to figure out how I do all this, you know. (Pause) So (pause) I figured Jess or Paul could help me out. (Pause) Paul says he has a client buying a condo, commercial condo, in the area [00:28:04] But I would do all the title work and hopefully the title insurance so that would be a nice change. You know where that market is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that guy's expanding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—But there's no (inaudible at 00:28:25) there. [00:28:25] Nowhere to park.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No there's the whole lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't seem big enough for a market. But he's doing very well. I guess part of the reason why I'm not at the end of my rope is because of others.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I stressed a lot about today, getting to today and what was going to happen as far as whether I'm driving up and picking up Ian and soccer practice, and soccer game, and this that, you know. And I know it's supposed to rain today, that'd be nice if it rained and I could just cancel practice. Have to make sure I have all my meds. These little Abilify pills I have to cut into fours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? [00:29:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have to find something to put those in. I don't know (pause). Just felt silly because I see the commercials on TV for (inaudible at 00:29:41). Excuse me. So you're not in line to buy your iPhone 5?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Pause) Be nice to have one, they're supposed to be pretty nice. Bigger screen, (pause) 4G. It's funny though, but it's like when I didn't have 3G I thought when I first got 3G how quick it was. And now I'm like, man it's so slow. So I wonder if the same thing would happen with 4G, I get 4G think how quick it is, and then a couple months into it be like, man this is so slow! (Pause) Kind of tired of all this election crap. [00:30:41] I really can't vote for Obama because he signed the (pause) Indefinite Detention of American Citizens, the NDAA.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which, you know, I was just read—it's ridiculous. So I'm probably going to vote for Jo Stein. She's the Green Party candidate, she's from Massachusetts, she's run for governor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah just some crazy old lady, probably from Cambridge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or there's Ray something, the Libertarian, but he's really Republican. (Pause) Just wish it was all over, I'm tired of all the ads, and the news, and the polls, and the this, and the that. (Pause) I really don't like Scott Brown or Elizabeth Warren. [00:31:57] (Pause) There's something about her that's kind of creepy. (Pause) I just don't trust him, you know. He just doesn't seem like he's honest, an honest person, you know. He reminds me of George Bush, you know he gives this (pause) everybody's buddy kind of guy but it's just all an act, you know. But with her there's just something, I don't know. I don't know if it's the way she looks or the way she, she's very smart (pause). Did you watch the debate?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, exhales).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not good. (Pause, sighs) It was a little chilly riding my bike in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:33:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I need to get a blanket, I'm really cold.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For at night, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's too early to turn the heat on, but (pause) I really need a blanket. (Pause) I made a trip to Target but I don't, well I do know the problem. (Pause) I'm running out of everything. I need soap, I need deodorant, (pause) I need a picture frame. I got my picture of my soccer kids from last year that I still haven't framed. How much can a frame be? You know I'd just get one of those plastic ones, you know, just clear. (Pause) I think I am going to have to be productive next week though. [00:35:08] (Pause) Some stuff I've been letting go, just putting off, I really need to focus on doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what makes it hard for you to work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm lazy. (Pause) You don't accept that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause, chuckles) So why are you lazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I knew that all my problems would be solved. [00:36:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) I gather you don't really want to look into that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean I do but how do you look into these things? I mean do you say (pause), I don't know what you mean. If I knew the reason why I was lazy then why would I be here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what comes to mind about your being lazy, even if it's not the complete, definitive answer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just don't want to do the work. Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow, you know? You know I just kind of want to get out of the office with the least amount of (pause) I don't know, get home so I can sit there and veg (sp?) out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really dislike the work? [00:37:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. You know I really (inaudible at 00:37:25) with the work I do. But I was, well I wasn't lazy in law school, you know. Which is (pause) you know, shows I have the capacity (pause, yawns) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) But yeah I mean if I enjoyed the work I would do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I don't know what work, I mean it's hard for me to find things that I do enjoy, you know (pause, yawns).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean in general or you mean work related?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In general, you know, it's like (pause) I waste a lot of time just sitting around watching TV, you know. I don't read books or I could be productive at home, the only thing I do at home is titles. [00:38:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they have to get done, you know. (Pause) I do a lot of that work, like I'll do the office and just do a title at home so, even though I don't have a good printer. But that's where my scanner is so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) It still takes forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah so I wonder why, you know (pause), it's hard to find things you enjoy doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. Because I'm depressed. Isn't that the root of all my problems? (Pause) Or are all my problems the root of my depression? [00:40:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know there's some of both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the chicken and the egg, kind of simultaneously appear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause) Yeah, it's a relief. Some of it may be depression, but there's other ways to think about that, you know like (pause), do you have any other thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I was waiting for you. You were like 'there are other ways to look at that', I was waiting for another way to look at it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way I look at it? [00:41:11] (Pause) Well there's diagnosis and there's dynamics. And depression is the diagnosis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's related to what your dynamics are, but it's much more non-specific, so (pause). You know for you I think your depression is pretty closely bound up with the feeling of not (pause) having enough, whether it's money, or affection, attention, or sort of pride and satisfaction in what you're doing, there's like always this feeling of being wanting. (Pause) You know, for somebody else it might (pause) more be that being angry and hostile and you don't have that, but you seem more focused on need and yeah that seems the thing. [00:42:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if I was still living at home I'd be angry and hostile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) I think for you, what you tend to be angry or hostile about is not having enough or getting enough. For somebody else it might be fore a different reason. (Pause) Yeah somebody (pause) it'll be, so there's working, is it worth it, is it going to, sort of, do enough for you? Like yeah you can clean your apartment and make everything nice but (pause) you still have to (inaudible at 00:42:17) or mow the field (pause) much warmer something (pause) not worth the work because it doesn't give back. Where you're still getting kind of the, like your deal is such a raw one that it's hard to. (Pause) In any case that's gotten less true, like as you've had money come in more at work it gets easier to work because you see something coming back even if it (pause) you know isn't much, but it's still what. Well we should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) See you back here on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should feel refreshed and ready to take on the world.</p>

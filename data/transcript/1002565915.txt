<p><b>DR:</b>	I was just going to ask you how many more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No more, but, um, I'd rather have it like this than just getting that one out of diapers and then start all over again [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, um, boy or girl?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Girl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  You excited?  You nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.  Not to be nervous so much, but, uh, that's pretty normal.  I bet your, uh, family's excited.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Babies are lots of fun.  Sure you don't want to do more, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sure you don't want to do more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I'm very sure.  Very sure.  [INAUDIBLE] I said no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can always get them untied.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Starting to build on to the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You doing it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I'm starting to build on to the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you or you got somebody doing it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, I've had my, well, my cousin he's doing it, older cousin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's a contractor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He knows what he's doing I hope.  What are you building?  A nursery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well, we're adding about 1,000, a little bit over 1,000 square feet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nursery and what else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, no, we're adding a new master bedroom, master bath.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have, how many bedrooms do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many bedrooms you got?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We only have 3.  That's why we need another bedroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we're going to have 4 and no more children because we'll only have 4 bedrooms and I'm not adding on again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's pretty exciting though.  Is she feeling okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she, she has days.  She's big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She hasn't gained that much weight, but she's [INAUDIBLE], but she also had, had a period, like some days she gets really exhausted and couldn't hardly breathe and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sent her to a heart doctor and now she's on heart medicine.  They said her heart was racing whenever it shouldn't and then whenever it should, it wasn't racing.  They did a [INAUDIBLE] ultrasound of it and she had to wear that thing for a day.  Now she's tired all the time, but she's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I imagine.  She's getting a little swollen too, isn't she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm the one that swells.  She doesn't swell.  Nothing but her stomach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My hands swell, feet swell—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yours do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Back hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she don't get none of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's funny.  Not funny funny, but interesting funny.  Sympathy swelling, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess, she don't.  She thinks it's funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's not.  What do you do in your free time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, enjoying the kids and we went off on our, for our anniversary to the mountains, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Spent the weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was it?  How was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You had a good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] with no kids.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No you won't.  That's a big, uh, that's a big change.  I remember talking to my one son once.  He said the first kid they were talking about wanting to live more in the city and so they could, you know, be part of the action and doing stuff and then he goes, wait a minute, I've got a kid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I once wanted to live out of the country.  Because your life is different then.  You don't realize it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] every day [INAUDIBLE] and dream—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doing the bath and changing the diapers and eating and playing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All of those things.  That's what's exciting though, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can be.  Your family's well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep, they had, um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it kind of took him a long time, they did it the microscopic way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But they, um, had to cut him 3 different places because he, because he was too big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the groin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too big?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] fat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he got pretty big.  I mean his stomach's cut, pretty much cut out in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's changed since I seen him last.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they said, said that he must have got bigger since the last hernia that they took out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, he'd probably lose that weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he's losing some now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably want to do that because otherwise, uh, he'll get it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	mom's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you came over here by yourself today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, [NAME OTHER]'s out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He had to come to [DEIDENTIFIED] for something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So tell me about work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's good.  Busy, but not so busy.  Everybody's starting to cut back a little bit.  Like [DEIDENTIFIED], my main company I think called and said they were going, you know, they're, they're buyers were cutting out until after the election, but we've got through the month, end, you know, next month and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You all sweating?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.  Now if it went on for a long time, I imagine eventually we could, but right now we're, we still got work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]'s your main, uh, customer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's our main, yeah.  We have 2, we have a couple of other companies, but that's a steady flow of work all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?  That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd say probably 90% of our work is from them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're pretty dependent on them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think you ought to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think you should do?  Anything different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no.  I mean we, our prices have never changed ever since, you know, everything else has went up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean should your business continue to be dependent on them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's not that many other people that's doing tanks.  They get most of the work.  Like the other companies that we have, we used to get a good little bit of work from them, but [DEIDENTIFIED]'s pretty much gotten all of their jobs.  They tend to, hadn't heard from some of them in a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] pretty big?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they have, they have places in, um, where is it?  [DEIDENTIFIED] and Alabama, [DEIDENTIFIED].  They have 3 offices.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Companies like that usually, uh, like want to buy your company.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, they wouldn't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're kind of slack.  They have enough time to try and even do what they do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On the way up here, one called 3 times trying to find out what they had.  They're on [INAUDIBLE] jobsite and what they had at the jobsite that the tank's being put up at.  They're always like, I really don't understand how they not went up under because they're very irresponsible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then how—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The people that work there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happens to you then if that happens?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you got to make sure that you cover your butt like with paperwork and stuff because they'll try to put it on you.  Like they sent something down there and we didn't ship it and if you let the paperwork slide, you'll pretty, that happened one time.  Something didn't get to the jobsite and they didn't send paperwork and didn't let it go out and it was like the handwritten paperwork, you know, and then got to the jobsite and they were saying that we had something on the yard that we didn't have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause they ain't going to let [INAUDIBLE] get in trouble if they can blame it on somebody else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And we hope that their company continues to do okay, but like you say, they're cutting back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, that part I said that some of their people are, some of their buyers are going to be cutting back until after the election.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that got to do with anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I have no idea.  And it might not be.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, as far as your role at work, has it changed any here in the last few months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You learning more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got pretty much all of it learned.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Got all that chemistry down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's complicated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.  Aggravating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] got his first laptop computer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just the other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, because he wanted to look up drag boat racing stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, not for work, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I put the work stuff on it in case if our computer, you know, crashes like it has before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have a backup?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but he wanted that for drag boat racing, looking it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You guys don't have a backup?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Computer crashes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] my backup discs and stuff and it crashed before and then I have to like do stuff on the typewriter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't lose everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I always have like backup hard drives and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's scary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, one time it crashed whenever I first started working.  About a year after I started working there and I didn't have backup discs and now that that was a mess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can imagine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Have I learned from that experience?  Now I have CD's and hard drives.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's so easy too.  You have to take tapes and take them home with us—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take them home every night—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just in case because that's the heart of your business, you know?  You wouldn't know what the heck, you wouldn't have any idea where to start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.  You start from scratch—formulas, everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] all the past stuff that you had stored in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you take home, you put in onto your laptop and take it with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you do much work at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.  Every once in a while just like an invoice or a quote, but usually not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm impressed how well you've done with your work.  I mean [INAUDIBLE] you really kind of, kind of moved right into it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, didn't get, I always had something, knee replacement surgery, hernia removed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's all [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but the plan was for you to take it over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, I'm, that's what I'm saying, I have to do something because that's what my family depends on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  How much longer's he going to be involved [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, as long as he can.  He's not one to turn around and quit.  He—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he's getting—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] to sit in that house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he giving more and more of the decisions to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, and it's not just me like we always, he always talks to me whenever he made one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gets your input?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He gives you your grade?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You guys think alike.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much, yeah.  Most of the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your wife and family, and your family getting along good still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and her family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Yeah, get along very good.  Her mom came and stayed down a few, a few days about a week whenever she went to the heart doctor.  That was nice.  Her mom's funny.  Anytime [INAUDIBLE] her mom would be always on my side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  She said it would be nice if you were on my side for one time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's funny.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And her parents and my parents get along real good.  Everybody [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and your wife don't fuss with each too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we bicker but we bicker.  That's, most people think we fuss all the time, but that's how we talk to each other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?  Teasing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't tease the kids.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't like that.  All the grandparents good with the kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, they's crazy about that last one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's awesome.  Your medicine okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You forget it often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Healthy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have a sore throat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've been sick a while?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Since about Friday.  I though it was just allergies and I still think it's more from allergies, but now I kind, I think I've got a little puss on my throat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No fever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um, I haven't had any fever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You on any medicines besides what I'm giving you right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um, well, um, I went to the doctor yesterday and they gave me that Z—Pak and I know that's not going to work, but I'm doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not going to work, but you're going to take it anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what are, what are your hobbies?  I hear your dad's got the racing stuff, but what do you got?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I much like working outside in the yard, kids and stuff.  I guess you'd say like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like to do on your weekends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Go the hardware a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Go to the hardware?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  As my wife says find something to do and I always look for something to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She didn't have a list for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I help out in the house a lot.  Everyday she tells me, she, she always [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The, the addition, you going to help with that a little bit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Smart.  Get it done.  It's been started though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How stressful is that for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not bad.  I thought it would be, but we from the very beginning said that we were not going to let it get, you know, not going to let it become an issue and like we have saved up now, for a while we had like $15,000 to start off—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that we don't have to, we wanted [INAUDIBLE] so that we wouldn't have such a huge, and then mom and dad's going to help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And see the part of the house we stay in now is pretty much paid off.  So it won't be that bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're saving money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got retirement with your company, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're kind of a putterer, your hobby.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, pretty much.  Sometimes I, I like to take things apart, but I can't actually—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can't get them back together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, I put them back together.  They just don't, they always have that extra part.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got to write things down.  You got to, got to plan these, uh, these constructions that you do.  How's the work [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not too bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too well, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], 168.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, you are one consistent young man.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that what it was last time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  You don't do much with your old friends, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't do anything with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My sister started dating somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you approve?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm, I guess.  He's kind of quiet.  Trying to get to know him a little bit, but he's shy.  I don't have nothing against him.  Don't really know him that well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's he do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he can't give you any discounts.  So that's a waste.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No free samples, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I didn't know they made those down here, or where's that factory at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He lives in, um, around [DEIDENTIFIED].  I think it's something like [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know, something like that I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where does she live?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right across the road from me.  About, well, she's working in [DEIDENTIFIED], about 30 minutes away—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From our house.  So it isn't that far.  He comes down a lot.  The only thing I think about it is like [NAME OTHER], even when they, she was married before—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], her and [NAME OTHER] were, you know, that was the only thing and, you know, everything was like [NAME OTHER] won't stay at nobody else's house because she's got to be with her mama.  I done told her that sh, you know, just can't cut her off her attention just like that because for 8 years that's all it's been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where's his family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	His parents, his family lives in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your parents okay with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sound like it might be something serious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I, it seems like it might be.  I think she must have talked to him a little bit before she ever told anybody, you know, about him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So talked about what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before she ever told anybody that she was talking to him because she must have talked, had been seeing him for a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause as soon as I heard about him, then he was started coming around all the time.  So I know she didn't just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Meet him.  However, she did meet him online.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretty common.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I feel they need to just stick with the old thing, you know, in person, you know?  So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, lots of people don't, that's how people communicate now too online and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I know.  That's like my wife with her business.  I mean she never talks to a person [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  It's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's always either a text message or an e—mail.  If she don't check her e—mail one day, she'll have 90 some the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then they wonder why all the time they're confused because she never, I bet half the time she doesn't even know their phone number.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that's [INAUDIBLE] confusion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean couldn't you imagine, you know, like [INAUDIBLE] or something and then they don't show up or she [INAUDIBLE] because she texted or e—mailed and they didn't check their e—mail.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said you need to at least talk to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's just like if you ever call for help, you always got to talk to a machine first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Press 2, press 3, press 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, they do that with, um, um, kids ever since that think in [DEIDENTIFIED] where they had the shooting, the, uh, colleges, uh, have a warning system so that if there's a problem on campus, they notify the students.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the way they notify them is my e—mail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I bet, like how many people are going to be actually checking their e—mail right then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean that's what they do though.  They'd say, well, I sent you an e—mail.  Well, okay.  I don't think it's a good system either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or the texting.  I think people—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, people text so much driving down the road and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Driving trains.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think people can get away with more that way though.  I think they can lie.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I had [INAUDIBLE] go the way, more the way with, um, videophones—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because it's harder to lie to somebody when you're looking at them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think that would be useful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Come out where you are.  You know, like even at business, even—</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR This is Wednesday, February 10th, Wednesday, February 10th. [00:03)</p>

<p>PATIENT (Sighs) This is a fun morning. (chuckles). I just, I guess I'm kind of excited. Because I went to a running class last night, so I'm going to start running, I think. Then it was so funny because I sat down with myself last night and I was thinking, I was laying on the floor, "Okay, now. Why were you so critical of the class?" Well then I was thinking "Maybe it's because I don't really want to take gym classes" and it's all because of the girlfriend and there's this big thing that I have. </p>

<p>And then I said to myself "No, it's not that, and then I tried to-and it was funny because this is one of the first times I've sat down with myself and figured out, you know, are you really doing something because, you know...let's see...because you almost feel like you are being forced into it by somebody else's ends...[00:53]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hmm </p>

<p>PATIENT ...or are you doing this because it's really something you really wanted to do, only, you know, it is like an excuse thing, "Well I'm just quitting because of this and that and the other thing and I'm going to something else because of my girlfriend, because of this, because of that." And I guess, I guess maybe the thing that concerns me, too, is my girlfriend says the other day "Well, you don't do anything you don't want to do, really." You know. "You won't really change unless, unless you are really forced." [01:19]</p>

<p>So that got me thinking and I realized that, really, this is something I wanted to do. It is like a den (ph). 0:01:23.8 It's beautiful, and we have gorgeous art and it's not real rough. I like that, too. But, I don't know, that got me thinking on it and I thought to myself, you know, like, I have lied to myself like lots in my life. And realized that, like I'll say-sometimes I will go into things like if the timeline is (inaudible at 0:01:41.2), this is like six months ago, I was just following, you know, like I didn't know where it all would go...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hmm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...somebody would say "Do this." I'd say "Okay"(chuckles) You know. Like I didn't know what do to and like...I guess I've been sort of like that all my life where people had to push me into doing anything because-I don't know why, but I just feel like I never really did any thinking on my own or I had no choice, it seemed like, in what I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR How does that connect with (inaudible at 0:02:09.3) you're lying to yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT Well...let's see-I guess like sometimes I would say that I was doing something because I wanted to and I really wasn't. You know, she brought this up before I said "No, no, no, you're full of bull." You know. [2:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR So what you're finding out is something inside you-it is, you can...</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. Something in me that like, you know, like, I'm getting to be able to make-you know-and it looked like...like....like I said, I was real critical with that class last night. There were things I didn't like and things I did like. There were more things I did like than what I didn't like. I liked the way the class itself was run, you know. And, and like I said, for the first time, like, I've looked into something. And like I could compare because I've already been in another art in that same field...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Right. (Both speakers speaking, unable to discern what each was saying [02:55]</p>

<p>PATIENT Right and it made me feel kind of good because I'm moving ahead. I had to look up the club, I had to get up there, I had to find out where it was when I got there. All sorts of things that have just been like-maybe it was nothing, I felt like a real accomplishment. When I came out of there I felt so good. Partly not just because I was going into something I thought I would enjoy, but because I had done something on my own without anybody pushing me into it. And it was like-it was like a big thing. Because, even like going to therapy, I knew I needed it, but like I didn't-well, I didn't know at the time-I knew I had a problem... [03:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...but I didn't know where to go. I didn't think that maybe I should go to a psychiatrist or whatever, you know. My group (ph) is "Ah no. You go here." And I said "Okay, I'll go." And it was like I really wanted to get rid of the problem but it was still like the same thing again. It was like I was still going into it because somebody else said "Well, now you can go here and you can do this and you can do that." "Okay, I'll do it." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm (coughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT I used to feel so dependent and now I don't feel so dependent anymore. It's really a funny thing. It is getting to the point like-when nobody talked to me-well, somebody did talk to me when I came in. But like, at one time this would really hurt me and I'd feel "Oh God, I'm not wanted." And then "What am I going to do?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And now for the first time, I really didn't feel like that. I walked into this place-and I watched the whole class, first of all. You know, if anybody had talked to me I wouldn't have heard or seen them because this was something I was interested in. And then, like after the class, nobody talked to me and I had to kind of seek out the instructor, the teacher, because he would go walking here and there and I said "Wait, I want to join this class." I couldn't catch up to him. Like when I finally did and everything, you know, when I talked to him, I didn't feel like I needed him to talk to me in order to take a special interest in me or something, you know. And the first thing I thought was "I'd better get into something else." This was before. "I'd better get into something else and then I can find friends of my own" and then I thought "You know, it is really funny-when I go in there I don't care if nobody talks to me and I don't care if nobody is my friend and I don't..." It is just so funny because I just don't care. I just...I want to be there and I want to learn the art and I saw that everybody has helped in that whole class. There is a black belt helping everybody and he shows everything again, like three and four times until you get it...[05:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...and I said aside from that, that is all I care about now. If I meet somebody there, fine. If I don't, I don't care. It is so funny because I said to myself "I really don't!" (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT You know, for once in my life, I don't care if I walk in here and nobody likes me. You know, and it's like-I've never really felt that way. I've always been like "I want to be accepted so badly." </p>

<p>PATIENT Yes</p>

<p>COUNSELOR And I feel like a real need that when I meet somebody they've got to like me. </p>

<p>PATIENT Uh Huh</p>

<p>PATIENT You know. And its like now, at the office, people are starting to ask me to go out to lunch with them and everything...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR This is all new. (both speakers speaking at the same time)</p>

<p>PATIENT I'm starting to feel like I don't care. Yeah. People are coming to me now. I'm not going out and thinking "Oh jeez, I've got to make them like me." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Uh Huh</p>

<p>PATIENT They don't like me, to hell with 'em.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Uh Huh</p>

<p>PATIENT It's like with my (inaudible at 0:05:50.4) Like she said one day-yesterday, she was mad-not mad, but she was busy. And so I was reading something out loud because I actually wanted to share it with her. It was kind of funny. It was one of those stupid chain letters. And she said, "Could you read that to yourself?" I'm busy." Well, you know, at one time, I'd think "Oh Jesus, nobody wants me. She doesn't want to listen to me, she doesn't like me." and all this bull and then I realized "She's busy. Okay." You know, right now she can't share anything because she's busy. She's got other things to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But I guess before it was you were so sensitive you were retaining people's words...</p>

<p>PATIENT Everybody's. No matter who it was. No matter whether they were as advanced even as I was. I mean, like, anybody who was above-"Yes" (chuckles) "Whatever you say. Yes, okay, I'm stupid, I'm dumb, I'm this," You know. Like I don't know anything and I wouldn't-rather than getting out and doing something-see now I'm doing two things that are new which is really starting to help me, I think. Which is my reading and my running. Because it's two things I'm doing because I want to do them and it's two things-I guess I'm getting more and more secure because, first of all, none of my girlfriends, of my two best girlfriends, are taking. This is something I'm taking on my own and it is different-it is away from them. It is something I don't feel like I need to compete in. [06:58]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Uh huh</p>

<p>PATIENT And it was really funny because I happened to mention that I took gym classes and I said I didn't want to go on two nights to this other girl. I realized that-and I found this out-that it's not completely abnormal to feel that way, like there is a competition going on. It is just like I would feel it more strongly. Because not only would I feel competition but if I didn't make it, I would feel inferior. Not just like "I didn't make it. Okay, so she's better than I am at this." But I would feel very inferior, as though "Shit, there's something else I can't do" or "I can't do it as well as somebody else." You know? [07:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And it would, like, really hurt me. I really felt that-it is so funny and all the sudden I said "Well, I'm not all that graceful." So what! I look like an elephant out there. I don't care! I shocked the heck out of myself because I never think that way. It would always be like "I've got to do this real well and I've got to do that real well." "If I don't do it real well..." I don't know what. What? I'm not as good as somebody else or whatever? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And it was like-this came back I know from a long time ago. I know that now. It is like just following through. I always had to be better. I always had to do more in order to feel like I was loved or accepted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But now it's like you are something. You think things about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. And it is so funny now because I started to sit down and think period. I said lots of times-I even told my girlfriend "Sometimes I might (inaudible 0:08:26.2) because I'm just thinking at the time. And I don't-I say something and then I realize afterwards it sounded kind of rough or something when I said it to her, like I was angry. And I'm not. But it's so funny because I could never do that before. I could never spend the night by myself without just sitting down and eating all night and watching TV. And I mean eat. Like would eat until I was so full I couldn't see straight. And you know, I'd still eat and I'd sit down and cry afterwards and I'd say "Why did I do this?" "What am I doing to myself?" And yet, it was like I had to. It was like a real need. I had to sit down and I had to eat, eat, eat. And now I can be alone or, either she's home, or she's in bed or she's on nap mode or whatever. And like, okay, so sometimes I do take a snack or something. But it's not like I have to sit and constantly eat like that's all I can do. See, because this way I don't have to think. I will sit in front of the TV and I won't have to think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And now it is almost like sometimes I'll think to myself "Ooh she's not going to be home tonight, now I can go home and I can..." I had it all planned the other night, but she was home. I could sit down and I could meditate and do my yoga exercises and things like this that I could do on my own and then I could sit down and I could just have time to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And I've never wanted that before. I just realized that. I have never wanted to just sit down and do nothing-not read or watch TV or something and just sit down with myself and think. [09:49]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT I never wanted to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Be quiet, be alone?</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. Well, I didn't like myself, see?. That was it. I liked being with other people that I could look up and say "This person is so much better than I am." I could look up to them and I could say "Well, maybe someday I might be like that." And then I'd end up trying to take on their complete personality. I would do it unconsciously. I mean, not consciously saying "Now I don't want to be me. I want to be them." [10:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT But it would just be like them. I realized too, when I first moved in with my girlfriend she had a lot to say. I guess that's why now I talk so fast and that, because I never expressed my feeling or anything. I'd just sit there and I'd listen to her because I'd feel like "Well, my feelings are so stupid" or "What I feel about it, she's going to think I'm dumb, so I'm not going to say anything." [10:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT It would make me feel worse because I couldn't say anything to anybody and I didn't trust people at work to tell them my feelings...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...and they would bottle up. And I guess that's the way-it's not just been with her-it's been, like, with lots of people because I never thought they'd understand, you know, if I said something they'd think I'm stupid or whatever. It's like my stepmother didn't understand why I was crying for my mother. [11:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT You know, "You're so dumb", you're so this, you know. Okay, okay, fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR So it comes out so fast because you don't think anybody's going to understand or because you've kept it inside for so long?</p>

<p>PATIENT I think it is more or less because I've kept it inside. See, I'm not afraid to talk here because you're not here to judge me. I would always feel like somebody was judging me and judging what I'm saying and all of this. And, now it just sort of comes out, you know (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT And I'm just sitting there and everything just sort of pours out. It's not like when I was younger and that I keep everything inside. But I still find myself sometimes now getting like when I was younger and I don't know whether it's because-maybe it's a good thing-maybe I'll start regressing all the way back and then I'll realize like what it was in the beginning. But, like, I'll get myself in a mood where I won't talk again. And it's like, it's not just the thing that I won't-I'm like-I won't say-Umm how can I say it? Not that I won't say anything, just like I won't be saying anything, you know. Like I'll say "Yes" or "No" or this. I'll say that much. But, like, to really go into something and try to talk, I won't. And my girlfriend helps me come out of that because she realizes, I think now, that I get into some of these moods sometimes. Sometimes I think even sometimes I'm just-something has hurt me-and sometimes I'm not quite sure what it is by I feel myself getting hard and going back to the side and I don't know what it is. [12:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT You know. And it's like I know one thing-I'm going to tell her about this-I don't know why I don't, but it's that fear of being hit again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Now she said something-she told me I should go get an x-ray on my back. Because, you know, one of the reasons-I do actually sometimes get-my back does hurt me after Judo practice, but so do the rest of my muscles. So, she said "Go to the doctor, get that x-ray." And then she said-"Sometimes..." what did she say?-"Sometimes I'd like to just take you and throw you from this side of the room to the other side of the room." or something like this. And the first thing I thought of is "You touch me and I'll kill you."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Hmm</p>

<p>PATIENT And that's the...that's the-I didn't say it, but this is the first thing that came to my mind, "You touch me and I'll kill you."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm, Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And it was just like-I really have a fear of being physically harmed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm. And that goes with anger, too. I mean, if someone's angry at you, then...</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, maybe-well, I know when I was at Wagners (ph/sp? 0:13:20.9) especially. That was my first foster home, like for three years. Geez, every time I turned around I got hit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT I mean, she really-she was from the old guard-you know, like if a kid was being-you don't talk to them, you just say to them "You're not supposed to do that." Wham! You know? (chuckles) And then that was it. And it was like, I guess maybe that was it and I find myself getting hard when people say that, too. When they say something about hitting or-because that's what I used to do as a defense, you know. I would get so hard she would have to hit me about ten times before I'd cry. I wouldn't cry. And I guess that was the reason. I guess it was like saying "I'm not going to let you hurt me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT You know. And I guess she couldn't understand that that's what I was saying. "You really hurt me already and I'm not going to let you ..."-well at least-let's say it this way "You hurt me, but I'm not going to let you see that you hurt me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Right. So when you get hard like that, it's like nobody can see you. Nobody can see that you're hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. And its like-I-at least-at least now though, I am hurt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT At one time...or should I-let's see, how can I say that I'm hurt but it's almost like a defensive thing. But at least it is a reaction, you know. At one time it would just be "Oh well, so I'm rotten again" and I'm this and that and I would-I would feel like low but now it's like a reaction. It's like saying "No, I'm not" almost. Which, in a way, is not good, but, in a way, at least it's saying-how can I say it? Like, well, one time she said that she-this is another thing-she comes up with these stupid things that I'm going to take her and throw her through a wall and she goes-she says " Sometimes I wish I could-I think I should spank you." And this again, right away, it doesn't just-it's not just the hit thing. It makes me think "What the hell do you think I am? A child?" [15:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Uh Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT But at least-this is what I'm thinking and this is-like I get a hard exterior, I just go like this and walk away. And I get hard outside, but at least inside I'm saying to myself "Look, I don't mind you yelling about something or you getting irritated with them, but watch how you talk to me because I am not this way."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And at least.... I mean, all right, so it might be like a cover-up like I'm really not too sure of myself. But at least it is saying I don't want to be like whatever or whatever you think I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm. Instead of just believing yourself...</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, like before I'd just go "Oh shit, maybe I am" and I'm this and I'm that. And this is the way I used to do it. I used to play like a big berating of everything I did and that's why I got to the point where I was-I had to-imitate here or whoever else. You know, and I had to do this and I had to do that because then I was this and then I was that. Like, it wasn't me. It's like going to charm school and that bullshit so I know how to sit like this and I know how to-you know all this other baloney. But, like, then I go out and people say "You're so stiff" because, sure, I'm not being me I'm trying to be something that supposed to be sophisticated and supposed to be this and supposed to be that. And I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Something outside instead of inside. [16:18]</p>

<p>PATIENT Right, right, right, right, right. And it's like I can get to that point and I can-now I can be relaxed in certain ways, like in sitting and things like this. And if I want to sit in an "S" or whatever, I sit like that. If I want to sit like at somebody's-I'll sit the other way. I'll sit-I'll do whatever is comfortable and, like, it's so funny because now that I'm doing that-it just gets me so mad-because now that I'm doing that, people are starting to come to me a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And people are starting, you know, asking me to go with them and "I'd really like you to help me pick something out..." And you think (chuckles) "Who me?" And you think, like, here I've been doing all these stupid things like standing on my head either for attention or for whatever, and it doesn't work that way. You know, it's like okay, so maybe you had to do that with your mother, but you don't have to do that all the time now. You can let that go. That was when you were a child, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And its like-its really-I feel like I' m really going someplace and I don't feel like all these changes of being so inferior like I used to. Every time I think to myself I say "Oh, cr..." Okay, look and then I look around and I'd see, you know, I'd be reading maybe a book and I'd say, I'd look around and I'd say "Look at all the books that Jodie has read." You know, and here I am with my stupid little 'Beginning Art' or something and she's an artist and she's done this and she's-you know what I mean? And it's like I feel so ignorant that I would just end up not looking into it. I'd say "Oh, well." And that would be it. And so, now, it's not like that. Partly the reading course is helping me because I have a private teacher and I'm reading some of the cl... -she's got a book that's really old. It's like a classic and now I can go around and I guess maybe it's a little bit of a brag and it's a little bit of something I can say I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Like I'll go to work and I'll say "Oh, jeez, I was reading from a book and its got just like classics that were out of print for thirty years." And boy, it makes me feel so good. And, you know, I can discuss it with one of the kids there or one of the girls I can talk to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's exciting. And you did it.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, right, and it's like something like...like-first of all probably not because I even said "I did it and you didn't." But it's like something like I did something that was different. I read something that you haven't read and now I can share it. See, it's almost like I felt like for a long time I didn't have anything to share.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT You know, that's an awful feeling to come out and say "I've got absolutely nothing. All I've been doing is taking from you and taking from you and taking from you." And now I've got something I can give back to and I can explain what I read and wow! This is something like this is like an original and nobody's got it. You know, and it is something like-it really makes me feel good. Now I've got something I can share and I can explain how something else is done that you haven't looked into. And you know, I thought to myself "I've been so stupid for so long that I should have done this a long time ago, got out of the fields that they're in, get into my own fields. [19:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And then I bet, it's almost like-it sounds stupid because we've come up with this before. We were going through a period where we wouldn't talk and then we finally came out with what was wrong. She was thinking-it was so funny because we think less alike sometimes. She was thinking "Jesus Christ, it sounds like two married people." I was thinking The Odd Couple. (laughs) You know, it's like-it was, you know, basically the same thing, but it was like we couldn't communicate. And I think, like, part of it was that. She said she was afraid to do anything because then I would follow her into it. And now I feel like "Uh uh, not any more." See this way, I can come home and I can tell you what I am doing without fear that you are going to try and outdo me or whatever because you're in a different field. And she can do the same thing and she doesn't have to worry about me following her around. And so I guess this is probably good training even if I ever decided to get married that I would know that. Stay in my own field and let him stay in his but... It's like, but that's so funny too, because now I keep changing my views on marriage (laughs). Before I wanted-I just-"Geez I want to get married so bad, I want to get married so bad." (laughs) And then I say to myself "I don't know if I want to get married so bad and spend fifty years with the same man."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT It just seems like I can see it now because, like before it was like I didn't have all that many friends and so like I wanted one that I could hang onto that wouldn't leave me and everything and so it would be almost like that with a boyfriend, too. You know, like with a husband. He would still be a friend basically, too. And I guess I felt like then I would have somebody like it wouldn't be like my mother and father leaving me and like, you know, like somebody kicking me out. Of course, you can get a divorce, but... It would be like now I've got somebody and nobody can take him away because now he's married. He's got that ring on his finger. I don't have to worry about somebody taking him away from me and I don't have to-you know anything like this because this would be mine. [21:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And now I wonder to myself "Do I need somebody that's just mine?" Or can I finally make it on my own or at least start to make it on my own and not have to worry if I do find somebody that I really thing I can dig so much and whatever and he's really like a real secure person, which I hope to be someday. And maybe I could spend a lifetime with him. I don't know. But, if I don't-I feel funny because I don't care. I can see myself being like my steno (ph) partner, like sixty years old and she's real happy because her nieces and that are coming over. She's never been married and she's not crying for it. She's got her things. She's got her book club, she's go this she's got that. She doesn't need a man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR The important thing about that is finding out what's good for you and you want, no matter what happens. You can see yourself being alone having your own things.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. And that's so funny because I can't wait to get out. I mean, I'm so excited. I have some friends looking at the resale-not resale shops-but they have rummage sales where they've got real nice stuff and they give it away for a dollar or two dollars. "Okay, pick me up anything you can find and I'll put it together." You know, and then I'm going to go out in April we're going to look through some things, too. Because I want a couple of things for my apartment. I'm so excited now because this is my own thing and it really sounds so funny because I've never felt this way before. I've always been like this one girlfriend I know at work and she says "I'm always so lonely when I'm home." I really cry for her because I know how she feels. It's like that little dog that was outside and couldn't get in. I can feel for her and I almost cried when she told me. Plus, she went through shelter bits, too. Now I think to myself "Look-you'd better get this girl into something. Not into one of your things, but tell her to go into something she likes at night." And she won't need this. She won't mind being alone for two or three or four hours by herself. It's not going to bother her. It's not going to bother her to go to bed by herself and not to have anybody there. Well, she's been married which is a little bit of a sex thing, I suppose. It's kind of hard for her when she doesn't have a boyfriend. But it seems like she's the same way, though. She just does not want to be alone. I can't-see maybe I can't understand it now because-I can understand it because I can feel for her, but I have a tendency when I start going up a level that I always think that everybody else I know is going up that level, too. [23:46]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Same way.</p>

<p>PATIENT And it's like, they don't do it. Wait, wait, wait, now she's still back there. You've got to work that way. I guess that's one of the reasons my one girlfriend had problems with me, too. Because I know I've gone up a level or two and she's still going like "Well, I want to make sure that I said it in the right way so I wouldn't hurt you." I said-I probably said "Jesus Christ, come on you don't have to do that any more, Libbie."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT "Come on, tell me, come on. Honestly, and it's not going to hurt me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You're saying "I'm different now."</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, but she doesn't see it yet. Well, of course, I'm not saying I'm completely different. I know there are still things that hurt me. I'm not saying like, you know, like in what? - fifteen weeks or something that I can be so much different that I was before but, see, just by facing some of the problems I've had, I found myself-I-I really just don't feel like I did before. I can't explain it, but like when I used to be happy it was like I wasn't really happy. I don't think I can ever remember-the only time I was kind of like happy is like-well-like Cam and stupid me, I still didn't figure that one out. There was this one guy who's real rich, from China. And I said-she said you really can't love until you're secure. You know, like you really can't have a real love. And I said "Oh, I don't know." I said "I was in love with my doctor and I was in love with..." Who else was I in love with? "I was in love with this fellow from China named Cam." And I said he was real rich and everything and gracious and the whole bit. He was really good-looking and at this time I was really thin and I really put the makeup on. I really looked gorgeous this one night when I met him. And so-like I felt-and I didn't realize it until afterwards she was trying to explain it to me even just a couple of weeks ago, that the reason why I felt like I loved him partly was because he gave me attention and partly was my reaction to the attention. </p>

<p>It was like saying "If somebody this high up or at least to me was so high above me would pick me over anybody else..." And there were other really good-looking girls. Like when my two girlfriends get dressed up they are both gorgeous. You know, too. And it was like, if he picked me over everybody else then I was good enough. It was like asserting that I really was somebody good. But it wasn't that I really felt it, it was just like-you know-and then when he-he didn't call me after there were two parties or something that I saw him at and we were together all through the night and that. And he didn't call me afterwards and I just felt to myself like "Oh cry." You know, it was just like a passing fad or whatever. He really didn't-you know-and the more -she just, she just did that and like all sorts of things like hacked off after she said had said that like "He probably felt like he was above you." "He picked you." And then everything else kind of went through my mind like "Yeah, he picked me for a little while and then he sort of dropped me." And it was like saying "Oh, but you were like Cinderella for a day but then, eh, you know, he really didn't care about you . You might have been the only free one at the party" or whatever. I mean also-(inaudible 26:40) it was mostly because, again, I was going the same thing. I got really jealous at the last party. I was terrible. I was like a little kid. You know, he was dancing with somebody else and I was sitting there and I'd be-oh, I was miserable. The only time I was happy was when I was in his arms and we were dancing or he kissed me or whatever. [26:57] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Before, the way you felt had to come always from...</p>

<p>PATIENT From somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR ...the outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. The way somebody else was towards me. Not the way I can be to somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR And it was really important to hang on to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. It was -it was like the New Year's party. The first time-my girlfriend says it was first time she'd ever seen me... I was waiting on people and I had fun. I really had fun. I had people come up and this one guy who had never met me grabbed me by the waist and said "Boy, are you cute!" He really liked that-oh, okay (chuckles). "Okay, go away!" And then we were dancing. We kept changing partners. I'd say things like I had never said before. Things like-like this one fellow who had been paying lots of attention to me and all this. I just said to him "This is an old partner (chuckles) (inaudible 27:39), you know. But it was like I was making a choice now and I didn't feel like I had to-like I had to depend on somebody else. And like I've never felt that way in my whole life that I could really do something by me and it wouldn't be like-all right, I admit that sometimes I go back to that. Like the other night, I was thinking and I thought to myself "Well, well it's pretty good that we don't sit down and talk a lot like we used to." And I said to myself "Because after all, when she leaves that's going to probably be just about the end of the friendship anyway." So then I said "Well wait a minute, now you're doing the same thing again." You're saying.... </p>

<p>But see, it's not like I'm real hurt about it like I was, but still it is like saying I synonomize not being there or at least not being there for awhile like separation, an ending. Like that's it. You know, where it shouldn't have to be that way. But like she-this is something else I've got to learn that I've never learned before. When I-I feel like when somebody leaves, that's it. They're never going to be back, they're never going to care. Because you know, like for the stepfamily to stepfamily, like from my mother to a church shelter. It's so hard for me to realize still that my one stepmother loves me. It really is. You know, because like-I keep thinking to myself "How could she love me?" It will be like "All right, my mother was sick, she's got an excuse. You weren't sick. All right, you were going through change of life, but still you weren't that sick. And you just didn't want me." And that's just the way I felt about that. And so it's going to take me a long time to get over because I almost synonomize people going away with not wanting me anymore, you know, or whatever. And like I said, it's not like I feel so hurt about it, it's just like I feel like it's going to be final, which it shouldn't have to be. </p>

<p>So I guess I'll just have to get over that feeling like as soon as somebody goes away that they're going to-it's just like-it's almost like-well, this is-again this isn't a sex thing, though, because it's my girlfriend and boyfriend. But it's like he says that-he kept saying things like "Oh, you're going to find other fella (ph 29:44) friends." Well this would be the same thing only you find like maybe another girlfriend or something, or you're going to stay in another country and you're never going to come back. And so then you may as well say we're not going to be friends because like, okay, we can write once every month or every two months. But if you don't see you friends for a long time, it's very hard to keep a close friendship when there's other people around that you can build up friendships with and they can build up friendships with. So, I guess it was almost like on the same thing and that's when it hit me home, is when we were talking about my other girlfriend. She said this guy was so great and he was so nice and he's really smart and he's real sharp but, he's so insecure that he's afraid when she goes away that she's not going to come back or whatever. That she's going to find somebody else. And I said to myself "Dopey, you're doing same thing with your friends." [30:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT It was still like an insecure thing that you felt like if they weren't there bodily, physically that they didn't care about you anymore and that that was it and that you wouldn't care about them either and that would be. You would just push them out of you life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR And you wouldn't care about yourself either...[that might have been what you were doing (inaudible 30:40)]</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, maybe. Maybe part of that, too. But I don't think it was so much like a hurt thing because I didn't feel myself getting real hard-a little bit defensive, maybe. Maybe it was partly that, too. But it was too a thing like this is like a final thing. And I guess that final feeling came from being pushed from here to there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Like they're going to vanish .</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, like that's it and "poof", you know, and then never again will they be back. Which is stupid-not stupid-but it's just like a feeling I have that I've got to get over. [31:10]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And its not-well, again like I say, it's not really like such a hurt feeling. If I would - like, when I knew-I found out that Cam, when I still liked him, was going to go back to China, I found out that he was engaged and all this stuff. Oh, I cried so hard because it was like-see, part of it was this, too. I found out he was engaged. [31:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT So, you know, my girlfriend said this more or less to-he really was engaged-and she told me, more or less, to ease my, you know, like my feeling of inferiority. But, it only made it worse then I was thinking he went into this relationship knowing, you know, that I had him and I don't know if it was man-love (ph 31:50) or whatever. He went into it knowing that he had a girl and he really wasn't even-he wasn't looking, he wasn't thinking about meeting any girl in that way. And here I was thinking of him like a future boyfriend or trying-you know, becoming a boyfriend, never thinking he was attached, never knowing he was attached. And then when I found out it was like saying that he was just playing around. That's all he was doing. He was using his charm, he was playing around. And here I was and he was more or less using me. [32:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And this made me feel so badly. I was just like when my boss-and my girlfriend said this, too-and I took it that way. She said that he was saying things like "Don't worry, he'd do it to anybody." Thanks a lot (chuckles)! Here I am "anybody". And again, it was like, it was this constant feeling like-I can't even say-it's so funny because like if somebody says I sound like I'm older than my age and somebody says that I sound like I've been through parts-like a couple of years of college or whatever it is, it's so funny because I don't think anything of that. I don't-I don't feel like I should be like the normal-when-if somebody says I'm just a general mill of the run people, which shouldn't really bother you. You know, because so what? If they say you're average, gee that's-that's average. That's middle-class, that's like the whole bit. But to me, its not like that because see, I've always tried to be above...[33:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...what I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And so when somebody just puts me down with "average", it bugs me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Hmm. You can't even take that as a good thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT No. I can't take that as a good thing at all because I've always wanted to be above because I was-I felt like I came from below. You know, I don't want to just be average, I want to be somebody. You know, because there's like a million and one people that are average and I don't want to be average. And I guess that kind of bugs me and then when I found out that my I.Q. was high bright I thought "Well you know, shoot, I'm not dumb. Let's do something." And then I realized-I guess maybe that's how I realized partly that frustration I had, too, was partly because I'm not dumb, I'm not stupid. I've got lots of potential and I haven't realized it. And this is one of the reasons I felt like this. :Like I just said "I'll follow this and I'll follow that. Maybe I can take some short steps because she's been all this way and then if I follow what she's does and says and reads or whatever, that-see, then this way I can cut some of these corners and I can be up where I want to be." [34:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm. Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT And now I know I can't do that. And I can't be that way in her fields or whoever's fields. And like the first realization that was that kind of-it really saddened me because I felt-you know, like I felt that this is somebody who's really a great person and everything. And things like we'll be talking and we'll come up with-like she'll say something like "Some people can be real popular just because it's a natural thing when they relax, it's just a natural thing that lots of people like them." And then there's other people that-they'll have friends, but they won't have all sorts of friends because they're just not type of personality that's, you know. So then I said "That was really hard for me to take." Because again, even then it was like I wanted everybody to like me and at least the great majority of people to like me and now I think to myself "Is it important for everybody to like you? Because you don't want to be like everybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT So why should you care if the normal run of the mill people don't like you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Now, I guess it would still hurt me if somebody who I thought was of some value and if I really wanted to cultivate a relationship that I couldn't cultivate one, I think I'd still feel hurt. But now, I-at least when I walk into a room I don't want everybody to talk to me or I'll feel like "Oh geez, I'm not good enough." Even if nobody talks to me. So they don't know me, I'm a stranger. So what? So they don't want to talk to me? So what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR If I can put that all together, it sounds like where you are right now is you are discovering that you can be something by yourself that you can-and you can know what that is. That you don't have to be so dependent on other people that-it's important to be you and you are really excited that that's happening now. []6:03)</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. And I can feel that now I don't have to take on, you know, like careers. You know, it's so funny because she was giving me a hint the other day. I know she was giving me a hint-I don't care what she says (chuckles). She teaches a business-shorthand and typing for secretaries and things like this-well, two days in a row she saw me come home in a slack outfit. Not-like-this is just slacks that I'm going to wear and then I'm going to take them off. But, I was wearing a slack outfit two days. So then, she said "You know, they've changed the dress code in our school. They changed it and now they have-they can wear slacks." And for a couple of days, I guess some of her girls came in jeans and so anyway, she talked about dress codes once and that was it. And then she always says "Well I never wear slacks. I always wear a skirt." You know, like a coordinated outfit, not just a skirt, but you know, like really-and I'm listening and I knew what she meant. I knew that she meant that I shouldn't be wearing these to the office because it's not real professional looking. But I don't care. Our office says we can wear them. I'm more comfortable in a slack outfit. I always wear the tunic tops which are the type that you should wear. And there's girls that run around with slacks and sweaters and like whatever else in the office, too. But I don't, because it's not office wear. It's fine for other places, but not for office work. And so, I do my thing and it's so funny because I didn't think "Oh boy, I'd better not wear slack outfits anymore." I knew what she was getting at and then she said that the girls came around and none of them were wearing slacks. If they did it was a real nice coordinated outfit, but hardly ever. It was always dressy. I said "I know what you are saying and I don't care." (chuckles) It was so funny. And I never felt that way before. It was always like "Oh God, I did something else wrong. I'd better not do it anymore." And now I said "No, it's not wrong." It may be wrong for you, but it's not wrong for me. [37:46]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And this is my thing and I'll do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And I said "My God!" (laughter) It shocked me because afterwards I realized...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT ...what I had said to myself. I said "This is nice and fine for you." It wasn't like-see it was always like me it was a right and wrong thing. It was either right or it was wrong. It was right for everybody or it was wrong for everybody. And I said to myself "This is fine because this is your personality and this is your thing and this is the way you feel is what is proper." But see, they just changed the dress codes in offices a few months ago. So, in my opinion, if the dress code says you can wear slacks, there is nothing wrong with wearing slacks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR So it is something like you can have your own standard now.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, right. And I can go along with whatever or if I felt like I wanted to wear dresses whether everybody else wore slacks, I would do it. And I don't wear slacks all the time, but I do love slacks and I love slack outfits and I'm going to buy a bunch more because they're in style and they're so comfortable. Why not? I can't see any reason for not wearing them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT So if, in my own opinion-but it's so funny because now I've got my own opinion. It doesn't make any difference what she thinks or what anybody else thinks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Uh Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And it just (laughter)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Could that be me?</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, it was me thinking. It wasn't me thinking "Oh my God, I did..." because this is the first thing I would think: "Oh Jesus, I did something wrong, now I've got to change this about me because this is wrong." Now, I feel like I've got lots of improvement to do. But it's like-that's like. It's like when I first started charm, I remember the one teacher to me that "You girls-you're all pretty and everything," she said then she said "You are all like cakes and all I'm going to do is help put a frosting on. That's all." "You're like a delicious cake and all we're going to do is put some frosting on it." So it's like saying the cake is still there. The cake is good and the cake is the best part of it but we're just going to put a little bit of icing on it and make it even better. Or smooth the rough edges or whatever they wanted to say. And now I feel like-this is what I feel like. I feel like-I feel like inside there's something in there that's like a diamond and it's just waiting to get out. It's waiting to get shiny and then people will be able to see it. People can't see it too much now because it's still floundering around a little bit. It's got some problems to work out. And once it does, it's going to be that shining diamond and people are going to be able to see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But inside you, it's really good and pretty and shiny.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah and it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR And it's just going to take time and then you can let people see that. [40:20]</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. It's so funny because I can really feel that way. I can have feelings for other people that I could never feel before. Of course, I shouldn't say that. I could feel for people before but it was like a-I can't even really explain it-like, for one thing, I couldn't give love like I could now again. Like I could when I was little because I know I did. I used to run up to people and I used to always want to kiss them. I remember that because I used to embarrass the boy down the hall because he'd come up and I'd want to kiss him all the time. "No, get away, get away." But, it was-for a long time I couldn't give love. I couldn't show love. I mean, I could give it. In other words, like I could work for people and I could be good and think that this way people would really love me. But, I couldn't just come up and-take my foster mother-the first thing I do when I walk in the door is I kiss her and I kiss Dad. And it's like - but it's like I really want to it's not like well this is now what I suppose you're supposed to do, so "Hi." It's like I really want to do it and I really can feel for them. Whether they care for me or not. And it's so funny because is doesn't even make any difference anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's like there's a whole, affectionate kind of puppy dog loving part of you that you that you just had to sit on for...</p>

<p>PATIENT For a long, long time. Yeah, and now...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR ...all these years.</p>

<p>PATIENT ...it's starting to come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But now it's coming out.</p>

<p>PATIENT And it's like. I can't really-'cause-it's so funny because even with my steno partner who-she's starting to come into her own, too, it's so funny. Because now I'm getting happy and she's starting to call out these funny lines and we crack up. And, you know, most people say "So why does she (inaudible 41:55) so business, so this." You don't know her-you know, we have fun back there (laughter). So it's like feeling like if somebody gives me a treat, the first thing I think of is "Oh, now I've got to split it and bring some to her." And I never felt that way or if I got something and it's something special I always think "Oh, I'd better bring Jasmine some." And it's like I never felt like that before. I never felt like I wanted to just come out-like I would do it for a boss or something. For a man. That's partly-I would do it more for a man than a woman. I would never give to a woman, ever. And I think part of that was my reaction to my mother or my feeling that my mother didn't or my feeling that my mother didn't care. That I had to do so much for her that I said "The hell with it! It's not worth it." [42:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And it's like-but now I can just feel that with people. It's so funny. I can't get over that. It's like-another thing that's so funny, too that-I don't get along with our office manager and she is so two-faced. She's unbelievable the things she-little jokes-little things she pulls on me. But even with her, I found myself-I can separate, I can separate my feelings for her as being-she's-well she's trying to be like a peacock. She's-I can see-it's so funny like I can see now-I don't just dislike her. [43:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT I see how she's insecure because she never had the training, really, to be the executive secretary and the office manager. Lots of times she doesn't know what she's doing and she tries to fake it and she tries to be like a boss over the girls to show herself that she's really-like she really is a boss and she really is something. I can see it. It still irritates me, but I don't get so mad at her and I don't get so-like I actually hate her because of that. But like I was saying, I can separate it now. I could never do that before. She came up and she said something about her son and I caught myself-at one time I'd say "Good for you." You know, because you're such a rat. But now, now I can separate. I can separate-like I can feel for that boy and I can also feel for the mother of the boy. Her as a mother, I can feel for her. And it's like I never felt like that. Like I actually-I just sat there and I said "I am so sorry." And I really meant it. Like sometimes I'd say "Oh, I'm sorry" but I wouldn't feel anything. I'd just say "Oh, the hell with you because I don't like you." And it is so funny because I could feel for once there was actually like a communication between both of us because now I felt bad because of her son and she could feel I felt bad. And then she felt better because somebody else cared. You know, it was like a real.... It was really a beautiful thing like I have never been able to experience that before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Learning how to give to people, how to feel what they feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT To feel again. I should say to give again because-I was reading in Spock and he said -well, I don't know if it's true-because I haven't read enough about it. But he said that if you never learned how to give love when you were a child, like two or three, in that area, you never could do it. So, it makes me feel good like I can say-you know, it's so funny because-I just-it's made this further correlation-I call it correlation, I don't know-between like my mother and me in that area. It's like saying now this is one thing my mother did give me. Because if she didn't give it to me, I wouldn't be able to do it. [45:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And that makes me feel so good because for a long time I blamed her for lots of the things that-and that's my fault. And now I can say that this is something my mother gave me. This is one thing she really gave me. She gave me the ability to love people. And now, you know, when it's all over-you know, like-how should I say-it's like when I don't have this real defensive feeling anymore and this thing like I'm not good enough and I came from this rotten background and all this that it's coming out again. Like this beautiful thing-this thing like, you know, to really love people. She was the (inaudible 46:00) part. She probably told me lots of stories and things like this and really did show me that she loved me when I was real little. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Otherwise, I could never feel this way. And now next time I go and see her, I can say "Ma, you know, I'm still a messed up kid but it is so funny because I feel like I can say 'I love you' because you've given this to me." It's so funny, because it's the first time I ever thought of that. That she's really-this is something she had to give me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Deep down inside there really is something strong and good and loving. You got that from her. </p>

<p>PATIENT That must be it because, like I said, I couldn't feel this way otherwise. I couldn't feel for anybody else. I mean, I could do it because I'd be afraid that I would lose their friendship at one time. But now, I don't even thing of that. One time I think "I should do this because if I don't do this then they won't like me anymore." But now it's like I can do it because I think "Ooh, this might make them happy!" Even if it doesn't make them happy, it's just like-I'm not doing it just because now this is a present I can give it to them. Or this is something-now they have to say "Thank you" and all this other baloney. But it's like saying I really want to make somebody else happy. [47:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT In any way, shape or form. If I can do it my showing them I care in a physical way-which I shouldn't say physical, I should say material way-or whatever, I can do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's your's now. You have it. </p>

<p>PATIENT It's like-it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Inside you.</p>

<p>PATIENT ...I can't believe it, that this is really there. And it's like-I talked to my girlfriend who's-she's got this crazy affair with this man where I work and she used to work there, too. And like my girlfriend said "Look." We were talking. I talk to Jodie about it because she knows more about psychology, she knows more about Jewish men. Because this girl is a black girl and she's going with an older Jewish man that, you know, he's got a wife, she's got a husband who happened to be a policeman. She's in such a mess and you know, for a long time I'd just listen to her and I'd go along with her little games like call up and see if he's home. He's at (inaudible 48:06) and all this bullshit. So, I told my girlfriend. She said "Just for you, you'd better get out of it because if it ever blows up, you're going to be in it and they're going to be able to trace you." I said "Well, I don't care so much about that." You know, I have such a deathly fear-because that girl is another one that's so giving and everything to other people. And see, her husband didn't give it back and this other guy did. He was nice and all this to her. So she thinks she's in love with him and everything. But, my God-if that girl gets caught-my girlfriend says, first of all, that black men are very-because we've got a couple black friends, but she knows them better than I do-that they're very jealous. [48:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And if, God, if that guy came home and caught her in some way that he could prove that she was-you know, he'd kill her. And he could get away with it because he's a cop. You know, let's face it. They would say "Oh, sorry it was self-defense" or some other stupid thing or it was justifiable homicide or something. He'd get off and she'd be dead. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And this is this girl that is so-can be so giving at times. So she's had a rotten marriage, the guy hasn't given back to her. Okay, so she's had a nice affair. But that man, that man is going to walk right away from her and leave her there. He's not going to care. He's not going to leave his wife for her or anything else. And here she's going to be stuck. She's taken all the risk. She's got two or three kids. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And I said to myself-so I sat down and I talked to her the other night. I said "Look, first of all you've got to break that thing off. It's not a good relationship." I said "If you want to get back with your husband then do so." She said he's been real attentive since the affair because I guess he sort of suspects but he can't prove anything. So now, he's becoming attentive. I said what I would do, if you still love your husband, is break that affair off, but don't be so giving. I mean, give, but don't-she used to wait on him, give him breakfast in bed and all of this bull, which really isn't necessary. I mean it's okay for a honeymoon or something or for a special day, but it not like something you should do for a man every day. Because he just gets so spoiled that you're like a maid to him. You're not like a wife. You're not somebody he can respect. So I was trying to explain this to her, like my feeling on it. Then I said you just really need to be careful because he's got a gun, he's got it on him most of the time and he-if he gets angry enough-that's what they say, most of the deaths are right in the home-and I said "He's going to kill you." And I said "You know, you've got three kids. I'm worried about you. The other man is going to walk out of this and he's not going to give a damn about you." So anyway, I hope she's thinking on it and that she's going to break it off. Because if she doesn't-I'm not going to get involved in it anymore. I'll still be her friend but I'm not going get involved in it anymore. I did what I could. I told her exactly what the score is . She's a pretty smart girl and she should know. But like-but what I was saying is one thing like-I could never feel like that before. I could feel it, but I would never say anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Because partly I had this inferiority complex like I didn't know . I was so dumb and like you don't have to take Psychology courses to see what's playing right in front of your face-what's going to happen to somebody. Or you talk it over with somebody who knows a little bit more about it-like Jewish men or whatever-she knows more about it than I do because she's dated lots of them. And like it was so funny because I can now come out and I can help a friend. I could never-I would never be a friend, really. [51:23]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Now you can act on what you think and feel because you're not waiting to find out from the outside whether it's okay or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, whether it's okay to feel or think that way and then I can do it. You know, that's true. It was like oh, cry because like even before I met her, I used to have problems keeping friends and that. But part of it was this. I would never put myself out for anybody. And, you know, the answer was because I went through that experience that if I did and if I really went too-then they're going to pretend to like me and then they're going to turn around and they're going to walk away and I'm never going to see them again. And the other way would be like "Well, you never got close to me anyway, so I don't care if you're not there tomorrow, so what. You're not there tomorrow."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT But now I think I'm getting a little bit more-still I feel like it's a final thing if somebody leaves. But, this is the first reaction and then I sort of think it through and the more I think it through, I realize what I meant or what I felt was like it was just like a feeling of well, now I'm going to be pushed away again. And it's not like that and it's so funny because like then they'll tell me and like, but see, at one time I wouldn't be reassured by words. [52:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And yet, like my girlfriend would say "Look, you know, we're going to go away, but so what?" And now its-and that was another thing that was so funny because I came to this conclusion-I figured that for my apartment I needed so much money and I'd either have to work really lots of hours or I could just work one night a week and I could go to run two or three nights a week. And then I'd have my reading and that and then maybe work overtime one night. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And I could get more things for my apartment but, see I was going to take a week and go with them because they were leaving, they were going to go to Montana first to see the rodeo and everything. And I'm interested in rodeo, but I've seen one downtown and it's not all that much even if it is the biggest one in the States and all the Indians are there and they're dressed and everything. I think probably what it was it was like it was saying that this is almost like a "farewell". And I get to spend the last week with you folks and then I thought to myself "I don't really need this." This was after that talk that she said "You go everywhere we go" and everything, or that I go. And I thought to myself-first I thought maybe it was her feeling about going on the trip, too, and that. And then I thought to myself "You know, maybe you are doing that. It's like you're still tagging along, you're trying to prolong it as long as possible-you know like, God, your last week." And I said, "Heck, that week will probably cost me 300 dollars" with the fare up there and everything-the expenses. And I said "That's not worth it!" I could put 300 dollars into my apartment right here. So maybe next year I take trip by myself someplace or I take a tour or I maybe go see them. Because I am supposed to meet them next year for a month in Paris. Fine, so I go then. Right now, I've got other things to do that are more important and that I need the money for. So I said to myself "Oh my God, it happened again!" (chuckles) It was like-I really didn't feel like they were leaving me. I felt like, okay, they're going. And then I felt like I can say goodbye. I'll ride with them in a taxi or whatever and I'll help them unpack or whatever their stuff and I'll get them on the plane or the train and they can go. [54:35]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And that will be fine. And it's like-it was-it's so funny, though, because I feel that. Like I used to feel like "Oh my God, what do I do? I won't have any friends, I won't have anybody to talk to." And all of the sudden, even at work, I've got two or three people that are asking me to go here, they're asking me to go there. And they're the best-the-like the one girl was the only girl that I talked to for a long time. She's a black girl. And then there's another one who was-I talked to a little bit and she seemed like she was pretty smart and that. And so, for awhile I would talk to her a little bit and she'd talk to me a little bit. But she couldn't trust too many people because everybody in the office is a gossip. I guess she had to kind of figure me out or whatever. And this took like six months. So, but this is nice because we're starting to get a friendship growing out of that. And so, like, this is something so funny. I've never realized it before and I've never-I've never-I've always tried to rush things and I went in and people always had to always like me right away. Everybody had to like me and I had to get in. Now it's like I don't feel that way and I don't fee like I'm losing my friends because they're leaving so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's not so desperate anymore. You can...</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, right. I can take it... [55:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR ...take your time.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah and if I-because that was so funny when I came to the conclusion that-and this shocked me, too, because I did it very unemotionally. It was just like, you know, very logically I said "Well, I can't afford that trip." But then I sat down and said "But why was trip important?" I said "Was it really because you wanted to see the rodeo?" I really would like to see the rodeo, but not all that much. I'd rather see my apartment get shaped up. And then I said "No, I think it was mostly it was because you were afraid." And it was like-and it was so funny because I really can say I'm not so much afraid anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT I can-like I'm realizing lots of things, like when I hear things like that I'm starting to listen more. And I'm starting to let my feelings go. And then I kind of analyze. Like when I heard about that (inaudible56:29) it was the first time I've ever really had a correlation like that. And it was really something and things have happened since then. I really try to think now "Now where did this come from?" or "What do I mean by this?" or "Where does this parallel my life?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Because I realize now that everything I react to, whether it's somebody else-if something happened to somebody else or whatever-had to come someplace in my life I had to experience it or to feel sorry for them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And so like-it's so funny because I'm starting to figure that out-then I figure now this probably came from that. I understand lots of the hurts and it's so funny because I still feel hurt at times and I still feel like I would have loved to have a father. I still feel like it was a big loss that I never really had a father. [57:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT It really is kind of a sad thing. And I feel lots for people who don't or people who are coming in to having a father. I can feel real happy for them because I know it is something I missed. But it's like at times I used to blame my father for being the way he was. And like, how can him when he didn't know. He was a sick man. He wasn't well upstairs and everything. Plus, okay, if he was never raised with girls-I he did have a sister, I guess, or a cousin-but like maybe he really didn't know what to do. Maybe he really didn't know how to take care of me. Maybe he really didn't know how to love me and so I-you know I've always used other people to blame them. The same way I had to have friends and if people didn't like me, then I was no good. Well then it was always like-I was always blaming other people for how I was. And it's like how can you blame other people for what you are, how you feel really. I mean, they might contribute to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But you are what you are right now and you're beginning to find out that's good and that can change.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. And then I can go someplace on my own and in my own way, no matter what that own way is. Whether it means I become a nurse or whether I means I become whatever, I finally end up wanting to be. I don't know if I will know until I get into school which field I really like. [58:44]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And it's like-I don't know. And yet-you know what? I think-I think to myself I don't know why I used to feel this way so much. Because I went into yoga and within a year I was doing yoga exercises, almost every single one. Some I would do even better than the instructors and some I would do as well as the instructors. There might have been one or two that I wasn't real good at. But even the best instructors aren't good at everything. And, like, I taught this one thing for a half hour for a friend. He just asked me to give a demonstration and every single one of those people said "When are you starting a class? I want to...." And it was like I just don't realize that I do have a -I think I do have a teaching ability in some way. I think that that's been born into me-that I should teach eventually. What, I don't know. See, it would have to be a subject. It wouldn't just be like-my girlfriend can teach this subject or that subject or whatever. I think it would probably have to be a specific subject that I was really interested in so I could really motivate. Because I can't really motivate somebody in shorthand and typing because I hate it. You know, how can you motivate something I can't stand the subject myself, you know? And it's like-but it's something like I'm really getting into something that-it's like-it's so funny-it's so funny that I'm twenty-one and I'm just starting to discover who Jane is. [60:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT You know, it's like I really never knew when I was, when I was just out of, when I was in high school it was always trying to be like Megan who's, you know, who is a little bit older than me. I know it was always trying to be like her, trying to get the same type of fellows she did...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...or as good-looking or all these crazy, stupid things. Or as many boyfriends and all this stupid, stupid stuff. And then it was like out of high school and I didn't know where I was going. I'd go home, I'd go to work, I'd try to get in with a crowd and I knew I would-I'd always try to get into a crowd. I'd always agree with everything-yeah, yeah, yeah, she-she's rotten. Yeah, yeah. Now do you like me because I agree with you? And then I'd come home and I'd escape into the TV and the only thing I ever did that whole time was take violin lessons. That was like the only thing I ever motivated myself to do in that whole time was take violin lessons-three years and I quit that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT See, and it was like, otherwise I didn't know what the heck I was. I didn't know where I was going, what I was doing. It was really a bad, bad thing. And then I went into to look for a secretarial college and that's when I met Jodie after awhile, at a secretarial college. And I just went into the first place and I said "Well, I guess I should get some secretarial skills." And they've got a medical-I was going to be a medical secretary. [61:23]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And then they convinced me to go into the law firm secretary-see, they just convinced me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...I finally did something, wow, I did something on my own and the first school I went into I didn't check, I didn't check on them to see if they were accredited. For all I could have been-they were a really rotten school but I didn't know this when I got in. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT I didn't look into it, I didn't watch a class. I didn't do anything. They just talked me into it. I signed the papers the same day. I didn't think about it, I didn't show anybody the contract. It was like, I didn't know, I said "Okay, you said do this, I'll do this" and that was it. It was always like that with my life. I never really tried I never really tried-I knew I didn't like secretarial work and yet I thought as long as I was in it I was stuck with it, see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wanted to be a doctor and when I broke my back, I couldn't be one. So it was like I had poured all my energy since I was a little kid into thinking of being a doctor and then when I couldn't be a doctor, it was "Ah". You know, it was like I didn't know where I was or where I was going or what I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yes, just sort of walking around in a fog and...</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR ...letting what hit you hit you and not really directing yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT ...and yet now, when I look at something, even on a movie, if you see an operation and all the blood and everything, I think to myself "Ugh. I don't think I could ever be a doctor." (laughs) I'd get sick at the operating table. And it would be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's time to stop, but it sounds like you're really going through a lot of changes and most of them are good. This is like it is sort of whizzing by and you can really see the way you were and the way you are now. [62:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. And I guess that is correlation in a way. Like things are coming back and things are starting to fit in place...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT ...and, you know, and it's like, like with my mother was the first time I realized that, that, like now I feel, I can feel like a little more of a-like I'll think about her and think I should get out to see her. I never thought that before. I guess after six months I'd say "Oh boy, if I don't get out there, she's going to think..." But it wouldn't be like that, it would be like now I would like to go out and see my mother. I guess what it really meant is like I felt that after I realized that I could love and then I felt happy to see other people happy and know that I had made somebody happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And then to realize that this is, this is a sort of love in a certain way. Or to be there with a friend-and I could never do that because I was always afraid I'd lose them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT Like with Jim, my other friend. I told him right out, I said "Look..." this and that. I told him he should go into therapy too, because he's been in Viet Nam and, you know, like things when you see a Vietnamese person sitting there and you laugh and it's not hysterical, it's just funny to you. You know that there is like a shell that you put yourself in and you've got to get out of it. And he's still like that...he doesn't seem to like himself either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT And I don't want him to feel that way because to me he's something pretty special. He tried to help me. He's a smart guy. When he relaxes, he's funny as heck. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT He's a real sweet, nice guy. And he needs therapy and I know it and I want to get him into it, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. I get the feeling you're saying this has been really good for you and you're really glad you came. Something like that. [64:32]</p>

<p>PATIENT It's so funny because I'm waiting for the depressed stage. See, I guess I thought that that was what was wrong. My girlfriend has gone-went she went through-I told her she's a different person from me, but she says everybody goes through it, that you go through-I did go through a period of depression already. Probably maybe I'll go through another one, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But you're kind of afraid that that's coming? Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT No, I'm afraid that maybe I'm not going to go through it and maybe that I'm supposed to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT See, and like she said she was crying all the time and everything-only once, like one night, I almost started to cry because my boss had to say something stupid like "Well if you want me to be like your father..." then oh Christ, and then I was like oh I was depressed but I wasn't crying all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR That-you're thinking you should be doing that and if you're not, then you're not getting healthier. </p>

<p>PATIENT Right. That's kind of a scare I get. That I'm not-you know-because she said you have to be like a rag and you have to be completely-go through lots of changes. And I know I've had lots of deep hurts and so, like, I was sort of just sitting there waiting. Ok, now when is it going to come. And like I cried, and I even cried a couple times at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR My feeling about that is that it doesn't necessarily have to be. I mean, if it comes, it comes. But, you're right, you're a different person from her.</p>

<p>PATIENT And see, like-well, like my-see-and another thing, too, is she didn't go through a real depressed stage. She went through a stage every time something was said that reminded her of whatever, she'd start to cry. But see, I don't cry-she said that it's natural to cry a lot. But, even when I was a little kid, I didn't cry lots. You know, like I'll cry, I'm not saying I haven't cried since I started. I cry here, you've seen it. And I've cried once or twice at home. But I just get depressed. See, I'll get to a place where I just feel like "Oh Christ, if I don't get better pretty soon, I'm going to..." Whereas she would, she would just start crying about it. Like, I would think about something like, like my mother or something and I would say I might think to myself "Why didn't she love me? Why this? Why-what did I do? Things like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It sounds like it is hard for you to believe that you're not going to be going through the same things that she went through in therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT I think so. Because see, another thing she keeps doing is like when I do talk to her and I tell her about any breakthrough I had-well you're just starting therapy. I say "Jesus Christ, I'm three-fourths done with this part." And she's telling me "You're just starting." Pretty soon it's going-and, you know, I'm thinking to myself "I thought I caught like most of the big things that were wrong already."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT I'm thinking to myself I'm starting to build a little bit and I'm almost afraid to build. I think that's part of it. I'm afraid to start running and other things and start getting into it and then if I do go to pieces, I'm going to have put everything aside and I won't be able to do anything. And I said to myself "But will I go through that?" Because I don't know." I don't-I feel better now. I don't feel like I should. I feel like it should be steadily getting worse and worse and worse and yet, it's not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yet it seems to be getting better and you...</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR ...you're finding you're afraid that any day now you might crack or fall to pieces because it's too good or something. [67:52]</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, right, right, right. Because it is like a feeling of-you know like I feel like now I don't have to be somebody else, which is so-I mean, I'll probably always go through a little bit of that. You know, if you meet somebody that's really-you might try to-not consciously, but subconsciously pick up something of theirs that is very charming, that you think is very charming. But that's like going to school and learning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT You know, you take up something like this. But it would be like I wouldn't feel like I would have to be that person, consume myself in everything they've done and everything they do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR We have to stop...</p>

<p>PATIENT Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR We can keep on (inaudible 68:30)</p>

<p>PATIENT You mean the hour or the twenty-fifth session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR The hour.</p>

<p>PATIENT Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But we can talk about that, too (inaudible 68:44)</p>

<p>PATIENT Partly. Because I'm afraid sometimes I'm not sure that everything is out. I think part of it is me and part of it is maybe I do have something that still hasn't come up and I, you know, want to get over with. And part of it, I think, is-like my girlfriend keeps saying "You're just starting". (chuckles) Oh Jesus, this is just starting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Let's talk about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT Which way? In which area? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR What you are saying. It sounds like you're worried about the (inaudible 69:23) of twenty sessions and you're not sure we're going to get everything done that we need to get done. Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. That's partly it. I'm not, see...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Well, why don't we talk about that next time. And you can still-[I'll worry for you (ph 69:36).]</p>

<p>PATIENT Okay, well good. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay, see you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT Okay. [69:50]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah the birthday get-together was nice... really nice weather, they're all from different locations. I've known them all pretty long... one since kindergarten and then my cousin too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my gosh yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course Jillian and then another friend. It was just good to be with old friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Do most of them know about your recovery?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just my cousin and Jillian.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that seemed to go okay with all of the openness and since you have such a long history with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah we really just kind of talked a lot about our lives and we met for lunch and then a few, two of them had to go back to work and so then we just shopped around and went walking around because it was so nice downtown. And then we all met up for the early dinner to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that that worked out really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm glad you got away from the routine as the mom of twins.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And got a whole girls day out for your birthday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah , but I have my cousin, you know the one that seems to be struggling with an eating problem... the one who did Optima fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Is that the one that came to the birthday party?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes yeah. And I wanted to get a picture of all the girls and she refused to be in it... she just refuses to be in pictures. I really wanted her to be in it because it was so unusual for everybody to be there together. So then at the last minute she kind of, you know we were all standing side by side and then she kind of pushed me in front of her and kind of turned me squared on like straight to the camera to hide behind me and take the picture. And it turned out to be like a pretty unflattering picture of me because it was squared on so kind of made me just a little bit upset.  It was like, "Why would you just throw me in front of you and hide behind me?" I was fine being in the picture... I've been putting myself in more pictures lately but she just kind of turned me in front of her to where I was totally covering her up. And I was a little put off by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it probably would have put me off too but it certainly would be a reflection of the amount of pain she's in. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That she'd do that to somebody that she loves and adores. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so I was looking back at the pictures this morning when I put them on the Internet I was like, "Oh it's not the best picture" and I had a little bit chatter in the beginning of like, "Oh gosh" but then I was like, "Well you know, at least I put myself in the picture," and, took the picture so that was kind of the only thing that I had kind of come up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good so is it that same site? Are you going to e-mail the group so we can see your birthday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I haven't set up the website in a while because I've been so busy but I can just e-mail out the picture to group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay good, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so did you and Jillian get a chance to celebrate your six months of abstinence when you had a little privacy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because we were in the car for a little bit together...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...when I went to pick her up and we were just able to kind of talk about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's been been sick for a while ... when I walked into her apartment and her whole apartment smelled like gas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "Jillian do you smell that?" And she was like, "No, no." And I was like, "Oh my gosh." Even being in her apartment she lives in a tiny tiny little place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I said, "Has this been why you've been sick? How long has..." she was like, "Well I smelled gas like a couple weeks ago."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh so we had to have the utility people come over and fix it while we were at dinner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my gosh well thank God you visited, because that would certainly make all the sense of her being nauseous and sick...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nauseous and dizzy. Having headaches yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so I was really thankful for that because it was really bad. I mean I felt pretty sick and I was in there for about ten minutes and you know I was opening up all of her windows and her door and I just did not feel good for a little bit after that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow you were like an angel brought into her life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because that could have been serious... I mean it was bad and I guess you can't smell it after a while... you just become used to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, so yeah we were able to do that and she seemed in good spirits. And she's still really sore from the car accident and just the walking around she got really tired and really sore pretty easily so we just kind of sat a lot and talked a lot. So but yeah it was great to get to six months of abstinence and to get to talk to her about it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, good good good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I wasn't to fearful of the fact that I got to six months... hopefully I've maybe found the key of just making sure to follow the bottom line instead of jumping ahead. I have a lot of hope that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well tell me what you mean in jumping ahead... tell me what you meant exactly. I think I know but I want to hear you talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well before I'd get four or five months of abstinence, then I immediately went into, "Okay I've got this down so I'm going to really just focus on making my meals extremely healthy." Going into the self-care and going back  into the healthiest meals, where I wasn't even paying attention to the bottom line for abstinence. Like as far as not adding add-ons or not eating in front of the TV or just kind of trigger eating behaviors that I've done. You know I was back to doing those but maybe with healthy foods.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so my meals still kind of had that disease energy in it and I guess slowly without me kind of being aware of it, it kind of led me to believe like well as long as my meals were healthy then I was abstinent.  So if I had maybe an add-on or impulsiveness, or ate in from of the TV that was okay... but that was weakening my abstinence and, making me feel like I wasn't really arresting the eating addiction... that I wasn't really abstinent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It effected the abstinence yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Impulsiveness keeps that chemical imbalance going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it keeps us much more vulnerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so, what you're doing this time is just sticking with the three meals a day nothing in between and no impulsiveness...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No impulsiveness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At meal times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And planning, definitely planning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Planning the meals before meal time, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When I go to bed at night I mean the meals are...well, I would say they're still pretty pretty healthy, but I'm not obsessing over the meals or food... I'm making sure that the 3 meals a day is the main priority.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're sticking with or going for the 80/20 rule of nutritionally healthy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we shouldn't even try to eat 100% healthy unless there's a serious health problem... I don't think it works at all for us to eat more than the 80 percent healthy... then it's easy to not sweat the 20%. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If we are trying to eat healthy 100% , it just kicks in dieting mentality...  all the crazy addiction chatter. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So good. It does sound like you've gotten a different perspective on this long term abstinence. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and it feels very, very different to me. Just like I said, the afternoons are sometimes a struggle but I'll just say okay, it's not dinner time yet and I read sometimes and I do have that satellite radio so I've just been putting it on maybe Oprah or just kind of a nice talk show or something to just kind of listen to and that's been really helpful to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sure sounds like the foundation you'd always hoped for is getting solid more and more solid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm also cautious too... but it does definitely feel solid a lot more than in the past. And I think it's because I'm working the steps as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because working the 12 Steps makes me feel like I'm not keeping any secrets and that I'm trying to uncover everything that might be under the eating addiction and that I'm trying to at least use all the tools.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And are you working with Julie as a sponsor?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah we talk about probably about twice a week... we talk regular friend talk but we have step question meets about twice a week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where we go through my step work so that's been working out really well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very nice, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like I'm able to take a chunk...like I'm glad I'm kind of going over the first three steps and then when I got to my inventory, the 4th step, I'm glad that I have a good foundation of abstinence before I start that "looking back over my life" process because I see how important it is to get to a good place as far as abstinence wise... just get out of the food and the eating to be able to really be more clear about all that dark stuff and be able to not be in such a vulnerable place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Abstinence wise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely. Yeah I think that it is really hard to walk into that fourth step when we're really new and don't have much confidence in the recovery path... or not enough trust in that partnership with God. But with the steps... you know the first three are so important, they are that foundation. And we just kind of go over and over and over them all through our years of recovery but step four, where we're starting that  "searching and fearless moral inventory," sometimes it's easier to start with the topic inventories... you know, the ones we've done as the chapters in the workbook study... where you take the "looking backward" posture... remember... if we videotaped your life in your 20s what would we think you believed about a particular subject and then what do you think God would have you believe about that subject or what's the spiritual truth about that subject. That exercise or exercises, kind of help you set a stage for really taking a searching and fearless moral inventory of yourself... I don't think until we kind of know what our values are, that it's a good idea to jump into that looking backward step.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because we get too punitive too engrossed in guilt and self-loathing so when you have your new beliefs very solidly articulated... written down and using them, then it is so much easier to go back over our past.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it seems that way because I know when I've tried to do the inventory step before, I was just wanting to dig so deep but I ended up so very hard on myself and just being so ashamed. But then I felt like I was supposed to be doing that so it was really daunting to think about doing all that again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That, that was my experience too so I wanted to really make sure I knew what my new values were, what did I want to live by. And the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous says we had to let go of all of our old ideas, and I thought well it's probably important to know exactly what those old ideas and old patterns are if we're going to let them go...  and then the Big Book also says we need to shape a scene and sound ideal for living. Okay that's the part I want to do before I jump into the historical stuff and get overwhelmed in it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that sounds like what you're doing with Julie as a sponsor, working the steps, and what we're doing with the chapters in my book...they are going to really dovetail nicely together so that you do feel that foundation is there where it wasn't so much when you were earlier on trying to get abstinent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and she had me get a journal and put together my favorite the spiritual sayings... just like we're doing in group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah yeah!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe or print them out with really pretty paper put them by the bed side so that I can just flip to any of the spiritual versus'... having it typed out or written out but then it's really pretty to look at too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What a great idea yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have most of my recovery stuff in a binder and it looks more like business stuff so just making something really beautiful to see and then open it up and read. So I've been starting to collect different cards and different sayings I like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well did she ever show you hers? She did such a beautiful job. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No she still has hers but I've never seen it. But she was telling me about it... she was like, "Has Josephine had you do that?" I was like, "No I think I have a collection of them but I haven't put it in an artistic form." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, but no, I don't tell clients to do the artistic part, she just made up the artistic part on her own. And I'd forgotten what an incredible job she did with all of her favorite poems and spiritual sayings and stuff. And she's so artistic anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's also been having me, usually after my step questions, she's been having me try talk about my spiritual truth with Step I work on... if I bring up a lot of emotions, she'll keep me on the phone call and help and talk to me through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh great great great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's been good so that way I don't unleash my emotions and then feel so "ugh" afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well it sounds like you couldn't have gotten a better match for the path that you're already on... she's just right there with you... a great sponsor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and so next Monday I'll be starting the business course they sent me.  It's huge book that arrived last week. So I've been sitting down and trying to take a stab at it. Of course with the kids, it just seems impossible...  but with them I don't want to say it seems impossible but every time I go to sit down I think I have them settled and then they just come running in and so I'm like okay this is, it's new for me to have any type of studying materials after having children. John is home today and tomorrow during the day so I'm going to try to maybe get away and go sit down, at a caf� like he does when he goes to study.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll do that.</p>

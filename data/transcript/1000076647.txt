<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Carrie's third interview with (inaudible 0:00:10.5). Okay, now, you were asking me if I'm always if I was nervous as a client. And I said I very often was, I wasn't always but I was very often. As a matter of fact, it's a good idea to be nervous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what Josh says anyhow. In fact, that's, that's what he says that's the only thing you have to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I reacted really strong to this morning. I went up and I said I just sort of like I wanted to come, I went through the whole thing of coming because I really wanted to be here, but then I looked at today (inaudible 0:00:41.3) responsibility but I got, you know, I reacted very strangely to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like another thing pulled me apart and said I should be coming tell me to get together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to get adjusted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now what do you mean by that, adjusted?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was giving I always I was teasing you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, now what I'm looking for is, is your diary. I like the way you do that by the way, I like the way you write it and don't sign it and all that. No, I, I like that serious, because I can recognize who it is. And then I don't have to be quite as careful with it, because if it gets lost, you know, it's the confidentiality is not broken.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I like that because then when I finally put it in a folder here then I can write down who it is. But, that's good see because I think I lost it. No I, I didn't lose it but I just can't put my finger on it at the moment. Damn it. Uhm, I, I want to find it though if I can quickly. It was very ah it was very interesting. I, I got a lot out of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you? (0:02:00.1) Because I almost ripped it up and did another one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was. From my point of view it was like ah for being helpful to me it was one of the most helpful ones I have ever gotten. See I didn't think you were that (inaudible 0:02:13.0 - due to laughing). Because I, I think it got a major I think it captured a major thing for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With, within that hour with, with us or something. It sounded like it was a - what did you say in it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah go ahead, go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want me to tell you what I said?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said that I thought that the sun, summertime I, it I would consider an evil trip almost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now wait a second that's ah - before we do that let's talk about let's, let's talk about that I want to do that but let's, let's talk about bringing in Olivia. I want to make sure you still want to do it and if you don't I'm going to badger you into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You really miss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Solid me. Are you ready?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, good. I'll call her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to talk about that. That ah diary because it was very interesting and ah I was not surprised by it. I kind a like, you also (inaudible 0:03:39.7) I'm a little scattered to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum. Because of the last few days?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I haven't had time to put my memos in the right pile, much less I haven't been able to keep in touch with how much I was falling behind. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's great. (0:04:04.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, my piles were falling behind, you know, here's a pile things to do I hadn't even had a chance to put the things into a pile.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello, so, yes, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What does she do just sit here well no I know, I'm kind ah embarrassed by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, for the benefit of you good folks listening to this tape if you are we're bringing in a consultant. It's not clear how much that tape doesn't listen to, it just maybe five minutes out of the hour. </p>

<p> Oh, Olivia this is Carrie.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Carrie.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Carrie. Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Ah, two isn't going to do this. I was thinking of another way of doing this. One way, is to do it the way it says in the paper. Another way is to, to ask you things that we want you, okay? Uhm, I want to talk about how we might think would proceed. One way is to do it that the way it says in the paper. The other way to do it is to when we want her we call her and you shut up until we want you. Another way is that, that second way except with the addition of I mean if you want if you really can't hold onto a lot of stuff you're building, you know, uhm you can raise your hand and we can chose to ignore you or respond to you. (0:06:06.2) What do you, what do you how do you feel?</p>

<p>OLIVIA: I would not I mean if she raised her hand I couldn't ignore it anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I could.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I could, I have her dates. Yeah, that's interesting though that's interesting yes. Even if she was talking I could ignore her if I wanted to. Uhm, you're saying if she raised her hand, I think we should just try to do it the way it sounded the first time. Okay? You're going to give us about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Yeah, I mean there's no reason why we can't do both I mean if you feel like there is something pressing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you want to come in then do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. We'll do it the way happens, how's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you want, do you want? You're really not going to put all that stuff in your head are you? A dangerous place like your head hyper lucid. Now we were, where were we? Now how are we going to start (inaudible 0:07:17.1). Ah, yes, no, go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What were we talking about before?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, whatever you want to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why, why don't we talk about how I reacted to, you know, last week's session?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Diary, which I can't put my finger on. How did it feel about me not being able to put my finger on it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ticked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm kind of annoyed at myself too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Give me 60 seconds. It's in the black box somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't in it was just in a plain white envelope if that's any help it didn't have the, you know, address on it. (0:08:00.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I remember, I remember very well. I think I put it in an envelope to take it home.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be nice that, that sounds good, doesn't it? I mean that sounds wow he took it all the way home with him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sounds organized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like do things with it and where the hell is it. I do, do that with things that I really want to look it. I look at them quick here and then I take them home and look at them. I had a special envelope here when, when the shit was hitting the fan. I had been through, through all those things that I wanted to take home quickly. And I think that envelope is still at home. So you're pissed at me. I guess you're going to have be pissed at me because I don't think I'm going to find it very quickly. Okay, you're angry at me you're angry. Should we talk about the contents?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, how you felt </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, it was like nothing was really resolved just, you know, like I just sort of brought things out and then I just I sort of felt good but that really wasn't going anywhere it was really superficial.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It struck me that now that I remember that you felt embarrassed afterwards about feeling good in here, is what it struck me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I thought it was false of feeling good I mean because nothing really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing really happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean nothing really changed, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You were still your old virgin self, hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We were talking about uhm shall I talk to her? (0:10:02.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure, well no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Just talk to me. Unless, if you need information she'll raise she'll butt in if she needs information. We stay, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said ah you were feeling good, but that I was crazy you didn't say that in those words but you said it was a false feeling or something, something like that. And you were feeling good in here but then when you went out it felt false because of (inaudible 0:10:36.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The feeling good in here was good, feelings are what they are I mean they're not something else later or something different. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm following you what you say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Like I'm saying the feeling good was good, it wasn't false.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I'm not going to let you talk, I'm going to try not to let you talk it away later.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in my head not only then, another thing you had later was uhm there was some embarrassment about being who you were I thought. I mean I heard yourself putting yourself down in that diary; that is, anything like uhm oh I was acting my old flirtatious way, something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I happened to like it frankly. I mean I didn't think you were I didn't see you as being obnoxiously flirtatious or flirtatious I didn't, I didn't perceive you as being flirtatious at all. Uhm, although you were I mean okay. But that would, the way you were I liked is what I want to say I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess what I meant by that is like I don't think I, I think I joked about it and it's really serious to me, you know, and I don't know if the seriousness came across. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just feel I do that with too many things that mean a lot to me. (0:12:02.3) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can make jokes out of the it really hurts kind of underneath it all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's what I was trying to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I also I didn't</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. No, no let me let me take that in. Yeah, I certainly got that from the letter that's when I can remember I said uhm that, that seemed like one of my the best diaries or something there was there was reading something there were really where you were at, I mean, I really saw that as a serious thing. Uhm, on the other hand I don't want to take away the humorous part of what we were doing either. That was good too that was real too. But I also see it ah you were saying that those little there is pain underneath and I don't want to push that I want to resolve that, I don't want to just do my old ways again. Hun, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I guess I thought it was like, you know, resolved sort of and it wouldn't go on, but it wasn't resolved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it was like one thing discussed onto another thing I wanted to discuss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, very interesting. Okay. That, okay ah so when so when you got out you fell back in old ways of feeling that you didn't like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, yeah. I felt like look at (inaudible 0:13:33.9) uhm, who is kidding who, you know, you better go it still bothers you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You better go back in there and tell him that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah I understand that. Okay, I'm glad you came back and to tell me that (inaudible 0:13:47.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I didn't, see that is what I would have expected though I think that's that kind of issues you're going to confront for awhile and feel good about parts of it and then feel bad (inaudible 0:14:04.3), feel good about and bad okay. Uhm, in fact I think the closer you get to resolving it the more you are going to be doing that. In other words, you are going to go through some pain you wanted pain, I think you're going to get some. Okay? I don't know if it's going to be the kind of what you wanted or expected, but pain you're going to get some. Ah, because as soon the closer you get to that dealing with that the more painful it is going to get probably, maybe, maybe. Ah, and it's going to feel very good for awhile and then it's going to go back and feel bitter so I think that's something you're going to have to live with for awhile, maybe, that's my guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there anything else in that diary? Respond to that though does that make sense? Does it help or clear up or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it, it you see I, I didn't sort of like uhm how I felt I was in a relationship kind of like I think I thought that I was just waiting because you didn't say, you know, so uhm your aversion that it bothers you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why are you still, you know, like, like deeper issues, like I </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It bothered me but I was waiting for to you say Jennifer what's you're, you know, when it should be me so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't think that a lot of times I want to face what really bothers me, so I kind a have this happy shell around me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, yeah I know. You become Alice in Wonderland.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mary Poppins.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mary Poppins, right Mary Poppins ah perfect, beautiful. Okay. And that's a very important point that you brought up for me. Uhm, I have feelings about that uhm something, something around ah. Sometimes I believe the way you're talking that is there's a deeper issue underneath that and if we get to that and crack that. (0:16:05.6) That's, that's where it goes, okay? And I do that too okay. Sometimes I think there isn't anything deeper then what we're doing, is what I'm saying. Uhm, and you have to be careful with me sometimes well not careful but I'm, I'm going to take you literally a lot when you are really going to want to go deeper. So you're going to have to say wait a minute I want to go more into that, don't take me so damn literally. Okay? But, let's go back to you now. Okay? Uhm, there you're closer to something underneath there. Did you have ah what is more give me more, what is underneath all of that, that stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean what did we miss what did we cover over, is what I'm asking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I think that like when I thought over what had happened, you know, I, I thought that sometimes a lot of times what I, you know, do in any sort of, you know, relationship I have like I really don't exert what I really am and what I really feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like I wanted to go I really think I did want to go deeper uhm, Monday, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. Okay. You were disappointed in yourself for falling into, into the old pattern really kind a emphasis to it a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I figure this is the one place I shouldn't have to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That was you under crisis, okay? Okay. You were under some pressure I was talking about going to bed with you, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And really wanting to and (inaudible 0:17:56.0), you know, okay and then you got into your Mary Poppins thing, flying around on your broom, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Up the window.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, that's okay, that's okay to me that feels okay because now we know how to recognize that part that you don't want to be. Unless that would happen we mean I might not have had a such a good sense of it. Because now I, I can see it and I'll see it very clearly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, that's very good. Too bad, we don't have a video tape. Because there are two points about that. One point is, for me anyhow, that part that's the way you don't want to be, and I understand that. But I wouldn't want you to be that way all the time either. And the other part is I like that I still like the way you were, okay. But I think the problem is not to eliminate that at all, but the problem is to give you some other options so you can choose. Right now you are not being you are not able to choose between being there which is really (inaudible 0:18:48.4). Or doing or getting more serious or.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I want to be yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, so like developing a choice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So like when you're doing in here I meant say to you something, you really want to do that? Or let's try doing it this way, maybe that will get us deeper or uhm you don't have to smile (inaudible 0:19:08.5) when we're talking about these things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you don't have to jump over, let's see where what's underneath that, okay? So then we can try getting some choices here. Where are you now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I was just thinking that, that's uhm a way I said that in diary that I, I act a lot when I don't want to face problems especially threats like in a relationship with a guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so I just sort of act like I'm not, you know, then I just sort of don't have to handle the seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or make excuses, you know, like well I'm not ready for the relationship anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened (inaudible 0:19:55.7) something happened you shifted, you came forward you doing a lot of eye contact what, what happened here something happened with us, something happened and you with us? (0:20:07.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I thought maybe, you know, like first I thought we were really just sort of discussing something that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really meant a lot to us I guess that's why I moved forward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. You felt more into it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. I'm trying to get a better sense of what when you do things with your body it means something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really means something. I'm trying to get what that is, okay. If I felt, I felt ah when you did that much closer to you, like you really came to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum. Yeah, I felt that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let's, shall we do her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 0:20:55.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like you're sticking up there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, we're doing you now. Go ahead.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Ah, it's, it's not quite consolidated yet so you have to help me with it a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. You don't have to be perfect either.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uhm, for awhile about five minutes ago I felt like ah you were taking up way too much space, it was some kind of question and answer session and you were just sitting over here waiting to see what, what he would come up with next. And you were going to respond to that but it wasn't like you had space or it was your time and that you were going to do what you wanted to do. It was like you were going to</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I want to respond to that. Okay. I don't want you to I want you to finish that item, but I don't want you go onto another one until we deal with that item.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's an important item.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Okay, let me finish it then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Ah, I don't know what I want to say at this point. Uhm, looking as are you willing to do that in your ah, you would follow his lead or something like that. You, you would let that happen, something about that. (0:22:08.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: And not letting her take up space.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without yeah.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Yeah. And your side was something about taking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum. Yeah, that's uhm I felt uhm I'm doing react to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I think I said that in the diary and I took it to bother me about (inaudible 0:22:28.6), I thought that I wasn't really getting to what I, you know, I was anxious. He didn't say anything about uhm, you know, like why you feel the way you are, why are you frightened, I didn't discuss it.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words I, I would bring myself delay.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't felt that as, as much today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because maybe there at least. Well, number one (inaudible 0:22:51.7) because you're here, I think. So I don't really sort of think as much in terms of us two.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, number two is, that was the thing a kind of I wanted to talk about as soon as I came in, you know, and I have so I, I am so I guess letting myself flow more.</p>

<p>Can I just say something else, I very strange sort of attitude toward therapy. I thought that he would never said anything kind of, you know.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I just love it when he talks sort of. I as I told, you know, I just felt that like he sat in a chair and just watched you.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I'd a pretty </p>

<p>OLIVIA: So you're still getting use to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I like it yeah because like it's human to human I guess I can refer </p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To (inaudible 0:23:35.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A nice analogy she goes home she's not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I, right, ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But there were two messages in what you said that are important to me for me. One is that, you know, I think you're right, I think you are dead right (inaudible 0:23:50.1). I should get more into the why in my - there was two things the why of what you're into I think you're dead right on that. And another was you want to get deeper and I should be helpful if I ask you why about your feeling and ask you why you really feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, I mean I, I think it's probably myself also and that is what I said sometimes I do it in a relationship because I know what I want to do. Like you said you wouldn't feel you had, you know, she raised her hand, answer her. Well somehow I feel responsibility for other things. But I should tell you, you know, look shut up I want to (inaudible 0:24:33.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's it, it's a two edge blade is what you're saying.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Right, it's both of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: And you're not letting her do enough I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: And she's not speaking up for herself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. And then let me tell you, that's a major thing, right? Like that's how our pathologies meet. That's my male chauvinism and you're hysterical little girlness, I'm going to take over big man, you're going to be a little girl and that's the way, that's, that's the way we can interact with each forever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And that's how like if you left now that would have been very helpful to me, that, that one piece. But there's</p>

<p>OLIVIA: And you what ends up sounding like is you, you floundered, you know, you floundered through response and it takes you, you know, a minute to make up something and that tells something about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right, that's right, I'm creating things.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't what are you creating?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm creating more to say on it to keep running the show.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can do that for awhile. It was seven years ago really. Uhm, but there's but there was more than that I thought. I thought you would still ask to be asking to be drawn out. Uhm</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I, I imagine I still will be for awhile I mean I, I just but I think I'm aware of it. I was aware of it after Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think two things should happen. One, I think I should draw you out more (inaudible 0:26:04.9) and secondly I think you should tell me to shut up and do more of it yourself. Ah, something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both of those things could be useful. Now this is, can I say something now about? This would be for both of you. I, this, this guy who I was with the last three days happen to be a very sharp psychologist, he was (inaudible 0:26:36.7) 15, 20 years ago and he just came out with he's coming out with a book called "Games People Ought to Play" and really a fantastic (inaudible 0:26:46.3) and after we were done with all of that other stuff then we and his stuff and my stuff mesh like this, amazing. For example, what, what made me think about it he has an exercise called Drawing Out, understandable, that the way of getting deeper. We might try that sometime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's, but that's - we don't have I don't want to try it immediately, but that is something we might try in a week or two if you want. It only takes five minutes. Okay. Now more, let me shut up now.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: I didn't get a sense that you felt finished with what you were just saying just now. When you said you were trying to be more aware of it or become more aware of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I was finished that maybe I wasn't finished. I guess I was finished, you know, like I felt that (inaudible 0:27:50.2). Just saying that uhm, you know, I am aware of it, that I was aware of it on Monday and stuff like that, but, you know, I think it would be something helpful, you know, to deal with. Because I think there are whole other questions where I, I just had really had this feeling of responsibility. That is, sometimes over my (inaudible 0:28:13.0) it would be worth more to me but I also don't think that.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum. Where you end up not speaking for yourself and bitching about it afterwards.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: So it just sort of builds up frustration for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Well the thing that happened with him is what happened (inaudible 0:28:30.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum. But I think that's two things I mean right off the bat. One is that uhm that will be good for me to stop doing that, one. And two it's a good feeling after I'm doing that to have you stop me from doing that. In other words, by cutting out more of your own space even with, even with a guy like me. I think both ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me, you want me to ask you now? Uhm, yeah I, I keep wanting you to stop doing it because here it's ah particularly now when you're first getting it out or something it's important for you to hear that. And later on maybe you can insist a little more or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just hit me now where, where the problem lies. That is uhm not that I'm doing too much of it, it's a structural thing. (0:30:03.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, I'm you're not making enough of the decision points.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, that paper every week the decision point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I question that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That, that's the whole picture. Like it would be okay if I kept spinning if you wanted me to, if you said, okay keep spinning. Okay. If you said kept doing it I'll stay keep doing it I'll stay. But, now we should do this stage. Then I can do whatever I want, because you would let me do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But right now I'm thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm tending to make those decisions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You keep saying (inaudible 0:30:36.2). </p>

<p>OLIVIA: And she said, of course, and that's the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay, so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I, it's also because I'm just really I don't uhm I don't quite yet understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know the game yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I don't know the game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know the rules of the game, right. So read the rules, I gave you the rules read the list.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe you can do you can just let it flow for awhile and do a little ah, you know, label.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of imposing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little labeling all right, yeah.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: What does labeling mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It means, okay what are we doing? Just like okay now we're doing the next. So well you guys could get into it recognizing what we're doing.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: So she can control it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, so you can control it until you recognize what kind of processes these were in, you can't control it.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean like ah I have private information now and I can just move you all over the board.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if we're playing a chess game and I'm both black and white. At this point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's because you don't know the rules yet. But once you know the rules and they're not that hard. I mean just reading through that a few times will be very helpful. And then you can say hey oh wait a minute you're breaking the rules, I'm suppose to decide there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well why don't you just do it, you should just talk for awhile and ah let things happen as they happen going close and, and just label, discriminate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This, this, this is this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. There is one important point in there everything is not in that paper it ought to be in there and that's we can change the rules. (0:32:05.7) You can change the rules, I can't well we both really can. If you don't like the rules we can change them because that's important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's another thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But first you have to learn the rules.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before you can change them. They are pretty good rules, I mean you win (inaudible 0:32:25.6). Now you have to be completely boggled by now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I am honestly feeling sort of resentment, like I'm a bog now (inaudible 0:32:37.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay. Okay, that's good, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's my reaction. You know, like letting you just move me around the chess board.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Well that is what he has been doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's what I've been doing.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: I mean you should feel resentful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know about that. (Inaudible 0:32:55.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's when I feel like yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not the needle, it's not the needle I mean.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Now what a minute.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm being defensive right?</p>

<p>OLIVIA: You are being defensive. A feeling is a feeling. I mean, there are two things in that for you. I know what it feels like I mean I us it too. Uhm, you let someone take up your space and then you end up resenting it, you let someone manipulate you. You end up resenting it and that's real, the resentment. But part of it is from what you did and part of it is from what the other person did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: There are a whole bunch of parts to it. But, you should resent it, did it right? He was talking that way. Where does that leave you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That leaves you with a hun?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, for some reason I don't want I want to blame you and not myself at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well blame me, why not? (0:34:00.6) You can blame me. Carrie, you can be angry at me that's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not angry I, I can't be angry at you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see you, you want to say okay, okay I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to I mean there's a lot to be, you know, it's right, you know, but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying okay we've been making mistakes and, and I'm not sure but I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also uptight on having that recorder on and kind of having you here I don't know like maybe I'm not, you are not considering me human any more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum. We've got all these rules we've got the machinery we bring this in to do this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like you have to play with the fact that, you know, it's going to take me awhile to learn the rules.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I guess I am angry, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. that's interesting. Okay. Ah, now I want to be defensive for a moment, can I do the upstage? Can I be defensive, is that okay?</p>

<p>OLIVIA: First, respond to her feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: You said it was interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I want to respond to that in a couple of ways actually. One is, both of those feelings are legitimate. The one, the one initially I think you have a whole series of feelings there. First of all, you felt good and then all of sudden we're like we're doing a little criticism right? Here I thought it was good, I feel embarrassed and duked and angry and stupid and all of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are all good feelings. Uhm, now can I be defensive? Did I get that? Is that (inaudible 0:35:38.6). Let me see that's not the dominant one, the dominant one is now caution. I mean it's hitting back uhm wondering what you're into now. Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay, now this can I do (inaudible 0:36:01.9), my feelings.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Yep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The problem with it I think the reason we got into this particular bind is because of the way we are initial contact. If you recall when of the first few things I said to you was that okay, you have tested to death, right? And you explained to an interviewer, right? You went through all of that and I said ordinarily I do a preliminary interview also which takes an hour. And but I'm afraid to do that now because you have been just interviewed to death. All right? How could you go through another interview like that? Ah, so I'm going to try to do it gradually. Now ordinarily I would, I would give you that paper right off the bat, lay it all, give you all of the rules right away, talk them through. Like do you understand them maybe negotiate them. Ah, but I thought given you being this special research project that I would try it this other way. And this is really the first time I have tried it this way. And what this points out for me and what I get out of this personally is that when you are methodically inexplicit you run into trouble. Ah, like you, you have very legitimate feelings to the process, I think. Ah, very interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I do an I thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: First tell him what </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: (Inaudible 0:37:28.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what did I feel like? Or what are my feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your, your feelings that you just sort of made ah another decision about how to work with this science.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what was the feeling, that's your feelings of like fuck your science where am I. That's your feeling, I don't want to hear your feelings now. My feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you thought that you made a mistake that maybe it would have been better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If right from the beginning I was just, you know, (inaudible 0:37:59.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That, that's one part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want to have (inaudible 0:38:01.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One part of it is like I feel bad like I did make that mistake. And there is another part of it for me which is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not (inaudible 0:38:14.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, it's the positive part of your negative feeling. It's like your damn science, it's like hum that was very good. That's interesting that's people should know that I should write that down. And you're saying and you're feeling to that is oh fuck your science.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about me? What about me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No my I is just that, you know, like uhm it's started and it was just like sort of we're discussing me, you know, how I feel and then you come in and talk about things that maybe should have done labeling and all this shit, you know, I just really resenting it, kind of like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, me as me is no longer important, just sort of me, you know, reacting to this experiment as material.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: That's part of me too, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's part yeah uhm but I'm also, you know, what, because you, you brought it out, you know, so a lot of it is directed towards you but in a way I'm actually grateful to you for bringing it out. Because that is one ambivalence I have had since we started, I don't, you know, I, I like I said I just have these incredible images of what it all should be when it wasn't going the way it should be, you know, I just miss, you know, absolutely no way of sort of knowing the reality of it.</p>

<p>And so when it wasn't that and it was just this, you know, good interaction it was like friends, a nice friend to come to and also I'm for him today, you know.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Scientific terms and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I want to respond to that. I think there's a miscommunication going on here (0:40:02.8) with this science business. There are some things in that paper that aren't true. That are that I think you think I'm doing with you that I'm really not and I think there's some clarification necessary. One, I'm not doing anything new with you. I'm doing anything with you that I don't have a very strong felt sense that it works. Now in the paper I talk about risky, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've done that so many times now it doesn't feel risky to me when in and the next rewrite of that that's coming out. When I do do but I might want to do risky things with you, okay? Those I will clearly label. Like, here's something I'm not sure about or I have not done it before but I have a sense that it will work, would you like to try it? But if I don't say that you can be pretty, pretty sure that that's stuff that I really feel very comfortable with. Does that, I mean I'm not doing science with you, I mean this is not my thing. </p>

<p>OLIVIA: Is that the part of science that you know, what he is referring to now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm not experimenting on you, that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was it was just all of it I mean like the tape recording didn't bother me until today. This whole thing sort of a revolt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feeling. Because it turn just that (inaudible 0:41:15.6) I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I feel this (inaudible 0:41:17.9) I mean I came in here to get away from it and all of a sudden you say, you know, you're being manipulated and just once you know the rules. Which is right, I mean that's true but I just felt you shouldn't do it to me they can, but you shouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I won't have to. Ah, let's clear that up maybe a little bit. The labeling business is of the chess game yeah there's a distinction there though. (0:42:01.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I do an I in the chess game thing? That's just something that, you know, I just really feel, you know, it's a very close to me now because of feeling with being so totally manipulated here. That just really, really struck me at another, you know, that image just wouldn't I wouldn't feel as much as I do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it invokes also feelings, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I, I guess express the, you know, resentment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you're feeling it oh no not here too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I want to say to you what my feelings on that is. It's really not here too. I can see how it would seem that way given how we got into this but with the inexplicitness. But, it's not going to happen I here if I have anything to say about it. Ah, that's, that's part of the reason for calling her in as a matter of fact. So I wouldn't, I have some power I think I'm a very powerful person and part of the reason I called her in or anybody, like you can call in whoever you want, you know, like we can we can get other people as long as we both agree on it. Ah, if we don't both agree then we might still want to pull get, get two people to come in, one person you like and one person I like. So maybe, maybe you'll be pushing here I don't know. But the point of that is the point of having somebody else in here so is to check on me, to checking at me mainly. To make sure I'm not bulldozing you. I don't think I would I'm a nice guy, but, like there's things that you did point out now that would be more helpful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way we use to do this the way I use to do this was just take the tape I would ah take the tape and bring it to her somebody else and listen to it. I don't like that because I think that's still I doesn't give you your say so, you know, your ah yeah but what, you know, I don't agree with anyone of you people. I mean this gives an opportunity for you to, to be in on it, you know, and that's that I built that in to cut out the manipulation too. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More on what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In your own self, it seemed like. Okay, but that's go ahead yeah.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: I think you have to be careful about changing matrixes and about ah, ah injecting your science and your methods into this.</p>

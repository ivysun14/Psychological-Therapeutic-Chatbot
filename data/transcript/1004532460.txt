<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I was in -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: My mom died in June last year. It's not (inaudible at 00:08)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, she did last year and your dad is getting married just over a year later.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices) It doesn't mean I think of your mom in my life. It's like, "I know." I just don't know if she really likes me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Or just kind of long enough time with her?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because they started dating, what three months after?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It seems like - I know her.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, three months after your mom died is when they got together, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Something? So I mean, this is kind of familiar territory for me because I'm familiar with step-motherhood and all that kind of stuff. But I'm not saying I have any insights, it's obviously a lot different than my parents getting divorced and my dad getting remarried. But at the same time, I can understand that being a reason why you might - because you do this shit where it's like you have - and... to... on - and honestly, you do this stuff where there's something that's bothering you -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - and you act like because of what's the underlying thing that's bothering you, you act really immature or like a jerk or like - I don't know how to explain it. But you - there's something that's off with you. And I've known you long enough to know there's something going on, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And then it situates until when it was, like last... after we had like basically 24 hours of being like, "You suck, I hate being around you," kind of thing. And then just before I went to bed, she's like, "Oh, yeah, my dad is getting remarried at end of the summer, save the date, September 9th, is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I was like, "Oh, okay. That's what's going on. All right. Now, I understand." And it's like I don't know why you mean to do that. To try -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I don't know if that's the only thing (inaudible at 1:45).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, maybe it wasn't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe hanging out with my family makes me - and I try not to listen to my middle (ph) sister because....</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: When you come back from Virginia, it's like... I feel like you regress or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you guys normally have holidays together?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We have. We have (inaudible at 2:06).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I was there for Christmas, last - I mean, yeah, we do spend holidays together.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just went home like - well, this time and then after it was last summer. Well, there was my mom's funeral and he was there, but then I (inaudible at 2:20) stayed a week later.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And then she came back and -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And then I went home for vacation. (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And then she came back and cheated on me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just saying it's like... I'm just saying that something happens to you when you're in Virginia and it's not good... good for us. I don't get it. I'm sorry, I didn't mean -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - to interrupt you. Go for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, one sister had the best - was... was the only one that said, "Well, first of all, that guy is a bad friend." He's the only one who has to say (inaudible at 3:02) but then she also said that like, "There's lots of things that are bad for a marriage. And I'm not saying it's okay to be cheating because that's really bad. But it's not the only thing that's bad for (inaudible at 3:15).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's [Connie Gleason] (ph)?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever. I don't know. I try not to think about it. I can pretty much block thinking about her cheating on me through the day as much as I can. Like I can - just can't - at a certain point, I just can't deal with it. I got to say getting high helps a lot with that, just being honest. If I get high, then I don't think about it. It sucks. It sucks that that's a pattern. And I know it's personal responsibility and with or without Jessica whether or not there was that, that's something that I'm susceptible to, so it's probably just a lame excuse to get high. But I do know that when I do I get lots of work done, and I don't think about that shit.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And you spend about as much.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know. Not really, actually, I make more.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But you're right. No, it's financially untenable.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can I ask you, Jessica, when you... when you say that your sister said that having an affair, cheating isn't the worst thing that -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not divorcing. She said it wasn't the only thing that's bad for a marriage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wasn't the only thing? Well, when you say that, what are you trying to convey? [4:27]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out what she meant, I guess. Just, I mean, she's obviously trying to say that Michael has also done things that are bad for our marriage. I don't know exactly. It might just be - I don't know. They would say different things maybe thinking more of me than I do. Like I just say, "But well, I make the same mistakes that he does, so I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's the whole thing, aside from the whole... aside from the whole cheating like that whole infidelity thing, I feel like we were doing things equally bad for our marriage in the sense that what do something worse? That's just me. And she's been guilty of using drugs and it's like - and she's done all kinds of manipulative bullshit things and so have I.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I have? [5:30]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, of course, you have. Physiological neglect, all that kind of crap. I think we're equally guilty of those things. But one thing I didn't do was totally betray our marriage vows. So -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - that's you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, this is what I'm thinking. And I don't want to... I always want to be fair to be both people. And maybe it's a matter of you feeling that Michael is so angry that there's not space for it. But I have to say I don't think I've ever heard you just sort of just look Michael in the eye and say, "I'm so sorry."</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-hum. [6:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not to say that you don't both have things to apologize for in the relationship. But it... this is a big betrayal and this is not to shame you. But I... I do feel like your conveying that to him is an important part of the healing process, so the two of you can move forward.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, she says, "I'm sorry," all the time, but it's always in reaction to me being upset. And it... she's always like - yeah, she doesn't - yeah, you're right. She hasn't - you haven't once engaged me without being defensive, without just coming to me and... and conveying any kind of apology. Yeah, that kind of thing, apology, like she's saying. It's always... it's always like that. You never made eye contact with me when you say, "I'm sorry," because of the reason why you say, "I'm sorry," is in reaction to me being upset at you. [6:59]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I have made eye contact, but I -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, sure, right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I can't say it now because that would be considered -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, whatever. That's not the fucking point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean - well, let me say a couple things. And I'm not saying that you - I... I haven't seen it in here. And again, I... I realize I'm saying that and I don't mean to shame you at all. But this is part - right. But it's interesting because - actually the focus is on Jessica and I was sort of wanting to give her some space. And what happens, Michael, is I think this is maybe one of the reasons that it's been hard for her to have space is because you just jump in at her and rage. And I'm not saying that you shouldn't feel enraged. But in a sense, this might have been in opportunity to engage with her, but when you jump in, then she feels terrible and then the whole process starts again.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But he thinks if he doesn't say anything, then I won't say anything. [7:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but here, so this is where you both have a role. Right, take two. Jessica, you need to come out. And, Michael, you need to chill out. And both things need to happen because Michael can't chill out if he feels like there's space and you're not doing anything. But you... she can't have the space to do anything if you're jumping in.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I have been really chilled out about it. Like in the last week, and you left for three days, but like I've been in a really pretty cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not - and again, I'm not -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Here's my issue, is I go to sleep and I dream, and that's all I can fucking dream about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And it really sucks. And I mean, I'm just saying consciously, I'm able to avoid it because I know it's not helpful. And I'm not attacking her as... as much as I was at all really. It's not even really comparable to what it used to be in the last couple weeks. But the point... the point is then I go to sleep, and my subconscious mind is just run amuck with this thing. I wake up with nightmares constantly. Every night I can't get away from it. [8:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess not worrying about what's happening out - you know in your life is that your apathy (ph) your... a very small part of your day-to-day life. So let's just focus on right now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just right now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. A lot of the times it seems like you're not bothering to do anything about it and drinking or (inaudible at 9:25) drinking or doing drugs and that doesn't -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, you -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Do you still (inaudible at 9:38) when I was gone. I just (inaudible at 9:48) (pause) all I know is that I don't want to anymore (inaudible at 10:39).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, it's happening, so whatever.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 10:48) I'm just saying that it's not something to wait for.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 11:00).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you, I mean, I want this for both of you, so it's just about Michael at the moment, but around this, do you want Michael to feel better about this?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you imagine would help him?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I think - I mean, not... not just me being sorry. I think we also have to be successful and show that it's working, not just be sorry. And I mean, I can't imagine feeling... him feeling better if we're still just in the same place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel a lot of this rides on you're being able to kind of function better -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. (ph) [11:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - as a couple, but also in the world?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. (ph)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, you made that difficult right now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 11:57).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You're making it worse, a lot worse.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So are you saying that (inaudible at 12:12)?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just saying my self-esteem is for shit, okay? That's what I'm saying. (pause) I don't know. It's not like - to be honest, this isn't something that you did in reaction to us being married for seven years and you realizing it wasn't working out. This is something that you did pretty much just after we got married too. So whatever. It's not different.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: How? How? One way or another you're giving another guy head. It's the same fucking thing as far as I'm concerned. All right? Prick. I'm sorry, it's not helpful. I'm just - that's how I feel right now, okay?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because you're so angry?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there something that you can imagine Jessica saying that would make you less angry?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, I don't know if she's capable of it, so whatever. The best... the best thing is for me is just to go back into getting numb over it and not thinking about it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's not going to work for me. [13:46]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, fine. Figure it out. I'm not arguing with her anymore. (pause) It's not helpful. (pause) I woke up and my arm is sprained or something. Can't straighten it out and bend it too far. It hurts really badly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you guys made anymore progress in your individual treatment?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I had a good (inaudible at 15:19).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: 6pm. They're both in Ithaca. They're both like (inaudible at 15:35) 6:15.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 15:39).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, you already fixed it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I changed it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, you changed it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, were they both at 6?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, that's convenient. It's fun, fun treatment. I've got a good rapport with Timothy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, I got a job lined up, I think it's going to be pretty good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You do?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, the one that skin and bones (inaudible at 16:23).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So when the workshop is... when we're done working at the workshop, I'd say we have this week and maybe two or three more weeks after that. When that's done, I have another job lined up — it might now. I'm pretty sure it will.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So what kind of job? I mean, would it be (inaudible at16:57) get jobs from other people kind of thing?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 17:02) pipeline.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So does he pay you by the job or by the hour?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at17:08).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 17:14) would pay by the hour. Anyway, it's nice. It'll be more than I get paid now, so that's good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Good. (inaudible at 17:24).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Of course I will. (inaudible at17:28) is 25 an hour.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. So the point is - I'm just looking forward to SSP being done finally, have this move is done. It's taking forever. Still it's - I worked eight hours on Saturday. I worked nine hours on Monday. It's not like a big deal or something. It's just like I've been doing the work I need to do. Starting Klineman and it'll be good and it'll be a fresh start.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I've just been kind of waiting to see what happens after a couple weeks.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, why don't you -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know (inaudible at 18:31).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm just waiting to see what happens. I mean, I'm not going to try a new job (inaudible at 18:41).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We better not get back in the same situation we were in at the end of last summer. When I'm going to work and she's like getting a job during the day while I'm work and like - I don't know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm more prepared.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That time I was promised by you that I would be able to work at SSP.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And you did it. (overlapping voices) And you had... you started working at SSP in December.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: About three months late or four.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. I couldn't help that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know, but that was just my understanding about the (inaudible at19:12) that's why I haven't had any pay stubs.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 19:19).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jessica, what do you see the connection with in terms with this relationship with this other guy and how you... the two of you are functioning for... financially?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know if I have anything to do with finances.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, just the two of you - because you... you because I had mentioned about sort of, do you feel sorry -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and then you - but you had... you connected it to just sort of just how the two of you, maybe not simply financially, but just sort of getting along.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, it's all about money.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, it's just about being comfortable.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: if I... if I were a lawyer or something and had all the money in the world, you would have never cheated on me. It's just bullshit.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's not true.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, it is. [20:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here, let me... let me just... I understand you're upset. I want to hear (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Money doesn't buy you happiness, but it does buy some things like you can pay your bills. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's the connection? Do you feel that if it... do you feel that you wouldn't have cheated on Michael had you guys been sort of just have jobs and... and other - do you think that's what you feel?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 20:27).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel that that's what led you to have this relationship with this other guy?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just not really how... not really in our marriage (inaudible at 20:36).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. So like when she cheated on me the first time, this is back in whenever it was -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That was just a mistake.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That wasn't a mistake. Whatever. Let's look at the context in which it happened.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I felt really bad afterwards and I wasn't going to do that again.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, well, okay. Whatever. That's just the power of your -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm just saying -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not actually getting what you want right now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have the opportunity to ask Jessica questions. [20:58]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Here's the thing, the context in which it happened the first time we - I - we were out of work, both of us. We were financially on shaky ground. We were living with my aunt down in Long Island, okay? And it was not stable, good situation. Well, I just finished a job up in Vermont. I didn't have another job, and we were floating for a few months. And that's when she cheated on me the first time. I mean, it's this like whenever we hit financial hard times or something is this what I have to look forward to?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know I'm not getting what I want right now.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm just saying we're not living up to our potential. [21:40]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You certainly aren't.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, you were the one that has that college education.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how are they -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices) and I had to get... park my ass down to Virginia for three years for you get it? I mean, it's ridiculous.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 21:50).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I fee like we're losing the forest through the trees. I'm still not sure how this is related. (pause)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: About how our finances -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [22:06]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just don't know how it translates how like insecurity about our situation translates to you like being unfaithful. Because it's clearly a correlation there and I don't get it. Because I can sit back and be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let her answer because it's a good question. It's a great question, let her answer. [22:37]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (clears throat) I don't know. I guess it just makes me feel like I'm (inaudible at 22:50) thought we were just supposed to have a life together, have a home, maybe have kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So given your (inaudible at 23:04) -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It just seems like none of that would ever happen if you don't like just -- floating.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But you haven't answered my question.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, what was it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: How does that translate to you having an affair? I don't get that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess it means I lost faith (ph) in our marriage.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 23:23) I just lost it right there, I know like I don't get that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you... what would lead you to having an affair versus leaving Michael? If you didn't have -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - (inaudible at23:35 in your marriage what - why would -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She'll leave me, don't break my fucking heart.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess it's just - well, I'd rather it work out. I don't want to - I mean, part of it (inaudible at 23:51) don't want to admit defeat. (inaudible at 23:55).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, not what she asked either.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Huh? Why not just leave him because leaving him would be -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Leaving me as opposed to cheating on me -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Would be -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: - not dealing with the situation after you cheated on me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: - admitting defeat. Listen.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay. So why is it better than admitting defeat to go and make things ten times worse? What the fuck?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 24:33) (long pause)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, I can forget about anyone asking me questions. I answered them straight forth like listened to what was asked and answer it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel Jessica listens?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Don't give a damn, give a damn. Like ask me questions.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like what?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. Anything that you're concerned about. Put me on the spot, please.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, then I'm nagging you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, you're not nagging me, just fucking ask me something. This is the kind of place where you can do that. It won't be viewed as nagging because we're in couples therapy. I'd love for her to ask me about -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what questions do you want to answer?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know what he's talking about.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't fucking know, Dude, that's not how it works. You're concerned about me using drugs, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm like in reaction -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: All I'm thinking is that you have all the help you're going to get like there's not more help that's better than what you've gotten, so if you can't... if you can't do it with that, then are you ever going to do it? (pause)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay. Several things, first of all, people go to rehab many, many times. That's something that happened. I don't want that for myself. And part of the problem with the Suboxone treatment is it's sort of like they give you permission to use because like - first of all, the thing that I went to rehab for which was amphetamines, I'm - [26:55]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, not in my mind. I think you went in for heroin.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, then I can -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, in that case, it wasn't effective.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can I interrupt you for a minute? Because I... you're getting to the answer, I think. But I - the... the question that Jessica asked I think was a little bit more direct. And she's saying, "Do you have it within you get better?"</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure. Do you have it within you to get better? [27:16]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And remember, half the time I'm using, she's using with me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, if I want to.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, were you encouraging me too? I'm a negative influence? You can go ahead and say I'm a negative influence, I might be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I - wait a second. I'm not sure I understand the relationship.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Between when -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I want to use and she's with me, so therefore she uses. I'm the trigger, I'm the reason why we use.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No. No. No. I wasn't saying... I was simply saying - I mean, the question was -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 27:44)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - whether you think you, whether you think you'll get better, so she's asking whether -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices) yeah, of course. I'm not... I'm not going to use drugs my whole life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's going to change?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I need to get out of this job and this situation. Having a new job where I'm expected to be there and it's a normal employer and shit, you don't understand how much freedom and leeway we have. My boss can know that I'm high and he still won't fire me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So the difference is between being expected to be there (inaudible at 28:21) at Seraphin because you hadn't had rehab yet?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The Seraphin was fucked, I was fucked. I (ph) was crazy. That's the thing, I... I could not have opiates at all, right, at all.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What about your pain?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's the problem. I don't get... I can't describe - like you've seen me in this appointment like cringing and stuff. I've got this arthritis pain in two places on my body right now, and it is fucking debilitating. It hurts, it hurts badly. And I... I don't get prescribed anything for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The problem is that you're just making Jessica's case. You're making the case for her instead of -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. No, but you're making the case that it's... that there's all these things that are making you back from making good changes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is I've got the Suboxone, so I can just take that. As long as I take that every day, I'm not going to use.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But it also lets you use knowing that you won't feel so bad afterwards because you can take that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. It's a real catch-22. And I figured that out with Dr. Patton who has canceled appointments with me for two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you should get someone else. See this is the thing, and both of you guys tend to - and Jessica I really don't think that your marriage not being good is a good enough reason.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know. [29:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really not. I understand that you're trying to - but that's still I think both of you really struggle.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, there isn't really a good enough reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but there's something that you need to find. Maybe both of you really struggle with taking responsibility for your decisions. It doesn't mean - we all make decisions we're not proud of. We're human and we make - I'm not... and again, so I'm not saying these things to instill shame or guilt in you. We all make decisions we wish we hadn't. It's not about that, but it's about taking responsibility so Jessica you say our... our relationship is bad -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The thing is when somebody asks me over and over, "Why did you do this?" So I should just to continue not to answer (inaudible at 30:22).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that's (phone rings) I'm sorry about that. I forgot the stupid ringer. Well, but that's - so there's a dynamic there. So I do think that if you were able to engage Michael more in saying that more responsibility for the decision, I have a feeling he would back off more. And if he doesn't we can talk about that, that can be an issue. And Michael, I hear a lot of times, when it comes to what are you going to do you, Michael, "Well, maybe the new job will help or maybe" - enough. I mean, that's not going to be good enough. That's not - finding external solutions is not going to be good enough. It's just not.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has to come within you. I could never show up to my job. I have - no one is my boss. I'm like, "Well, I can never show up." It has to come within me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know you could have a boss telling you to come to work, but that still doesn't mean you're going to go. I mean, there's a lot of reasons - and I'm not... this is again, not to minimize all that you're up against. Not the least of which is the debilitating chronic illness. So I get it, this is not to say that you have your reasons for being... having the difficulties that you do. But in a sense, that makes it all the more important that you're able to kind of be able to surpass that at times. They don't have days off because you're in too much pain I imagine is another (inaudible at 31:37) condition. But I'm sure more focusing not on your circumstances, but your orientation to that. And I do think that's really important for both of you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me know your thoughts, but we're going to need to stop because I don't... I don't want to cut you -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So we're going to need to stop. I was... my... my day is a little bit different on Monday because of Patriot's Day, so I could move a couple things around. I'm wondering for... just next Monday if you could come in at 10:30 rather than 10:10?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: is there anyway we could do an afternoon thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have anything that Monday.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean, not... not (inaudible at 32:13)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: 10:30 would be fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: so we can - so I will look at it if you want, the only thing -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: 10:30 is not that early in the morning.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know we just tell ourselves it's still at 10:10.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: However it works. So 10:30. Also, you owe me for a couple sessions.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've given you statements.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I've gotten the statement. I (inaudible at 32:34) stepfather, I haven't sent it to him yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. If you could pay me next time and make a payment (inaudible at 32:38).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to send it to him but you have the check?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I can do that. I'll do that. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, please, do because that's from -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - three or four weeks ago.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I know it's one of my -</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: do you need it to be itemized, for that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did, I gave an itemized bill.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, you did?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'll make sure -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In fact I gave an itemized bill for all of the sessions.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: All right. I'll be sure and bring it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if you could, please, I'd really -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. But I really would appreciate that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, he can charge the other card for one of them or however many.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's... it's up to you, I mean, it you'd rather pay a check next... this time with you, that's fine. But if you could, please -</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is so difficult just give him his credit card number, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. If you could, please, give it to Karen, I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I'll you guys next Monday, 10:30.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (inaudible at 33:31)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) The first thing I was thinking was, uh, of something that's been on my mind, really ever since FSO was born.  And that is that well, first I was thinking about trying to find somebody.  But I think underneath that was sort of a mixed feeling of uh, well, mixed feeling on many counts.  Because for one, I didn't want to find somebody in a way, because I didn't want to, to feel I, I wanted to feel I was absolutely necessary to her, that she couldn't get along without me.  And yet, I wanted to find somebody, because I think I — in feeling I was absolutely necessary to her I was resenting her, during the time when I didn't leave her with anyone.</p>

<p>And, and then I had a, I think a feeling of, well, a mixed feeling about coming back.  And in one way I think I was feeling I didn't want to come back.  In another way I did.  And I don't know why on either account.  But I think, I was thinking, uhm, one time that I kept calling you, I think, probably, I mean, prob—, I was thinking I should let you know what I'm doing.  But I think I kept calling too, because I wanted to make it impossible for me not to handle things so I could come back.  I guess that was — if I, if I sort of was committed, then I was — I think I felt I'd make more of an attempt than if I weren't committed. </p>

<p>And there have been, I don't know, there have been lots of times when (Sigh) I haven't really known what was on my mind, except I was thinking if I were coming here I'd probably work out was on my mind and what was disturbing me.  Because I know there were lots of times during the time I didn't come when I was feeling disturbed.  And then I was, then I was just thinking, well here I am and none of these things were coming to my mind.</p>

<p>And then I, then I immediately thought of something that, I don't know, it's sort of hard to explain it, or, but I began to do it right here.  Not think about it, but I was actu—, actually doing it.  Uhm, where I see FSO doing something and it might ev—, it might be just stretching or a way she breathes, or something like that.  And then I'll find later on, either I want to imitate it, or else I'm breathing in such a way that it makes me think of the way she does.  And then I almost feel as if I know exactly h—, the sensation she has when she does the same thing.  And, I can't remember now what it was I was just doing, what I was imagining when I first thought of that here.  But, I don't know, it's almost as if I become her.  (Pause, Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>And then I was just thinking about, uhm, I was, I don't know, the way I fluctuate on enjoying her or well, sometime resenting her I think.  Or feeling angry at her or just, many times, it's not feeling either of those things.  At least not, I'm not admitting it.  But I'm just sort of trying to fit into a certain pattern and I don't know, it's almost as if well, I, I, mean, I guess it's part of this desire on my part to control my life, to be able to plan it out.  And she doesn't always fall into a plan. </p>

<p>And I was finding, th_ then I was just thinking about how at first when we'd go out anywhere and take FSO with us, or even just planning on when I'd leave her — we've left her a few times, uhm, or I have, I mean, during the day.  And it just always seemed to me  overwhelming to plan feedings and things like that, so I could leave her.  (Sniff)  When it really isn't that hard.  But I always realize afterwards it's not so hard.  But at the time it seemed impossible. </p>

<p>I don't know, it just seems like a lot of my i—, the times that I, I just feel as if I have all the time in the world and I can be relaxed and just enjoy her, are so few compared to the times when I'm actually taking care of her.  When she's not sleeping and I'm, I, I'm sort of thinking now, how will this timing fit into what I want to do next, and that kind of thing.  Because then, then I think of something that, I don't know ex—, what aspect of this is bothering me, but uhm, last Thursday I went in to see my doctor and I had an IUD put in. </p>

<p>And I don't know, when he was — he'd talked to me about what method of contraception I'd want to use in the hospital.  And he'd told me about that, and it seemed like the best thing to do, because I'm breast feeding.  So I, I didn't really want to use the pills, because he couldn't guarantee it wouldn't affect the breast feeding at all.  And, I don't know, this seems like if it works, a very good way, anyway.  And I didn't think much of it.  At least I didn't think I was thinking much about it, until right before I was going in to see him.  And then I got, I don't know, I was having dreams and I can't remember them now, but I know I was just feeling quite agitated.  And (Sniff) when I got in there, I just felt very afraid of it.  He was putting it in, and afterwards I had a, I don't know, I couldn't f—, I mean I really couldn't feel anything, but I was going around as if something horrible was about to happen to me. </p>

<p>And I don't know whether it was that I was concentrating other feelings on the IUD, or if that, if that in itself was bothering me.  Well, I think I must have been concentrating feelings on it, because uhm, we hadn't had intercourse and — MSCZ and I — and it was sort of like that was the end of my not having to worry about having intercourse.  And I didn't really want to even think about it.  I think maybe I thought about the IUD instead.</p>

<p>And then when we did have intercourse, I, I kept saying, MSCZ, well, let's put it off, until he finally wouldn't let me do that anymore.  And, and I found it, I don't know, it was almost as if I'd never had intercourse before.  And I don't, I don't just mean in the feeling.  I couldn't relax and it didn't feel that comfortable, maybe probably because the stitching and all has to sort of, the area that was stitched up has to sort of loosen up again or something.  But uhm, it was more just, I don't know, it ah, reminded me almost of our wedding night when w_ when I first had intercourse with MSCZ.  (Sniff) </p>

<p>And well, at least anyway this time, I just started crying.  And it wasn't that something was hurting me so much I had to cry, or anything.  I just, I didn't, I couldn't understand why I was crying.  Except somehow I felt as if something were being taken away from me, or I'd lost something.  And he was kind of joking about I'd lost my second virginity, which maybe, i—, i—, i—, there's something, I don't think that's it, exactly.  But — (Pause)</p>

<p>(Sniff) And I'm not sure this is part of what I was thinking I was losing, or if it were just another thing I was aware of.  But (Sigh) I don't know, it's almost as if my feeling about myself was, or my image was very much I am a mother, I have a baby, and I don't know, M_M_ MSCZ just sort of there as the baby's father.  And, and having intercourse with him, it's the one thing where I can't, I can't sort of go around with that image.  I have to have another idea of myself.  And it's almost b_ beyond that, that I can't, in, in having intercourse with him, be aware of FSO, right then.  Because I have to be totally aware of MSCZ, and, or I am, that's what happens.  And (Sigh) I don't know if it's so much that I want just to think of myself as a mother as — well, I mean I want to, because I don't want something else, I think.  But I don't think, I don't think that's what I want, if I, if I just think th—, what I want to be is, I don't know, it sounds kind of confusing.  But — (Sigh)</p>

<p>And then, and then this bothered me.  I mean it a—, it was very pleasant, but it disturbed me in the way I reacted afterwards, because I had to f—, I don't remember how soon afterwards I had to feed her, but the next feeding I felt it was a more, I felt a more satisfying feeling from breast feeding her than — I don't know, it seemed, a grea—, to be a greater satisfaction than often.  And, and I had a feeling it was directly connected with the fact that I'd had intercourse with MSCZ. </p>

<p>And that really disturbed me, because I don't think it was that — I mean, if I'd had a satisfying time with MSCZ, it wouldn't have bothered me.  But the fact that it hadn't been a satisfying time, I mean it hadn't — it was a funny kind of upsetting time, because I had assumed the first time wouldn't be easy.  And so I wasn't, I wasn't upset that it had been bad in itself.  I just wh_ what had upset me was the way I reacted and I didn't, I mean th—, what had, what, whatever was going on when, when we were having intercourse.  And uhm,  I don't know, I don't, I just — maybe I'm not really, somehow I don't feel I'm really saying things the way they are, so it's making me wonder is it confusing to me because I'm really not saying what, what is true, or what. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Did you feel that by not coming back here, that you could avoid these conflicts, and the way uh, mixed feelings you have?  Because you said that you had had the mixed feelings about returning.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Interrupts) Yeah, I guess in a way I did, but in another way I knew I couldn't.  Because, well (Sigh), in the first few weeks when I was home, I suppose that's hard time anyway for anybody, but there were some times when I didn't know what was disturbing me.  But I, I knew something was.  And the only way to really get at it was to come back here.   And so, in, in a way I was wanting very much to come back.  But I suppose in another way, I kept, I was thinking that well, I mean, I'd, I'd, I don't know if I would even think why I had the feeling of maybe not wanting to come back.  It's just that it was there. </p>

<p>And, I was just thinking in the last week or two, things are easier as far as taking care of FSO, partly because I'm more accustomed to it and more at ease, and I've done more things with her.  So I know, I mean, just everything's easier.  Uhm, so that, that wasn't a strain as much.  And I, I don't know, it's just as if I could kind of push, it was getting so I could push all these things back and only be temporarily concerned or bothered or upset.  And then I could somehow push it away.</p>

<p>And then I think I was thinking of coming back here as upsetting all that, which it obviously would if it brings it out again.  But, but I had a, well, when I had, when I had seen the doctor and then uh, I don't think we had intercourse for ab—, maybe another 2 days or something, and both those times, I had the feeling that whatever was bothering me or whatever was on my mind, I would never really handle, even if I tried to face it or handle it, I really couldn't without coming back here.  And so I wanted to for both, during the stress time of both those times,  But then once I got over it, I sort of think, I think, that coming back would upset it. </p>

<p>Because the other thing that, well, I was thinking it today, I guess.  Because I was thinking that it, well, here's the first day finally and, and all the time when I had been thinking about coming back before, I had been thinking how is — I just can't imagine, especially during the first few weeks when her pattern of eating was really kind of crazy.  And I'd keep thinking that I just won't be able to manage it.  How can I get away for 2 hours, which means I've had to feed her starting about maybe, well at that point I had, I took an hour to feed her, about.  And so I, I was thinking I'd have to start an hour ahead.  And she gets hungry by 2, 2 and a half hours after the last feeding in the afternoon.  I was just thinking, I can't do it.  And s—, then I was thinking today, well here is the day, and so I'm going to have to do it, however it works.  And anyway, she's gotten a little bit easier and goes longer periods.  But, I don't know, still I w—, it sort of seemed like how can I go 5 days a week and manage it. </p>

<p>And yet, the, the only thing that's really hard about it, if, if I — well, when I think of it right now, it seems to me the only thing that is really hard, oth_oth_ other than my emotional feelings about coming and, and finding it hard, is being able to arrange for a sitter if there's any problem.  And if that's all set, then I can't, right now I'm thinking I can't see wh—, what I think the problem is.  So it must be just I don't want to face things and, so then I think it's too hard. (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, when I, a_ after I said that, then I thought (Sigh), I don't know, I was thinking, but in a way I do want to face things, because I don't want to keep feeling well, for one thing, as I did when MSCZ and I were having intercourse.  And (Sigh) also, uh, it just occurs to me now, I don't want to keep feeling the way I do toward FSO of uhm, I don't know, fluctuating so.  I mean, it's more extreme than just a parent sometimes feeling tired and frazzled or something.  And, and wishing the child would not demand so much.  B_ because I, I think probably she's been a fairly easy baby, but yet I don't think always that's my attitude.  Except when I hear what other people have been through, it sounds like she really is a very easy baby.</p>

<p>And then I, and then it made me think of uhm — and now I don't, just seconds later I don't quite see the comparison by being — I thought of when she was born.  And I, I guess I was comparing it and thinking that what I don't want to face sometimes is hard work that's part of coming here.  The hard work of getting at the things that I'm trying to hide from myself, too. </p>

<p>But anyway, I, I was thinking of when I was in labor, uhm, it actually, well it was, one time I was comparing it to, instead of running a mile, running a uhm, 40-yard dash, or something like that, that uhm, they had to speed up my contractions so they induced it.  And everything went extremely quickly.  So in one way, it was a very nice labor because it was so fast and it was over very quickly.  But on the other hand, it was extremely hard work and tiring while it was going on.  And there was, there were no breaks in between.  It didn't go the way we had been told in class, because it was so fast. </p>

<p>And yet, I don't know, I felt ,and I still f—, when I think of that now, I feel I could handle it again.  And I was feeling I could handle it then.  And I didn't want to take anything when the doctor asked me if I wanted anything.  Because I didn't feel any need of it.  But, it was after she was born, I m—, I, well, there was a quite a long period when I couldn't push, and, and I wanted to extremely badly, and I found that hard.  But I, that sort of is faded in the, my memory, and I hardly remember it now. </p>

<p>But the part I found really bad, and I hadn't anticipated, it was after she was born, and just everything they did to me after she was born.  And I don't, I don't know, and then it just occurred to me, I wondered if it had anything to do with the fact, then I was being stitched up.  And since I hadn't had anything, there was no—, I had no_ nothing to help me relax.  And in the course we had had, had given us nothing to work with to handle that period, which I don't know, I just found very hard. </p>

<p>And so I found it very upsetting, I guess, to be, to be stitched up.  I, I'm not sure it really hurt all that much.  I thought it did at the time, but I'm not sure now it did.  And they knead your stomach a lot, and I found that very painful and yet now I think well, it couldn't have been all that bad.  And then I, I, from the timing I know I was, uhm, they put me back in the room I'd been in labor in, to just check up on my recovery for awhile.  And I know it was a very short time, but it seemed like ages, and I seem—, I felt as if I were in horrible pain and everything, then.  And, I don't know, it a—, really surprised me that I reacted that way. </p>

<p>And then well I — it must be connected with the fact, then she was well, I'd, I'd think I'd, I never, I never could connect her with uhm, with being pregnant really, in a way.  It was almost as if I knew there was something alive in me when I was pregnant.  But it was almost as if that was something else entirely than FSO, who was there after she was born. </p>

<p>And, but, uhm, I don't, I don't know why I got so upset, as if I were concentrating then just on myself.  But I think in, when I was in labor I was concentrating on myself too, the feelings I had.  But yet, I had something specific to do.  And because it, well I was just thinking again of when I had the IUD put in, it was bothering me very much that there was this foreign thing in me.  Now I don't really think about it much.  Well sometimes I still do though, and th_ there's no feeling, there's uhm, but I, I just keep being afraid, I guess, that there's something that's going to happen to me, that there's going to be something wrong. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I c—, I think of this first, and I don't know if it's because somebody had once said there have been cases where people develop a cancer from it, or at least they don't know whether that's exactly why.  But that was a fear I had, and — but that, I don't think that's really my personal feeling about it.  (Sigh) Well, the other feeling I had, uhm, when I finally faced the fact that I just had to not put off having intercourse with MSCZ anymore, because it was ridiculous, uhm, was that I was different, because I'd been stitched up.  And actually, well, it took me a long ti—, I, I was very afraid to touch myself there at all.  I found it very hard after I went to the bathroom, to wipe myself, or uhm, to bathe myself, or anything.  I just didn't want to touch myself, and I, I suppose that came partly that at first it was sore, because of the stitches. </p>

<p>But I kept on feeling very m—, I mean, I, I think I still do feel squeamish.  And then I began, when finally I was healed and there was no problem, I think I was curious to know, because I really felt I must be different.  And the feeling I had, I think, was I had no vagina. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You say you'd been sewed up, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, it was almost like, it wasn't — I mean, I knew I'd been sewed up, but it was almost as if the sewing up was just sort of, well, like cutting a buttonhole and finishing the buttonhole.  The sewing up was the finishing part that i—, i—, as if he had just cut my vagina out when she was born, or after she was born, right after.  Although I don't, I don't remember, of course I don't know if I'd know, because there was so much that you think and feel at that time.  But I don't know whether that's the beginning of when I felt that way, or not.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or, if I had a vagina, then it was as if it had moved and it was in a different (Sniff) — I don't know, somehow a different, different shape, and — but I think the feeling was if I still had one, it was less than what I had before. </p>

<p>And MSCZ kept thinking that, and I kept denying this, I don't know whether it's uh, uhm, sort of emptying the Nile, but at one point I asked him if it felt any different to him.  Because I really had this feeling that somehow I'm different.  And he said no.  And he, he kept thinking I was worried that I couldn't satisfy him.  And that, somehow I would lose a certain aspect of my femininity if I couldn't.  And I suppose that's uh, part of it. </p>

<p>But I didn't feel as if that was what really concerned me.  Somehow, what concerned me had nothing to do with him.  I assumed if he, if we had intercourse he could be satisfied.  But yet on the other hand, I was feeling I didn't have a vagina.  And, and, seems kind of crazy, because how could I, if I didn't have one.  (Sigh, Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Because that's another thing that I, I mean it must have been on my mind.  Because I know that, I mean when she, right after she was born, because uh, well, I was aware when he cut, but I did—, it didn't really bother me.  I, I suppose partly because it was so fast, and at that point anyway, a_ all I was thinking about was the sensations of wanting to push, and they kept telling me I had to wait.  And uhm, I just didn't — they were trying to arrange the mirror and i—, and actually, they never were able to, because things were happening too fast.  But I know I, my one thought was, when I knew he was about to perform the episiotomy, that I didn't want to see it.  If they did get the mirror arranged, I certainly wanted to be not looking at the mirror at that time. </p>

<p>And uh, but then when he started sewing me up, and I had, I knew what I'd had and I don't know if I'd seen her yet, or not.  But anyway, I wasn't going to s—, uh, I think they were doing th—, whatever they do to babies when they're born.  So I couldn't see her right then.  And I immediately I think, asked him something — I can't remember my question exactly now — but it was something to with would what he was doing now, sewing me up, have any, be affected at all by my first operation, when I'd had to be sewed up.  And I don't know, I gu—, maybe, or maybe I was wondering if he could tell where it was.  Or anyway, the time when I'd fallen on the stick and had be to sewed up, came to my mind right then.</p>

<p>And it's almost as if I, I, I think it's almost as if I were, just from the way I remember my question; I think of this as sort of a progressive thing, that whatever happened to my, in my vagina then, was just a little bit making it not right, or bad, or abnormal, or something.  And then, this time it would be a little bit more.  And — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Do you remember shortly before we interrupted, before you went into labor, you had among other things thought about an operation your mother had after MLWZ was born?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   For some reason that occurs to me now.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because that, that's kind of funny, actually.  (Chuckle) Because my mother came down after FSO was born, to uhm, help me in my first week home.  And I'd been, I w—, that was on my mind then too, because I was wondering just what had happened.  Why had she had a hysterectomy then, or something? And it turned out that that operation was a year after he was born.  And that particular operation, which I was recalling, was an operation for hemorrhoids, not a hysterectomy.  Although, and so then I was thinking MSCZ and I were laughing about it because, uhm, at first I was wondering, well did she ever have a hysterectomy.  And then later on, uhm, she said something and, and, and said, "When I had my hyster—."  Oh, I know, we were talking about appendix and appendicitis and she said, "Well, when I had my hysterectomy, they took my appendix out, too."  So I—, now I don't even know when that was.  But yet that's how I thought of it.  and it was a year after MLWZ, not right after.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I think, uh, I know I'm sort of dodging some of the connections in, in thinking of that operation.  And then my feeling about s—, my vagina being cut away slowly, or taken away completely.  But uhm, I was just thinking that the—, I was thinking the reason I must have assumed that's when she had the hysterectomy, whenever I knew she had had one, the thought of it was that I was always feeling that they were just having children until they had a boy.  And once they'd had a boy, my mother didn't mind having an operation so she couldn't have any more.  And that she would have had this at anytime, after she'd had a boy.  That was my feeling. </p>

<p>I know, because that makes me wonder too, of how much I'm not admitting my feelings about the fact that FSO was a girl.  And uhm, all the time I was pregnant, well, we referred to the fetus as 'he', because I guess you do if you don't want to refer to it as 'it'.  And that I think made it another thing that made it very hard to connect her with my being pregnant, among all the things that probably make it hard.  And wh_ when she was born, somebody said it was a girl.  And I had, my immediate feeling was, oh, who are they talking about, who else is in the room having a baby?  Because I, I don't know, I just, it didn't connect with me at all in my mind.  And I think I was disappointed, but then I immediately tried not to admit I was disappointed.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I guess what right now, what I was thinking about, the fact that I connected this operation my mother had that particular time, which is the only one I've recalled, and thought of it as a hysterectomy when it was a hemorrhoid operation, it made me think of the fact, I've been sort of suspicious, and MSCZ sort of joked me about this, too.  That uhm, I've well, recently, I, I do have hemorrhoids now.  I don't know when I got them or how long I've had them.  But uhm, and I've had problems with them; I still am.  And I, I don't know how much you can kind of keep them going.  But again, it's almost like it's another thing to concentrate on so I don't have to concentrate on something else. </p>

<p>Because uhm, well they got really bad and, and I got a prescription from my doctor, which took care of them.  And then they started up again.  And I just wonder if they really would have started up again, except that maybe I want them to for some reason.  But in the hospital, I kept asking if I had any, and they — because I felt as if I had them, but I'd never had them before, so I didn't know.  And the nurses kept, or whoever, I don't even, I think I even asked my doctor one time.  And anyway, a_ anybody I asked, said no.  And so for awhile when I was home, things weren't very bad.  I mean, I wasn't that comfortable, but they weren't that bad.  And, and yet I kept thinking about it, wondering if I got them.  So it's almost as if I wanted to have them.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Because I, I, again I think of uhm, you pointing out that I was thinking of this operation of my mother's before, and then these feelings I've had about myself after FSO's birth.  And it makes me think again of something I've been aware of off and on, ever since she's been born.  How, I don't know, at times I just feel she's so unreal, in a way. And it's not, I mean, I suppose it takes a while to really feel the reality of, of a new baby.  But, uhm, this is unreal in another way.  And it, it's almost as if I can't be aware of anything except for myself.  And so I can't be aware of her.  And therefore, she's unreal, except she's there and I'm feeding her and I'm changing her, and so forth.  But in some ways, she's unreal to me.  And, and then, and then, the whole thing of being pregnant and having a baby seems unreal, and the whole possibility of it ever happening again seems unreal. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Uh, this Friday we're going to be closed again.  So I have to cancel.  And our time's up.</p>

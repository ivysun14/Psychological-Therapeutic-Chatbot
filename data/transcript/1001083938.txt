<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how have things been going for you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, kind of stable, kind of a little bit lately. I think with trying to get [NAME OTHER] out of my life and trying to get my own life in order.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is [NAME OTHER] finally taking the hint?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I don’t, you know, I’m not sure. I thought he, in my mind he does but I don’t think he doesn’t because I think he has and actually was supposed to meet me. He may be out there when I get out today, I don’t know. But in my mind I’ve gone on and now I’m struggling to try to find something. I’ve determined that I want a man in my life and I, but definitely don’t want that man. My brother got out of jail and he came over the day after he got out of jail with his wife and we had dinner and we had a really nice visit. It was the day before my birthday and he can help me, we bought a bunch of furniture to put together. He can help me with that. We got talking about God and about beings and I don’t know if any of us care to believe in God any more but there’s like an energy source you know, and we talked about putting out positive energies out there, you know. I’m trying to work on me now and I’ve gone back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and to work out and take some classes. That’s gotten to be important for me, to keep a schedule of some kind. I still do, you know, I got my house together and it’s like part of me doesn’t want to stay there. You know it’s like I don’t wanna unpack anything because I don’t know if I wanna stay there. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you know what about it that would make you feel better?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I feel to far away from where I used to be.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know I’m not real comfortable and it’s, because of the way my house is set up it’s a split ranch and the bedroom’s in the front and my bedroom’s right on the people’s driveway right here and I can hear everything that goes on over there in their driveway because you’re close, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You’re pretty close. They had been on the other side, I should probably put my bed on the other side. They didn’t have it set up that way but the jets flying over the head are roaring, you know it’s loud and I don’t know, it’s so close to the lake and I worry about sinus problems. I got a lot of sinus things going on and in fact I’m going to another specialist because I’m still getting a lot of pressure in the eye and the ear, nose throat. It’s not my sinus. It’s not my nose. And now they are sending me to some other [INAUDIBLE] specialist or some damn thing, so I don’t know what’s going on there, but I’m not sure. You know I just, I’m just thinking I’m just gonna look, thinking of really looking for another place. You know I really do like the house but I sure don’t like the location. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that location too live</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. You know and I walk. I walk around and it’s, it’s really a, [DEIDENTIFIED] is pretty but small and it’s old, you know, and I don’t know. It’s so far away from everything I’m so used to, and you know. I get, go and see my sister and that I do often. Right now she’s in a nursing home because she had lung surgery biopsy to find out what’s going on and she’s at a nursing home which is closer to me but I still have to run out and take care of her fish and her apartment and get her this and get her that and I’m pretty much having a very un-fulfilling life right now. There’s no, I have to work on setting up the positive energy here and finding some positive people in my life and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And finding some fun in your life.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, fun. Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because everything you’re doing is task orientated</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah. You know and you know [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] has been task orientated and that I used to like, but </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he was having rough times</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, such a poor thing, but he still manages, I tell you that dog will walk with me until he drops dead. Honest to God he will. I mean he’s excited about walking and walking and yeah, it’s, I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He’s probably-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Flashbacks, you know, are vivid. I mean so vivid I mean like I’m right there. So vivid and clear, and crystal clear. I don’t know what’s going on with that either.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s pretty new for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Pretty much under control.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, sleep has been very bad at times. Ambien, like I said Ambien can work very good for a couple of days and then it won’t work for me any more.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you’re still alternating CR to regular? Or?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I usually take one of each.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> One of each still.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What time of day are you taking the Valium?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I take it at night time because if I take it during the day I probably would fall asleep and I wouldn’t get anything done.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Ha ha, it doesn’t [INAUDIBLE], I have to drive during the day</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But even with the Valium, the Valium, the Equetro and the Ambien you’re still not sleeping real well.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I was going to ask you about that thing, it’s called Roz- or something or other.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Rozerem? I haven’t had real-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think you tried me on that actually before.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Success with it. The studies that were done were on people who don’t have any other major psychiatric illness. All they have is insomnia. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I don’t know. I just haven’t been real impressed with the outcome of it. Have you tried Lunesta before?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. You said that’s terrible, nasty taste in your mouth.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It can be but why don’t I give you some samples of it and, what I finally did find out is that you can use apple juice, swish that around in your mouth and brush your teeth like three times a day. If you’re on it for like a couple days it usually goes away.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So when I first started giving it out people were complaining about it but when I explained to them that if you do stay on it it’ll fade away.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And it does work? You’ve found experience it works better than Ambien in these people that tried it, or?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, basically what people often have to do is alternate from one to the next. So, because eventually the Ambien wears off…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then you’re, you go over to another one.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well anything that’s not a narcotic is pretty much gonna give you that. You know, wear off-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s going to wear off eventually.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because it’s really not me to use it every night probably.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Basically not, but it’s done because we don’t have any other options.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I mean it can be but it doesn’t work so why bother. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right. So I’ll give you-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t use it every night because it doesn’t work so why bother.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I’ll just give you samples of the Lunesta then, enough to last you through at least a month. They’re three milligrams. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You take one at bed time.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, the Ambien are ten, aren’t they?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah the Ambien are ten but they’re totally different drugs. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So we’ve got that down. When was the? Let’s see here, lab tests. That one Creatinine that we did, it was quite awhile ago. It was elevated a little bit, did your family doctor repeat that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, in, probably not.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Probably wouldn’t hurt to just get that at some point.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know if it’s going to screw up my liver or whatever or-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well that was back I think when you were on Lithium. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don’t even bother taking any you know, for the diabetes. You know, none of that ever comes back at all since the medication, all that medication.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] been the same.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So I think we ought to check just a blood count as long as you’re on Equetro. It wouldn’t hurt to get an Equetro blood levels to know where you’re at. Now, this will check your kidney test. I’m sure that’s gone back down to normal with everything else that normalized but-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I’m working on putting all this positive energy up here and my brother thinks it can work. You know he needs money, he can’t, he doesn’t have a job now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s trying to find energy out there for money and I’m talking to him and my sister out there in [DEIDENTIFIED], we’re pretty close. The three of us are kind of close and we’re all kind of thinking the same kind of thing with the energy and if it can work for money than why can’t it work for me to get positive in my life and somebody in my life, I’m definitely not narrowing it down, it just you know, I would like a man just for, and I’m not talking about marriage or anything but just to have some of the holding hands and the things that go along with it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And somebody to make me feel special again because I certainly don’t feel very special in any other relationships that I’ve been having you know with [NAME OTHER] and my sister, they’re all negative people. They’re self absorbed. You know, they argue yip yip yip [INAUDIBLE] and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s where you really need to shoot higher.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I need something back here I need um </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You don’t need a project. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You really don’t.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. No, I need fun you know, and I, that’s why this [DEIDENTIFIED]’s gonna become important to me because if I keep going to the same classes I’ll meet people, all the same people will see me over and over again and I’ll see the same people all over again and you know, there’s already been, you know, if you talk to people a little bit and hi, how are you doing. You see them again and again or whatever. I just don’t wanna anticipate any person coming around and expecting [NAME OTHER] because there is no [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And my brother did have somebody he wanted to set me up with but I don’t know that I wanna be set up by my brother.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Who would he know?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s never been married before. To me that’s a, he’s my age. To me that’s a warning thing going off.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Also, where did he meet him would be another huge question I would ask.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I can’t remember. I think he’s in construction. I don’t know. I’d have to get that and find out more about this guy. Apparently never had time to get a relationship going but I don’t know, I heard if they’re not married by like forty watch out because there’s a good reason why they’re not.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I would agree and I think you need to look for is whether there’s give and take. If you’re doing all the giving you’ve gotta-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m so tired of giving, giving, giving, and getting nothing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s also no good if you’re doing all the taking. Occasionally you’ll find some guys that could be, allow you to just dig, dig, dig, dig, expecting that people fail</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah. Somebody-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You also have to be able to compromise with each other.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Somebody who wants to do stuff, somebody who wants to have fun, somebody who likes to travel, somebody who likes to go to a movie. I actually took myself to a movie on my birthday. I went to see The Departed. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How was it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s an excellent movie. Excellent plot and everything but you’ve gotta get past all the f’in words. Every other word is f this, f that. Oh my God. I mean it was bloody and gory because they shoot people in the head and the you know, mobs. That didn’t bother me like the f’in did. I really hate that word. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well the words or the meaning.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, and it was just constantly. You know, do they really talk like that down in the mob, in the ghetto or wherever they were?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you bet. You bet.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh God.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They talk like that in my old neighborhood. Of course I was raised in a mob neighborhood.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh well, I guess then. I guess I’m just not used to hearing that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Exactly.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Whoa. But excellent, excellent plot. Really interesting. Yeah, I went and worked out for a couple hours, took myself to a movie and got home like eleven thirty at night. So it, it was fun.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. I think that is the first thing, just go have fun by yourself. If you can have fun by yourself chance are then you can have fun with someone else. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I do have fun when I work out too, I really enjoy those classes. You know they have what they call power flex and they’re weight lifting and I do Yoga sometimes and sometimes there’s aerobic. So, I do different things. They use different muscles. Oh my God am I sore.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I bet.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve been shoveling my keister off. All this snow.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah, out there was horrible.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve done all the shoveling. Dumb ass was supposed to come and help me and he never showed up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think you have to be pretty careful about doing that so you don’t hurt yourself.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well yeah I did. I hurt my back a little bit. I already got a bad back but I got one of those special shovels, have you seen those?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They’re bent really weird.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Which for me it does help.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but if it is too heavy. You’re better off paying-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, you know what else I hadn’t realized how heavy it was I would have paid him, but I didn’t have any idea when I started how heavy it was or how deep it was and I have a stupid, my driveway is right out in the front and it just blows right across and drifts like crazy. I happen to have one of those open because mine is a, I am the only one in the whole block that has an attached garage. Everybody else’s garage is way in the back and their houses are even and my driveway is way out in front. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, do you have a snow plow come and plow all the snow in front?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know what I did? I threw the damn snow right back out on the road. I don’t have anywhere to go with it and I can’t lift all that snow. I threw it right back out. I don’t know if that’s illegal.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I don’t know either.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean there was a cop that came down the corner while I was doing it and he turned around I thought oh here we go. I’m gonna need to stop and watch for a few [INAUDIBLE] but he turned around and kept on going so if it’s illegal he had some other call or, it’s just too dang heavy. I moved it right out back onto the street. Because you know I have a two car garage and I have a very wide driveway…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That is a wide. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So I think from now on I’m going to just shovel half of it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or find someone that can plow it. You can pay something like twenty five bucks to have them plow it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean look at the cost of that compared to the cost of a medical bill.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There’s no question as to which one is going happen</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We haven’t had snow like this in how many years and it’s a welcome to [DEIDENTIFIED] for me I guess. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right and…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Welcome to your own house and look what you have to look forward to for the rest of your life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, a couple times in the next half years. That doesn’t happen that often.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> This is the worst you’ve had?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In ten years. It happen to be the year, well like I said, welcome to [DEIDENTIFIED]. Welcome to your own home. Well it takes me about an hour you know and I think about it and it’s not too bad. It’s good exercise I guess if you do it right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now you have your gastric bypass and I don’t know what your bone mineral looks like. Have you had a?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Bone density?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Bone density.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I did have-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> From osteoporosis.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I’ve got like a problem with one hip already.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah I, something you, take it from experience, you should not be doing this.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I tried to pull some car out of the ditch with a bunch of other guys, turned out to be a woman from our church and crushed my L1 vertebrae. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, four weeks ago. Not a happy camper about it. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well what do you have to do about that?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wait another three weeks so the pain will die down. There won’t be any surgery, it shattered the top of it, but stayed all in one spot so I immediately stopped pushing when I felt it. So it’s just, right now it’s more of a nuisance but I can’t lift anything. I don’t dare run, I don’t dare do any significant exercise for at least another three or four weeks. Meanwhile I’m reminding myself yeah I depleted my bone calcium with the gastric banding and I’ve got to keep on taking calcium. It’s so easy to forget that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve been taking calcium for many, many years though.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I still have the weakening of my hip problem.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, weak hips, you shouldn’t be trying to lift that heavy…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I wonder if that’s why my stomach is always sore from exercise too, because of the stomach stapling, I never thought of that. Because that’s sore for days, after I do all of those, stomach you know, abs.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It hurts to cough and it hurts. That’s probably what it’s from and maybe the shoveling. Yeah, okay, I’ll have to, I didn’t think of that you know. I didn’t think about that at all.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I didn’t either, my brother who had his gastric bypass said, idiot, you’re a doctor, you should know this stuff. But it’s drawn out of a powdered calcium about a month ago and I hadn’t purchased anymore.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well you take a powdered thing, I just take a pill.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah mine since they tightened the band, so we did the pills too.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh. Are you going to need that tight, does it stay that tight now, or you going to loosen it a bit? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m going to loosen it. The biggest [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You wanted to lose more, you want to disappear, huh?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, they said they wanted me to drop further, which is fine, yeah. But I have to, any pill that’s a certain shape or size I have to grind it up or cut it up or come up with a liquid or powder version.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Well, luckily they got that, I’ve been doing the protein too and my hair is getting much better now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. From the protein.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Got more hair. Not losing it all anymore I think.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m eating 200 grams of protein a day.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah when I went to see that dietician, yeah, ninety, she wanted me to be on ninety. And I’m also taking those two, vitamins, that you suggested, so it has been helping.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Definitely am not losing my hair.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that gets kind of scary when it starts falling out like that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. It was really getting bad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your overall mood done in terms of big mood swings?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Big mood swings, um, there has been a couple of dramatic drops in mood. It doesn’t last long though.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Less than a day or?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’d say less than a day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So you’re getting anything the last like three or four days on end that are calming. Try to keep your sleep cycle as stable as possible.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s tough to do, to keep that sleep cycle stable.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because if you don’t, it throws off your biological rhythm and that’s when you’re gonna have those times where your mood gets down so I just came back from a conference in [DEIDENTIFIED] it was [INAUDIBLE] you on psychopharmacology. One thing they did stress on bipolar disorder, definitely get people get as much as possible to go to bed and get up at the same time. That’s like a huge part of the battle. If you can do that, now like you’re saying get a schedule.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well I do have a pretty good schedule for sleep. You know it’s just getting the sleep, you know, getting and staying asleep. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I can get to bed at the same time and pretty much get up at the same time but it’s the constant waking up, you know, during the night or taking awhile to get to sleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Especially if you’re having flashbacks.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Yeah, so vivid. I mean it shocked me. That they are so vivid and clear. This far into my</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that does seem quite unusual.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t understand. I don’t know if maybe it’s just because I’m questioning all kinds of things right now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, should I stay there, you know. [NAME OTHER], I want him out of my life and that’s frightening because at least when he was there I had somebody but even that somebody wasn’t exactly good for me, he was still somebody. It’s frightening not to have anybody there to depend on or well he is an average guy, I can’t depend on him either, but it was somebody and it’s putting yourself out there again and just trying to find somebody to have fun with, whether it be girls, guys, whatever. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, people [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. It’s a tough road, I think, ahead.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You got to find someone that’s gonna treat you nice, treat you fair, treat you equal.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don’t want to be alone. I really don’t wanna be alone the rest of my life. So, I’m working on getting that positive energy out there and-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think you’re on the right track with the exercising.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That should give you more energy and more positive-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then when summer time comes I’m gonna look into tennis.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, getting into, sometimes I don’t know what’s around here, that was all familiar where I was, you know? I knew where it was, I knew everything, I knew, it takes me so long to get anywhere. You know, that’s such a shopper, that I’m constantly going here and going there and doing this and doing that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I don’t know [DEIDENTIFIED] very well, I have just driven through there a couple of times. That’s where the ferry goes over to [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think that’s where it comes out.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have no idea.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So I drove through there, just a couple of time</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You blinked and it probably went through and you didn’t know it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It is right by [DEIDENTIFIED] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, before [DEIDENTIFIED] yeah. Kind of broken there is [DEIDENTIFIED] and then there’s [DEIDENTIFIED] in between [DEIDENTIFIED] on one side and there’s [DEIDENTIFIED] and...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just, you know, I’m like [DEIDENTIFIED] and how do I know what it’s gonna be in the summer time, is it gonna be-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So this is an older part of the neighborhood then.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. It’s only, I think the whole thing, there’s nothing new in the whole [DEIDENTIFIED] probably except my house.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good Polish restaurant.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I have to figure it out. I guess I won’t unpack until I figure it out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That would be a wise thing to do. Make sure that you want to stay there. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yup. I got the driveway in, I got the lawn in and still don’t have any towel racks up or paper or toilet paper things, blinds.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not settled yet. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I am very far from it, I am very down to the bare bones with plates and dishes and I use the same ones and wash them over and over again. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh gosh. Do you think the Ritalin’s keeping you awake?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, because I’m tired. It’s not that, you know, it’s not. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because your mind’s not shutting off.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, my mind doesn’t wanna shut off. And I work on the positive trying to get the mind to shut down too. And sometimes it works. I put on mountain streams in the background you know, I try everything to try to shut the mind down and sometimes it works. Most of the times it doesn’t.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have any particular music that will calm you and relax you at night?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just when I play, you know, storms or streams.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so forest sounds.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that kind of stuff. No music with any kind of different beat coming out or something that would probably keep me awake or make me wanna get up and dance and sing or-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> There’s always Gregorian chant. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I should get up and do that. Yoga and what do you call it, what is that other thing, it comes along with yoga, I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Tai Chi or something like?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, meditation.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Meditation.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I should learn how to meditate so I guess that’s all part of the yoga thing is meditation.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You go into your heart you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The first time I tried yoga I could do it all. I can bend my body in the weirdest positions. I mean, the instructor said well don’t, you know you might not be able to do this if you’re not advanced enough. I can do it all. And I’ve never done it before.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s good to be limber like that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because that’s half the battle.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I guess I’m very limber. I’m limber and didn’t realize.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Let’s see, Valium, do you need a refill on that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think I’m good with that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good with that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The Ambien we’ll replace with the…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or you can alternate them.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Alternate them, yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So that’ll be Lunesta three milligrams or Ambien ten for CR. And Equetro, you have plenty of refills on that. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Yeah, I do that mail in. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And if you get those lab tests done then we’ll make sure everything there is fine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> How far away from the hospital, I don’t even know what hospital to go to.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well if you wanted you could go right over to [DEIDENTIFIED] today.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Where’s [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you go down [DEIDENTIFIED] out here, you go all the way down to the end there’s a cemetery. Go around the cemetery and go in the first driveway to [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You mean it goes to an end, it goes to the end? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It ends at the cemetery.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And around the cemetery and you’ll come out, the first road you come out on, take a left, then the first road that turns in is [DEIDENTIFIED] and it’s called the atrium. Just go right up to the first entrance there. You sign in there and they’ll take care of it. Because it’s definitely late enough in the day now, you can do that because you took it this morning. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m afraid.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it should be fine to do it now.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh. Just take it when I, if I don’t go there and do this, you don’t want me to take it the morning I have it? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you do it in the morning I would say not to take it, okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But if you’re gonna do it like this time of day, if you already took it in the morning, that’s fine</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve already taken it like ten o clock or-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s fine. That would be your easiest as to get out to here and go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think I passed that when I came down here I came down [DEIDENTIFIED] because, there’s a [DEIDENTIFIED] over in the other town I think I passed the hospital. Isn’t that [DEIDENTIFIED] by any chance?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yep, it sure is. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes I did, I passed it then.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but the easiest way to get into that entrance is go [DEIDENTIFIED] through the…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Through the cemetery.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Cemetery, then you go around over to here and the first road in here is called the atrium so it’s very easy to get to. There’s a parking garage right there or you can even park outdoors or…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> All righty.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> great. And then do you wanna come back in four or eight weeks? Your preference.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Let’s do four weeks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Four weeks. Okay. There’s enough Lunesta there for 36 days.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> After taking it every day, right?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If I get a nasty taste in my mouth that’ll kill it right away.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, again, brush your teeth or use-</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Peppermint or-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Peppermint, apple juice, anything like that, anything else. Okay. All right. Thanks for that, I appreciate it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you’re welcome.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] Okay, take care.</P>

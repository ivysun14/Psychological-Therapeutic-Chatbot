<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Oh, right, that's really great.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:05) (pause) So I don't know what I expect or want you to do to make me feel better. I think part of that is that I kind of [made clear expectations] from therapy before I started working with you, and (laughter) this doesn't really work the same way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've been kind of barely consciously trying to derail, like not expect anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What had you expected?</p>

<p>[00:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Kind of a problem-solving approach. You know, "Okay, this is what you're telling me and well, if you look at it like this, what if you can do this, will that help you feel better?" You know, some of that but not much. You know, it's more "Well, this is what you're telling me, but maybe this is what you're really saying." No, but I was saying the first thing. (laughter) (pause) It's hard when I talk to other people because I expect that I will talk to them, I will tell them how I am sad, they will, you know, express sympathy and then I will feel better or will feel less alone or something.</p>

<p>[00:02:07]</p>

<p>You know, and there's a lot of "Oh yeah, and this happened to me. I know how you feel." And there are certainly people who know how I feel, but not that many of them. You know, like my mom knows how I feel, but I don't really like that. (chuckles) </p>

<p>I had an appointment with Dr. Vaughn yesterday, and I was talking about how everything in my life is kind of a mess, and she said "I imagine it must be very hard for you to be married." You know, "Why do you say that?" kind of having an answer in my head, and she said "Well, you have a hard time holding onto yourself in the face of other people. You tend to kind of throw yourself into other people's emotions and expectations of you."</p>

<p>[00:03:11]</p>

<p>I'm like "Yeah, I totally do that. Like that's what I was thinking of." It's also like a classic symptom of BPD as far as I can tell, and it's also something that my mom does to an extraordinary degree, and that has caused me a lot of pain over the years. So I really don't like that in myself. So, you know, talking to my mom for sympathy is kind of a double-edged sword. Because then the only conversations we have are about depression, and it's just depressing. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:04:01]</p>

<p>And then like she'll be right there with me, and then just totally not there at all, and I can't handle that gap. Like between her like eerily knowing what's going on in my internal life, because it's the same thing that's going on in hers, and also having this total cluelessness about what I'm actually telling her that, you know, makes it just not very sensitive sometimes. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just have two—- one is, I guess I'm wondering the extent to which you are sort of occupied with or worried about having BPD—- </p>

<p>[00:05:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of it. More than I'd like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the second is, I don't believe I've ever heard you mention your mother actually understanding something well about—- I mean, even paying enough attention through being able to sort of keep a conversation focused on you much, let alone having a clear or even uncanny sense of how you really felt and what things are really like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more in the last year or so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, she dominates the conversation, but I will kind of say "So, I'm sort of like this" or "I'm having a hard time because I have a hard time telling people I'm depressed or acting out the way that I'm feeling." </p>

<p>[00:06:22]</p>

<p>And she says "Yes, I'm exactly that way" and goes on to describe in eerie detail the kind of thought processes and situations that I get into. You know, and she's much more extreme in some ways than I am, but in some ways not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like she—- (chuckles) To take the kind of adopting other people's personas, she picked up bow-hunting for like two years when she was—- I mean, I was like 12, so I guess she was in her early 40s because she was working at a farm and had a couple of friends, I think one of whom she was with for a while, but she didn't tell us about him, so I kind of found out in an awkward way.</p>

<p>[00:07:23]</p>

<p>Then she like killed deer and made sausage (chuckles), and I just like dropped it. And she like bought me a bow and taught me how to shoot and took me to the firing range and stuff. I'm a really good shot, actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, weirdly enough. But then it was like when she dropped it—- it was something, you know, I was like "Yeah, I'd like to have a bow. I would like to learn how to do this." But then [that was gone]. This was the guy that I think she was with the night that I—- she kind of presented him as a friend, the night that I was just really kind of in agony at my dad's house. I didn't want my dad, so I called her.</p>

<p>[00:08:22]</p>

<p>And then she was with this guy, and this guy answered the phone. Then she was like "Let me talk to your dad, let me talk to your father," and I talked to him, and then he like screamed at me for I guess embarrassing him or something. I'm not still angry about that at all, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As long as we're clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, I just—- it was like one of the times when I asked most clearly for help because it was unbearable, and they both just totally dropped the ball. I literally got punished for being depressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>[00:09:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's less that I'm upset thinking about having BPD, and it's more that I'm upset thinking about being like my mom, who clearly, in my mind, does have BPD. She just meets all the symptoms. I know that the next DSM, it tracks it entirely differently. But the current one, just all of them. It's distressing to me to find that my sense of self is so unstable because that's not something that I'd known or thought about myself.</p>

<p>[00:10:15]</p>

<p>I always thought I had a pretty good sense of who I was and what I wanted. (pause) So there's a lot of instability there. (pause) It is hard being married. It's really good to be married, and it's really hard at the same time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I'm so tired. Like I think just working at The coffee shop is putting a strain on my knees and moving is hard work. </p>

<p>[00:11:07]</p>

<p>Especially like last night. James and I both went our separate ways. I ran errands, went to see Dr. Vaughn and she's like way the fuck out there. I came back and picked up a whole bunch of things and ran some errands. We got back at like seven, and then like ordered dinner and ate. But then we had to go out again because we don't have Internet yet, and I needed to send e-mails to people who are going to look at this apartment, just to say, you know, "just call me because I don't have Internet."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we got back, and we'd talked about moving the furniture last night. You know, we'd said like yeah, let's try to get the furniture sort of where we want so we can start unpacking. And I just wasn't up for it. Like I just couldn't do it. </p>

<p>[00:12:07]</p>

<p>I just went forward. And it wasn't just that I didn't want to be moving furniture myself. It was partly that, because some of it we both had to move, but also like I didn't want to make decisions about where things were put, but I want a say in where things go. James was exhausted and he kept dropping things and hurting himself, and I was terrified and freaked out and just started sobbing. He just kept going. I can't—- (pause) I thought I made it pretty clear what I wanted, which was probably some combination of I didn't make it that clear, and it was really really important to James to have less clutter before he went to bed. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:13:19]</p>

<p>Sometimes it's nice, like knowing that I feel really bad, being clear about where I am. Like yeah, I know what's going on in my head and I'm really unhappy. (chuckles) Or I don't know if unhappy is exactly covering the basis. (pause) I'm just tired. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Devastated? Is that closer than sad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, but I think of that in terms of like grief over something, and it's more that I'm just stretched too thin, you know. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:14:19]</p>

<p>Yeah. I don't have enough to give to do things, you know? (pause) I feel (inaudible at 00:14:32) but I only got like five hours of sleep last night. (pause) Yeah. (pause) You know, I'm getting better telling James what I want, and telling him when I'm unhappy with him. But, you know, that doesn't always mean you get what you want. (laughter) So I'm working on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) [It doesn't?]</p>

<p>[00:15:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I wouldn't want that, you know. I don't—- yeah. I feel bad when it feels like James is taking care of me at the expense of what he needs. So I don't want that to happen. (pause) It's also—- a completely different topic. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's amazing how fast I'm pushing this thing that happened at church out of my memory. Like I just don't want to deal with it.</p>

<p>[00:16:20]</p>

<p>It's like this big, hard, really devastating—- that is a really devastating thing. And I can kind of feel myself just feeling like well, I'm going to go think about something else now. (long pause) </p>

<p>[00:17:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess this is the moment where you'd like some help somehow with what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I don't—- (pause) I don't know what this means for my being part of this church. It's also the fact that I met with one of the priests and I talked to him. He was really kind and he was really helpful and said he'd get back in touch with me, but he just never did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know I need to push or, you know, say "I'm still here," but I don't want to have to do that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:18:48]</p>

<p>It was so hard talking to him the first time. It took me like six months. (pause) (crying) But I love this place. Yeah. The services are really incredible, really beautiful and lovely and exactly what I need a whole lot of the time, and I don't want to give that up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's a moment there, I think, where you feel abandoned, like you really put yourself out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:19:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other person—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not being welcomed. Yeah, yeah. [The other person could've said] "Okay, this makes me uncomfortable or this is outside of what I can do." Or, in fact, he's a priest and he probably he just forgot, because he's really fucking busy. (pause) But I don't care. (pause) You know, half of me kind of wants to make excuses for people, and the other half says nope, not good enough. (pause) (sniffling)</p>

<p>[00:21:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What more goes along with that judgment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffling) That I don't care?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that it's not good enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if you're grading students that day. You said this isn't good enough. Is it because it's disorganized, because you don't make the point clearly, whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I would like my need to matter. (pause) And I would like to be able to talk about my life in any sort of an honest way, like in any sort of a way that allows any kind of actual relationship to form and not just have people walk away because they're scared. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:22:20]</p>

<p>I kind of want to say look, I'm the same person that you like that is, you know, showing up on time to things and is not attacking you or—- I don't know what scares people about this, but—- (pause) (crying) You know, it's like I've always been afraid that if people knew who I really was, they would all reject me.</p>

<p>[00:23:22]</p>

<p>Now I'm trying really hard to let people know who I am, and they're rejecting me. (chuckles) (pause) (sniffling) But I also don't know what I'm—- I feel like it feels as though people, a wide variety of people, are responding very differently to me than I am used to, or that I'm expecting, or that I will say something, and the response that I get is really not what I was thinking of. Which, to me, means I am changing in the way that I interact with people. But I don't quite know how because it feels like I'm just the same as I always have been.</p>

<p>[00:24:20]</p>

<p>So that's scary that I just don't know how to talk. (pause) And I understand that being afraid of what you don't know or not really wanting to be best friends with somebody who is just off—- I get that. I really get that. (pause) I just constantly feel wrong-footed because I don't know what I'm putting out there, so I don't know how to gauge what people are returning.</p>

<p>[00:25:18]</p>

<p>You know, it would be nice not to have to worry about how I was putting myself out there, but I don't think that exists. I do know people who don't worry about how they present themselves, and they're usually assholes. (chuckles) I don't want to do that. (pause) (sniffling) And it's also so clear to me that I take rejection very very hard, and that I will construe a wide range of things into a rejection, so that's not fair.</p>

<p>[00:26:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you also have a fantasy of being able to know or sort of predict more so and also contain how you feel that, in a way, can be unrealistic. You don't know why the Blue Cross guy like turned tail and fled. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His co-worker next to him might have responded very differently, you know. It could be that he was in the hospital and didn't want to get near that or, you know, his younger sister killed herself or he has some other stigmatized view, or who knows.</p>

<p>[00:27:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually—- there's more—- I think you assume and maybe there's more evidence [in the field than I can know].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not usually. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He found this shameful and disturbing, like he found you shameful and disturbing to him—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmmm-hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- and didn't want to have anything to do with you. </p>

<p>[00:28:28]</p>

<p>I guess as I think about it, I imagine like slightly under the surface, you had a very particular impression of why he responded the way that he did. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That has more to do with how you can see yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obviously I'm not trying to excuse his reaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, but that makes sense. (pause) Yeah. (pause) When I think about myself and am by myself, I'm not embarrassed about being in the hospital. I'm not embarrassed about being suicidal. </p>

<p>[00:29:30]</p>

<p>None of this feels like something I should need to not bring up in kind of casual conversation, as these are the things that are going on in my life. (pause) It's just where my life is right now. But I am like so so sensitive to seeing that rejection from other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know how those two are connected. Then it's like when I'm not ashamed of it by myself, but if I think someone else thinks I should find it shameful, I find it shameful. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:30:32]</p>

<p>I don't like that. (pause) [One of my less-appealing qualities]. (pause) I don't find other people's mental illness to be something that they should be ashamed of. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:31:27]</p>

<p>So my parents—- I don't think they should be ashamed of mental illness, but I do think they should be ashamed of the way they treated me and treat me. (pause) But I also don't think they should, you know, hold onto that and beat themselves up about it forever, because that doesn't do anybody any good. So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) You know, it's like Papa and I talked a little bit about the way I grew up, like last summer and when I was in the hospital. You know, I said "Yeah, it was really bad." And then I said "But it's okay." Like "You're forgiven," basically.</p>

<p>[00:32:41]</p>

<p>And now it's like well, now I'm still really angry, but I don't know how to talk to him. (pause) Because I do want him to forgive himself, I really do. I don't—- (pause) (crying) I don't want him to have to keep dealing with this, but I have to keep dealing with it, and it still hurts. (pause) (crying) And it feels like he just gets to get better and move on with his life, and I really don't get to do that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:33:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [But I think he feels]—- (pause) so responsible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel so responsible. (pause) Like I assume that's why you don't know how to talk to him about it, because you're stuck between wanting to be honest and also take care of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) And it's like [he's so indifferent now]. And in some ways, I think he's really not very different.</p>

<p>[00:34:58]</p>

<p>But in the things that used to terrify and hurt me, like he's so different. So it's like the person I'm angry at doesn't even exist anymore, in some ways. It feels like that, although I know that's not really the case. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (long pause)</p>

<p>[00:36:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're right. I mean, I don't know (inaudible at 00:36:08) this guy at church at all. (pause) He's not anybody I have anything in common with. It's just—- he's somebody there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I may be over-emphasizing this, but I have the impression there have been a number of these moments. But I think we just had another one where you bring something up that's overwhelming and you don't know how to reconcile, and there's a pause, and I get the feeling you then kind of want me to help you with it, and I don't say anything. And then you tend to like reach for something that's either positive or easier to grab onto in a way.</p>

<p>[00:37:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I talk and I get to the point where it's like I feel my own thinking is not going to carry me any further, so I just kind of wait and see whether you have anything to say. And you don't, and I say well—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: —- onward. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine there is some, you know, not necessarily very big feeling of being abandoned there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, actually, no. Because I know that you're hearing me. It's more just disappointment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmm.</p>

<p>[00:38:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it doesn't feel like—- it feels like you're listening and you understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you also don't really know what to say or know what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know what to say or know what to do. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It's more like the feeling is like "that makes two of us."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:39:01]</p>

<p>I guess—- yeah. I guess I do feel abandoned, but I can't think of a time when you have done this when a treater (ph) will, you know, basically invalidate what I'm feeling or what I have to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like when I was in the hospital and saying "This whole mood monitoring thing where I try to think a different thought, that's not working for me at all. Like at all, at all." And they just said "Well, you just need to keep working at it. We have the answer and you're doing the right thing. You just need to keep going and it will work eventually." </p>

<p>[00:40:01]</p>

<p>And me saying "No, that's not how it's working for me. Like my experience is not that." You know, that felt like I was being abandoned. (pause) (sniffling) You know, I guess it's a really good sign that I think about that now, and I'm like "Yeah, I would've quit. I would quit after like two days." (laughter) Like after the second person did that to me, I would just be like "Bye, I'm out of here. I'm done with this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good. But that's also a kind of a fantasy, like I would like to think I would I quit, but would I? [Probably].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's just looks a little different than it did at the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it registered differently anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just know—- </p>

<p>[00:41:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you had more perspective on the way it had registered, if it were to happen that way again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause) Yeah, you know, it's like I keep hoping [to have an answer] or something. Sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't, and it's okay. (pause) I guess I'm a lot more pessimistic than I used to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>[00:41:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) It's like oh, there's a shocker. (chuckles) (pause) Yeah. Maybe I'm just desperately making excuses for you. (pause) It's what it feels like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm not desperately making any.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Oh, yeah]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm [going to be] [inaudible] for Halloween in honor of [the story], and also it's an easy costume. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to go back and play with a glue gun. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you going to have a party?</p>

<p>[00:43:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I have to dress up for work, which I'm not really excited about. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) This is a place where you can admit things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, basically. Well, it's like they're instituting wacky headband and crazy tie Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in general?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In general, like it's a thing. And like my manager told me about this and I was like "Is this flair?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's like "Yeah, but it's good flair," like trying to sell me on it. I'm like "No, no, that doesn't work."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time, I really like pretty hats, so I'm totally into that. (laughter) Like that is exactly where my nerdness falls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I am planning to exploit that opportunity.</p>

<p>[00:44:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to unpack. We still have James's stuff, so we have twice as much stuff that's going to come into this apartment. Oh my God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:00)</p>

<p>You sure?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Thanks for (inaudible at 00:03).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. So, like, shit hit the fan on Tuesday night when I decided that finally, like, OK, we were going to go to dinner, me and Franklin (sp?). And I was like, "You know, I'm just going to bring this up, like, do not make a huge deal of it and just—in a calm setting, you know, like, you know, explain to him how I really feel." He was at practice and I was at home, and I got the bright idea that, "Well, maybe I'll just go on his computer, and see if Facebook's logged in, and just reassure myself that the messages are harmless and it's just upsetting to me that they're messaging to begin with, regardless of what's being messaged.</p>

<p>But no, I found disturbing messages, starting from the day prior—so Monday through Tuesday—and, like, there was nothing appropriate about anything going on this messages. This little girl—like, I'm, like, (inaudible at 01:09). First of all, there's talk about when they're going to meet up. There's him saying, "So when can we get a drink? Are you going to be around?" I guess she works in the city, I gathered. She's saying things, like—he's saying, "Oh, you know," they're chatting, "Oh, I'm about to stretch," and she's like, "You should come here and stretch me out." And he's like, "Oh, well, what the fuck?" And then she's like, "Well, just let me know when you can squeeze me in, or I can squeeze you in rather."</p>

<p>Sending him links to stuff she just bought, including a fucking vibrator. Like, "Look at the sex toy I just bought." Like, so many inappropriate things. Like, I printed some of it out and I think I threw it away. I don't know what I did it. Like, I was shaking, like, shaking. And seems like, I had been talking to him that day in (inaudible at 01:56) and he was, like, kind of upset that I was going to be away the next three—well, the next four weekends really, because of, like, this weekend I was going to go to visit a friend, next weekend and the following weekend in Virginia, and then the weekend after that a baby shower for my best friend Amanda. [00:02:08]</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, you know, why don't I go on Thursday, come back Saturday afternoon so that we can still have a nice date night," and literally two seconds after I said that, he sent her a message saying, "I just freed Thursday up." Right, OK.</p>

<p>So I texted him and I'm like, "Are you on your way home? We need to talk." So he calls me. He's like, "What's up?" I'm like, "Well, where are you?" He's like, "Walking on the tram." I'm like, "All right, you really want to hear this and sit it in on your train ride? OK." He was like, "So, what's up?" I was like, "I found your messages that I really need you to explain to me." And he was like, "What are you talking about?" You know what the fuck I'm talking about Franklin. How about the messages with Betty (sp?), like, planning when you can meet up to fuck." He was like, "Trina (sp?), Trina (sp?), I wasn't meeting up to -"</p>

<p>And I literally stopped him. I was like, "I don't want to fucking hear it. Like, come the fuck home and we can talk about it in person. Like, there's literally nothing you can say." So he walks in, like, extremely sullen and I, like, handed him the printout and he, like, throws it, puts it down, like, "I know what it says." And it's starts with like, and he goes through all the phases, right. It starts with, like, you know, "I (inaudible at 03:15) time to think about it on the train," and he said, "You know, I'm so sorry, like, there's nothing I can say." And then I started crying and, like, was like, "Why? Like, why?" [00:03:26]</p>

<p>And then he goes to blame me, like, as usual—his fucking default—and says it's because he thought I was cheating on him. I was spending so much time with my friends him and he wasn't sure if I was planning all these weekends away, I was planning to cheat—I was either cheating or cheated or was planning to. He felt like I wasn't giving him enough attention, he felt wronged in our relationship and he felt that I wasn't attracted to him, and when he tried to talk to me about it, I always told him he was crazy, you know, and of course I am. And I was tilting my phone away, and so he thought I was, you know, acting really suspicious. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>And I said, "OK. You don't do that though. You talk to me about it." "I tried." "You didn't try fucking hard enough Franklin. Like, you didn't try hard enough. Obviously if it was serious to the point—and how could I even fucking believe that? Your consciously talking to this girl in the way that you were. Like, you're not fucking drunk or dumb. Like, this is a conscious behavior." And I said to him—and he said, "Well, I don't even know when it began, like, to turn into that." I was like, "OK, well neither do I, because you have no record of anything, because you deleted everything." And I was like, "You know, yeah, maybe when you did that I didn't take it seriously, but that's because, like, I—of course I am attracted to you. Like, what are you talking about? Like -" and yes, I was tilting my phone away—and I was. But that's because over the last three weeks, I've been texting all my friends, asking for their advice on—how do I, you know, every time I would see, like, on his phone that, you know, he was deleting a message or whatever, I would text my Amanda (sp?) like, " I really don't know what to do, like, he's still texting this girl, like." And I didn't want—and (inaudible at 05:03), it was a little, like, (inaudible at 05:06), but, really? [00:05:09]</p>

<p>That's what I was saying. And he's like, "Well, I didn't know and I didn't know, and I didn't know." And then it turned into crying and begging, you know, like, "Please, please, please, don't do this. Please, I'm so sorry, please." And then it turned into anger because he feels that he's given me so many second chances when we've had all those breakup talks, that if I don't give a second chance—then I'm like, "Well, first of all, we've gone through this in the beginning of the relationship with the other girls. Like, maybe not to this extent, but I have no idea." And—oh, and he's trying to say, "So you really think I was going to meet up with her?" And I was like, "Yeah, of course I do." "I wasn't. I don't know why I was saying that. I wasn't going to do it." I was like, "You're giving her weekends that you're free, when I'm not going to be here. Like, what right now gives me any reason to believe anything that's coming out of your mouth at all?" And I made sure he knew that.</p>

<p>So then he wanted to go out and, like, drink, like, alone by the water, or I don't know. And I, like, convinced him to stay, because he has a tendency to be, like, very overdramatic, so he's, like already gathering stuff, "Like, I have to figure out what I can sell and go to tomorrow morning to the place and sell the stuff." And I was like, "This is not tearing a Band-Aid and, like, it's done Franklin. Like, there's still stuff—this just happened right now, like, there's still stuff to talk about. Like, there's still money involved with us, there's still an apartment. Like, you can't just leave and be like, "I'm going to stay at some family member's house and I don't know who and I don't know what I'm doing." (sighs)</p>

<p>We went over it and over it, like, (pause) and even the times that he's saying he gave me a second chance, the reason I was crying and begging for him not to, like, be like, "I'm done, I'm done," is because I tried to start a conversation, it turned into blaming me, I ended up saying, you know, "OK, fine, I'll be better, I'll be better." So there's are, like, the second chances. I just, like, it—I have, like, no words. And I told him, I was like, you know, "I checked your Facebook and, like, I really didn't want to, but, you know, I figured it was just to make myself feel better about approaching you about not talking to her anymore since it was so innocent, and it's what I was hoping to find. Like, just, like, bullshit about cameras or whatever." [00:07:20]</p>

<p>But no, it was far from it. And I asked him, oh I said, "You know, so, when you first started, like, texting her or whatever back in June, I saw that she sent you a bunch of picture messages. What were those?" "I don't know, stupid stuff like a pair of shoes and her face after she did her makeup." I was like, "Right there was when you should cut it off, right there. You don't—no girl that's just a friend is just, like, 'Look at my face after I did my makeup.'" And, like, one of the times she was like, "Well, I (inaudible at 07:49) about that lesbian vibe] (ph). Ha ha." And he was like, "I wouldn't know." And she was like, "Oh yeah, that's right, we haven't met. I keep forgetting." And he's like, "I know, I feel like we have." Like, Franklin, like, you can't tell me this is all because of me and because I wasn't giving you enough attention. And I said, "You know, fuck that, because when I first said to you, listen, I see you're messaging with this girl, is it because, you know, and we talked about that, and you said no." And he said, "Well, maybe, but it's wrong and I should get that attention from you, so, you know, I'm going to stop." So for you to stay it's because I wasn't giving you any attention, bullshit. And because you didn't feel attractive, bullshit. [00:08:22]</p>

<p>Maybe I was turning away a little bit, you know, I'm not as cuddly lately, but, you know, it's because I've been feeling like shit because you're still talking to this girl that I asked you not to talk about. So, OK, there's a circle, but I'm not going to say that, like, "I'm so sorry, like." And I just—I, like, don't know if, like, I can rebuild trust now. And he's like, "You know, I'll give you all my passwords and you can see everything. I won't delete anything." I was like, "First of all, I have no reason to believe you right now, that you won't delete stuff before I look at it." So I go, "I don't want that. I don't want it to be like, 'Hey honey, how was your day? Can I check your phone and your Facebook and your e-mail? What's going on today? Who'd you talk to?'"</p>

<p>And I was talking to one of my friends about it and she said, "You know, Trina (sp?), honestly, like, this has kind of happened before and, you know, OK, he did this now—what's going to happen in 5, 10, 15, 20 years when it really gets hard and he may feel, like, unattractive or whatever? What's going to happen then?" And, again, he was telling me that he wasn't going to actually meet up with her. Like, maybe that's true but, like, the intention was there, like (sighs), like, I'm literally just out of luck. Like, I didn't—[00:09:39]</p>

<p>And then last night, (inaudible at 09:40) came into town yesterday, which is, like, good timing. I went to—I went to work for a little while. I told my boss what was going on because she kind of just knew what was going on and (inaudible at 09:50) similar situations as well. And so she obviously was, like, "You can do whatever you need to do, like, if you can't be here today, that's fine. Leave whenever you want, like, do whatever." I ended up leaving at, like, 3:00. Went to Mandy's (sp?) house, hung out with her. We didn't really get to talk yet because her little sister was there. And then we went out to dinner and we talked more. And, like, her thing of it is like, even from the beginning, Mandy's (sp?) not been supportive of how much—how involved I got so soon with him, like, in terms of money and she didn't like that I helped him with the dental stuff and she has been the one, like, saying, "You need to separate your account with him, like, a long time ago, like, he can't do this." [00:10:23]</p>

<p>So, you know, on one side she's saying, you know, that. And then on the other side, "Oh he said, you know, I think I need therapy, I have a problem." And I was like, "You have a huge problem. Yeah, you need therapy." And then he started to say, "We should've gone to couple's therapy." And I said, "I tried. I said to you, 'Maybe we should see a couple's therapist just to talk about stuff,' and you said no." And he said, "I know, I know," you know, he's sobbing and crying, he doesn't know what to do. And so last night I went out with Mandy—I hadn't eaten, like, I just—I couldn't eat. I just [really haven't been] (ph) hungry. So I'd been drinking water and then went out with Mandy (sp?), had some sushi, drank some wine, got a little drunk, she drove.</p>

<p>I came home and I couldn't find him. And I was like, "OK, it's 11:30. What the fuck is going on now?" And then the last place didn't I look was the office. And he's, like, laying on the floor in the office. And I was like, "What are you doing?" And he was like, "I don't know. I didn't—I was crying and I didn't—and so I laid down and I guess I fell asleep." And I guess he had drank a bunch of a rum and, like, eaten like nothing or whatever. And then, like, we were both crying and stuff and hugging, like, then we went and made love, and—but I, like—and then we woke up this morning and he, of course, had a hangover and is sick at home, like, didn't go to work. And I woke up still feeling the same, asked to check his cell phone. [00:11:48]</p>

<p>She had sent him one of those, like, my e-cards, like, postcard things that you see everywhere now, that was like, "Sometimes you just need a hug. In your vagina. With a penis." Like, sent that to him. And then, like, he didn't respond. And then later on, "Well, thanks for making me look like a fool." All right, you make yourself fucking look like a fool. And, oh, I did get in contact with the ex—her ex-boyfriend, who's our friend. Like, "Is this really your ex-girlfriend?" And then he said, "Yes," and then he was asking me why. And (inaudible at 12:17) was like, "Well, can you guess?" And he was like, "Yeah, I can guess." And then he was like, "Honestly, like, she's insane, like, and she's a fucking hypocrite, like." And so I think he's angry and I was like, "Please don't get involved if you can help it." So I don't know if he called her up and that's why she said to Franklin, "Thanks for making me look like a fool." He was like, "I really think you should message her and, you know, tell her than you told me and tell her whatever." [00:12:34]</p>

<p>And I have been going back and forth with if I should, but I just don't know if that's, like, the healthiest thing to do, because literally all it would be is—say, "You fucking dirty little slut. Like, who the fuck says that (inaudible at 12:45) somebody else's fucking boyfriend, who you know lives with his girlfriend? Like, who the fuck, you know? You didn't know (inaudible at 12:52) made you look like a (inaudible at 12:53)," but I don't think I should, like, I think it's pointless. And also, it's kind of humiliating for me because she could just as easily write back and be like, "He wasn't stopping it," you know.</p>

<p>She wrote him messages on Facebook that he didn't respond to yesterday, and he showed me, that was like, you know, "Hey honey bear. Let me know when we can get a weekend away together." Like, what the fuck? I just (inaudible at 13:19) this morning, even though he's like sick, like, whatever, hung over. And I was like, I just don't understand how it gets to a point where this is happening. Like, how did it get to this point, you know? Like, that doesn't happen because you're unhappy in your relationship and you felt like I was cheating. Like, you talk to me about that. You don't do this. And, you know, and he started crying again and he's like, "I know nothing I say matters and I'm ready to accept whatever decision you make," and, you know, all that stuff. He's just a little drama queen, like, and he tries to make me feel that sometimes, but (pause). [00:13:57]</p>

<p>Like, you know, I was telling you last week how it was making me uncomfortable and I did think—and I told you in the past how I don't like when he likes people's photos, and how many females he talks to, and the girls from the beginning of our relationship, you know, and how that went too far and how he lied to me about it. I was, like, ready to kind of—I was moving towards getting over it and finally, you know, and now this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course I don't know, but from what you said, I have a hard time believing these are the only two incidents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me too. That maybe went too far, and even if he hasn't seen these women that he's planned to meet up with, it's completely inappropriate and I wouldn't have any idea.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you have no idea what's happened here (ph). [00:14:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And he's trying to say, you know, "Well, how many times have you been away and I haven't done anything. And, you know, I'm home when you're out. And you're the one out, so I thought you were cheating." And I'm like, this is all—it doesn't matter. Like, [this is in everything] (ph) that he was saying. Exactly how would I ever know? There's zero—like, I have no way of knowing if he's cheated on me ever, and no reason to believe that he hasn't. And, you know, he can say he loves me and he's crying, "I ruined my life. I can't believe I ruined everything. I ruined everything." And I was like, "Yeah, Franklin, but, you know, you were doing it. Like, it's not like you got drunk and fucked somebody and that's what ruined it. Like, not like you got drunk and made out with somebody and that's what ruined it. This is days and weeks—and I don't know how long, and I don't know how many—of this kind of thing." I mean, if this girl in the beginning is sending pictures of herself with makeup, it's not I don't know when this kind of thing started. She was being flirtatious from the beginning, and he was allowing it to happen. [00:15:47]</p>

<p>He's like, "You saw that I never, like, responded specifically though." And I was like, "But you didn't tell her to stop. You laughed it off. You said, 'Oh, that looks like a good fucking dildo.' Like, what the fuck? Like, ew." So (pause) as much as, like, I would like to say, you know, like, "Well, maybe he can do therapy and work it out," and blah blah blah, I just don't think I can be around for that. Like, I think that I can't be with him if he is going to get help and if he does, then there's a way that, you know, we can work it out and be together later, then maybe that would be nice. But I just—and a lot of people are saying, "Well maybe—well, you know, trust can be rebuilt and it depends on, you know, what—how honest the person is with you." And yeah, OK, while that's true, I just don't (pause) I just don't know. Like, I just don't (pause). [00:16:50]</p>

<p>Like, this doesn't feel like a first-time offense. And it was just so easy for her. I mean, he was like clearly, like, chatting with me on (inaudible at 17:00) and chatting with her on Facebook—at the same fucking time, like, "OK, I'll just leave Thursday so then we can have date night. Love you. Hey, I freed up Thursday, want to go out?" What? How does it—so, for now, (sighs) like we're staying in the house together, like—oh, and the night that this happened, he, like, (inaudible at 00:17:24) and then, like, passed out on the couch. I went in the room and it was, like, packed in with [some people] (ph). And then I, like, fell asleep I guess, like, in my clothes. And then he came in, like, 4:30, and was, like—and, like, literally, I woke up, like, a sad face, like, about to cry, like, because I remembered what was going on [that night] (ph). And he was like, "Can I sleep in here?" And I was like, "Yeah, I mean, whatever. (inaudible at 17:52)." And I'm not even, like, ready myself to, like, have him just, like, go and not be there anymore. I just—a lot of people are saying, "Like, well, he just needs to fucking move out. Like, fuck this." But, OK, it's easier said than done. [00:18:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: True.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, so anyway. So I'm going to be away. I'm going tomorrow morning through Saturday afternoon, I guess, to hang out with Mandy (sp?). Then she has, like, some reunion of her, like, trailer park people from the summers. And so I'm not going to stay for that, so I'll come back Saturday night. Then I leave for Virginia. (inaudible at 18:33) I may have to reschedule some stuff. I leave for Virginia a week from tomorrow. And I'm not back until the following Sunday. So that's two Fridays that I miss and then a whole week. Like, so we can just probably not (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. So you're (pause). OK. (pause) Which days are you—and we can talk about this another time, but... [00:19:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, let me just continue and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) So and then I come back, and then I'm here for the week. And then the following weekend, the first weekend in August, is the (inaudible at 19:33) competition thing that they have every year (inaudible at 19:35). That we have people coming to stay at the house. Like, OK, they can still come to stay out the house—that actually is Amanda's (sp?) baby shower weekend and I'm not going to be there. Like, not—I'm going to be at the baby shower. And originally, I was planning to just go for the baby shower and then come back, so I could hang out with our friends and stuff like that. But, you know, I don't think they necessarily need to know, you know, exactly what's going on right now, whatever.</p>

<p>But I can't be there, I'm not going to go to that event and help out, like I usually do. After this, like, everything's like copacetic, because it's, like, really not. And I almost feel like, you know, yeah, I mean, it sucks and they're going to be like, "Where Trina (sp?)? Like, she really couldn't be here?" But, like, I mean, it's just something I can't, like—I mean, that's kind of uncomfortable because I know they're going to be staying at my house and I'm not there, but, like, I'm sure Franklin can handle it. I hope he can handle it. And he's like, you know, like, extremely depressed right now and, you know, he's, you know. I saw the messages, I saw that he wasn't doing it anymore or whatever, but it's kind of all like moot. Like... [00:20:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, you really don't know what he's been doing over the last few years. And I think (pause) it was probably clear to him how serious this was when it happened right at the beginning of the relationship and you were upset about it. That didn't really change anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. And I tried to explain that to him, and he tried to say, "Trina (sp?), that's when we were first starting. I was confused and, you know, I told you when they were texting me after that." And I was like, "No, that shit (inaudible at 21:18) at the [inaudible] (ph) where we lived, when that was happening."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [See, I think] (ph) (pause) the one that, like, doesn't seem like this is going to change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really doesn't. And as much as I wish that it would—and, yeah, I know that he does have residual shit from his fucked up childhood about not feeling attractive. And his family called him ugly for many, many years. Like, "Oh my god, you're so ugly. Like, how did the rest of us come out so cute and you're so ugly." [00:21:43]</p>

<p>And OK, fine. But we talked about that stuff, like—so, you know, maybe he has some stuff to work out in therapy, I just don't—again, I don't—yeah, and I want that for him, because I love him and I care about him and I don't want him to have to carry that around for the rest of his life. Just, whatever. But, I just, again, I don't know if I can ever trust him, ever. He's given me no reason to. And his reasoning for having done it is really loose. "I felt like you were cheating, so I did that."</p>

<p>When I felt that you were cheating, I'm pretty sure I approached you about it. You could've done the same, like, if you really felt that way. And, you know, I can't believe that he really felt that way. You really thought I was cheating, Franklin? Like, really? (sighs) Fucking idiot, how stupid can you be? And you (inaudible at 22:39), "Oh, I ruined my life. I can't believe I ruined everything we planned." Yeah, I mean, I can. You did consciously, four hours ago. Like, it's not like this was sporadic, or one time. So (pause), I mean, and of course there's, like, uncertainty on my part because, like, yeah, I do feel like, you know... [00:23:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you're uncertain about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Honestly, like, OK, like, a little bit about losing him, because I do love (inaudible at 23:16). But honestly, like, the bigger (ph) stuff I'm concerned about is my apartment, my cats, and, like, how I'm going to afford the apartment and stuff if he leaves, and—god, I'm even, like, "Oh god, Trina (sp?), that's such a, like, selfish thing to be worried about right now. Like, you should be worried about, like, your relationship and Franklin's feelings and your feelings." Like, I'm, like, doing that to myself inside my head, like, which is so fucked and, like, it's like almost, like, a result of conditioning of this three years of bullshit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that's your security, right? The apartment, and how you're going to afford things, and your cat. I mean, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, we have two cats. I don't want to separate them, I know he doesn't want to give them up. Like, if he wants to take them, I'll let him take them, because I'd rather them be together than, you know, and then be sad about missing them. Like, my friends—like, that would be fine, because he was, like, alone for a while at first, but Gypsy's (sp?) always been with her mother and siblings, and then with us. [00:24:14]</p>

<p>And I just—my friend got divorced, and they separated the cats, and now the other cat—her cat has been peeing under the bed all the time, and it's, like, fucked up, like, and I just don't want that. So, you know, there's that, and then there's, like, you know, god, how will I afford my rent? Like, they upped my rent 50 bucks a month. Like, how will I afford my insurance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long is your lease?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No lease.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't want to move out of that apartment. I like it. I like the location, it has all my stuff in it. I mean, I guess I could (inaudible at 24:42), but I don't want to, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I bought that big bed and made my bedroom nice, and have my washer and dryer. Like, I don't want to move out of there. I'd rather find a roommate to come live with me, but that would, like, OK, I need to, like, get on that quick. I mean, like, and then I'm not even worried about Franklin would go. He's talking about, "If we break up, I'm leaving because I can't have a life here if you're not in it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you get by for a couple of months? [00:25:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm sure that my parents would help me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that's sort of what I meant. And, like, that sounds like more of a medium-term question, the how can you afford (inaudible at 25:30), like, or how can you find a roommate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the longer term question is obviously, like, (inaudible at 25:34), you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like a pretty short-term question too, yeah (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You think?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're pretty upset about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you (inaudible at 25:44).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really wish—well, whatever, a lot of things. But that he, like, that he hadn't done that. That I hadn't had reason not to trust him to begin with. And, like, regardless of what he tells me, like, there's nothing that I wish I would've done differently. Like, I wish I would've given him more attention, I wish I wouldn't have turned my back on you in the bedroom. I wish I would've been more responsive when you touched me. [00:26:19]</p>

<p>Like, I don't wish any of that, because, you know, like, we're in a relationship and we're planning to be together forever, like, OK, that's some of the stuff you fucking talk about and, like, whatever. Like, (inaudible at 26:28) happens, like, when I—fucking married couples don't have sex for a few weeks. Like, it (ph) fucking happens. Like (pause) I just wish—everything I wish is for him. Like, I wish you hadn't done that. I wish you hadn't been so fucking stupid. I wish you hadn't led somebody on and pretended you wanted to see them, or you actually wanted to see them. I wish you hadn't talked to these other girls to begin .</p>

<p>I wish you hadn't—like, so many things. I wish you hadn't told me you would stop talking to her, and then he tried to say, "Well, you were the one that told me to keep talking to her." And I was like, "No. When we were talking about it, you said, 'Well, she's helping me with marketing stuff.' And I said, 'OK, fine. So if that's really the case and, like, it's really helpful to you, keep it to talking about marketing stuff.' I didn't make you keep talking to her and that's why this happened. Please." Oh my god. So, I think that, you know, he's (inaudible at 27:16) and he's so upset he, you know, he is really, like, (inaudible at 27:26) himself. I don't think that he'll do anything to himself, but, you know, he's definitely acting, like, extremely depressed. OK fine, you should be. You (inaudible at 27:34) shit of your life, like, I'm sorry. And of course that's my other (inaudible at 27:40), you know, surround—fears that, like, OK wait—now, are you feigning being so upset or are you really upset because of me? Or are you really upset because you're nervous about losing this security? And how—will I take care of you and help your life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trina (sp?), from your perspective, like, what's the difference?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. There is difference. I mean, nothing matters. Like, none of it matters. What matters is what he did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think what matters is also what you're going to do about it. [00:28:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm hearing different things from different people. Like, a lot of my friends are like—well, most of my friends are just saying, "No, like, he just needs to move on, you need to move on. Like, fuck that, you can do so much better." You know, like, one of my guy friends said, "Maybe this was fueled by him being, like, 'Oh, maybe Trina (sp?) will be single (ph).'" I mean, who knows. Like, you know, from a guy's perspective, he was like, "Honestly, like, you're 28, you're gorgeous, you're smart, you're successful, you're caring. Like, there's no reason that you should stay with somebody who's clearly not ready to make a commitment to you." And, you know, but then some of my friends are like, "That's a one time thing, you know..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The issue is that he's not ready to make a commitment to you. That's like, "Well, you know, I'm not ready to decide to get married, or I'm not ready to really be engaged." That's not making a commitment. That's not what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not (ph) really at all. I mean, you (pause) you really, as it turns out, haven't been able to trust him, probably throughout the relationship, in terms of how he's going to interact with other women at the very least online and, for all you know, more than that. I mean, he said he was free Thursday night, you were going to be away. Like, he didn't happen to find this out. [00:29:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, how many other times did that happen? You have no idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea, and I can't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And part of that means, you know, you can't trust anything he says about it because he's obviously been lying to you about it (inaudible at 29:55) going away. That's not just not being ready to make a commitment, that's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wanting your cake and eating it too? Kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of more, like, cheating on you to an extent you don't really know. And then, you know, at least a couple of times, and you don't know how many more. (pause) And I don't think the reasons matter. Like... [00:30:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I don't. From what you said, it sounds to me like (pause), you know, things were incredibly difficult for him as a kid in lots of ways, and lots of trauma and lots of neglect and disorganization, all sorts of stuff. And it's hard to imagine, you know, like, how difficult that can all be to deal with. But I don't—in a way, I don't see that—I don't really see how that's relevant to what seems like a kind of really ongoing...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Behavior pattern? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Way of treating you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know what, the other thing, like, it's like, I guess, either—I can't remember if it was the 10th, 9th, or 6th, when—last year when I had an abortion. And so, we were—on July 2—coming back from his sister's birthday party and it struck me that the last year on his sister's birthday was the night that I found out that I was pregnant. And I said that to him. And I said, "So, you know, so, I'm feeling a little bit sensitive and emotional and upset and sad right now, and I probably will be for a few weeks." And I wanted to make that clear to him, because I did know that I would be feeling even more sensitive to stuff, like, you know. [00:32:27]</p>

<p>And he didn't even take that into consideration, you know, like, in terms of maybe being secretive or being out with friends more, or not wanting to be physical as much. But I, you know, it's—and so there's that too, you know, like, I really would, like—especially because of his behavior when it happened was like—well he claims that he was so traumatized, that that's why he was not really there for me as much as I feel like he should've been and all that. And it's, like, you could've at least made up for it this year, like, you know, when I tell you that I maybe need a little extra attention or something. And (inaudible at 33:14).</p>

<p>I talked to my mom about it and she like, "I know. I looked at that calendar the other day and I realized that, and was wondering how you were feeling honey." Yeah, that's how you respond to somebody you love that went through something traumatic that's kind of maybe a year later, like, realizing. Meanwhile, my mother doesn't know anything [thus far] (ph). She doesn't know that we almost broke up, like, a few weeks ago. Let me just also point out, we almost broke up a few weeks ago and had this great talk about how we were going to change things and how we were going to be more honest about issues that we have with each other. And, like, he was already, like, texting with the girl. [00:33:49]</p>

<p>But anyway, my mom doesn't know anything of that. She knows in the very beginning of our relationship, that I was like, "Listen, you know, he's texting with this girl all the time and I feel very uncomfortable. I'm not sure how to handle it in part." See, her thing was, like, you know, "If it is just friends Trina (sp?), like, I think, you know, especially because this is a new relationship, you need to just, you know, leave it for what it is." So she kind of knew that stuff, and I haven't talked to her about it since. But, I mean, obviously, I have to tell her now. I mean, I don't have to, but I obviously want to. I mean, I want to. And so, I mean, in that sense, it's like good we're going to have time away with each other.</p>

<p>I mean, I know what she's going to say as a mother is, you know, "Yeah, he's moving out. Like, Trina (sp?), you're done. Like, done. Like, you've given him so fucking much. Like, money, everything, and you can't." And what I always do—what I will do and what I always do is I always—whenever she's talking to me about something, I say, "What would you tell me if I was your client, not your daughter?" And I know it's hard for her to separate, but I am always curious because I want to know, always, like, what she's going to say. And so I—well, the (inaudible at 34:51) do that, and often it's, like, too similar to, like... [00:34:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, she really can't know. (inaudible at 34:57)</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, because it's like, her feelings are going to be 100 percent different with her client as [opposed to] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 35:05) and she just knows you in a very...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Intimate way, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...different way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, so yeah, so I mean, I've been trying to, like, wrap my head around it. And I'm even try to make myself think, "Well, maybe there's a chance." But I just don't think there is right now. Like, he—I can't. I can't, like, I just can't. I can't live with him, you know, past this month, because whatever, everything is going on, and I'm going to be away and all this shit. He needs to move out. I'm sorry if you have to sell some of your camera shit, like (pause), I mean, he's left me no choice. He wants a second chance, it's not a fucking second chance. This is going to be multiple chances that I've now given him. [00:35:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I would think, you know, if it's evolved (ph), I know it's always harder to do, but this is going to keep happening. And as awful as it is now, you know, you've got a one year and a four year old or (inaudible at 36:24)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And a dog and a mortgage. And another car. Exactly what my friend said. She was—I mean, and I took [that with the grandfathers] (ph), (inaudible at) told me of, like, 15, 20 years. Her husband cheated on her before they got—I think maybe right before they got engaged or maybe right when they engaged, and she decided to let go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's sort of different stories and (ph) different people, like, if this was a one time...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'd be different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you know, or if it was, (inaudible at), as you said, sort of getting drunk and fucking somebody, or something had happened with a particular person he knew well, you know, if it was like an affair. That's one thing, but from what you've said, it sounds like this was more like just something he does and that talking about it with him hasn't changed anything. [00:37:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope, never.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also seems like he kind of says whatever he has to say in the moment. So, yeah, I guess for those reasons, it seems to me like, you know, if you stay together, that's kind of what you're setting up for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm also signing up for being the girlfriend that's checking the phone every single fucking day, checking the phone record, checking the Facebook, making him, you know, make sure that he didn't delete messages. I mean, I don't fucking want that. I mean, he's found a way to be sneaky a hundred times before—I'm sure even with passwords and everything, he'll find another way to be sneaky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't—there's zero trust. (sighs) So anyway...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm so sorry to hear that that's what turned out...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of sorry (ph), yeah, me too. It was really disappointing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And it sounds like it's (pause)—talking about having him move out, I'm sure that's going to be incredibly painful and sad for you. [00:38:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. (inaudible at 00:38:36) I mean, it's going to be horrible. But I just can't do it anymore. Like, I really just can't. Like, I really deserve much better than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) So this is what's going to happen. I haven't broken him the news, because I just came to the decision, again, this morning when I realized, you know, I can't do this. It's just so tiring. Yeah. Anyway, but in terms of next appointments, OK—so I'm away the 20th—which is a Friday—through the 29th—which is a Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here, hold on. Let me—I need to use this, let me stop the... [00:39:31]</p>

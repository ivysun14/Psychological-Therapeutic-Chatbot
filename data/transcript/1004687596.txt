<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's the temperature? Too hot? Too cold?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's fine. I have a lighter shirt on today. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what was that because I was late?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What was what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I walked out and you had a sort of smile on your face like something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I got to pee again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was something that we were talking about at the end Friday. Was it Friday, yeah. Actually I forget what it was but it seems like I always talk about things (inaudible at 00:00:49). Do you remember? (Pause) </p>

<p>Were you going to say something? [0:01:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, go ahead. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just going to say there's this guy—I've only met him a couple of times through a mutual friend and my friend Mosbie goes up to the lake almost every day in the summer time. And we went up with him on Saturday and stayed up there. I came home with this guy Curtis and it's funny because every time I've seen him he's been pretty mellow and he talks but not—and he was just wicked crazy. He would just not shut up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he talked about how he gets depressed and stuff. I'm like oh this guy's bipolar. It turns out he's not on any medication or anything. Because Mosbie takes forever to get anywhere. He's always zooming in at the last minute. And I know they were up there waiting forever for us to get up there. So there's probably a lot of tension between him and his wife. [0:02:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Between Mosbie and his wife?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Curtis and his wife waiting for us like when's he going to get here because when he showed they were both...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. So you and Mosbie came up together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Curtis and his wife were already up there. There was a lot of tension between them about having to wait for the two of you guys. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Kerry was with us as well; Mosbie's wife. So I went home with Curtis and he was like oh you should come over tomorrow. Bring the kids over and we'll barbecue. But he sleeps till 11:00 so I've got to call after 11:00. So Jess asked me because Jess had wanted to do something with the kids on Sunday and she's like what are you going to do with the kids and I'm like I'd like to take them to a barbecue over at Curtis's and she said no. She said that I don't see Lucille enough and that I can't take her. And I'm like I don't even remember the conversation. I was completely blown away. And she said we'll talk about it later and we haven't talked about and I don't want to talk about it because it's just going to be some (inaudible at 00:03:26) of me. [0:03:27]</p>

<p>She goes I think you should visit with Lucille a bit here. You don't see her enough to take her away. I don't want her to go. And I said she'll be fine. If not I will bring her home. And then she said both kids are sick with colds too. Why don't you see the (pause) Erica and then go to the party? No, she's not going with me. Why don't you see the kids and then go to the party? No, she's not going to see the kids. See it wasn't a party. I should've pointed it out that it wasn't a party. And I said you're being unfair and overprotective just because she might cry is not a good enough reason. She knows me and she would have fun with the kids. They have colds, fine, but don't tell me I can't take her anywhere because she doesn't see me enough. I'll be heading over. I said I'll be over. Maybe you should go to the office or coffee shop to do some work. She said it's not about suddenly crying. I talked to her on the phone and she said she doesn't want to tell me about it with the kids there. She wants to talk about it. [0:04:34]</p>

<p>So I guess there was confusion that she thought it was a party but it was just me and the kids. I don't know. She was upset about something that happened at the last barbecue or whatever but it's like she simply said no. I'm in no position. There's nothing I can do that's not going to lead to... I would have to get some sort of court action which would put me on some sort of schedule which I really don't want to be on a schedule with the kids. I don't want to have to have them every other weekend. It's really getting to me having Ian every Friday because it's like—I guess she misunderstood me but still... [0:05:24]</p>

<p>So I was all pissed off. That was Sunday. It really bothers me. It sticks with me and I'm upset for a long time. And with the colds we went to the park and both kids played in the water. Yeah, they're really sick. Now she wants me to pick her up from daycare a couple times. It's like presumed... The way you get her to learn about leaving you is by leaving you not by having me pick her up in a situation that doesn't involve you. It's like the same thing happened with Ian and this is a big source of tension. She does everything what she thinks is best for the child but it ends up just getting the child into a routine of never leaving it's mom. [0:06:28]</p>

<p>And now she has done the same thing with Lucille. There's a reason she's like that. And I bet you if she had something to do, she had to be in court and there was no daycare that day and I couldn't help out, she would call her mom up and she would leave the kid with her mom. But I can't take the kid to a barbecue. That doesn't make a difference whether it's a party or not. (Pause) That drives me crazy. And then after making such a big deal over the money she acted like it was no big deal. It was just like oh it's no big deal. It's like you're fucking crying and it's no big deal. Maybe she was menstruating or something like that or premenstruating. The pre or after—she pretty much before, after, during maybe one day a month she's happy. So I went home and drank. [0:08:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead of going to the barbecue?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was no barbecue to go to. The whole point was for Curtis and I to get together with the kids. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I hung out with the kids till like... It's not even... I hang out at the house, go to the park, Jess's there the whole time, and then they want to go get ice cream. It's like so we all go and get ice cream. I don't get ice cream. I shouldn't be eating it. The kids shouldn't be eating it. Jess definitely shouldn't be eating it. She gets Lucille a frap and even if Lucille likes it she wasn't going to eat it or drink an entire frap. She had two sips and Jess drank the rest. Jess's going to get diabetes and die. I don't think she realizes it or maybe she does but she's significantly overweight. She does nothing about it. I know it's hard to diet when you're eating with two children. But not every mom out there is morbidly obese. Maybe she's not morbidly but she's definitely obese. At some point I'm going to be stuck with these kids because she kills herself from eating too much or not exercising enough. [0:09:27]</p>

<p>I don't know what her genes are. Her parents are both thinner. They're both in their 70's and seem pretty healthy so maybe she won't die. She'll just (pause). She should see my dad it's like all the pills and everything he has to take and insulin and all that. He's got to check his blood sugar every morning. He's got to eat at certain times. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he overweight? [0:10:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a bit. He's lost a lot of weight but he's got type 2 diabetes. And I don't think he's lost enough weight where the diabetes has gone away. I don't know if you ever can get rid of it. I'm not sure. (Pause) I can't say anything to her about that. That would really strike a (pause). You know Jess I'm only saying this for the best interest of the kids but you're really fat and you're going to get diabetes and die and your kids are going to miss you. Oh by the way... How do you think that would come off? [0:11:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean she knows it. I don't think it's a surprise to her but (pause) two C sections and lack of exercise will do that to you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think (pause) you're having fun thinking about it for two reasons. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Go ahead. I'm out of coffee. I should've gotten a large.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of which is how frustrating she is to you. But another of which is I think you have a hard time being confident when you're arguing or fighting with her like the thing with the kids. I think you at some level feel like she's right or it's hard for you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've given up. I mean that's happened years ago. I've given up. That's why I'm here. [0:12:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It started when Ian was born probably before then but it really didn't make a difference until Ian was born is years of getting pummeled and no matter what I say makes a difference. So at some point... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course what you say makes difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To you and me but not to her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she does not have dominion over all. I understand that she may completely discount, override, undo, disregard, quash anything you say. I understand but... [0:13:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well here's what her response would be. You know Jess you're dead set wrong and I want to see the kids today and that's it. She's going to be like well okay let's go see a mediator and set up a schedule (pause) which I don't want to do because she's been trying to do that. She brings that up every time I... Yeah, let's go pay someone money we don't have. We're paying $300.00 a month to the DOR, $400.00 something to the IRS without even knowing whether we're going into the program or not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think the reason issue—not that the money isn't an issue but it sounds like it's more so the schedule. In other words that you guys might even be able to work out a schedule on your own if that was something you wanted any part of. So the thing she kind of holds over your head there is the schedule. Does she want a schedule? [0:14:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't... I don't think... She likes the status quo. But if I were to complain about not that's what here answer would be. She's mentioned it several times like when it comes to the finances let's go see a mediator. She's said it before when I either don't think I'm seeing the kids enough or she doesn't think I'm seeing the kids enough, that's what she brings up let's go see a mediator. She's a fucking mediator herself. That's her answer to everything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But why does that always mean you lose? In other words...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because mediation is not going to... I'm not paying any child support. There's a minimum. You could be homeless and there's still a minimum child support payment and I can't afford that. [0:15:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So the thing she holds over your head in each of these instances is that there would be kind of minimum requirements in terms of child support or child care?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That I don't want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you don't want. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I like my life of Riley. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the life of Riley?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You've never heard of that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds familiar but I don't know what it means.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's a book just the life of Riley. Some guy where there were no consequences or whatever to how he lived. I think probably at the end of the book he said something bad happened to him. But I haven't read it but it's a saying living the life of Riley.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Someone who is living beyond their means or without any regard. I could Google it if you would like me to. [0:16:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that was a fine explanation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know exactly. Wikipedia would have it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing I'm most interested in is getting the gist of what you're saying which I think I now have. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anything you hold over her that you do see the kids regularly, that you do coordinate around dropping off...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything I've always done—you can go back to the first time we met, everything I did was minimized. I never do enough. I don't get credit for anything. She's got the kids. She's paying the kid to go out there and pull weeds. Ten cents the kids getting for pulling weeds. Who fucking used to pull the weeds? How did they used to not be? I never got credit for any of that. I never helped clean the house. Well who fucking took care of the yard? Who took the trash out every Thursday? [0:17:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cameron, this is important. I'm saying something different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't matter. I know. Anything I could hold over her would not be enough that she would feel any pressure from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. She depends on you for some things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know Jess I'm watching the kids seven days a week, I'm flat out at work, I'm making too much money, and she would still find some way to be well you're not doing enough. When I was working too hard and making money I was cheating on someone and I wasn't spending enough time with the kids. I was putting work before family. Now I wasn't working enough last year. So it doesn't matter what I do. She's a litigator and litigator's don't take the facts. They take the facts and they twist them to a specific point of view and that's what she does. She takes the facts and she twists them to her point of view. And she doesn't even have to think about it. It's subconscious. [0:18:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of like what I'm doing to you right now. There's no way you're going to win this argument. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The problem is (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you feel like I was being a little overbearing there because that's exactly how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You can win this argument all day if you want. You can beat me every single time. I don't really lose out there. In other words...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I know. [0:19:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're trying to make a point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm telling you that I can't win. I can't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So humor me here for a minute. What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm always trying to humor you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) You're trying to make fun of me. That's different. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Proceed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you say look Jess I can't bring the kids to the barbecue. I'm not picking Lucille up from daycare this week when you need me to because you're in court.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was nothing to do. There was nothing to have no wedge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Then fine. Look Jess if you're not going to work with me here on this and make compromises I will not be there for you when you need me to be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Back to answer number one. Okay, well then let's go to a mediator. Let's have a schedule set up. All roads lead to that. [0:20:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So that's really where your... And you don't want that no matter what it looks like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't. I don't like the kids that much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I wanted to go to a wine and cheese thing that a couple of people from E&G were getting together. And I don't want Ian this Friday (inaudible at 00:21:07) E&G thing. If I had a schedule it'd be like well I'm sorry I don't have any plans. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She would schedule a weight watchers meeting or something else. [0:21:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then in that case you are getting things out of this arrangement. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you lose out on being able to take the kids to the barbecue let's say, but you're making a compromise that you'd rather live with giving that up on one side but avoiding the schedule and having the life of Riley on the other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like my life it's so difficult to schedule. No matter what I do I try to set up okay I'm going to do this today and just whatever happens for some reason something gets in the way of that whether there's something else I need to do, I don't feel like doing it, I sleep late, I blow it off. You know it's like... I felt like yesterday I went into the office and I had all these things to do, and I really keep putting off doing some litigation work because there's no pressure for me to do. I finally called the clerk on the thing but it's like... I don't know. I try and schedule my days. I find out about a closing three days in advance. You've got to schedule it on this day. It's got to close this day. It's not like okay here's when you've got to close. And this was the difference between closing with the Bank would be like okay you've got to close it within the next two weeks. Mortgage brokers aren't like that. [0:23:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got to close on the such and such.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't have the ability to extend rate locks willy-nilly where the bank could. And that was the nice thing about the bank is that there was no pressure. Every once in a while there was this has to close by... But more often than not I had a week window a two week window sometimes to close something. A purchase, obviously, it's got to close that day, but I know well in advance what that day is. But with the loans I'm getting now and I want to be able to play handball, and I want to be able to go to the revolution games with the people from practice. I want to be able to just make last minute plans if possible. [0:24:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want to sit around the house playing words with friends and drinking whiskey; a little bit of poker. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's all your call. I can see how I'd have the wrong point of view. To me at first when I was looking at it, it didn't seem like you were getting what you wanted. It seems like she was constantly beating you down. But in fact this is actually an arrangement that gives you quite a bit of flexibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's really not such a bad deal. Although it does involve you making sacrifices and having to give things up such as a greater degree of control over what you do with the kids. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it was like that was what was upsetting to me. I had planned on spending time with the kids. I had arranged it. I had asked in advance to spend time with the kids on Sunday. I was denied removing Lucille from Jess's presence which... [0:25:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And you had ceded control to Jess over things like that in exchange for all these other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was probably something she's going to pick out of my behavior at the previous barbecue on Memorial Day when I let Ian carry Lucille off and Ian just dumped her somewhere and Lucille showed up to my mom crying. But that made my mom's life though. She doesn't see that. My mom is probably still telling people at work the story. And I'm sure my mom told Jess the story, and so now I'm forever banned from taking Lucille to a barbecue because I'm not going to pay attention to her. But the whole thing was that there was someone else there to watch her. My mom was there to play with Lucille not to hang out with my friends, drink, and eat ungodly amounts of meat which I have a feeling I'm going to be doing on Wednesday. [0:26:31]</p>

<p>(Pause) I'm going to spend the fourth of July with Tracy from the old office and her son. They were the first ones to ask me and I was just like I don't see those guys anymore. I might as well just go. It's the fourth of July. To me it's not a big holiday. No one had invited me to a party. If there were a party I would've been invited to it already. And someone asked me last night to go to the harbor and it's going to fucking rain all day anyway. There's going to be thunderstorms. It's not going to be nice weather. So I'm supposed to go swim in the pool at 2:00, and then have some barbecue around 5:00, and then watch some fireworks. From that pool, I guess, you can see the various towns around that area you can see the fireworks which is good because they're all at a relatively decent hour where I'd be at home. If I'm there I'd hate to finish up at 10:00 at night and then have to drive home at 11:00. [0:27:47]</p>

<p>(Pause) So you're saying I shouldn't be upset about it, or I'm overreacting, or that's what I've given up? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. What I'm saying is you paint yourself as having no power and being totally sort of overpowered and unfairly dealt with. And in fact the situation is not so one sided that you actually get a bunch of what you want and what really matters to you out of the arrangement with her. [0:28:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean if there was more time for me to spend with the kids during the week I would do it. She squeezed me out of picking Ian up and dropping him off on Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not telling you're doing anything wrong in how you arrange things. I'm just saying you present it as though you're left with nothing. She makes all the decisions about everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but that is because you don't want to. You don't want responsibility for a lot of the things that she's making decisions about which is okay. That's your decision. But it's not as though you couldn't have it another way if you wanted or (pause)... It's not that you couldn't have it another way it's that you want it in sort of the widest sense you're being totally overridden. In fact, you've retained quite a lot of autonomy in how you do things which is what matters the most to you. Again, I'm not taking issue with how you have arranged things. I'm just saying at least to me it seems like you often present things in a way that's sort of at odds with that. I'm not even saying you're not right pissed off at her for not letting you take the kids to the barbecue. Only that when it starts to become about how you don't have any control over anything and she calls all the shots about everything, it's because there are things about that MO that work quite well for you. [0:30:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean there is an up side. But it's not like I am living the life of Riley. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I understand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like my life is some great enjoyment. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm aware of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not telling you you're getting away with something. I'm just telling you there is a deal here that you have agreed to that you could have done differently if you wanted to. And that doesn't mean things are great are things don't really suck in a lot of ways. It's just different from how I had been looking at it, I think, because of how you presented it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) What were we talking about on Friday? I don't remember. (inaudible at 00:31:21) have some big epiphany right now and then we'll talk about that next time and we won't. Maybe I'm just misremembering. I wonder if I tried that in words with friends would that be a real word? No. Roger Clemens testifying before congress on steroids. He said I misremembered. Now I've heard it several times used as if it's a word now. [0:31:59]</p>

<p>Today I had to drive just to record something and the guy paid $35.00 if I did the title. If I didn't do the title I get $50.00. I figured they go are you going to be at that registry that day? I am now. I've got nothing else to do. I mean at the office I do have work to do. I've got to make some calls. [0:32:37]</p>

<p>(Pause). I did finally beat Barbara in words with friends although it was a technical win. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's a technical win?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The app said that it had to repair something and then when it was done the game was gone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you had been winning? </p>

<p>CLIENT: And apparently she conceded the game. She said that there was no way I was going to beat you anyways which was not my recollection but I'm not sure I had a recollection. (Pause) I found it endearing. (Pause) I think I'm pathetic. I don't know. [0:34:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of what we were talking about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That and my inability to ask this woman out and just... I don't know. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you actually want to ask her out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I've almost gotten myself to the point that I almost do it but I always bail at the last second. (Pause) Not bail but I just don't do it. I give myself enough time between the moment I feel like I'm going to do it that I say I'll do it and I never do. Oh just do it Cameron and I don't do it. [0:35:32]</p>

<p>(Pause) It's like the downside of her saying no outweighs the upside of her saying yes. I have no reason to believe she would say yes is really what's troubling me. [0:36:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why I asked if you wanted to actually ask her in the first place because (pause) I wasn't clear. (Pause) If the downside of her saying no outweighs the upside of her saying yes why would you want to ask her out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's probably not true. If she said yes that would... There's still a possibility that she could say yes out of politeness and then shut me down after saying yes. Well that was a nice dinner and everything but you're too old for me. And I'm going tell everyone on the team and you're going to be uncomfortable every time you play. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) how bad is that? [0:38:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. To me it seems bad. It's enough to prevent me from asking her. I have low self esteem. I lack self confidence. What else is there? I don't take risks (inaudible at 00:38:52). (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you enjoying the way things are with her now? [0:39:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. You guys pretty play words with friends and chat a little at practice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I work with friends with my brother and I don't even talk to him. (inaudible at 00:39:51). I keep losing. What it is, is that I can't stay focused long enough to really... I mean I just suck at it. I don't know. Maybe he's cheating because he comes up with words I'm like my brother doesn't know this word. I play this one guy who's got a PhD in biology, or chemistry, or whatever and he comes up with these crazy words, but I know he knows these words. The name of some fungi or something like that. [0:40:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because whenever he does play one of the words I Google it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess if you play it enough you learn words that other people play. You know like Scrabble where you've got to play a word and they can challenge it. It just tells you, you can't play that word so you keep trying different (inaudible at 00:41:04).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You can also by a word meter; something that tells you how good your word is. I don't know whether it means you have a better chance that there's some other word that's better that you can play out of if that's the case There's also for $2.99 you get a thing that tells you what letters are left that you can kind of figure that out in your head. [0:41:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like those (pause) $4.00. You can't spend $4.00. I totally misguided how much money I had coming in to how much is going out. (Pause) I don't have any money. The life insurance is going to end on the fifth. Maybe on the sixth (inaudible at 00:42:45).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're pretty nervous about asking her out huh? [0:42:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am. Yes. I've never been so (inaudible at 00:42:56). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would put it like that. It seems like it's hard to talk about. Like you're (pause) much quicker to list out the reasons you're going to give up on it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Why I should go out with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well than to think about what's going on with that. What makes it so difficult. (Pause) We have to stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is your little recorder not working? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's better to do it on that because if I put the phone in airplane mode so it doesn't ring then people can't actually leave messages otherwise it rings, otherwise the phone calls just interrupt the recording so it's better to do it on that. See you on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't blow your fingers off. [0:44:06]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, [PATIENT NAME] what brings you in today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I needed to get an evaluation done for court.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For Court?  And, um, the referral says that you haven't been able to see your son in 2 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you divorce or something or separate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we were together for 8 years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, it was an abusive relationship, so it was good that I got out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, the reason I got out of it when I did, it was all right when it was just me, but I didn't want my child being raised in that kind of atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And you have only the 1 child?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One child who I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your child's name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	His name is [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And does he use your last name or his father's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's his father's last name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's [AGE], he will be [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, evidently, you lost custody of this child?  What happened exactly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The thing was, after I had children, I realized, um, instead of getting post partum depression like a lot of women do, I go the other way.  I go into like extreme anxiety.  They call it like a manic episode.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I was in, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, after the birth of him you had like an anxiety, a manic episode?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you had those before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not to that extreme, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, what happened?  Did they hospitalize you or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where did they do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, how long were you there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two and a half weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then I guess they had you on medication hen you left?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you do follow up at all with anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are you still on the medication they started you on, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I had went off it but now I'm back on it, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you go off with the doctor's permission or just stopped it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you'd never been really severely depressed?  It just goes mainly to abnormally high?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have been severely depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?  Okay.  When was your last depression?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	August of 2006 and that's the last time I seen my son and that's why I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you had custody up until August of '06?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had joint custody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because what happened, we had broke up when I went into the hospital when I had that manic episode—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we lived in a house together and then life just got involved, so, when it was time for him to be placed back into the home, I wasn't living there at the time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was the best interest of [NAME OTHER] to have [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you gave custody to his dad or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, to have, because it was a more stable environment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they didn't let you see him for the last 2 years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, because I went into that depression that I was telling you about—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I ended up getting pregnant with my daughter, she's [AGE] now, and when I got pregnant, I seemed to like level off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, and I was bringing it to court.  What they were worried about was after I had her, that I would either get depressed or manic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or manic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I did end up going into a manic cycle, but it wasn't as bad as with [NAME OTHER], but I ended up going back on medication at that time after I had my daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you did that on your own, you figured you needed it, and you went in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Going to the guidance center.  I started going there in February of '07 so after I had [NAME OTHER] I started where I wasn't sleeping, I was cleaning a lot and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, now what meds are you on now that helped with this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How much of that are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A thousand mg at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that the extended release, the ER 500 or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just regular Depakote?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Regular, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and what else do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, Zyprexa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how much of that do you take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Five mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Once a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and that's it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and who prescribes that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [DEIDENTIFIED], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine, all right.  You're compliant with meds, she's happy with you, you're happy with yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I go there for therapy also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is your daughter residing now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's, uh, she's with me and my fiance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now, you're petitioning to the court for joint custody again, is that what you said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, unsupervised visitation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you had supervised visitation with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just started 2 weeks ago.  They let me have that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it was brought to court.  I have the paperwork if you want to see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they gave me 30 days to get a psychiatric evaluation done so this way I could, uh, resume my supervised visits.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So, how many supervised visits have you had with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And who is the social worker supervising?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], I'm thinking?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And now, everything is going well and you're petitioning for unsupervised.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Unsupervised.  Yeah, they said, um, because you figure, I haven't seen him in 2 years, I was, you know a little nervous about seeing him but they said that it was like I just seen him yesterday.  He, you know, warmed up to me really good and we were playing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what did you say, why, what did his dad say why you couldn't see him?  Were you ill?  Did you tell him you'd been ill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's, I don't know what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's what I, if he ever asked me, that's what I would tell him, I was ill and mommy had to get better before she could have visits with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, [NAME OTHER], does he want to see you unsupervised with your fiance and his sister or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I had, he had met my fiance before and he used to enjoy coming and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I told him he had a little sister and he seemed excited about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, once you have, I guess, unsupervised visits, would you go for joint custody again, or are you going to leave custody with your ex—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was also always primary cus, cus, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Custodian?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Custodial and I was second custodial so it's still worded that way in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was done because, at your request, at his request, or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I had requested that because, like I said, I had to move out and I wasn't in a stable environment.  I was living with a girlfriend and I was, I mean, and now I live in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was he your husband at the time or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fiance.  We never got married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You certainly seem pretty much in control of yourself today and okay.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.  I've come a long way.  Because like I said I was like real anxious where I would talk real fast and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't sleeping.  I sleep well now, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often do you see the psychiatrist at the guidance center?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was every 2 weeks for a while and now it's once a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And they're happy, I guess they're happy with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said, I know I have an illness and I need to treat it and I got to be healthy so I can be a good mother to my children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The fact that it's an illness that can be transmitted genetically, too, you have to watch your children.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, because they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had mentioned that in court, too, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're not going to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have a 1 in 4 chance of getting bipolar disease.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your family, did—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mom was bipolar?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because sometime she goes, uh, she gets real anxious but she won't admit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Never diagnosed, but just a little intense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was um, I guess right before I was born a couple years, she was admitted into a psychiatric place for a few weeks, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's either depression, what did she tell you it was about, was she sad or depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, she said it was because she was leaving her first husband, thought there was something wrong with her so he put her in there, but I think she has bipolar.  To be honest with you.  I don't see the depression—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It usually runs in families.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I see, you know, but I'm not going to, you know, I'm not a doctor.  I'm, I can't diagnose her, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm just looking for a minute.  I mean, you know they didn't give me an initial paper just have them send it in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, um, like I said, while my son was with me, he, um, when I did have my visits before, he never got hurt or anything like that.  I was, you know, he always was happy and I made sure he was safe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll just look a minute.  [NAME OTHER], can I have an initial, um, form —</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Page?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, page.</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks.  I just noticed they didn't put an initial page of any, of all your identifying information, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a court order, if you need to read what I actually need.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, I want to see the court order, of course.  I'll have her make a copy of this so I have it, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I figured that would be a good thing to bring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, they already began the supervised visits, so they just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because they were going solely on how I am with my daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Okay.  Oh, and would you make a copy of this court order, please?</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, um, when I went to [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After I had my daughter, they, um, it's like a routine, they call [DEIDENTIFIED] in so [DEIDENTIFIED] did like check us out, you know, and gave us services I guess for a while, for, um, about 5 or 6 months they would stop over and they wrote a letter that they felt there was no abuse or neglect and like so they were making sure that I was going to therapy and I was taking my medicine because I get blood work done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Make sure my liver's okay on account of the Depakote, I guess?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they have to recheck it all the time.  Uh, do you have any middle name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME].  Is it one word, or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's supposed to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  And it's [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME], okay.  All right, and what's your current address?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED], I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your phone number there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].  Uh, your birth date?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how old are you now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, social security?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And where were you born?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As soon as he copies that, we'll get it to see exactly how, what the wording has to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know what's funny, because when I was coming to you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What, 18 years ago, you did diagnose me with manic depressive, which, that's now, they call it bipolar, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bipolar disorder, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  So you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No one believed me then, what happened?  No one followed up with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, you put me on medicine for a little while and then the case got closed and then I was okay for a few years and I guess when you get older, it gets worse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, with any type of bipolar depressive illness you want to treat it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you don't' treat it, what happens is the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It goes in dormant—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Illness will become worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it gets more intense and each time it gets more intense, the moods are higher, the downs are lower.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they'll come more quickly.  The more you can flatten it out and treat it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More likely you'll have many good years where you're comfortable and you may not need a lot of medication, but you need something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Because like I said, they took me off of it for a while and I was okay—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For a good year, year and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I was, you know, getting a little antsy and then it really, like you said slammed down, where I couldn't do anything, couldn't think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to let a depression go untreated, and this is the reason.  All the new studies show that there's an area of the brain called the hippocampus, it's good for recent memory.  If you don't treat depression, it starts losing cells and you'll find your recent memory is poor.  And it won't come back.  It'll get poorer and poorer and poorer with each depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, my.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you definitely want to treat it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And just, you know, stay comfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It does seem like part of your brain, like you said, just shuts down.  It's confusing just to get ready in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, it could be a major effort to get out of bed when you don't want to and sometimes people don't eat, you know.  Then it can shift into high gear sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something like is happening to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When it first starts shifting into high gear, people like it, because you feel good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you need people around you who can sort of let you know you're going too far that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And listen to them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if anything, you know what ends up happening, oh, you're doing better!</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get too better—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, too better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They start walking out of the room and don't want to deal with you, you know you're going too fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They'll leave.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the thing.  I would answer people before they finished their sentence because my mind was just going so fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It speeds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can be a benefit, I have some very wealthy manic depressive patients, but they use it in terms of business deals and things, but they have people around them who sort of let them know they're going to far to the left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You can get yourself into trouble because I know, one thing I was doing, in between like Comcast with their triple play thing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, Verizon and I was bouncing back and forth because, like my phone wasn't working one day so I would cancel it and go with the other people and then it wasn't working there, so I'd go back and next thing, my bill ended up being so off the charts.  And it took a year to get it straightened out.  It did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I had one patient once who spent $150,000 in 10 minutes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And regretted it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, eh, you have to be careful.  Um, any allergies to anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Penicillin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Penicillin.  Any physical illness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, Wellbutrin?  What happens with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I was quit, well how many years ago was it?  I broke out in hives because I was trying to quit smoking.  So, it was a generic for Zyban.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you could get it as an antidepressant but they wouldn't give it to you for cigarettes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I remember that.  Any physical illnesses, hypertension, asthma, physically pretty healthy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I was pregnant with my son, um, I had high blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they make you go on bedrest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  But they were sure, they induced my labor with my daughter because they were afraid I was going to go on high blood pressure again.  And then I had gained weight and since I gained weight, it was a little high for, they were watching it but now, I lost some weight and I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let me see how far they come along with the copy of that court order.  How far along are in the copy of the court order?  Hello?  Can you buzz me when you get off line please?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think the reason they took me off the, of my medicine, and this is what I just figured what was doing, is because it was after I had my son, I went to that manic stage and they said the same thing with my daughter, I don't know if it's hormonal or if that just helped trigger it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, any type of stress on the body, and of course you can have hormone changes after pregnancy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any type of cortisone level changes can, it makes you more unstable.  Every one has cortisone levels that change every day with weather and things, but if you're bipolar, you're a little more sensitive and sometimes it will trigger you and send you for a cycle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, and I said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Usually people go depressed but, like I said, I go the other way, I don't know.  And I guess I should [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they usually they get psychotic depression.  You got psychotic mania.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I get overly happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>NR:</b>	Sorry about that, I was the phone.  I'm just now done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay fine, thanks.  Well, as you appear today, you appear pretty intact so I don't think there's a problem, as long as you're on medications—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  I take my medicines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're see the doctor regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm not going off it because I don't, I don't enjoy being depressed and like I said, like you said when you go in the manic stage it is like you feel like, you said, a natural high, but it's not worth it at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, because what follows is usually a major depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that didn't happen because I got medicated, thank God.  But you get overtired too from it because you're not sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You think you're doing a lot of good, but then it takes you a lot of time to clear up the mess you made.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I had an older patient, she was [AGE], a very famous songwriter and she's bipolar and, uh, she made a lot of money writing jingles over the years, and she was good at it.  But as she got older, she was retired and every time she got ill, it started costing her a fortune to go in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she said to me I just can't afford this illness any more.  She says I, I said well take your medicine regularly.  She said well I finally realized I have to do that, but it took me all my life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because it does slow you down, it does make you a little drowsy and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, then you should talk with the doctor so they can fine tune it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you really, depending on the season, you may need a little more, a little less, but you should always let him know how you're doing and what the effect is so they can change it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?  Because most of them will work with you.  The goal is to have a nice life and to be in the mid range and be comfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I heard Robin Williams has bipolar and look at him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no doubt.  You can tell.  You can tell—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And also, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the stigma with this illness, because everything, like with the media and everything, oh, they got a mental illness or this or that.  Like I said, I think that's why the courts are so hard on people because of that, you hear all these—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they see the worst case scenarios usually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't see my millionaire bipolar patients.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They do very well.  Thanks, [NAME OTHER].  Well, it's always bipolar who, though you'll see kill themselves or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kill somebody else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the highway and hitting another car, or the people are going too fast so they act up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And those make the headlines, but I would say most of my bipolar patients, they're well controlled most of the time.  They do well, they're comfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's, that's what, like my other doctor said, you're controlled bipolar patients, not like, you're not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Diagnosed or you're not taking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not psychotic, you're under control, keep using meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's always the suspicion thought that you won't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What won't?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that you'll say ah, I'm not taking this medicine and you're in trouble again, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said, I'm not going to risk—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got to think, I got other people to think about now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm sure that if you get to that condition, [NAME OTHER]'s father is going to see it or your fiance is going to see it, so somebody's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Going to block it.  All right, they want to know if you're stable enough to continue visiting with minor child.  And evidently you have been and things are going well and you're compliant with medications.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I said, everything was okay with me visiting [NAME OTHER], until I met my fiance now that I have a daughter with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay that's the father of your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, my son's father had a problem with me, I guess, moving on, but I didn't meet him until 2 1/2 years after we broke up.  It wasn't like I just jumped into one relationship to another.  And he was making things difficult with me visiting [NAME OTHER] and that's when he started, he really used this like bipolar card in his corner a lot, you  know?  She's got mental illness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most patients will, but as long as you take your medicine and you're compliant and you're doing well and your psychiatrist says you're doing well and the social workers say it, they won't give you a hard time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, if you're bipolar mentally ill, as long as you're under control, you have legal rights to have, as anyone else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, that's what I was saying, if everybody that had a mental illness couldn't see their kids, it would be a childless society.  Or parentless society.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, there's some doctors, you know, that most people must have some mental illness of some sort.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To keep having kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you know, everyone has certain quirks, but, um, as long as it's managed, that's not a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's when it's unmanaged and you're uncooperative, that's when it'll give you the problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it did teach me a lot.  I feel privileged to have children.  It's not a right, because like you said, they can take them away from you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so I really value my children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you have the 2, a boy and little girl.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my daughter's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, who is your attorney, [NAME OTHER] who works up here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, um, both of my children were on heart and lung monitors also, because I had a child on it, remember that far back, uh, I had a son that died from sudden infant death syndrome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was your first child, or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's when I went into a depression state after I had him.  And that's why I was hospitalized in 1990 and that's when I came to see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you see me for an accident or for the bipolar disorder?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was for, it was for the accident because my lawyer got me in to see you, but I came to you after I was in the hospital, I guess for depression, after my son passed away.  So that was 1990.  And that's when you diagnosed me with them.  And I even remember the medicine you put me on.  It was Buspar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And Adapin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Adapin was an old antidepressant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Buspar was for anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And did I diagnose you with having bipolar and you not give you, were you stabilized at that point?  Or did we just preliminarily started with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You started me with that.  And I was, I guess, manic depressive you said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it work, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But then I was, this is where I'm thinking that now, too.  I was on birth control pills at that time, too—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think that might have helped me, my uh, even out a little bit, too because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the hormones.  And I haven't been taking them since 2000 and that's when I started having problems, like a year after.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I'm getting ready to go back on birth control pills next month.  That's, that's what I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'll stability a lot of problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm going to still take my medicine but I think that will help me, too.  I'm not going to get a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Please do, because the court's bound to be contingent on the part that you stay on your medications, see your doctor, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, definitely, definitely.  But I think that'll help me more because I notice around that time of the month, I do get a little emotional, like crying and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You should tell the psychiatrist you're seeing at [DEIDENTIFIED] that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe he can give you a little extra, um, usually an antipsychotic or even a diuretic can help at that time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because sometime the brain retains fluid, it gets irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need to get the fluid out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll follow up.  Because I just started getting it after my daughter [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I will dictate a report and, uh, as far as I'm concerned, as long as you see your doctor and you're on meds, you're fine, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm not going off my meds this time because I know, because I think that's why took me off it before they thought it was more of a hormonal thing and I was doing well, but they always told me if I felt like I was going either way, up or down, to go back and then I ended up doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] now is [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll be [AGE] on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right, well, thanks for coming in.  And thanks for participating in the study.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  That was painless.  So, I'll get a good report?  I'll be able to see my son?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, as long as you comply with your doctor's recommendations and your medication, I don't see any problems seeing him, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I got to think of my little girl having a healthy mom and so does my son need a healthy mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, like I said for me to go in the hospital and leave my daughter, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's so attached to me now, too.  I wouldn't want it to get to her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to be healthy for her, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got to be healthy for her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is she now, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[AGE], okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, be well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks for coming in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good seeing you again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bye bye, same here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bye.</p>

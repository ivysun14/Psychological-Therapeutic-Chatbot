<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And thank you very much for contributing to the research.  And I'm very glad to see you.  It sounds like there's been a lot going on recently.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, tell me what's been happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I just moved out of my house.  Last week I sold my house finally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh you moved out, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my ex moved out like, he moved in November.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Is he the person I had spoken with in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, so you guys are, are done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  I had him move out like a year ago and then, um, I just sold my house and I just moved out, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Where are you living now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm living with my sister right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Until I buy a house, but, um, I just have to get him to sign over my settlement check.  He came and took my dogs, like a couple months ago.  Before that, they're my, like my 2 puppies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I let him see them whenever he wanted.  I let him come and take them for the weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I was at work like 5 months ago, and took them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Amongst other things like all my furniture, things that were mine, must mine, my Dad's ring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All my Dad's things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you didn't marry that guy if he could do something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the cops can't do anything about my dogs.  I have to go to court.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, how awful.  What about the ring and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They say that it's a civil matter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My Mom bought me another dog, but not as a replacement dog, just, you know, to buy me a dog and he's like well your Mom spent $1,500 on a dog, um, to replace the other two.  I said no, it's just because, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're not interchangeable.  They're individuals.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know how you could do that to dogs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No or yeah, to anybody.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mentioned that you and your Mom had sort of had some rocky times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  When we were moving.  I mean it's hard on her too because the house was in her name, but, um, she's since then apologized, but I just don't know how you could say things like that to your daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kinds of things was she saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she just out of nowhere, we were moving stuff out of my house, and, um, it was over like a, I had a yard sale and she was having some, someone from church coming to pick up my daybed, and I said, you know, someone was going to buy it from me for $30 the whole thing.  She was like well I'm just going to give it to the person from church.  So it was like an argument over $30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's like it's just $30 and she went downstairs and she somehow blurted out and called me a nigger loving lesbian.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whoa.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How bizarre.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because the, uh, guy that I'm seeing is a doctor here and he's black.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know she doesn't like it, but to say things like that to me, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where did lesbian come from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How odd?  That almost sounds like a Tourette's kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My Mom doesn't talk, my Mom doesn't curse.  My Mom doesn't, she doesn't talk like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I know she has strong feelings about the racial thing, but she doesn't talk like that.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How strange.  That almost sounds like it's disconnected from reality like a Tourette's like thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  Like she gets angry like that, she doesn't talk like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So you're dating a physician?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  What's he like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, really busy.  Him and his brother both work here, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Neurologist and a transplant doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And his brother.  They're twins, so they're—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They live in New York and [INAUDIBLE] so I get to see him a couple of times a week, but I've been seeing him for almost a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, do you think it could be serious or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Yeah, you don't have to rush into anything, but it just sounds like he's someone smart, nice.  You know, as long as he treats you well, that's what you deserve after what you've been through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And since then my Mom apologized or tried to, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know like if you can take things back that you say like that, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Unless it's just like, I mean it almost sounds like a tic or quirk or some weird thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but she kept going on about it.  She like dug it in further and throughout the rest of the day.  I just couldn't believe that she kept doing it like, I don't know like I couldn't even breathe, I was crying.  She just kept yelling things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's strange.  Gosh.  That's too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she, I think she apologized, but, uh, I told her like I tell her so much.  My sister doesn't tell her anything, and I could just not tell her things and lie to her and make her think that, you know, I do everything she wants me to, but that's not a problem I have with her.  I try to do too much that she wants me to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I told her I was tell, stop telling her things if she, you know, can't accept things when I don't do it her way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What were her thoughts about your ex fiancé?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Liked him up until the whole breakup and everything he's doing now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So she sees it makes sense that, that you decided not to stay with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's good at least.  Well it sounds like your sister doesn't talk to your Mom much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have they had incidents like this before themselves?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, my sister never talked to my Mom really.  Um, I mean just regular conversation.  She was close to my Dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she resents my Mom a lot for making me scared of my Dad, and not letting us make our own opinions of him.  So she has a lot of resentment towards my Mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I've always been close to my Mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you did care a lot for your Dad too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you and he ended up having a close relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, there's so much going on.  Do you feel pretty well, like emotionally supported by your sister?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know.  She is the same way as my Mom, just like judges me because she's never done anything.  She's never left home like to go to college.  She's never done anything like that.  So she doesn't really talk much—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's she doing now, um, in terms of a career?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she left her job when my Dad was sick.  Now she's working, um, organizing like home care for people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for her.  And it sounds like you're on a hiatus from work right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, this week I took off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what's been happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it started like with the house stuff and all the stress, I would come to work and couldn't even be, you know, at my desk around so many people because they would ask me and my boss just said, you know, like people talk to me because I'm very open, they'll ask me how things are going and I just can't keep it together and be there.  So I'd get sent home.  And she just told me after all this it's better to just take off the week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Do you feel like it's been helpful to be off for a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel like you'll be ready to start back?  Are they going to have you start back on Monday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I told them I want to come back, but I think I'll be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, tell me what things are like in terms of the day to day routine at the office?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, my, my job no one else does when I'm out.  There's like a lot of pressure to keep like do it all before I go out, but, um, I'm just laying around a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it like, um, helping to get patients ready for their appointments?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I do mostly stuff for the doctors, the radiologists downstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] signed and different stuff like don't like deal with patients too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it sounds like they really value your organizational skills and.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.  Has it been a good place to work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Overall.  That's good because I remember how miserable it was with that awful—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, boy oh boy.  Yeah.  I think sometimes having a routine can be a good thing because it seems like so many things are up in the air right now.  What would be your ideal living situation if you could choose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I can't live with my Mom.  I can't.  That may be best for me until I buy a house, but and I can't live at my Dad's house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I could buy a house, a small one, but I don't know in the meantime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think you might, um, prefer to live with a roommate or with other people or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably by myself because I'm depending too much on other people right now.  I'd rather be by myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel lonely by yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, because I'm usually not at home.  I usually go out [INAUDIBLE] with people, but I want to get away from like living with someone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to depend on them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  If you need to talk with someone, who do you usually turn to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, my friend [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so has her been pretty supportive through all this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's her living situation right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she's living with her uncle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Would [NAME OTHER] ever be someone you'd consider living with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  She's in nursing school, so she's, you know, she can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's really cutting down on expenses.  Yeah.  Do you have any leads on places to live?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I was looking a few months ago, but I just stopped.  I was waiting until the house sold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.  Well it sounds like at least you and your sister get along enough so that you can look around a little bit and really try to make a good decision.  That's a lot of change.  You're missing your dogs, you know.  It's got to be tough to kind of know like what the circumstances are when you're going to be talking to your ex fiancé because the dogs are still a question, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He doesn't think they are.  He thinks I'm just going to somehow forget about them.  It won't happen, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gosh.  Do you think he's like trying to keep you involved with him somehow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he's been very spiteful or he's done has been spiteful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's awful.  With all that's going on, do you feel any sense of relief that he's not, you know, that you're not engaged to him anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good at least.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was a big loss.  I lost $90,000 from the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] it's worth it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's almost like what price freedom.  Had you married him, it would be so much harder to get out of it too.  So, still it's hard, and of course, you love your dogs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.  You want to be able to see, now is he offering for you to see them at all or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that's what we were doing.  They were at my house.  He could take them when he wanted to and he just came and took them and disappeared.  I could not call him, could not do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's awful.  I'm shocked.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last time I talked to him, I've only talked to him once between then and now, and I was asking about them.  He was just very smug and likes to joke when I talk about it, and he was like oh, I sold them.  Now they're on a farm somewhere and just like laughing about it like it's funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He totally negates your feelings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  It's tough because he doesn't deserve the attention.  He doesn't deserve to get a rise out of you, but these are living creatures.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's when he came to my house to get some stuff and I, you know, like he was running around getting stuff and I was like why am I following him around, but I was like begging for my dogs back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, he, I'm sure, just loved that, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Yeah, he still wants to have some kind of power over you any way he can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he doesn't deserve it at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He won't sign my car over to me.  He took my one car because the one was in his name, the one I have.  Like my other car, it was paid off.  I paid for it, but they're both in his name.  So, it's been in his name for almost a year.  I said you're liable if I get in an accident.  I don't know why you won't just sign it over, can't get it registered, can't get it inspected.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, man.  It's one of those control things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you saw signs of that a long time ago.  Wow.  Well I guess he is liable for, yeah, I mean what happens like if you need to get inspected or what happens if you get pulled over or something.  Wow.  It's pretty complicated.  Wow.  How are you holding up with all this?  I mean I'd be tearful too.  Are you able to sleep?  Are you able to eat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I try [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] it's been like one thing after another.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But they're all like, you know, like big things like work knows that it's really happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's like every time, you know, I'd get back to work and something else happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happens?  What kind of things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.  I can't think right now because I've been back on track, but um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it mostly work related stuff that's been happening or is it not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's outside of work, but it affects work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, pulling stuff and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I do my work when I'm here, but it's stuff outside of work that affects work and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things with my car, and other things.  Mostly all related to the house and the relationship.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Boy, you're in a really tough spot.  What a creep to make you have to give up the dogs too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because like I'm sure in some ways you'd like to get a restraining order against him—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And just not have to have any contact, contact, but then, you know, he's basically holding your dogs hostage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that stinks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that I don't want to see you for the next 10 years, but he could go get them up my Mom's.  We've been doing.  My brother in law will pick them up like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just has to work with my dogs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  There's nothing logical about this.  It's just spiteful, mean controlling stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's awful.  And with the car thing, is there any way you can just stop driving that car?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I won't have a car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah because I'm sure, you know, financially you're in a tough spot now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got the checks at my house because I put so much down on my house that there was a lot of profit that was mine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean just to go out and buy a new car on top of the house just because he won't sign my car over.  Another car that he had, I put $11,000 down on [INAUDIBLE] for a year and yeah, there was a lot in his name, but he [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's so awful, and you know, part of him would probably be thrilled if you lost your job over this too like to try to make you as dependent as possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On whatever he decides to do.  The more you can distance yourself.  The dog thing is tough.  What kind of recourse do you have with that?  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't believe how hard it is to get, to get them back.  Like I just can't go get them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Yeah, and they say something like this is a civil matter.  So, how is that so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I had to file court papers.  So then he'll get served with them and then I have to go to court and [INAUDIBLE] my dogs and how I'm going to prove that they're mine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like mostly everything when I took them to the vet, I used his last name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, bummer.  What's the new dog like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she's great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, a little toy Maltese.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I love Maltese.  They're so cute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is so cute.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, at least there's a bright spot, you know, in terms of somebody sweet and, wow.  And your Mom got you the dog.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How did that come about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she just said when she felt bad, you know, about the dogs.  She was like, you know, she knew like it was hard for me not to have my dogs, but she's like, you know, I'll get you another dog and at that point, she kind of wasn't sure if it was worth it to just let it go because of the fight to go through with [NAME OTHER] and I'm not worth dealing with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she'd never tell me just, you know, forget about him, but she's like, I don't know, you know, what we need to do, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I saw her in a pet store and she took off work the next day and she got it for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, she's great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She really cares about you even though it is, what she said, it's hard to forgive.  You might even be able to forgive.  It's hard to forget.  It just sounds like she had like this period of several hours where she was just ballistic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Because the main thing is, I mean any parent who steps back and takes a deep breath, if someone helps make your child happy, you're glad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're glad they're in their life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, and I'm sorry if she is [INAUDIBLE] on prejudice, I'm glad that you're not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because, you know, that could be a whole group of people you'd never get to know otherwise, and it's also when someone is acting as awful as your ex, just to know there are nice men out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, maybe you won't marry this guy, maybe you will, but there are decent guys out there, you know, people with plans and brains, and you know, who aren't putting all their energy into being spiteful towards somebody.  Wow.  Well, yeah, I mean I think getting as free as possible from him is going to be important, as, as little financial dependence as possible while still it's going to take some time with the court papers with the dogs, you know.  I mean in the meantime you have somebody of your own to raise that nobody else is going to lay claim to, but it's not the same.  It's not like that's interchangeable.  He should know better than that, and if he doesn't, then he's really got a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  That's what I said.  I said I feel they're even with you if you think that I could forget about them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He tried to claim neglect because the one, um, the little Chihuahua, that he was gaining weight when we were together and he had a bad leg, so the vet said, you know, because I had pet insurance for them and everything and I used to take them all the time.  The vet said he needs to lose weight.  So we put him on a diet the same way the vet said, um, because of his leg.  And it just so happened to be that, you know, in that time, I had [NAME OTHER] move out and, you know, so the next time I ever saw the dogs, you know, they were on the same diet.  [NAME OTHER] had lost weight, so he claimed I was beating him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh come on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, you know, he's like I'll tell them you neglect them.  I said take them to the vet—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it'll be on the papers from the vet that said he was on a diet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  If you were following medical recommendations, and that's hard because you like to spoil your dogs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, to, to have to be strict about a diet, that takes a lot of devotion.  It really does.  Hmm, he's someone who's determined to twist things if he can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're doing the right thing, you know.  And if it seems like work is starting to seem like a lot to handle, I mean even going back part time could be possible.  I could write a letter.  You know, whatever you need to do.  Do you feel like the medicine is helping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, like I said, it was like too much, like I can't [INAUDIBLE] then there's one problem, there's something else, and I feel bad complaining because everyone deals with things, but it's just too big for me to handle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well this is a lot.  Yeah, I mean he is a wild card.  You know, it's hard to know what he's going to pull next.  I guess he's pretty much done what he could do unless you think he might show up and take the other car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That stinks.  What would help you get through?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just a new start.  I don't know.  Just so many people know like, you know, that so much is going on so I come into work all the time having everyone, you know, ask me or a lot of things I have to settle like or during, you know, work times or try to leave a lunch break for the court, for the papers and do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I want it over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And maybe it could be that, you know, looking at a part time, you know, you'd still be able to do some of the things that you do, but also be able to get some things done during business hours, which you don't really have any choice.  You know, that's when court is open or whatever needs to be done.  Do you think your ex harbors hopes of getting back together with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not anymore.  I think he knows that not now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because if I had moved out, I didn't attempt to speak with him or anything but being civil.  He just wants to make everything worse for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that really stinks.  Under this much stress, it could be reasonable to increase the medication and then give you some flexibility to work with like the Zoloft, it's 100 mg a day.  If I wrote for twice a day, you could take 1 and a half for a while if you need to.  You know, some people go up to 200, that's okay.  Um, the Seroquel, you can probably take 1 or 2 a day if you think it might be helpful.  Do you usually end up taking 2 or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, usually just 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it is nice to have that flexibility into 25.  It does come in 50 now, um, but sometimes it's nice to have control over, you know, being able to increase if you need to and the Xanax, that's like every 4 to 6 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll write you new prescriptions just in case some of the old ones are looking like they might expire of something like that.  Um, or I could call them in if that's easier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can call them in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To the pharmacy.  Okay, yeah, then you can pick them up.  That will be no problem at all.  So I'll increase the Zoloft and then you could do 1 and a half or 2.  You know, especially if you're having trouble sleeping on a regular schedule, tearfulness really getting in the way.  You're just under so much stress right now, and your body produces serotonin to help deal with stress, but when you're under so much stress, it soaks it up right away, and the Zoloft, it helps to slow down your body soaking it up, so a little more in a kind of stress is certainly reasonable.  And you know if our appointments, if coming during lunch break is helpful, or sometimes, you know, if you feel like you just need to touch base, I can usually find a space between a couple of appointments.  We could touch base or I can write a letter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] pressure from everywhere, my Mom and work because everything that's been going on is affecting work, so then like at the, you know, [INAUDIBLE] and they are great down there, you know.  They say all the time how are you and they know what's going on and my boss is great with that, but at the same time, you got to be fair to everyone else.  Everyone else has lives too, so then it's even more pressure, you know, feeling like I have to make sure nothing happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, there's only so much you can control and sometimes it's a question of you may be pretty much the only person who does what you do, but it might be better for you to be able to do it for a couple of hours a day than either go from, you know, a couple of days of full time and just be burnt out and then need to take some time off.  I mean either way.  I bet they'll be glad whatever you try and do.  There needs to be a way to set some parameters and also so that people aren't asking you all the time.  It's like you really need to be able to, to focus when you're at work also.  And get into a routine as much as you can because so much else doesn't seem routine I'm sure.  What's the pressure that's coming from your Mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she was going to do so much, well dealing with so much, do everything the way she wants me to and work especially.  She's like constantly is like checking on me at work.  I told her that she needs to stay out of my job.  So nothing's like, I never once had like some stupid excuse for work.  It's, you know, been all things that they've had, you know, documented proof I talked to my boss and, you know, after work, she's seen the things that have happened and I'm just like nothing's good enough.  Like you get in a car accident, she'd still be like why weren't you at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're a grown woman.  I mean it's between you and your boss.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't need her overseeing things.  Is she also pressuring you to break up with the guy you're seeing or get your place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She tells me she'll never, she'll never accept it.  We never bring it around her, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's too bad because right now you could just use some support.  Having a nice friend is critical, male, female, whoever it is, you know.  Hopefully this guy doesn't judge you.  He just is, you know, he appreciates you for who you are.  And it also sounds like okay, he's busy.  He's probably not putting tons of smothering demands on you I hope.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Yeah, instead of someone who's just you can't even breathe or they're calling you at work all the time or something.  Yeah, because I remember your ex, you know, he tried to push the boundaries and called me and asked me for information, and I'm no, this is confidential.  I don't have a release of information to talk to you.  I'm not going to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.  That's not, and the same goes for your Mom, you know.  If she, if she wants to know something, she needs to ask you and you'll tell her what you want her to know, you know and that's it.  Is there more that I could do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well especially, you know, you're here on campus, you know, call.  If you need to touch base at the end of the day, lunch break, anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I can find some time and we can work with the medicines.  You know, you're very familiar with these.  You know, you've used them for a long time.  You've done a fantastic job of staying in shape, you know.  And just to find a routine for yourself when there's just this wild card, and when you're free of him, you know, it's going to feel so good, but it's going to take a while to really believe it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and the thing is he's going to find somebody else to victimize.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, unless he decides to get himself some help, which for his own sake I hope he does, but, you know, you do need a fresh start.  You need to be able to move on regardless of what he does, but you want to see your dogs and I want you to also.  It may be possibly, depending how things go with court and how slowly things are going, they may be some animal rights that could help you too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or have some ideas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just can't believe how hard it is to get them back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well I think going through this whole process is important, and what I'm hoping is at some point, they'll be inconvenient for him, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean last time he brought them over, they're staying with someone that he knows like, he's staying with some girl and [NAME OTHER] like, I was like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just hard knowing like where they are and that [NAME OTHER] takes care of them.  This is my new one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so cute.  Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's precious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your dog's name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her name's Lily.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lily, that's so pretty, little white Lily.  Oh, she's gorgeous.  Congratulations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you like to try to set up another appointment now or wait and see how your schedule goes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we can do it now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What do you think would be good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, like a lunch time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, let's see what I've got.  We could do, let me take a look.  What time are you usually done with work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, 3:45.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to go, do you want to plan next Tuesday after work.  Here's what happened.  I had a 3:30 and a 4:30 both cancel—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a 5:30 and a 6:30 coming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So there's a window there.  I'm going to pencil you in, you know, whenever you get here.  I'll put it down around 4:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then, you know, you could just stop up.  We can touch base with how things are going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your medication supply right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I think I'm usually like the 9th, 10th I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, so I may not get to call this in until the end of the day, but I'll be sure that I do.  All right, do you want me to give you with next Tuesday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four written down.  Sure and I'll leave my voicemail on there.  And you know they can page me from here any time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Can I either pay for today on Tuesday or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh sure, no rush.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I know money's up in the air right now.  So don't even worry about it.  All right, I'm really glad you made it in.  And this is going to pass.  You know, just remind yourself there are nice men out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's going to get out of your hair.  He's going to find somebody else to bug, and you're going to get your dogs back.  It may take a while, but your cause is justified.  I mean even if we called [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, they'd know how to make his life pretty miserable, so he doesn't know who he's up against.  So, it's like calling out the National Guard if you need to.  So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But the way that he is now, he just thinks it's nothing.  It makes me want to, I mean my dogs enough reason for me to, you know, get them back from him, but he doesn't think that I'm going to get them back.  He really thinks [INAUDIBLE] I'm never going to see them again, and I told him that he's wrong and he laughs about it and he thinks it's funny like I just laugh that he could really think that he can take my dogs, take things from me and just walk away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if there's anything I can do, you know, write a letter for the court or whatever.  I mean the whole time I've known you, your dogs were like your children.  That's how you've treated them.  You have taken them to the vet.  The vet can vouch for that.  You're not making anything up.  So and that's definitely going to make a difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  That's what [INAUDIBLE] he's going to look terrible in front of a judge like how he could do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly and maybe he'll realize it and, you know, you won't even have to get that last step to court, but he might push the envelope as long as he can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he tried to say, he was like oh, you don't have receipt.  And the one he bought me for Christmas, but a gift you don't take back, and you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he put him in my name with the vet.  And, um he bought him for his Mom though originally, but the dog was $1,500 and the other 2 brothers didn't chip in.  So he never gave them to his Mom.  It was like 2 weeks and, you know, was staying with me, and by the time Christmas came he, you know, said, you know, I'm going to give them to you.  His Mom never—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a gift.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Knew, but his Mom found out later that it was for her, so she's even screamed at me and said well he bought them for me, and I said but he didn't give them to you, he gave them to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That apple didn't fall far from the tree, didn't he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, and I was like, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have her for a mother in law.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I paid my cash for my other dog, so he said you don't have proof that they're yours.  I said [INAUDIBLE] go to court and explain to the judge everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And whether you're going to lie or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And whoever sold you the dog knows, you know.  You showed up cash in hand, that's what they're going to say, you know.  You'll prevail.  Don't worry, anything that I can do to help, I'll do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So I'll see you next Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, hang in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you so much for seeing me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm glad you came.  Take care now.  It's definitely going to get better.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well glad to see you.  Take care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (6-minute silence) When I came in I was, suddenly started thinking that I couldn't remember what I'd said at the end of yesterday.  And I don't know, I just kind of had this feeling.  I guess, maybe I decided I wanted to get back to what I was talking about yesterday.  Because I know I left yesterday feeling I hadn't really gotten at whatever it was.  And then, I just have felt today that my thoughts would just go anywhere but to what I was thinking about yesterday.  Yet it's almost as if nothing else is really important.  But it's just a matter of getting away from those thoughts of yesterday. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I'm sure this is connected in some way to what I don't want to think about.  Because I feel (Clears throat), I guess, very reluctant to say I've even been thinking this.  I was thinking of the gym man again who, ah lately has been taking the boys in the room.  And I, I don't know, this time I was just sort of thinking that the type of thing he does with them.  They seem to have a very good time and they're also very disciplined.  But he's not, I don't know, he has the control without being terribly authoritarian.  And I guess I was comparing it to how I don't feel I have that kind of control.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you feel it's connected?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know.  Just the comparing myself with him.  And almost thinking I think, that the kind of thing he's teaching them is the kind of thing that boys want to learn.  And, so they're more eager to follow what he asks them to do.  Uh, uh, the results are much more understandable to them than say, one day you'll be reading and you'll be glad you worked hard.  That doesn't mean much to them.  And so I was kind of comparing the areas that we both have to teach, and the fact that his seems to be one that, I don't know if I was thinking that it would be easier, or just of more interest to the boys.  And I'm not equipped to do it.  I mean it's not even so much that, if I had a class where I taught the gym, I could do the same.  I, I was feeling that well, I never did do as well when I did have the gym period.  So it's really that I wasn't feeling I was equipped to do it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think basically what I mean is, I'm not a man and therefore, (Clears throat) I 'm not equipped. (Pause)  I just had that reaction that I know I so often do, of kind of saying well, I'm not going to think about it.  I don't want to think about it anymore.  And, I don't know, it just seems strange to me, I don't know whether I said this was it.  I think it might have occurred to me yesterday at some time while I was also thinking about other things.  But, it just seems strange that I can not think about some things, and then — that are things I don't want to think about, and yet, then I would think about other things that would make me very unhappy.  And I'd mull and mull over them, and really torment myself with them sometimes. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was thinking (Clears throat) that sometimes the things I seem not to want to say are things that I know I have a strong feeling about.  But yet, when I say them, sometimes they just seem sort of silly to me. And then I had the feeling that yesterday, there was something I said that had made me feel that way.  That it had either been something that intellectually I would say, well that's ridiculous, or obvious, or, I don't know, what reaction I — because I know I said something yesterday I had this feeling about.  But yet, there is a feeling I have attached with it, that isn't silly.  And then I started wondering what it was I'd said yesterday. </p>

<p>ANALYST: You can't remember what you ended up talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can't.  And I don't know whether that's what I, I'm referring to now, either.  It's almost like, the thing I remember about yesterday is that I was finding it hard to think about the dream.  And uhm, well, something else that had to do with how I feel about being a woman, like how being pregnant —  But it's almost as if I can't remember anything particularly specific.  I remember your asking something about (Sniff) why I didn't want to say it because I was here and i—, I'd be saying it to you — whatever, or think whatever I was thinking.  But it's almost as if yesterday were a long time ago. (Silence)</p>

<p>I just recall a feeling that I, I know I had yesterday and talked of when I was here.  That I — seems to be a part of a, a feeling I have about being female or being a woman, accepting that I am one.  And also part of my stopping work.  Because I was remembering the feeling I had when I saw the woman holding the child and thinking, oh, I could never be responsible for children, since I can hardly take care of myself.  And the fear of having to be all alone, so that I wouldn't even have MSCZ to share the responsibility with.  And, I don't know, somehow I just know I was connecting that with this fear I have of, what am I going to do with myself when I'm not working.  Will I, I don't know , somehow know, what to do or.  I just, right now feeling when I stop working I'll be at loose ends and I won't be able to take care of myself.</p>

<p>And I think when I start feeling that way, it's because I'm somehow connecting it with feeling that I'll be unproductive.  And going to work is being productive.  And sometimes I think well, having children is productive.  And yet other times, it seems like that's just as much as an escape as going to work.  I mean, it wouldn't have to be, but the way I see it right now it seems that's how I use it sometimes.  Because if I had a child, then there'd be things I had to do, so everything would be already set up.  And I would, I wouldn't have certain decisions to make that I would if I weren't working and had no children.</p>

<p>And I think when I think of it as this fear of not being productive, I don't know that I know what I mean by it.  Unless it has something to do with what other people think is productive.  And I don't know how this fits in either.  But somehow, it seems related to the fact that I have to get out of the house and be with other people also. (Pause)  And having a child would, to a certain degree, get me out of the house and I'd be meeting other young mothers.  And therefore, being with people.  But somehow, it's a secondary thing, because a lot of what you do has to be done in the home.  And so what, I don't know, it's always vaguely dissatisfying to think that that's how I'd be productive, rather than work. </p>

<p>And yet, I don't understand why I feel this way about these things.  And if I ask myself about it, it would seem that there are so many other things that could be productive, and why do I have to be around people to feel that I'm being so.  But I guess it's partly a thing of uh, at least about being around people and being out of the house — it must come something from the feeling I've so often had of that I want to hide, withdraw from people and just stay in the house.  And that is an unproductive attitude and (Cough), so I, I guess I end up feeling that in no way can I stay in the house and be productive.  Or even beyond being productive, be happy.  Because it's almost as if whenever I chose to stay in the house, or even now to a certain degree, but certainly when I was younger, it was because I was afraid and was unhappy. (Silence, Sigh)</p>

<p>I g—, found myself suddenly thinking about school again, but something connected with an activity we're going to do Monday.  And I wasn't thinking anything new about it.  It was just, well, whenever I think in that particular way about school, I always feel that it's definitely getting away from other thoughts.  And then it just struck me, I s—, particularly remembered when I was in high school working on outlines for our history course.  And how I used to spend hours and hours doing it.  And in a way, I used to be upset that I'd spend so long.  And I never understood why I made such a big job out of it.  But right now, it just seemed very clear to me that there wasn't anything else that I wanted to do.  And it sort of gave me an excuse for the fact that I was just going to be staying at home.  And it made me feel productive. </p>

<p>But yet I always sort of had this vague feeling that somehow I was making it into a much bigger job than it need be.  And that makes me think of other things that I do too, when I'm doing papers, reports on children or, you know, just about anything like that. (Sniff)  Or even, it just occurred to me, all these piles that I've always collected.  I'm not quite so bad about it now, but I still have them.  And so then when I have some free time, I always know that there's a pile to go through and get rid of.  And it seems almost like the same type of thing. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking that, wondering if that's why I don't throw things away, because by saving them it gives me something to do.  And, I don't know, it seems like a combination of being afraid to throw things away, because somehow they prop me up in some way.  But then also, not wanting to, because it would free me, and I'm afraid of that, too. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I don't know why that made me think of (Sigh) again, something that I was getting at yesterday in talking about the dream and how I felt evil and sort of lustful.  But it just struck me then that in a way, I don't want to keep talking about that, because then I might free that particular emotion in me or feeling.  And it's almost as if I'm — don't know what will happen next, that I don't want to have it freed. (Silence)</p>

<p>It made me think of my father and the fact, last night MSCZ called my parents.  Because uh, the spring vacation we're hoping that we can go down South for about a week.  And my parents have a, they're buying an apartment down in PWN.  And they've said that if we wanted to go at a time when they wouldn't be there, we could use their apartment.  And so MSCZ wanted to check the dates.  And I didn't particularly want to speak to my parents, but I knew I should, because I know my mother, at least, is hurt when I don't. </p>

<p>So when he finished with what he had to talk to them about, I got on.  And my father immediately — he'd been on one of the phones, my mother on the other — my father immediately said, "Well, do you want to speak to your mother?  I'll get off."  As if, as if he expected I'd say "Yes, I don't want to speak to you."  And almost thought as if he wished he could get off, too.  I don't know it was sort of a strange feeling.  He does it all the time, but usually I guess, I respond, "Yes, I want to speak to my mother."  And anyway, last night I said, "No, I just wanted to say hi, and so — you, know, for both of you."  And he stayed on and we chatted for a minute.  And then I said, "Good-by" and we all hung up. </p>

<p>And then MSCZ said something about, they were going to be there a day or two when we would be down there.  And that my father had been the one to say he thought it would be fun to have you down there at the same time.  And that, that was sort of unlike him, it would usually be my mother to say that.  And MSCZ then laughed and said, here he d—, he and MSCZ disagree on a lot of different subjects — and so MSCZ (Stammers) laughed and said that, "Here your father dislikes me and then he's saying it would be fun."  And then he s—, he added, "And I think he really means it." </p>

<p>And then it just occurred to me, well — uh, first I thought, well my father doesn't like me, either.  And I don't know exactly what I meant by that when I thought, he doesn't like me.  Yet, I'm sure in a way he doesn't like me.  But in another way, it doesn't matter to my father if he likes you or not.  I don't really understand, I don't know, it was just sort of a feeling I had about it. </p>

<p>But now when I think about it, I don't — well, I guess it's more that except for how you affect him to certain extents, and you only can to a certain extent — you really don't matter.  And it could be anybody there.  And he would prefer people he knows because he's more comfortable.  And he doesn't have to make the effort to be polite and all.  But (Sigh) and somehow the feeling that, in a way — when I say he doesn't like me — in a way, he's just not aware of me, or of MSCZ.  (Pause) Well, whatever it was anyway, I think it's part of what's always — a big part of what's always bothered me so much about my relationship with him. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, right after that I started thinking about (Clears throat) the feeling I have when the boys fight in my room.  Or just sort of push each other around, like arguing about which place in line they're going to have and things like that.  And the fact that when they get frustrated or angry with another boy because they can't have their way, they just hit out.  And, and how it really bothers me.  I know I spoke of it the other day, either yesterday or the day before.  And the feeling that somehow I'm responsible.  That I'm not doing something that would make it easier for them to handle this problem of taking care of themselves. (Pause)</p>

<p>I think I think that way because i—, it was just seeming to me — it might be a reflection on how I react when something I don't like happens, and if I show anger, which I think I'm afraid I do.  Uh, that's who I — or it's more things will happen that I really — really shouldn't make me feel angry.  Except that I do feel angry and then I show it.  And (Sniff, Sigh), I don't know, it's almost as if the relationship between me and the children to a great extent is built on angry feelings, rather than feelings of good will.  And they're — then they react to each other the same way.  So it is a reflection on how I'm reacting with them.  And I know that's the way I've seen how we used to fight in my family, that our relationship with our parents was usually based on anger and frustration of some sort.  And then we had it with each other. (Pause)</p>

<p>Because I also think of FEIZ who, I guess, will always seem to me an example of somebody who really feels — well, if you break down feelings toward each other as either love or hate — love toward other people; making me very aware of the hate I feel.  And how with her, the boys were much less, it seems to me apt to fight and, I don't know, push each other around, and feel put upon or whatever.  I mean there just was a greater happiness. (Pause)</p>

<p>Or, or maybe it was just simply she didn't feel threatened.  She had confidence, and then somehow the children did. </p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, all the while today I've been recalling what you said that at the beginning you couldn't remember.  You called my attention to it, that is, what you ended up talking about yesterday.  And I want to remind you now, in light of what you've been saying, what you were telling me about at the end was how much you have wanted a television set.  And how MSCZ has used his authority to keep you from having one.  And then you made it sound almost as though at one point he convinced you that you didn't indeed, want one.  And I think you were furious about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.  Oh I remember when I left here, I was very dissatisfied with what I'd been saying, because somehow I (Clears throat), I knew I wasn't getting at something that I was feeling, and I was saying something almost as a contradictory thing to it.  Because when MSCZ talked to me — well, usually he'll just say, "No, we're not having one," flat, that's it.  But this particular time, we had been talking about other things, too.  And I always bring up having a television as a teasing thing, and I don't know exactly in what way I do it, and why.  Whether it's to test and see if he's still saying "no," or just what. </p>

<p>But anyway, this particular time, he said — we were talking about it a little and I was saying, "Well, I think you're afraid of having one," which I usually say, and it always makes him angry. And this particular time he said, "Well, let me try to explain why I feel this way, because it is very important to me."  And so the feeling I ended up with after that was, I felt somehow privileged or honored or something.  I came up to his, he looked upon me as an equal that he could talk to, to explain why he felt that way, whereas before he would always just say no, as if I were some kind of a servant or something. </p>

<p>And I think it is true that when he's just said, "No!", I have felt furious.  And I don't know how much I want one, except for the fact he's said, "No, we're not going to have one."  But I don't know if I felt furious after he did that or, I don't kn—, well, it's still his decision, though.  That's true. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good thank you. So I had my mom's Christmas party this weekend or last weekend and she's wearing what resembles an engagement ring. And when I asked her about it she said she didn't know. So I was thinking this is a perfect example of why I can't trust what anyone says or just like how can you not know. <note ref="1"><b>Psychotherapy helps people come to terms with their feelings about their parents and their childhoods so that they don't generalize these experiences to their adult life. "A" is saying that since she can't trust her mother, she can't trust anyone. This lack of trust negatively impacts her current relationships.</b></note></p>
 
<p>Are you or aren't you? And then I asked her how can you not know? Are you or aren't you? And then she giggled and walked away. So I assume that means yes, but I just... I know how she works so I know why she's acting like that but I'm like I don't know. I feel kind of sad kind of offended like why do you think that behavior is appropriate. I'm like well why wouldn't you tell your kids first before you started wearing an engagement ring at her Christmas party? Yeah, I don't know. [00:04:45]</p>

<p>And then I felt like are you just angry because it's like a hard thing to see her get married again possibly. <note ref="2"><b>This is a positive sign when patients reflect on their feelings and try to make sense of them. She's developing a theory of where her feelings may be coming from.</b></note> I do feel a little sad. I mean I was just kind of offered, but I do want her to be happy. I'm like why can't you just tell me? And then I said what the hell goes through your head because... I don't know. You just don't think that how could any... I don't know. How could this end well when you prance around with a ring on your finger? Other people are like oh what a pretty ring. And then I'm just like what. And then they ask you and then you I don't know. I don't know. And then I feel like I can't even talk to her because I'm asking her what do you mean you don't know. Yes or no. So I found that to be really frustrating and it freaking just brought back a lot of feelings and why I didn't talk to her for such a long time. [00:06:11]</p>

<p>I just feel like you can't even ask her what she's thinking because she just doesn't think. And I know that in her head she thinks that I'm going to be upset which you know I am a little bit, but I'm not mad that she's happy or anything. But I just think how do you think how do you think you're helping the situation by avoiding the topic? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's pretty insensitive. <note ref="3"><b>I'm validating her anger at her mother for not telling her that she's engaged. I was trying to help her feel less alone in this experience, especially given how isolated and excluded she was feeling from her mother's life.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or I just think if you're not ready to tell your kids that's okay. Then don't wear the ring at a Christmas party. [00:07:10] <note ref="4"><b>"A" doesn't directly take up my comment about her mother's insensitivity. Going deeper into her feelings about this may have been too painful for her at the moment.</b></note></p>

<p>Yeah, it's like how do you even tell someone like that that their behavior hurt you when they just can't even think (inaudible at 0:07:21). I just feel like any person with some sort of common sense would recognize that that would be upsetting. But it's in our own blood. (inaudible at 0:07:33) about Christmas like are they going to make this announcement while we're having dinner? And then I don't know... I feel like when I'm upset it's very hard for me to pretend that I am not upset so then I'm going to not say something but it's going to be very visible that I'm displeased. And then I feel like I'm ruining their day. That's (inaudible at 0:08:11). [00:08:11] <note ref="5"><b>"A" moves from her feelings of displeasure to feeling guilty, "I'm ruining their day". Is she feeling guilty about her angry feelings? Why is she blaming herself for a situation she didn't create? I could have taken up this point with her.</b></note></p>

<p>And then she just makes things so much worse. Like if she was just honest half these problems probably wouldn't be problems. And she just sees it as the problem is she's getting engaged and maybe I don't like it. And I don't see it like that. I see the problem is that she doesn't take responsibility and to me acts like a child. And had she said that she was getting engaged I probably would have been a little upset but not upset that's she's... It's like I would almost have her lie than to give me these responses that don't even mean anything. Now I'm like why do you get so upset? I don't think she worried about how I would possibly feel once she told me. [00:09:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I mean that's part of the problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's just felt so offended when I get a response like that. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think one of the things that we can do together is to help you comes to terms with profoundly limited and disappointing parents. <note ref="6"><b>As I have commented in previous transcripts, I want to help "A" mourn the wish to have parents different than the ones she has. I believe that her difficulty giving up this hope holds her back from creating more fulfilling relationships.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because what you're up against now is almost a sense of shock every time they do what they do. And I completely understand how profoundly disappointing it is. But there's a way you know this about them. This isn't a surprise, but I think emotionally it feels like such a shock that it's hard for you to come to terms like this is what she does. [00:10:11] <note ref="7"><b>This is a very important point in psychoanalytic thinking, namely, what people know yet don't allow themselves to know at the same time. If asked, "A" could have more or less predict her mother's behavior. Yet because it's so painful, she prevents herself from this knowledge emotionally, which is why she is "surprised" when her mother acts the way she does.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like I feel like... I don't know. The issues seem to get bigger and bigger somehow in my head. I'm just like oh she's going to - I don't know - like not act like it this time. Why would she... It's just like everything she does is just like little stupid lies like that. So I do think that's something that I need to work on, but I feel like... It's like I know but, like you said, emotionally it's still a shocker at the time. <note ref="8"><b>"A" takes this point up directly and continues with the idea I presented. Psychoanalytic theory pays close attention to what the patient "does" with the therapist's interventions. Does she address them, avoid them, or disagree with them? The analytic therapist focuses not only on the content of the session, but the process/dynamic between therapist and patient.</b></note> And I think part of it is like I just get angry like what makes you think that you can treat your kids like this or anyone. So then I'm upset and then I'm also really annoyed that I feel like all these behaviors are just... Like there's never any consequences for them which goes back to my by the rules. But I'm just like how can you act like this and have it be okay? I know it's not my job to police them but... I don't know. Maybe the problem is that I over think things. But I usually think of all those things before I have a conversation with someone or (inaudible at 0:11:50) decision or statement or (inaudible at 0:11:52). [00:11:52]</p>

<p>And then part of me worries does she think that I'm... I am happy for her. The woman was miserable for years, but I think she doesn't even get that I'm even the least bit upset. Maybe she's not engaged but she said that she doesn't know. But what does that mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean even if for some reason there's some ambiguity in what the ring means, she could talk to you about that. [00:12:29] <note ref="9"><b>I am supporting that side of "A" who feels entitled to know what's happening with her mother.  More effective would have been for me to point out her conflict between feeling angry and feeling guilty about her anger.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I don't understand why would you wear a big diamond ring on your left hand but the response is just... I don't know. It reminds me of like a little... She's all like a no. What does that mean? I just felt like it was very insensitive. And I felt silly because her niece and cousins are like your ring's just so beautiful and I'm like in the middle of a cookie platter like stop dead in my tracks. And I feel like I don't want to steal her glory since she was probably really happy and she thinks that... I don't know. I found it to be extremely upsetting. I don't know what to do to not make it feel like it's the first time every time I'm disappointed. [00:13:50] <note ref="10"><b>Again, "A" is taking up my point from earlier, that on the one hand, she knows who her mother is and on the other, she's shocked every time her mother acts in these insensitive ways. When a patient returns to a point throughout the session, this is a good sign that the intervention has been useful.</b></note></p>

<p>I don't know. I feel like neither of them are going to change, but... I don't know. I just feel like every time I'm really upset again like it's one of the first times. And then there's just no talking to them about it because they never make any progress. And then when I feel rejected or upset after I kind of put myself up there then I feel like I just really shot down, and then I start to feel like I'm at a choice with no choice. My choice is don't talk to them at all or talk to them and have a mediocre relationship. And I feel like I've become okay with a mediocre relationship in most respects. And it's stuff like this that just makes me worry like why do I even bother. [00:15:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what you outlined is a choice. It's just that neither option is particularly appealing. <note ref="11"><b>It might have been more helpful for me to comment that she feels stuck or trapped.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not that you don't have a choice because you just outlined what it is. It's just like it would be nice if there were a third option.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you could talk to them and get through to them and they would stop being so infantile. I mean the way you describe your parents they're both in different ways infantile. Your father's constantly having a temper tantrum and has no sense of any sort of responsibility in his relationships. He's constantly feeling victimized. And your mother, I guess, wants to be a child in someone parent's house. <note ref="12"><b>Psychoanalytic theory believes that the longing for parents who take care for us, whom we can admire, and on whom we can rely, is a universal wish. "A" is dealing with parents who often act like children, a reality which clashes with this universal wish. Understandably, she is struggling with this.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like I feel like her parents got divorced when she was in her low teens or adolescence. And her mom left her and her brothers and she stayed with her dad and kind of took care of the family. And then I feel like she got married so young that she never had a young adulthood. And then after she got divorced... Well she always acted like a kid a little bit. But then I feel like once she got divorced now it's like she's living out her teenage years it seems like. Yeah, both of them are like children. When both of them are like that I end up feeling like it's me. [00:16:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? <note ref="13"><b>This is a very important question. Why is it her? When people face limitations in their parents, they can often feel like, "I guess I did something wrong to deserve these parents." This is especially common in the case of abuse, where the abused child or adult thinks, "I must have done something to deserve this abuse."</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: How can I be blessed with two people who are like that? Like am I... I think I'm a pretty open person but then maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm just really judgmental. I don't know. But at the end of the day they do, do these things that make me feel bad so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe it's easier to feel like there's something you're doing wrong because then I guess the implication is you could do something right versus in this respect this is unfortunate. You're unfortunate in terms of your parents. There are worse parents for sure, but they're really disappointing. [00:17:30] <note ref="14"><b>A famous psychoanalyst, W. R. Fairbairn said, "it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God than to live in a world ruled by the devil".</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then I do think there probably are worse parents. And I don't know if I'm doing it, like you said, like if it's my fault then maybe I can fix it. And then I think part of it's like my dad just preaches any time your upset he's just like it could be worse. It could be worse. Well okay that doesn't necessary negate that I'm upset. <note ref="15"><b>This is a very important indicator of progress for "A", one that I could have commented on. She is able to validate her feelings in the face of someone (in this case her father) invalidating them. In the past, she would have questioned her right to feel what she does when presented with a comment that negated hers.</b></note> He just raised us till it was like if you're upset you'd be complaining so no complaining. There are people out there who can't even eat and you're complaining about this. And I feel like there's some small bit of me that kind of thinks like that. [00:18:20]</p>

<p>And I feel like it can be good sometimes like if I - I don't know - feel a little lazy at work or something I kind of use that to push me through. But I just feel like I really am in this place where I'm like - I don't know - am I just really difficult? And then I feel like I know that's not me and I know they don't act ideal. I don't know. Maybe it's just hard for me to admit that both parents are not ideal, and I'm unhappy with our relationship between the people that they are. I just don't know what to do when I find myself in these situations like this weekend to not upset myself as much. [00:19:33] <note ref="16"><b>"A" is speaking to a universal dilemma–what do we do with our negative feelings? How do we manage them? Do we express them, deny them, medicate them with drugs and alcohol, etc.? The primary reason people come to therapy is that they need help dealing with feelings that they can't tolerate or can't make sense of.</b></note></p>

<p>And then part of me feels embarrassed that they... I don't know if this is really the key into it but like when other people go your ring is so beautiful because there wasn't even a congratulations so I felt like... I don't know. I guess embarrassed is the only word that I can see. It's like I'm standing there. It's like they know something I don't. I'm trying to get information. I'm not getting an answer. I just feel really embarrassed that that's happening or that... I don't know. <note ref="17"><b>I could have asked her about this feeling of embarrassment. Was she embarrassed because she felt confused about what was happening? Did she feel embarrassed that they did not deem her worthy enough to include her to tell her about the engagement?</b></note> Like one of my cousins is going to say oh I'm so happy for them and I'm kind of like what. It's just so awkward. And then I feel like it's really hard for me to sit there and pretend to have a conversation with them like we're having cookies and coffee around the table after. [00:20:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds infuriating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I feel like I almost fell for it too because they don't ever feel like there's a consequence. Like at the end of the day even though I was really upset I went home still not knowing if she was engaged or not. I'm like what am I supposed to do sit there and throw a tantrum like my dad would until I get an answer. So it's infuriating. Its three days later and I don't know what the heck is happening. And then I just start to think - and I know I should probably not even care about this - but the wedding will be like in is she going to ask me to be her maid of honor and that's not something I want to do. So how do I tell her no? Maybe that's really thinking too deeply and that's the first thing I thought out. [00:22:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you (inaudible at 0:22:11)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think she won't get it and I'll have to... She'll just think that I'm saying no because I don't like the family, which is true, but that would never be a reason why I would say no if I had a good relationship with her. I just feel like I don't know what to say. It's like I don't want to be your maid of honor, and we're not close like that, so I shouldn't be your maid of honor, but I don't think she would get it. <note ref="18"><b>"A" is describing how deeply misunderstood she feels. It could have been helpful for me to comment on that.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't want to say no because you don't think that she would understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you don't want to say no because you know she wouldn't understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So would the saying no be because you just don't really want to participate or would the saying no because you're hopeful that she would understand? [00:23:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you'll get one but not the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's your right not to have to participate if you feel included. But for the sake of making a stand I'm not sure how far it's going to get you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I feel like our - this is kind of like me always wanting to make someone recognize something, <note ref="19"><b>This could have been a good moment for me to say, "you want so much for someone to recognize you". I think this speaks the heart of the matter and would have helped her feel understood. This could have also led her to move deeper into this experience.</b></note> but yeah I feel like if I just say no that I don't want to participate there's really just part of me who really wants her to understand that we're not very close and why. But she doesn't really get that because we've tried to talk about it a couple of times and it just didn't go very well when my parents got divorced. But I don't know. I think this is a very bad trait about myself. But if someone makes me feel bad like really deeply like my parents and not that I've had fights like this but I haven't been as ambitious about it but its like if you make me feel bad I want to make you feel bad like twice as bad. So I feel bad in saying this but I feel like part of me wants to be like no I'm not being in your wedding for all these reasons to make her feel as shitty as I do. (inaudible at 0:24:48) and it's kind of passive aggressive. [00:24:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you desperately want to get through to her and you're angry with her because you feel so shut out now. You absolutely refuse to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then I felt like just like when they got divorced we didn't speak and I was really upset with her, and then we started talking then, but I still felt like there were unresolved issues that I can't talk to her about. I knew that it was just a matter of time before something like this happened, but I didn't think it would happen right now and I wasn't prepared to deal with right now. And then I feel like it just brought up a lot of feelings like this is why I didn't talk to you for almost a year. This is why we're not close. This is why I don't think it's mom but she's like a mess as a person. This is why you're always late for work and not saying that you (inaudible at 0:26:04) and then lying about her vacations. She just lies. [00:26:14]</p>

<p>I do feel very ungrateful about that. And then it doesn't really bother my brother. So then I'm upset and then I end up feeling like a bad kid. <note ref="20"><b>Again, this is the idea of taking on the "badness/ responsibility" for her parents behavior. It again speak to the psychoanalyst I referred to above who said, "it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God than to live in a world ruled by the devil".</b></note> "Everyone's all happy and like kumbaya, and I'm like sitting in the corner really pissed off. She had the same response to him but it doesn't bother him. But I'm like how can that happen and not bother you? But I just feel like that's a big something that you tell someone. I just really have a problem accepting the situation that I am that's our kid. You know she's going to do things like this. [00:27:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think accepting it would mean? <note ref="21"><b>I'm trying to help her imagine what a future would look like in which she felt more at peace.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Part of it's like a stubborn piece of me that almost doesn't want to accept it because I feel like she gets away with this all the time. But I don't know. Maybe knowing that we're not going to be close or... I don't know. I think why does it upset you so much when you know that this is always the current state? I don't know. I just feel like I'm just never going to be happy with them in that house. I don't even know. It's hard to explain but I just feel like I can't for some reason. [00:29:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe you're not sure what house you can be happy in. <note ref="22"><b>This was an intentionally ambiguous statement with multiple levels of meaning. Some patients can look beyond the more obvious meaning and hear comments on a more metaphoric level, for example, that I was referring to her inner house. What kind of inner state of being can she create in which she would be happy? "A" is not quite at the point where she can hear this metaphoric level.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well I feel bad because they're really nice to me. I don't think they're very nice people but they're nice to me. And they're very welcoming but I don't know. I guess something just doesn't sit right because they all lie so much and it just makes me feel really uncomfortable. Which makes me think what else do you lie about? I don't know. And then part of me's just like well my brother doesn't live good either. He's fell in some way... Like he and I can be in room, and he could met you, and he can still talk to you and shoot the shit, and pretend like he loves, and I can't. I feel like I'm still really nice, but you can tell that I'm kind of uncomfortable. But part of me feels like well I don't want you to think that I like you because I don't. [00:30:33]</p>

<p>And then I end up feeling guilty because they're nice, and open, and accepting of me, and I just don't like them. I shouldn't say that I don't like them. I don't like being there so I do it as minimally as possible. I just don't know how to come to peace with this. Like I don't even like me being there all the time like I'm around somebody that's when it makes me upset. But then when I talk to her a little bit about it this makes her upset too and (inaudible at 0:31:50) on how to take it for what it is and be comfortable about it. [00:31:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it feels so uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And because I felt like... It's like I almost feel uncomfortable being as upset as I am and they don't think that anything's wrong. And then they... It feels like all just fake and weird. They look at the holidays and now this situation so... And I think of when my dad finds out somehow then I have to deal with his emotions too. Right now I don't have time for both. And then I just - I don't know - I think I'm just still harping on the things that she did wrong when she left my dad. I think my dad's a very difficult person to be around and knowing my mom and how she is and how he is I get that she just kind of ran away. It makes sense. I feel like her current boyfriend just preyed on her. I keep thinking well these things don't even really matter but yet I still find upsetting. [00:34:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you think he preyed on her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he knew that she wasn't really happy and kind of just... He's a very strange individual and not many people like him in her work setting at least. And I think they were friendly, but I think he saw an opportunity to talk to this woman and give her the attention that she lacked from my dad, and slowly I feel like he moved in. And then I just think like how when she moved out of my dad's house she was living in this apartment. She was just lying about who they were and he was kind of living there. It's just all lies. And then she moves in with him, and she tells this ridiculous lie that she's living with her boss because she can't afford to pay her bills, and he's going to help her out. I'm just like okay I'm moving in with his boss and his family. I don't think any employer would ever do that and you're staying in his room. Come on mom. It's almost comical that she thinks that would make sense or is believable, but part of me feels really sad for her that she tells those types of lies and just lives that way. [00:35:55] <note ref="23"><b>This is an important moment where "A" moves from only feeling angry toward her mother to empathizing with her. She is developing a more complex picture of her mother, which indicates treatment progress.</b></note></p>

<p>And I'm sick of feeling this upset and annoyed with them, but I still do. No, it's just like its one disappointment over another, and I don't know how to deal with it. And then it's like I knew something like this was going to happen. <note ref="24"><b>"A" quickly moved away from her sadness about her mother. It could have been helpful to point out just this, that she moved away from her sadness.</b></note> I've feel like I've calling it forever with my brother, not that she would lie about it, but that it would come out in some weird sort of way. We wouldn't know for a while and it would be really awkward. So I know that these types of things happen all the time with them. It's like repeated behavior, but I just don't know how to deal with it. [00:37:31]</p>

<p>And then I feel like is it because... I feel like none of these behaviors came out to the worst until they got divorced. If you talk to my dad about anything he blames the divorce. And I don't think that the divorce was the problem. It was that they had this problem but it was a little more hidden when they were together. And I've talked to a couple of friends about it and one of my friends had said it's just the divorce too. My parents are divorced. And I feel like no one's parents are as strange as mine. And I know there are worse out there, but they're just not what... They have the worst skill of communicating and ownership I have ever seen in my life; not that mine's the best. [00:38:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How am I not the best?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You're not saying because I think because you're hoping to be the best but it's sort of a bit of I'm not very good either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think my problem is hard for me to bring it up. But I think a lot of times it's because of dealing with my parents and I know that I get these answers that are just out there. And so I tend to feel like why bring it up because we're not going to have a good discussion about it anyways, or I'm not going to have the, not even the answer that I want, but an answer that - or something that I'm able to work through. And then I feel like... I don't know. [00:39:46]</p>

<p>Like even with my parents I didn't want to ask my mom is that an engagement ring because I knew that the answer would be some sort of an answer that would cause me to - like it wouldn't be a yes or no. It's an answer that causes me to ask additional questions and then somewhat have the answers. So then I feel like well what's the point of asking because I still don't know. And I think that's hurting me. Bad treatment (inaudible at 0:40:18). I feel like it's come out in Jamie situations, but I'm much more comfortable talking to him because I feel like we can have rational conversation about it. But for a very long time I wouldn't mention something. But I think once I'm talking if I have a problem it's usually okay. I have a problem bringing issues up. [00:40:51]</p>

She is describing two parents were are uninterested and unaware of what she communicates and she has developed a learned helplessness about speaking her mind and her feelings.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. (inaudible at 0:41:08). But some families have one or the other and they both lack these major traits of being an adult that I feel like it's hard to have conversations like that. Or is it I'm wondering how did you end up like this? My dad it's like no one likes him. Everyone's out to get him. I don't know. I just feel really annoyed with all of these situations because I'm like let's talk to dad. Here's one person to talk to hear me. Mom, you lost a lot of friends because you lied to them and did weird things. They can't see it. Why do I even care if... For me the worse case scenario would be knowing that the more I talk about people I think of my dad if even people liked me. But if he doesn't care and he thinks people like him, why should I care about it because he seems kind of happy thinking that. [00:42:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I wonder if there's some envy that somehow their obliviousness makes them so much happier and you're stuck with this awareness that it makes you feel miserable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah. I was actually as I was walking between the train and her it's almost like I'm jealous. I never would want to be the type of person my parents are but my mom is just like happy go lucky like a pig in mud about this. She doesn't care and I kind of wish I didn't care. But I would also not want the trait of not thinking about things or being aware of certain things. But at the same time kind of like ignorance is bliss and she's just really happy in her situation. <note ref="26"><b>This is something I often hear from patients, namely, the burden of self-awareness.</b></note> But yeah I do think about it a lot. [00:44:02]</p>

<p>I feel like I just... I mean maybe it is a good thing but I feel like I think about things way too much. I start thinking about them and chopping them up a million different ways and looking at it from every different angle. That's good in some situations I guess, but it stresses me out, and I don't know why I do that. (inaudible at 0:44:44) angry with the engagement thing and then I'm really stressing about Christmas now which I already find stressful enough. [00:45:01]</p>

<p>And then it's hard for me to even be happy or as happy as I would be for them when I think I have this lurking over me. I don't know why I feel so stubborn like I feel like she just sees it as one thing but I see it as she's getting married. It's not optimal for me but not horrible. But then the way she communicates it and acts horrible not acceptable which she just kind of meshes them into one. Because in my head I'm like well why bother having conversation. I know that I'm right because I'm not really going to get anywhere, but I haven't accepted that yet. [00:46:02]</p>

<p>I think that's what I need to do. I feel like that's hard because I feel like most people talk about issues so I'm not comfortable communicating things and I've had to work really hard on our relationship with the knowledge communicating things that maybe make me upset or whatever. So now it's like I can communicate these things that make me upset and I'm trying to talk to my parents about them because now I feel more comfortable talking about them but I can't because when I bring them up it's just not very good. I feel like a lot of frustration comes out of that because before - it's almost like before I would not say anything. I think that was a better solution to deal with my parents. But now that I can I feel like it almost makes it worse with my relationship with them. So it's like I'm practicing the art of conversation with him and with them I'm trying to come to terms with possibly not even having conversations anymore. [00:47:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine it might make you feel you even more disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "A", we're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye-bye. [00:47:47]</p>

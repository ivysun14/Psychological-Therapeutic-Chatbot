<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right [PATIENT NAME] how are you sir?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doing well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Doing well, doing well, all right, what does that mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My head's in a real good place today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well no, actually not just today, I have actually been doing really well, I've actually been doing really well in general.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and it is your birthday today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So happy birthday once again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you, [AGE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [AGE], well any reflections back on -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wouldn't change a thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just kidding.  I actually was in a very reflective mood yesterday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just in a kind of weird situation and I just kind of chilled out last night and I didn't do anything that I would normally do.  I just sat and I thought a lot last night.  I spent a lot of time thinking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was kind of cool.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Relaxing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, good, good.  I knew you'd be back today.  I wasn't so sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Me neither, after your performance last week.</p>

<p>CG: Two weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who's performance?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yours.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You weren't real shy about my background.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What background?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I suppose it was kind of a lesser woman running for cover, in fact, it probably would have been ninety eight percent -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wouldn't you want them to run for cover though if it just wasn't right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes I would.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, you don't have to elaborate because I know exactly what you mean and after a lot of thought I agree.  If it was beneficial for [NAME OTHER] to go her own way, then I would wish her well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, because yknow [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Here we go again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, no I just want to say, I mean we come here and we have one body and one mind to take care of and we should do as good a job as we can with that and, yknow, you want to do what you want to do in this world, that's up to you but when it starts impacting on other people and when it's in a very negative way then, yeah, you start to cross over that line of what right you have and so, for example, rather than take another person down with you if you are going on that road, you know, that's okay for you to do, you have every right to do it in the world but it's not fair for others if they are being lied to or misled or in some way coerced -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I never lied.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know what I mean.  And for her part, I'd say, look you've seen here what you've seen here and you make the decision.  Sometimes we want to believe what we want to believe and see what we want to see so she would have some responsibility there, too, but clearly last time there was a point where she's saying wait a minute, I'm not so sure this is the right guy or I'm doing the right thing, it's probably scary and you, likewise, have the decision to make if I'm going to do this or I'm not going to do this and where am I going.  You know, she's not my patient, you're my patient but here you are so we don't need to rehash that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I was very surprised that [NAME OTHER] came back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.  When did you know she was going to come back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right after we left.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right after you left, you knew she was going to come back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I mean when we're sitting here in your office I'm convinced -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's not coming back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not only is she not coming back, I'm pretty much convinced I'm never going to see [NAME OTHER] again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's very truthfully what was going through my mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I actually had just, I had begun the healing process because I was quite convinced.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You had written her off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  So what, what told you that wasn't going to be the case.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I don't remember if I directly asked her.  I went over to her car as she was leaving and we talked.  I don't know if I specifically asked her if she was coming back or if we were talking about something else and she said she was coming.  I probably specifically asked her I guess, I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>CG: You did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, I figured, I figured she'd be back.  I was guessing maybe seventy, thirty.  You know why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know why actually, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think because even if she didn't want to be with you, I think out of respect for you or for me because I made a request right?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think maybe just because she's a good person and just would want to tie up some loose ends because I think there were still some loose ends there from last time and just to tie up loose ends and put a final stamp on it one way or another that she would do it, she would come back, even if it was to say I thought about it hard and long and there's just no way I want to do this.  I think she would do that because that's the kind of person she is. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can see that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I'm not saying that she was going to come back and say I want to still have a relationship with you but I thought she would come back just to say I definitely am clear that I'm not doing this, so here she is.  And it sounds like things are as good or better than they had been.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you can say that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Significantly better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, sometimes you need -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It seems like the space thing probably ended yesterday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The, I need space thing.</p>

<p>CG: No, no, just not as much space.  I mean you've been, you've been listening when I say things, like the conversation we had earlier when I said I was off tomorrow and you said oh we could shoot pool and I was like whoops, hold on, just because I have the time available doesn't mean that it's allocated to you and you understood that.  You said oops, yknow, those types of things have been, [PATIENT NAME] has been making progress with.  I think, well I know this for a fact, when we came here two weeks ago, [PATIENT NAME] was for sure you were going to be on his side and I was going to be swayed and have my mind changed about those things that had occurred and I know from the look on his face, he was totally stunned that wasn't how it turned out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: I on the other hand was pretty sure you and I would see similar things that had occurred and have a similar view on it and [PATIENT NAME] felt that, perhaps that's what he needed to here was that it wasn't how he thought it would be. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yknow, I was not trying to beat [PATIENT NAME] up but I also did not want to be dishonest or misleading just for [PATIENT NAME]'s benefit to keep or get what he wanted.  I don't think that would be fair to you, yknow, to be part of some part of conspiracy here.</p>

<p>CG: I don't think he thought of it that way.  And I said to him, I said he's pretty straightforward and I wasn't expecting to hear some of the things I heard, not that it changed my opinion one way or the other, [PATIENT NAME] actions and that's what I told him, have changed over the past two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: In fact, we saw each other that Sunday and had breakfast and hung out for a little bit and that was nice and it has progressed from there, yknow, I don't get a bizillion phone calls or a bizillion emails and [PATIENT NAME] needs to know that he stops and I begin somewhere.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: And he needs [PATIENT NAME] time just like I need [NAME OTHER] time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: And we're going out tonight and I asked him yesterday, I said are you asking me out as a friend or are you asking me out on a date because if you're asking me out on a date, I expect you to behave that way, yknow, if we're going out as friends that's cool, we'll just hang out and I think for [PATIENT NAME], he realized that's starting over, we have to start fresh, yeah we're friends but we also need to be able to, if we're going to be in a relationship it has to start from square one and that's, you go out on a date, meet new people, we do things together, we don't smother each other, we give each other space and time and, you know, be accepting and know that it's possible that he could meet somebody else or I could meet somebody else or we could meet nobody and wind up happily together for the rest of our lives.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or you could drop dead.</p>

<p>CG: That's what I said to him yesterday.  I said all we have is today, we can't predict the future, we can't say, yknow, next week or next month or next year, just today.  If you can't treat me the way I need, deserve to be treated today, tomorrow means nothing to me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: And I think it's difficult for [PATIENT NAME] to realize that because he does see, yknow, he's projecting this is what I want and he'll do anything he can to get it.  Well, no you will.  I'm not saying that in a bad way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, no it's unfortunately very accurate and I just wonder how transparent I truly am.</p>

<p>CG: It's an Aries trait.  I mean it's very characteristic of Aries to be, to go for what they want regardless and in what I know about your past, that's your personality.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well but you know [PATIENT NAME], how old were you when you were diagnosed bipolar?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess I was like [AGE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so like fifteen years ago or so but even before that, before you were diagnosed, you had some problems with different things and, yknow, it's not just how [PATIENT NAME] but [PATIENT NAME] has a brother with is own issues.</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And a mother, so part of it is how [PATIENT NAME] environment that he grew up in and [PATIENT NAME]'s mother is very giving and giving and giving, right?  </p>

<p>CG: Giving's a word.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so, you know, you talk about being smothered but it doesn't come out of nothingness, I mean, you know, [PATIENT NAME] either verbally makes a request or expresses a need or non-verbally does something which says to his mother, I need to help this guy or I want to help this guy and so it's almost like a parasitic relationship at times.  They're pathology both, yknow, kind of feed of each other, so I'm just saying that [PATIENT NAME] over the years, yknow, has as he had declined from where he was, had become, you know, more needy.</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And rather than somebody kicking him to the curb, yknow, his mom, of course mothers tend to be that way anyway, most mothers, they'll do whatever they have to do for the kids and so his mother is no different even if it means harming them in a lot of ways, yknow, because you just can't keep doing and doing and doing because people will keep taking and taking and taking.</p>

<p>CG: You can't control a man his whole life because then he's no longer a man.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: And I see that [PATIENT NAME], I see part of that, I don't know his parents that well and I don't know him that well but I do see, yknow, the kind of relationship that he has with his mother and one of things that you learn growing up as a female is you can tell what kind of man a man is by the way he gets along with his mother.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: So when I mentioned this to [PATIENT NAME] a couple of months ago, I said I think you need to try to be a little more understanding of what your mother's going through, in that you can't constantly put her down and degrade her because she has problems too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, she does, although in [PATIENT NAME] defense, I mean his mother has so many problems.</p>

<p>CG: Oh I know, I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you'd have to be almost a saint to be able to deal with that and I'm not blaming his mother for his situation.  The only reason I bring that up is, you know, [PATIENT NAME] is [AGE] today.  This has been going on for a long long time, so people just don't change overnight.  Even if the light bulb goes on over your head, it's not necessarily the case that you're going to just be able to be completely different, yknow, one hundred and eighty degree change.  I think there are a lot of things in our lives that we experience.  You know, [PATIENT NAME] lived through this first hand and, you know, [PATIENT NAME] tomorrow, today, you could leave my office and bump into somebody, that person could have a profound, yknow, lifelong effect on you in some way, good or bad I guess, so yknow, [PATIENT NAME] may have had some kind of an awakening of sorts last time that you were here with him because I think he knew that he was, in fact, I think that [PATIENT NAME] had already chalked it up as you were not going to stick around, and part of that may have occurred because [PATIENT NAME] sometimes, [PATIENT NAME] can come across as being very confident and very sure and, yknow, he speaks well and he's very bright and he knows a lot of stuff, so he comes off very confident and self assured but, of course, [PATIENT NAME] also has that flip side where he's very insecure and unsure of himself and I think that at one point maybe he's thinking, yknow what, I don't deserve, yknow, this is what I have coming to me, this is, you know, why would anybody want to be with me or I'm not so, yeah, he has a very self effacing side of him where he's not real confident about things, he's uncomfortable around certain situations and maybe he feels like he's not worthy of having a relationship that would last and, yknow, old habits die hard so it's going to take some time but I think it's a worthwhile investment.  He's gonna to make that investment in himself and, you know, with your help, if you decide that you want to be part of that but you don't need to take on a science experiment like [PATIENT NAME], I mean you do it because you like him, you like his company -</p>

<p>CG: Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's a good friend, he's a good person, you know.  [PATIENT NAME] and I had this conversation so many times about relationships and if you think about it, yknow, [PATIENT NAME] how many times did I tell you, you know, when you start a relationship, yeah it's appealing to jump in bed with somebody from the first minute you see them perhaps but how many of those relationships really last.  It happens, okay, it can happen but if it was only about the physical stuff and you didn't even know who this person was, it was just about the act, yknow, you may have been lucky and it could have been a great thing but probably not so I always told [PATIENT NAME], [PATIENT NAME], yknow, you can't have a relationship or a life or a romance without really learning who this person is first.  You know, you want to know what do you have in common, are you trustworthy, are you a good friend, are you caring, are you loving, the rest of it comes if it's going to happen.</p>

<p>CG: Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that will always form a better basis, a better foundation for a long term relationship, yknow, people don't want to take the time and effort to put that kind of foundation down, it takes time and effort and -</p>

<p>CG: Patience.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Patience and if you want to just get it done, you know, it's a different story, it's a different mindset though.  I think [PATIENT NAME] at his age right now, yknow, he was married once and lost that.  I shouldn't say he lost it, it ended.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was a mutual thing but it ended.  It doesn't mean that he wouldn't want it again, yknow, he's not turned off to that.  I think [PATIENT NAME] wants a companion, lifelong, or someone to make a commitment to both ways, they to him and he to them, but [PATIENT NAME] shouldn't settle for second best nor should he be the one that is the only important part of that relationship and I think he's going to learn that.  You know [PATIENT NAME], [NAME OTHER] is very different from your mother.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] is very different from ninety eight percent of the woman -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, they say you marry your mother, right?</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to, well we won't get into that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the thing is, yknow, [NAME OTHER] is very different from your mom.  She is not going to or can't or won't give you what your mother does for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good thing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is a good thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you say I don't want it but part of you is very used to that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, maybe I am used to it.  But that doesn't mean -</p>

<p>CG: It's a learned thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have to wean away from that kind of a relationship.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my head is clear enough now to see how sick, what my mother and I have or did, I don't want anything to do with it.  She, when I go over there, she offers me money or she offers this or that, I don't accept anything anymore, not because I don't need it but because I don't want her help at this point.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, but you know, you shouldn't cut off your nose to spite your face.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not and I'm very polite, I'm not rude but I just, I need to do this, she can pay my car insurance right now because I really can't, that's enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you know [PATIENT NAME], part of a mother's feeling good about herself is to be able to do for her children.  If she can't love you and hug you and physically show you that, I mean, it may be that she wants to do things for you and give you some money, slip you a twenty or pay for your insurance or call, yknow, you have to respect that too because she doesn't want to think of herself as what part of [PATIENT NAME]'s failures am I responsible for.  What did I do or what did I not do and so you've got to give her a break too and find that balance between, yknow, redefining your relationship with her so that you can not hurt yourself but not hurt her also.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I will tell you very truthfully that is exactly what's happening.  I do not cosign her bullshit.  If she is saying something that I disagree with, I don't play around.  I am not mean, I try and give her reasons for anything I say and I think it's working. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's no reason for you to be mean to her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not trying to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I know, I heard you say that.  There's no reason for you to be mean to her but the other thing is that at her age [PATIENT NAME] and given her problems, don't expect her to change.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it happens terrific but don't expect that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, no, it's not a matter of if it happens but it's not going to happen. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe it might, you may be surprised but don't count on it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do not harbor any animosity towards her.  You are very good at explaining that all these things she's done, she's done for love regardless of the impact, there's no question that she has done some serious damage to me, as far as I'm concerned but all these things that she did, I think that her goals were in the right place, her heart was in the right place.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think so.</p>

<p>CG: I don't think it was intentional.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, but -</p>

<p>CG: You never intend for you child to -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I agree but the think is all she did was for love, that may not be the case.  She has needs, she has problems, it may have been for her in some ways, right?  She has to get something out of it too.  She's not Mother Theresa right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So whether it's good or bad or pathologic or not, I mean she did things, I mean it's tough being a parent so she did what she could do but anyway I think there's a lot of promise there.  You know, from a practical standpoint, I don't know how often your mom calls you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a lot of contact with my parents right now, which is something I never ever did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Does she, if you don't want her calling you as much, okay, and I don't know, she doesn't harass you does she, on the phone or anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She called yesterday and today.  It was not a problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, that's not a problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But one of the things you can do is you can beat her to the punch line there, so like if you don't want her calling you if she's bothering you then you go and call her -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And say mom how are doing, I'll call you in a couple of days.  She'll feel more comfortable if she's not always reaching out for you, wondering what's going on with you, wondering if you're in trouble, if you're this, if you're that or the other, you know, so you can take control of some of that too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I stop by.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's fine, that's better yet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean, first of all, at least once a week I have an ulterior motive, I need to do wash and I go there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And who does the wash, you or her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, because you know -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She would if I asked her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know she would.</p>

<p>CG: You wouldn't have to ask her, you could just show up with your laundry and your mom would do it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right but, you know, and there are times when you don't have to, not every time you have to go there it's for a purpose either, other than say hey how are you doing, is everything okay, is dad okay, all right good, I'll see you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, not that you need to get your wash done or you need something, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you'll figure that out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the contact at this point is just like a zillion times more than my old life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The contact, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I hope that the quality or the depth of the relationship,  yknow, [PATIENT NAME], the sad reality, I don't want to say sad reality, you know, none of us here are going to be alive forever and statistically, yknow, for example, between you and your mom and your dad, they're going to leave this earth before you do and so, you know, once they're gone, I mean things change a lot and it's good to just make the time you have because you never know what's going to -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I agree.</p>

<p>CG: Didn't I say that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, no.  Yes and yes but in all honesty, I think it's harder than you think.</p>

<p>CG: It is hard but -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You just don't know.  I have a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p>CG: I do know because I've -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You've talked to her too but it's really challenging to be me and deal with her because she's so crazy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but part of it [PATIENT NAME] is, don't forget, she may have been crazy but you made her crazier.</p>

<p>CG: Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Repeat that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, in other words, it's not just that she was crazy and she made you crazy.</p>

<p>CG: Sort of.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so again, it's a dance here in a sense and so, but look, you can fix things for yourself and if she's still, she will see things and feel better herself, as well as she can and, again, she's got her own things but it's going to take a lot of work and effort but I think good things can come of this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In all honesty, what's happening is, that's happening but it's happening because I have my shit together.  It's happening because I go over there with a clear head and I talk to her and I treat her well and I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have it together today.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't make it sound like it's going to be a done deal for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>CG: Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because tomorrow you don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, you're right -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if you keep working at it, it will be.</p>

<p>CG: Make it a habit and, as I said to you when we were there the last time and your mom, I saw her in the hall and she was crying.  In fact, it was when you got out, the day you got out and we went there and I said to you, I said go say hello to your mom because I could see, as a mom, how she felt and I think her biggest concern and the reason she overcompensates is she's afraid that you're going to go backwards and wind up worse off than you were before because she said that to me, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, and I think by you being the bigger person and treating her differently that she'll lose that worry, son wise, I mean she's still going to be concerned but I think by her seeing you, yknow, standing on your own two feet and doing things and progressing and becoming a better person and leaving that life behind, that will make your relationship a little bit better.  As I told you, your mom, I'm like her best friend now and I, you know, it's difficult for me to be in a relationship.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that's today too.</p>

<p>CG: That's today too, right, and it's difficult for me because I can feel her pain as a parent, yknow, you don't, with the stuff I'm going through with my son, you know, I don't want that to happen but it's out of my control.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know -</p>

<p>CG: He's a grown man.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want to talk about cynical, how about this for thought, that you make [PATIENT NAME]'s mother out to be, well, let's assume from, continue from last time about this selfishness, let's say we're all selfish people, [PATIENT NAME]'s mother is not so much worried that poor [PATIENT NAME] would end up dead.</p>

<p>CG: She's worried about how that would make her look.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well how about how it would make her feel?</p>

<p>CG: And how it will make her feel -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because, again, I have to deal with burying a son, that's a terrible thing to have to deal with and nobody wants that and so it may not be so much about [PATIENT NAME], it could very well be about her.</p>

<p>CG: That's what -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Put the flip side of things -</p>

<p>CG: And I mentioned that to him, yknow, no mother wants to see their child go through this, no mother wants to stand back and go you're on your own, you know, sink or swim and she's worried two fold, you know, one for him and two for herself and that's metastasizes and now it's like that's all she can think about and she's constantly concerned and I think it makes [PATIENT NAME] back off instead of saying hey mom, you know, I'm doing good today, today's a great day, yknow, and kind of reinforcing a positive side to it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh sure, it's easy to look at somebody and say what's the matter, yknow, you look sad, you look tired, you look this, you look that, you need, you know, parents do that all the time and a lot of times it's their own thoughts being projected on to somebody else but, look, [PATIENT NAME] may surprise himself with how good his relationship with his mom could be but clearly you're not working necessarily with, there are problems there.</p>

<p>CG: Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's just put it that way.  </p>

<p>CG: I understand this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's like, yknow -</p>

<p>CG: I don't know [NAME OTHER] that well and I take her at face value because I'm not going to make judgements on her just like I didn't make judgements on [PATIENT NAME] but when I am with him and we're there, I feel uncomfortable because I can sense his, this is in the past because we haven't been there together for a month or so, two months, it made me feel uncomfortable as a parent to feel his rejection of her and whether you know it or not, you could, it's like watching a TV show, I could see her need for him to say hey mom, yknow, give her a hug or whatever and she was dying for it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: And he was oblivious to it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know if he was oblivious to it or maybe he -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oblivious.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe he wanted to withhold it because he wanted to punish her in some way.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The first one, oblivious.  I don't see that.  I understand and agree with what you're saying but I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you're getting all the time and not giving, you know, it doesn't -</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, there are people out there who, that phrase, you know, what can you do for me today.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, what's in it for me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so look, it's complicated but I think good things can happen.  I don't know what your needs are.  I think [PATIENT NAME] would be a, [PATIENT NAME] has the potential to be a good person to be with, to hang out with, and entertaining and fun, and enlightening and I think potentially that there's a good possibility that you could have a much deeper relationship other than a friendship but time will tell and, yknow, things change so, yknow, [PATIENT NAME]'s mom one day could think you're the best thing that ever happened to him and a week later would want nothing to do with you, yknow, for whatever reason, so that's what you're kind of up against but it's, you have to be committed and you have to be motivated and if you lose either of those, you know, you're kind of cooked.  I mean, you know, your marriage might have been salvageable at some point [PATIENT NAME], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, it might have been.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But yknow, when people stop trying, when people stop working, it's done.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My marriage was, yeah -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That ship sailed long ago, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Live and learn.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep and I did learn a lot.  I hope, I think. I'm actually in the process of contacting [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I want to make, I just want to take her out to lunch and I want to make a couple of amends.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good, that's nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Believe me it was a two way street but, yknow, my head is clear today and I recognize the mistakes I made and there was some big ones.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You get that from the twelve step problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is nice sometimes to go to somebody and say, yknow what, I was a jerk or I was wrong or I was whatever and just try to right it because again, yknow, not that you worry necessarily what they're saying about you or whatever, they may die or you may die tomorrow but it's nice, it's a nice process to go through just to kind of try to right things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's how I feel.  I mean there was a lot there at one time and it still would be nice to not totally ignore each other and have no contact whatsoever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, it's all a journey.  What are we doing here?  [PATIENT NAME]  and I go back a long time and really, not a whole lot of therapy for a long, long time because that's what it was all about and [PATIENT NAME] had several different diagnoses at different times.  He and I talked many, many times about what is it, this, that, or the other but for a lot of years [PATIENT NAME] was carried as a bipolar and was on lots of different medicines and is not presently taking medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Completely off.  The Celexa seems to be hanging on a little bit.  After like two days, I started to get lightheaded and dizzy and I take like a half a one and it goes away and then it will go three days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your, getting back to your mother, your mother would have my head.  This is the same situation.  [PATIENT NAME] is off of all medicines.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And doing great, [PHYSICIAN NAME] is a genius -</p>

<p>CG: [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If he's off medication and something happens to him, what kind of a quack are you, this guy has a diagnosis and you are not going to -</p>

<p>CG: I pay you -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Giving him the medicine that he desperately needs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't need medicine right now and I probably never will again.  Sometimes I wonder if I ever, I guess there was a period of time when I needed it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know either.</p>

<p>CG: You don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really don't, sometimes I wonder -</p>

<p>CG: You may have just needed a good kick in the ass.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hon, you know what, I hate to admit it but sometimes it's the truth.</p>

<p>CG: That's what my son needs, a swift kick but I think -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I just never -</p>

<p>CG: How long has it been since you've ever been like that?  Fifteen years?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Again, throughout all of that, of course, [PATIENT NAME] did his own prescribing and it just made things so complicated.</p>

<p>CG: True, it does, it clouds the mind and then you have no idea this would happen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well when you cloud your mind, you make bad decisions.</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You make poor decisions.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My mind was always clouded, one way or another.</p>

<p>CG: But I see a difference, yknow, it's only been two weeks and it's been gradual which is fine, I'd rather him take small steps then try to take this big leap and say okay now I'm superman the next day because I wouldn't buy it, I wouldn't believe it.  He knows I'm not that gullible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So dinner tonight, is that what you're doing?</p>

<p>CG: [PATIENT NAME] [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it a date or is it a -</p>

<p>CG: We're dressed alike.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Don't we look good?</p>

<p>CG: One of us got [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it a date or is it a, what did you call it?</p>

<p>CG: Hanging with friends.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hanging.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A date.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A date, so you behave yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Don't you worry.  I'm not going to [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p>CG: I had to straighten him out.  I had to straighten him out last night on the phone but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Difficult to describe but ecstatic might be a good start.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excited, not euphoric.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ecstatic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All I wanted was a chance and it looks like I'm getting that chance so, yknow what, if I screw up from here, then I guess I screw up from here but at least at this point I think I'm getting a chance and I really want to try and do the best with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're off all your medication?  Yes or no?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.   I take a half a Celexa if I start to feel lightheaded and it goes away.</p>

<p>CG: How can you tell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I expect that will go away.  How can you tell, that was cute.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will take a Restoril if I start to feel like crazy stress but I haven't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're taking medication kind of on an as needed basis, not on a daily basis.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Look, you know, DMS4 says that one manic episode once in your life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is classified as bipolar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bipolar, okay, that seems like an awful big loophole there.  Never had depression in your life, one episode of mania and you're bipolar, right.  So maybe you had one episode but that was it, you're done now.  I don't know [PATIENT NAME], I don't know, it was very unclear to me, in fact, truth be told, I didn't want to believe this bipolar diagnosis, I kind of went along with it because it was something to do I guess.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I came to you with it.  That's what they told me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I've told you many times, you know, that it was drug and alcohol and drug and alcohol and other things and personality and learned experiences and, look, I don't know, but time will tell because if you were bipolar, you don't escape that generally, forget about this once in a lifetime mania.  Typically, it's more depression and it's something that doesn't run away.  You can't escape from it and hide from it, it comes back to get you, so you'll find out, we'll find out together but for right now, I'm okay.  I don't know what you're gonna tell your mother if it matters to you because I don't want to hear from her about day to day what you're doing and what you're not doing, it's got to be all the medication -</p>

<p>CG: If she doesn't know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well she to some extent has this better living through chemistry philosophy too so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you know, not everything comes from -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know why I started doing drugs?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because they were there.</p>

<p>CG: Prescription drugs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Prescription drugs, because they were there and not only were they there, they were there in huge quantities.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] but -</p>

<p>CG: But you made a conscious decision to open the bottle and take the pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right.  [PATIENT NAME] I went to my friend's house, [PATIENT NAME] I went to my friend's house when we were kids and his parents were old, they were much older than, his parents often were mistaken for grandparents not parents, okay, they were just a whole lot older when they had him.  They had a lot of kids but I remember being in his house one time and he, well we looked in his medicine cabinet or whatever, actually it wasn't even a medicine cabinet it was like a medicine closet.  I said to him holy, now these were old people and they may have been [AGE] at the time but when you're, you know, [AGE] -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's old.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh they're old, they must need a lot of medicine because look how old they are but, you know, [PATIENT NAME] I never saw so many drugs in someone's house before.  I'm not saying they were narcotics.  There was everything, you know, from A to Z you name it, over the counter prescription or whatever.  I thought I have never seen a person have this much medicine in their house but [PATIENT NAME] they had six, seven, eight, nine, ten kids, I forget how many kids there were.  To my knowledge, just because the medicines were there, it doesn't mean they were there taking it and experimenting, I didn't, we didn't do that, you can so that oh you know, you grew up in those but you can't keep putting the responsibility on some else.  You have to say, you can go out on the street right now and go buy something or do something and that doesn't mean that it's -</p>

<p>CG: That person's fault.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  It's your decision.</p>

<p>CG: Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, you know, again, you take some responsibility too.  We can't blame mom for everything.  We can blame mom for a lot but we can't blame her for everything.</p>

<p>CG: Right, can't blame mom for that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so, look, happy birthday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I hope you have a good evening and listen, we'll hope for the best here for you.  </p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, how are you both?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't talk that fast.  Doing fine.  We had forgotten what time we had.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I had to call the office.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wasn't a big problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were in [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can see the color.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two and a half weeks is all.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh was that in the condo that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that we recently had bought.  She likes it now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good choice?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If we can afford it, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I could enjoy it more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's in a nice little surrounding, let's put it that way.  It's on the west coast of [DEIDENTIFIED], a new complex of both high rise buildings and some single family homes and some five story, I guess—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Townhouses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Townhouse type, so it's a mixture of things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Villas, they call them villas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's two towers and just across from the towers there's some shops, stores, couple restaurants, delicatessen and a bunch of upscale shops we probably wouldn't shop at.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's, a lot of boats, yachts—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yachts.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a yachting community, not a boating—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yachting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's lots of tourists, people walking around—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And once a week on Tuesday evening, they have an outdoor entertainment so people gather from all over the place to come.  The coffee shop is great, I love the coffee shop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Plus they have internet access in there and they also have coffee gelato, which reminds me of [DEIDENTIFIED], so I did have coffee a few times, well more than a few times and gelato a few times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we enjoyed it, actually she likes it too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	My daughter and son in law and grandchildren came down for a week so that was nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's really great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We just haven't furnished it all yet so that'll be with time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One day here, one day there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We've bought a few things but next time we go, we'll continue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this is a time share or is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is yours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We actually bought it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what the problem is because we, not the problem, we have a home here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A mortgage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And taxes and expenses and now I have a large mortgage and taxes and expenses in addition.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The real estate market has gone—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes it has and that was the reason that I was inclined something.  We looked over ten years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I ruled out certain areas that just are out of my price range, although I love the areas.  On the east coast I ruled out most everything because it's not affordable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [DEIDENTIFIED] and also [DEIDENTIFIED] area which I like and [DEIDENTIFIED] on the west coast but they're not affordable.  This I bought it, I don't know, 60 to 70,000 less than the owner had bought and he never lived in it, so I bought it, I guess it was like a year old but it never was occupied.  [INAUDIBLE] speculator.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just brand new.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, oh the people that last—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's some people that will furnish—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You guys broke it in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well some people—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The grandchildren.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they spill something always.  Eh, what do you expect?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what grandchildren do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, it's relatively close to all kinds of stores and shopping, all things going on, and there's a couple—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And your mother lives down there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that goes by.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we're able to get to different beaches and there's a pool, a couple pools in the complex itself so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds ideal.  It sounds like it was really a good place for your family to come as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But my son in law and daughter and the kids loved it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They want to move down there, except that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, right now [INAUDIBLE] vacation.  My son in law's parents rent a place on the [DEIDENTIFIED] shore for a week in the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The summer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he says okay now we've got our summer vacation and our winter vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're too young to think about those things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're only in their early 30's with two toddlers who they have to feed and clothe and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Educate and whatever so, in a dream, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh few other things then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That have to come up first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's for sure.  Well at least they can foresee the possible future.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, that's really nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said to them, at least my son is law has already had toys—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Motorcycles and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And a boat but now that the kids are along, a motorcycle and two boats, so the first boat and the second one, he actually made, I think he made money on both of them because he's a pretty good talker and when he bought, purchases things—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we always send [NAME OTHER] when we know we want something serious because he can talk people, not so much down the road, he knows he's getting, he just bought a car—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He just smiles and laughs at them and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's got a knack.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Gets the price down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was at an auction, it was for dealers—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	As soon as the dealer bought it, he went up and he was just looking, it's a car he's wanted, and he talked to him, he got it for like $8,000 cheaper than it would have been had it left and gone to the showroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he was there, he talked to the guys, talked to the boss, made a deal, picked it up last night, so this is the type of person we're talking about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Anyway, right place, right time, right words.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I say about him.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's good with the negotiating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I'm taking it then, with the vacation and everything else that you've been feeling well still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'd like to think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	However, you'll have to ask [NAME OTHER] how she thinks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I ask you first, I take that assumption but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was he on vacation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's good.  I mean, probably on vacation he's better than he is at home in that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Less distractions.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I mean he's still going to the auctions, going to the flea market stuff—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh limited.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Taking things in.  I mean he's selling stuff but it's, he hasn't condensed it to or organized it to a location in the house so the house is still, I feel, overwhelmed.  I mean I'm still working on hospital bills and stuff like that and now it's income tax time, we haven't even started that and keeping up with all the paperwork that, I mean it's a daily, you know, I was a secretary so I, you know, and I feel like my own secretary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The paperwork from when I was here a year and a half ago because basically it coverage that we had, well didn't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It only covered twenty days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Covered twenty days and I was in, whatever it is—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have coverage for so it's slowly working up into both hospitals.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, this hospital I have to call back because I think they put in a code that the insurance company, in emergency room, it made it look like an appointment or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're slowly getting it all, we worked something out with them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we've got, yeah, I mean I have no—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not overwhelming, it's just—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We'll I've worked it so that I can pay a certain amount per month because there's no way I'll ever get that from the insurance company because there's a limit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, there's a cap on the thirty day hospital between his two stays here and his time at [DEIDENTIFIED], it was over.  I mean that was over a three month period—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember nothing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was in and out of the hospital, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That part of—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that I'm dealing with and then the, so I'm trying to find space and all my space that I used to be able to have is gone and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah and then now it's the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the kids come in and I move everything and we all eat dinner, it wasn't a problem.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it will be tonight again, my daughter is coming over.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I just feel I can't get, you know, I can't even clean the house, it's just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, what happens is when you start with bills or with income tax, you don't want to move them around—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You want to put it out there, try to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE] is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's coming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two and a half weeks away.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we know that we start late normally and it takes a lot more, we do it ourselves—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, she does 90% of it.  I used to do it and then once, once, well years ago—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Kids couldn't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I want complete silence.  She can still watch TV and do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just can't operate because I'll forget or miscalculate, not a mathematical error but I'll forget something that I want to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, when you concentrate, you have to concentrate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have to concentrate, she's a little more, so anyway, this takes time because we get interrupted naturally with other things like a phone call or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well sometimes this and that or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Dinner or whatever—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she likes to leave things and continue on the next time that we chance which could be the next day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you've taken over my working portion of the table.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you only have one space that work at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is the dining room table.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is your setup at home?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have a table that's my daily mail and a table that's my collectable mail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, let him understand that the house isn't small.  We have a living room and two family rooms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two family rooms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two of them and four bedrooms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four bedrooms, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And one bedroom could be used for—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, it's not that we don't have the space.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We could just move it to another location.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have like an office you could set up?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We have a library.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sort of, yes, we have the computer set up and, yes, some of the things could be organized up there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If I could clear off that table.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have like a card table you could put in the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's a desk similar to this in the library.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not that big, yeah, it's like half that size.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That could be used for that purpose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That way you can leave it if you don't get it done.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But it's not, but the thing is that it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't blame me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it's both of us, I mean mine is paperwork, his is piles of stuff for the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's clutter from the flea markets.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it's all clutter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's not.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's just he, I mean it's what he can't fit in his car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or what I haven't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or what we're not taking to the flea markets.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What I haven't looked through yet to decide what I'm going to do with.  Sometimes I'll buy something and I'll start going through it but then I get interrupted with whatever.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Going to [DEIDENTIFIED] but when I come back I'll continue when I get a chance.  Eventually, it all gets relocated.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's no counter space in the kitchen either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds like you're working on some projects together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] one thing, like taxes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, we usually do it.  I kind of help her get everything organized and for the last few years, she's done most of it but I will double check to make sure we haven't forgotten things and, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like what I'm hearing though too is that you get some things from the flea markets with the intention of going through them, you get distracted—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But there's [INAUDIBLE] watch a TV show or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But before you've gone through the things you've brought in, do you find yourself getting more things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, yes, and sometimes no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it sounds like the main goal might be just to make sure that before you bring new things in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get rid of stuff you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, that's easier said sometimes than done and when we did get home, we got home last Saturday and I purposed went out of my way not to do anything because I wanted to go through mail—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I wanted to get some things moved from before we went away, so I just like hung around the house for three days and I got a lot accomplished but when you look around, in reality—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She says no but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have a couple spaces in the house that are just like, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have a basement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Organized and clean and the way that you like them to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like for example the living room, is that like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The living room, well, it's still got Christmas stuff in it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The living room is fairly clean.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Only because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's nothing in there—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Only because before Christmas he had taken over the living room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but I cleared it out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because we were having his brother and family at Christmas and I wanted the Christmas tree up which is all I got up this year because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, then maybe it is that you just agree that there's a couple places in the house that are for company that need to stay organized and can't, they're off limits for clutter or taxes or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the bedroom is off limits.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That has, well all upstairs is pretty much, the three bedrooms that the kids used to have, you know, two of them have the bedroom and then was the spare room when his mother or aunt would come.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or my daughter brought the kids.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And now, yeah, the kids, she was here the other day and they used all three bedroom, so those bedrooms are not cluttered at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And our bedroom is only slept in, you know, [INAUDIBLE] done, put away—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Suitcases, I mean but it's bedroom stuff, it's clothes and stuff and the computer.  I mean upstairs is basically intact.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you don't live in the upstairs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, not at all.  I never go back up until, I mean I come down in the morning and I never go back up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I go up on the computer.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have to go up today because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess one of the other things that might give you an appearance of less clutter is to use one of the spaces upstairs that isn't trafficked, you know, to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes but then [INAUDIBLE], see I'm not, like I said, when I come down in the morning, I never go back upstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So if, still, it's one of things, out of sight, out of mind—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I would have a problem dealing with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you've got to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if your clutter was out of sight, out of mind, then it might be less disturbing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, for the same reason, it's something—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But then he's, but this stuff goes in and out of the car—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To the garage or the basement.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's only a temporary—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's just another—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do I tell her, this is only a, what's the terminology—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is only the staging area.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a staging area.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which means I keep walking around, see now, okay—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't go downstairs—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or go open the garage, or it'll go wherever it has to go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Here's [INAUDIBLE].  He has [INAUDIBLE], so he has a bunch of tables and stuff—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, a staging area that he uses and then he takes everything upstairs and puts it in the car.  Well, now with all the stuff in the car from the flea market, he's got to take that out and stage that so he empties the car.  So okay, so he came home—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we went to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah, we went to [DEIDENTIFIED], we cleared out, we actually got a ride in the van and he takes everything out and it's in the kitchen and it's baseball card show stuff he had done.  So that's going to go downstairs, I know, that's not a problem.  And the stuff in the kitchen is going to go back in the car, well it didn't and then he got another card show set up for Sunday so he said well I'll just leave everything in the kitchen, why bring it downstairs and then have to bring it back up.  So now I have stuff from the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday it'll all be gone, it will be, it has to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it's the staging area, where it is now is not a good one because it's not the staging area, having a staging area, it's where the staging area is which is the kitchen and dining room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we have a fairly large kitchen with a center island and whatever few things that are in the kitchen are in the center island area, so the kitchen itself is useful but she likes to turn around with pots and pans, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Use the center island.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It is a kitchen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's only a temp—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I do—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean those things will be out of there tonight, tomorrow, because I have to put them in the car tomorrow night in order to go use them on Sunday, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then when they come back, they won't go there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They'll go down the basement but that's a temporary, I bring them from the outside, I put them in and I bring them down the basement.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But then the stuff that's in the car—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I run out of time, so it sits and then the rest gets done the following day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean I guess the joy of bring retired is having some flexibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm not on any deadline.  She thinks I am.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I'm not asking for a deadline.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think you want, you want your trafficked space to be useable, the place that you are most of the time to be—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The room that he, like he said, we have two family rooms, the house came with a family room and it was a new construction in a development and one of the options was to have what they called a bonus room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A second family room.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we had, when we [INAUDIBLE], we had added on a family room there and it was so expensive, to add on a bonus room under new construction was so cheap it was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With a full basement.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With a full basement, you had to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he basically has that room for his TV.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That room is pretty organized because I don't have much in it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, except for tables.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Except for a few magazines.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that's half of it and then the other, there's two doors that enter it, so he basically has that where he sits and watches TV.  The other side right now is build up, I have a treadmill in there and then the kids toys are in there now.  That actually could be organized for a staging area.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, you both agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's convenient to the garage, to your car.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's on the first floor basically, so it's convenient.  It's better than being upstairs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or at times, I could actually pass them out the window to the car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well then that sounds like a good compromise if you both agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we should be able to do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It would get it off the kitchen table.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you have to put a little sign up in that little area, staging area.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Staging area, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just call it that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what, basically you run out of time in a day because there's more things in life than just attending flea markets or shows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need a sign for the kitchen that says this is a kitchen not a staging area and a sign in that other area, this is a designated staging area.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	My daughter, when I talked to her today, she said, and she's coming tonight again and she's, she just finished peeling wallpaper off her kitchen walls in her house.  She says ma, when I come tonight, maybe we'll do yours because five years, four years ago, I guess it is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You started—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I started, I wanted to paint the family room and I had painted it before we moved in so that's fourteen years ago, so but I put a border up.  So I did the kitchen and I painted that, got all that done and then as I started the family room, because the ceilings weren't together, it's one of those, I started—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was border all around.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The paper was coming off.  Some of the front, if I get the front off of it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you put it on real good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, in past it's always been wallpaper but the top of it would come off, the back might stay there and you wash it down and it, you know, comes off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This I can't get the front off so my daughter says well I'm in the mood now, we'll do it tonight and I said [NAME OTHER] if you want to do anything, do my taxes.  We've got to get [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He just said he wants his aunt to come and stay for a few days.  Now this aunt is but someone he really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My [AGE] aunt that's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I know we have to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's almost deaf but very sharp, very sharp.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I said she cannot come in the house the way it is because first of all, because of all the staging areas I don't clean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She can't hear but she's sharp, knew who was presidential—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you plan things like that, you agree on it mutually, then that gives you the motivation and the drive to kind of get things organized.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, if you plan people coming over or, you know, you honor Christmas, it's going to get the living room cleaned, it's going to get things cleaned.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you share the common want to have it be nice for your aunt, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have a common.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A common goal.  I just, I was, we got talking, I'm thinking, I'm going back, this has nothing to do with what we're talking about but three or four months ago, at one time you asked me about sleep and how I was doing.  For the most part, I've been sleeping fairly well but I went through a spell a few months ago that I just woke up with all kinds of crazy dreams, more nightmares than dreams.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, you've always that your whole life.  He wakes, he doesn't wake up—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't get continuous sleep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he doesn't wake up so much as he yells out in the night, like from the dream, you know, he talks in his sleep basically but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But it's not talking, it's only when it's a bad dream—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the other night, I could hear, I was downstairs and I could hear him from upstairs and then sometimes, I mean he curses and everything else.  Now when he was working, sometimes it would be oh yeah, I [INAUDIBLE], he'd remember the dream.  Oh yeah, so and so wouldn't do something on the job or whatever, you know, but I don't know what he dreams about now, probably me yelling about the stationary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Getting things organized too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping okay now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  You know what really made it much better?  We went away on vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just prior to the vacation, I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think he—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Basically my problem is I don't believe in alarm clocks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I'll be awake looking, say I want to be up at six o'clock, oh it's four thirty, all right it's five thirty, then I'll jump up, so the alarm clock, I don't even know if it works.  I have it set but I'm always up just prior to the alarm clock.  I don't that that's normal but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe part of it is just the idea that the vacation allowed yourself to, I mean had you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] schedule, I didn't care about an alarm clock, I got up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe that just speaks to the idea that when your life is so regimented, just like working adds pressure and you need to have some vacation time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need to allow yourself to have a couple days where you just—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But that's what [INAUDIBLE] is supposed to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, at this point, I think I need—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he's so driven.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you've created a job—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In your retirement which is good because you need—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In my spare time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To keep active but at the same time, just like if you were working a job, you'd have weekends off or you'd do this and that, you know, you need to have some time that, you know, is just relaxation time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, yeah, like Monday, Tuesday and Friday—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're absolutely right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Monday, Tuesday and Friday, he basically doesn't, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and sometimes Sunday, he'll do flea markets or there'll be shows or whatever, but Monday, Tuesday and Friday there's basically nothing planned but every Monday, Tuesday, Friday, like just before we came here, he went to an auction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In [DEIDENTIFIED], up in [DEIDENTIFIED] so we had to get up early.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I'll only stay—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You only stayed for half of it but still, I mean he still is driven to the point that gee is there, I have free time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean life's too busy but I guess, you know, with everything that you're doing—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh I think it's wonderful, don't get me wrong, I think it's wonderful he does it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'd be good to have like some, and I know that the auctions aren't necessarily business, it's not a job—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a hobby and it's become a business in a sense but it's not your original business.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it'd be good to have some days off where you just kind of, I mean have a day where you can sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well that's what I, last week it was like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I made him, I made him go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yesterday, the last day and a half, yeah, I didn't go to the flea market.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you enjoy it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes and no, I'm not, we did see a show, excellent, I really enjoyed it, 42ND Street.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I've seen four times, we've seen it in [DEIDENTIFIED], in [DEIDENTIFIED] playhouse—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And in [DEIDENTIFIED], so four times—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's an excellent production.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But it's been a long time, because I think the first three we saw it, I think we saw it three times in four years, so it was like one of those—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, that part of the day and a half I enjoyed.  The gambling, I'm not a gambler so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I like my slots.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I played like, what did I do Wednesday, we got there Wednesday—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I went on a machine and it wasn't the type of machine, it was a poker machine, I made one pull, I won something, I cashed out and that was it, I didn't play anymore.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What he usually does, well in [DEIDENTIFIED] he goes around, he sees tickets, like people leave 2 cent tickets here and 5 cent tickets or they forget to take it out of the machine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He'll do that and in [DEIDENTIFIED] he goes around and goes, doing one of these, he goes around and looks to see if there's coins left and he always comes out ahead more so than I do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This time I played very, very, very little.  I really don't like to play those slot machines.  To me it's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the tables—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The only machines I like are the lower priced nickel because I don't think you can win no matter what you play, the odds are in their favor and the longer you play you're going to lose, I don't care what game you're playing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We'll you got to listen to the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The house is the only one that wins so I'll, the only things that I'll   play are a low priced poker, a multiple poker, in other words, you get three to five to ten games and you will have the decision rather than no decision to hold certain cards or not hold.  [INAUDIBLE], they don't pay off like slot machines but at least I don't feel like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You don't lose like you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Blindly you just pull a handle.  If I lost, okay, I shouldn't, I should have held this card instead of that card, it's my own fault.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you have to understand that his winning and losing is less than a dollar on either end.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I won—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This time you did well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I won but I only played $5, I only put in $5 the first day I was maybe 60 cents I had or something, I didn't care and then yesterday three different times I played, I lost in the morning but then by the afternoon I won a dollar and another $3, so it was about $5 I had.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I walk away, I don't play continuously, I play for—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I walk away from one machine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I'll play 15 minutes, then there's entertainment, music, I'll watch the band.  This time I didn't.  I usually go to the boardwalk and watch people and watch things going on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah but I mean like the other day, we got there at two o'clock, two thrity and at four thirty, five o'clock, I guess five o'clock, we were having, we hadn't eaten lunch but we had an early dinner because then we get, we stayed at [DEIDENTIFIED] and the other show is down the other end of the boardwalk at [DEIDENTIFIED] so we walked it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a nice walk.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, four thirty, five o'clock till ten o'clock at night, you're not at the machines, you know, we played a little at [DEIDENTIFIED] but basically you're doing things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always went to the room and looked at the [INAUDIBLE] looked at sports, read newspapers, did my—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like it was relaxing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did my sodoku puzzles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think that you're doing pretty well.  Do you need prescriptions today?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, we're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're good, we have, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And no other new medications, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The medication you need is from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], the Lipitor.  You have to get that when you go for a check up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  So I'm doing pretty good with—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With taking it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With taking it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's so good on vacation at taking them because I put them in the bathroom—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, why don't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And when he shaves, he takes them but if I put them in the bathroom at home, he doesn't do it because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm thinking about where I'm going, what I'm doing and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	5:30 in the morning is too early to take them so he doesn't take them, then he'll come home and go, oh I forgot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I forgot to take them, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, so it's like pulling teeth with him sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't think I've missed a day in quite a while.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You've been pretty good, one day maybe but that's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well, I mean maybe those days that it's too early and they're left in the bathroom, maybe keeping some—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, they're actually on the kitchen table.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I was going to say next to the orange juice in the refrigerator.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, the thing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do have one pill, one eyedrop in there, that's the allergies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you're going to be going out, maybe just leave your dose in the car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, leave them on the front seat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, but he's not, no, you see, he's very regimented.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have a little container with seven days of the week, it's easier that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough, fair enough.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I guess we just need to set up another visit, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, I want to use the phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.</p>

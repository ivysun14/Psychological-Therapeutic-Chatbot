<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so, uh, so you had your presentation on Friday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, how did it turn out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well, probably got a, uh, like a weak shock.  Um, there, like, there's, uh, like, strong, uh, shock waves, and like weak shock waves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Finally, we were able to see a weak shock actually today, which was pretty much all we were going for at this point, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it was, I was, kind of, the whole project wasn't really thought out too well by our professor before he, um, he asked us to do it, like, we were supposed to have a, uh, wind tunnel, a super sonic wind tunnel, running for 30 seconds using a normal compressor, like, from Home Depot?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ended up having to hook it up to 600 psi in, like, it's connected to this huge compressor and we barely saw anything, though we saw some stuff, so, and it was only for a couple seconds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, shouldn't they know that, that you'd have to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You would think, I mean, but I, like I was talking to this other professor, it's like, yeah, sometimes they don't, you, you think that they're smart but they don't really think things out too, too much, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I mean, super sonic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is probably hard to achieve.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  Worst part was, today I was, we were testing and I forgot to put my, uh, head, ear protectors on, which was, uh, ears are still ringing a little bit from that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Aye, aye, aye.  And, you're the team captain now, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just happy that it's almost over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Hm.  And, how about your other classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, they are going well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a, uh, a project due Friday night that I'm going to be working on, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, and, that is, like, the last big, uh, big thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you're done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have some exams, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but after finals, you're done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, uh, and then what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have, uh, I got offered a job where I'm working now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is, uh, I'm just taking it for the time being because I really haven't had the chance to really go job hunting, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, interview and stuff like that.  I've just been focusing on school mostly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know.  My, uh, my dad said that he could get me a job eventually.  I just want to, uh, read some of the code books and stuff like that before -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where does he work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, he works at this company, he does like mechanical, like forensic engineering, stuff like brakes, like he finds out who is to blame, like what happens -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just trying to read, read up on, like, the code books so I can hit the ground running when I start there.  I don't want to make it, make it look like he just got me a job because I'm his son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Okay.  But you're mechanical, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  So, you excited?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That you're finished?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I mean, I guess if I had a chance to really think about it I might be excited, but I've just been, like, wandering around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Yeah, no, I, I got you.  All right.  And, what do you do, have you had any time for fun this semester?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, I mean, some, some fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Just had a, uh, formal in my fraternity, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was a lot of fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where was that held?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, went on a little cruise around [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, uh, kind of a mess though, like two people, two couples were too drunk and they went the wrong way off, after we got off the buses, and they didn't make it on the boat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Aye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think, that you were going to say they fell off the boat, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I once went on that type of thing and, uh, it was lousy because they had a band that was deafening.  A band, or DJ or something.  But, it was freezing outside, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There was no pleasant place to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's kind of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got a little lucky with the weather being nice and all the sun, it's, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  But this was probably a nicer, a nicer set up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, it was all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?  You go by the Statue of Liberty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think I remember seeing that at some point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, uh, it was bad, this one kid, uh, ended up passing out in the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, on the bus, on the way back.  And the bus driver there was knocking on the door, trying to get him to wake up.  He's, ended up having to pry the door open, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Aye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was a bit of a mess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Aye.  Oh, oh.  I don't understand the fascination with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, neither do I.  I mean, I drank a little bit, but, I mean, it wasn't like, I wasn't trying to get really hammered because, uh, I wanted to remember a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's crazy.  It's crazy.  Um, what do they, uh, what do they have in place to try monitor the drinking at the frats?  They have anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I mean, basically, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, like, they try to, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because most -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Teach you.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most college students are under age.  Some of them have rush.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most of those people should not be drinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Correct.  And they, the way, I guess the way that they monitor it is by cracking down, like, really hard if they catch somebody.  So, people are kind of really careful about it.  There is no, like, no people checking IDs.  For the most part, it's kind of, uh, we keep an eye on everybody.  Like, the worst thing that happened was the last semester, um, we had a mixer with the sorority, and this one brother, who was still in the house that didn't go to the mixer ended up, uh, having a party without telling anybody.  And this, this kid was on the rage and he got really drunk and he fell down a flight of steps and, like, he got really, uh, really hurt, and ended up having to go to the hospital and he obviously, probably could have died, like, a flight of steps is probably about, I'll make it 20 steps, and he fell from the top.  So, we're on, we got in trouble with the university for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I remember years ago, a kid fell out a window and died.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that ruckus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So, I can't understand why they, you know, they don't have more, kind of, checks and balances.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, in, in the last couple years it really has changed a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They go on as many party, like fraternity parties, and they're run a lot more, I guess, tightly than they were in the past, so.  Like, we're not allowed to have kegs anymore, and stuff like that, so, anything that is like mass quantities, so, I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Okie dokie.  I, uh, it's no different, I have a friend who is a plastic surgeon, and he is on the staff at [DEIDENTIFIED], and, uh, you know, he says whenever they have their Homecoming week or whatever, he is like sewing people up because they fall down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this is even the alumni, let alone -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Students, you know.  Aye.  All right.  So, let us see.  We haven't met in two months.  Uh, what else is going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I mean, nothing much, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who did you take to the formal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I took this girl that I've been talking to for a while, and it was, uh, it went pretty well, I mean, I mean, so far.  See where it's, where it's going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What year is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, she is a senior too, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  What is she going to be doing after graduating?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, she doesn't have a job yet but, I mean, she is graduating from business school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  You know it's a bad time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You going right into that.  She might want to go to graduate school because, if she is so inclined.  Hm.  Okie dokie.  And, medication wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's, it's going well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think everything is still good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you always on the same Luvox, it's always the same looking pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For, for a long time, because I remember they used to be, like, circle pills -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, a really long time ago.  But, um, I, I think once we moved up to, I think, we may have increased it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then they were, like, uh, more oval shaped, actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Any ways, it looks like it's the same company.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  They now make a branded Luvox.  A Luvox CR which, um, you know, I've had a good experience with.  And it would be covered under your insurance because there is no generic Luvox CR.  But, if you're doing fine on what we're on, I think, you know, we can leave it, what you're on.  Okay.  All right.  So, what are you going to be doing at this, I'm going to write and talk, so what are you going to be at, uh, at this job once you graduate?  Are things going to be any different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it will probably be a little different.  And, I don't really plan on staying there for too long.  Probably, actually, try a little harder since I'm working full time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, really, kind of, uh, I was really only good at the things that I wanted to do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is kind of a bummer, because I, I don't really like coding, like programming too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ah, just think it's really boring.  So, whenever they gave me something like that, I'd take a little bit longer on that.  And then when they gave me something I actually liked to do, did that quick and they would, I mean, it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what would you like to be doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I actually still don't know.  I mean, that was something, like, I've been thinking about for a while, uh, like, I mean, I like engineering.  I guess, but, certain types of engineering are really boring too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  What is the job market like for engineers at the moment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it got, it got hit by, by everything that happened, but it's still, still there.  I mean, it's not, it wasn't as bad as, like, finance, or some of the other careers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your supply, you're probably fine on, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, still functioning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, try again.  How are your friends doing as far as finding jobs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, a couple of them found, uh, found jobs and some of them are, like, planning on looking right after they finish with the exams and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what I plan on doing.  A bunch of people are applying to grad schools and going into, uh, trying to go alternate route, teaching -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something that, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even from engineering?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, not from engineering but, um, just like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like Science majors and English majors?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, majors.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  So, how would that be, working with your father?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it'll probably, it'll probably be all right, um, I worked with him once before as in intern.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, how big of a place would it be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's a, it's a pretty big company.  I mean, he just got put in charge of, like, the whole Eastern, like, region.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's nepotism, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, basically.  Actually, I mean, well, I don't want to come in looking like I only got it, I only got the job because I'm his son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So, this is April, May.  Well, I think that people might think that initially, but, I think if you're good, you know, then people will think, "Oh, that's why."  All right, anything else we should talk about?  The gambling remains, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, yeah, I have, I haven't been gambling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's good.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of a, I mean, the way I was thinking about it, like, whenever I, whenever I get like the urge to gamble or whatever, I, I actually, kind of, kind of like that, like that feeling, just the, I mean, it feels like it kind of makes me stronger every time I, I don't do it.  So, I mean, it's the way I've been thinking about it.  Like, whenever I get the urge to gamble or anything like that, I just, kind of, feels like it gets easier every time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is good.  That is very good.  Well, you have to be vigilant, because it's easy, easy to talk yourself into, "Well, I could probably get away with it this time."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or, it wouldn't hurt if I just, you know,</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing, like, I'm worried about is, like, when I actually do have a lot of money, I know, like, it's easy to talk myself out of it right now just because, like, how am I going to gamble when I have to pay rent or something like that.  Like, I don't even have the option, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, like, uh, I don't know what, like when I have too much money -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you're a young, single person and your, your living expenses are modest, you're going to have all this, this, potentially disposable income.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  But, I, that's, sure I'll be able to, uh, convince myself, otherwise, like, just, kind of, I, I think it was, a lot of it was just being depressed before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, it was like, I don't know, it was just a way to get, like, uh, an adrenaline rush or something like that.  And, and the more depressed I got, the more I wanted to gamble, because, like, you're not always losing, like, you've still got, like, uh, the rush from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well, I think once you start making money, you know, you might try and put it in safe and diversified investments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, then, someday, have money saved up for a house.  Do you have a lot of school loans?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, only $10,000, which is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy, that's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fantastic.  Well, then, you know, you could knock those down and, and, uh, be saving for a house or car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> True.  I mean, uh, I don't think, uh, I mean, I think I'm pretty much past that.  Like, it was a good, good lesson, I mean, I guess, rather learn it when I didn't have a lot of money to lose in, later on in life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's always, you know what, it's always better to have a set back like that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even an outright failure, young in life, because you can much more easily recoup.  You know, it's just like these people who, um, are closer to retirement than me, who had all their money in stocks, you know, it was a disaster.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, it was a disaster for me, it was a super disaster.  You know, it's a bummer for me, but it's a disaster for them.  So, you know, yes, better to identify it, address it, correct it now, and know you will feel no ill, no pain from it.  But, yeah, if you had saved up enough money to buy a house or something, and you blew that, uh, with gambling, it would be awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's kind of, I mean, I was thinking about the, this kid that kind of got me into playing online poker and stuff, he won, like, he won over $10, I mean he won over $100,000 over the course of one summer on online poker.  But, he ended up losing, like, a lot more than I did working [INAUDIBLE], just like the fact that he dropped out of college, like, he didn't even, like, fail out, he just stopped going.  And, uh, dropped out, and now he's just, like, living with his girlfriend who doesn't, like, went to, like, massage school or something like that and is not really doing anything, like, he just smokes, like, every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Smokes pot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, it's kind of like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, what happened to the gambling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, he still gambles all the time.  It's just like, I, I saw, like, the path that, in, back in high school, we were, like, in Future Business Leaders of America, whatever.  We came, we came to college and then that happened and he's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's been derailed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I, um, I had a roommate in college that was a very smart kid and he, uh, became a pot head and he just didn't do well, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, I don't know what happened to him either, but when he tried, he was, you know, excellent.  But, yup, so I've seen that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, he has two problems that are keeping him, keeping him back.  Yeah, I mean, oh, you know, they, it's awful, because they have, uh, the poker on television, everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They make it look like, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, more people, many more people suffer, and harms them, than are, are, you know, big successes.  Few people win a lot of money, and most people lose a lot of money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one thing, like, when I went down to Atlantic City, that was when I realized, like, I, I, you know, I looked around the table, like, at all these guys were like, 35, like, just sitting there, they had been there, like, for hours.  And I was looking around and they all knew each other, like, they knew people in the casinos, like, that was a group of friends I was, like, do I really want this to be me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, quite a, quite a seedy group.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, you know, even people who are smart, intelligent and everything, in the long haul, most of them don't do well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There was this, uh, this one guy that, I was, I actually read this, uh, story online.  This, uh, I don't know if you heard about that ship that was, uh, like, boarded by pirates and held the captain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, uh, this guy, who apparently makes a lot of money playing, uh, Black Jack?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He offered to, like, fly, like, all their families out to, uh, um, out to somewhere on, on a vacation or stuff like that, like, probably just at that time, like, all his winnings, he, like, uh, helps people out.  Like, people that are, I don't know, he reviews a bunch of stories, like people submit, like, uh, their struggles to him and he picks somebody that deserves it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I mean, that's pretty nice, but, I mean, there are not many people like that, that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He is the Bill Gates of the gambling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  All right.  So, let us figure on two months, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

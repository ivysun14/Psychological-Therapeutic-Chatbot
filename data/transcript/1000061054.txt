<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: This is the fifth interview. This is interview number five.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Want some gum?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no. I'm not supposed to chew. I have a temporary-a bridge for one tooth that I had put on last week and I was chewing gum and it came loose. So I had to go to my dentist for a special trip and he re-glued it. It was terrible because it was stuck all over my tooth before I went in. I decided to give up gum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are things going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, with my friends, I guess pretty good. I've still been talking to them. Everything's been at a pretty rapid pace. I guess it's getting more rapid because of moving now. I don't know, I just-I think right now I've become closer to my friends than I am my family. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Lately, I've just felt like I couldn't talk to my two sisters that are around. This one girlfriend of mine-I just felt much closer to her and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I called her up the other night-we were talking-and I called her up. After we hat started our conversation, I told her but... I think now-or you've at least gotten the idea that from what I said that I kind of panic when something changes. And I was just thinking about how I was relating to my two sisters and I was talking to my girlfriend and she said something that kind of calmed me down. She said "You need different people at certain times". I really can't even put it in the right words. She said you just need people at different times-other people. So, I wasn't worried about it too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As far as like it was really nice to have some friends you could be close to but sort of like you're betrayed your family some way, somehow if you were close to these friends. [2:17]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I felt bad. I was hoping it wouldn't be a lasting thing, you know? But I think with one of my sisters-there's this-I don't know. We're changing and we're both just going in complete opposite directions and the only reason I think I can talk to her sometimes is because she's my sister. But I really don't like the things she says or she does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like there's really much in common with your family.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she's just really insensitive to everything. Really, she is. I mean, she's a good person but she just-I think she's mainly interested in her life and her thing. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of feels like some of your friends, at least, know you better than your family.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can talk to them about much more things than I can talk to my sisters about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you feel like you ought to be closer to your sisters (inaudible 03:16).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it must be something with my whole family because my mother-the other day she called and she said "Why don't you and Adrian come over and stay overnight?" and she had already planned what she-she would meet us downtown and everything and I just-she said everything so fast and I kind of had to think what I had planned for that day and everything. And I said "Well, I'll call you back later on in the evening or else tomorrow" and she-I guess she got hurt because I didn't say we'd come out right away. But I don't know, I talked to her later. She's-she's super-sensitive, you know? I asked-I told my sister about it and she said not to even think twice about it because she does the same thing to her. But I just felt like my mother and my father were pressuring me again, running my life, when she did that little thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like she didn't realize you had all kinds of things happening already before she called.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she just gets hurt if you say "No" or "I'll call back tomorrow."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like instead of seeing it like it's just your life and you have to do it, like your rejecting her or something like that. [04:38]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what she did? She sent me some money in the mail then yesterday. I don't know if she did it because she had extra money or she just-I don't know why she did it but I felt twice as bad because here I get this money in the mail today and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't-you don't think she was trying to remind you that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that's your daughterly obligation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...she gave me some money over the weekend which would usually be enough for the whole week. Then to have her send me some.... What day is it? Tuesday already? I don't know. I was just kind of wondering if she was doing it to make me feel bad or what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It had that effect, anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like "You'd better remember you're my daughter and I take care of you. If I want to see you, you'd better come."</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right away. Does it seem to you like she was trying to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...get you upset?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think she was trying to get me upset but I-you know, the more I think about it, I really don't know. I just kind of feel bad because she's there with my father and he's virtually impossible to live with. He's-I really feel sorry because she lives with him now alone and everything so I guess she has friends her age but they can't get together, you know, (inaudible 05:59) so I guess she looks forward to seeing us. I don't know, I just kind of feel pulled around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she really needs you to be there as a buffer almost. [06:13]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe just Adrian, I think. Because when Adrian is there he just fills up everybody's time and maybe she-she has him now, so....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of hard now you sort of feel like you've abandoned her in a bad situation or something. If you would stay there, then she'd have you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. She likes to see Adrian, but I just feel bad again because she gets so tired from playing with him a lot. And she won't-she won't say she's really tired. She says she loves to do it for the baby and everything, but she won't say she's tired when she can't take it anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I have to kind of say "I'm going to go now" because of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like she puts you in positions where you have to feel like you've hurt her. Acting (inaudible 07:10).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well she's kind of like a real big martyr at things like that. I mean, I think she does it to my other sisters, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When it happens each time it sort of sounds like you feel bad for her each time even though you know she's sort of a martyr type.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel bad she has to do it because she is the martyr type.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It also sounds like in a way that you're pretty afraid of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid of hurting her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Like letting her get too tired with Adrian.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because she's hurt all the time. I mean, I see my mom-she's in the middle of-she's a punching bag, too because her parents are still alive and they're old and they think about themselves a lot and they want her to do all these things for them and just react towards them. And my dad is there and my sisters and I just kind of think she's-I don't know. I think we come to her when we want something done, actually, or we want her to-I don't know-just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, it seems like (inaudible 08:28) the martyr for good reason, actually. That she really has a lot going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, good and bad, I'd say. Sometimes I think she does too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You always wonder if she's sort of putting it on but (inaudible 08:42) she really is pulled by everybody in a direction to everybody. You mother doesn't have much of her own stuff now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she's-you know, like she's had four kids. Something I've told her before, like her whole life is centered around the mother role and the kids. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of hard for her to get used to not having (inaudible 09:06).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told her last week because she's always-you know, she gets herself mixed up. She calls herself mom because we call her mom. So she said to Adrian, "Come to Mommy", like that, she says "I mean, Grandma." I said "It's okay, you can say Mommy to him, I won't mind." But she made special point then after that to say Grandma. My dad will tell her once in awhile, "You're the grandmother, not the mother." I don't care. She can be called Mom or whatever she wants-like certain things I don't want Adrian to learn about or know. And when she does it I kind of reprimand her right away. I don't know if it's in a loud voice or what, but I kind of-my dad reminds me every once in awhile. He says "Don't hurt her feelings" and stuff. He says "I'll tell her."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell her about what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tell her what I think she shouldn't have done and what was bothering me in that situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does she do that bothers you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just certain things-like once-I think I told you before-she-Adrian was looking at a little doll, a plastic doll or something, and she grabbed it right away and she said "Boys aren't supposed to play with dolls" and she put it-she hid it and he wanted to see it. And I said "Well, let him just look at it to see what it is. That doesn't mean he's going to play with or take it home." So she's going to have to adjust to having a boy in the family, a little boy in the family. I don't know-another thing is she bought-no, she didn't buy it-she found this plastic gun in the house and she was just going over to Adrian "Bang, bang." I didn't want him to play with guns or anything, you know? Because it's also-it's got the paint, the silver stuff that comes off real easily and I didn't want him to suck on that or anything. So I told her to put that away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like she has a lot of rigid ideas about what Adrian ought to be doing that are different from you. Is she like that with you, too? [11:33]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not too sure. She kind of-well I think my mother is pretty liberal as far as we go. Anything that she says, like, I guess, about morality or just what girls should do and what boys do I think is kind of-she's heard it so much from my father, she's picked it up from him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She talks about that a lot to you? What girls should do and what boys should do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean as far as playing with certain toys. Well it wouldn't apply to our age, but what girls are supposed to do like, like get married and keep house and that type of thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that must have something to do with that feeling of boxed-in that you get when you (inaudible 12:30).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they-she might-they don't bug me too much about that right now. I think it's like my older sister because she's teaching-she's married but she's still teaching and they think, for example, that she should give up her job and just have a baby with her husband and everything. Because my dad always says in the end she'll just have a little red schoolhouse. They've been married, I guess, four or five years. So my dad said it's not right for her to teach as long as she has. You know, most couples after they've been married a few years have a baby and everything. So I guess...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel when he says that to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Her? Oh, I-yeah-I think she should do what she wants. For God's sake, it's her life. And, I've told her. She's seen me and Adrian and I said "Heck, it's a twenty-four hour job. It's just as hard as teaching at school. You get paid for what you do" and everything, so you can't-my father's like that, though, he tells us everything. He told my sister what career he thought she should have, what I should have, you know my other sisters. He just doesn't tolerate any of the-any different lifestyle and his. Like I told you before, he wasn't brought up that way, either, so it's something new that he found.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really latched onto it (inaudible13:55) and you were trying to push him away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he thinks that we should stick with it because anything that he has or what he's worked for to give us is the best way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he worked so that you could live your life the way he wants you to and you're pretty ungrateful to give it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told you-because he and my mom, you know, life centered around the kids because they each came from a very small family so I guess they missed a lot, too. Then they came and had four kids and they did everything for-saved up money for college and all that stuff and they just figured that the way they were living was the best possible way and that we should live that way, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that hard for you to come to terms with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not when I speak about it, but when I actually live and try to put up with it that way, it's harder. It's harder that way. But it's getting easier for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. What are the hard feelings about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe because maybe my father's way is pretty good, you know, having all that security and everything and maybe it's a guilt because they did work so hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you stop and wonder sometimes if he's (inaudible 15:28).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I-but I don't feel-like I don't have all those things in life to back me up right now and he's not going to give it to me tomorrow. Like he has the bonds and all that type of thing that when he's dead, you know, in his will, we get it. Big deal, our lives will be half over anyway and I don't know, I just-it's really not that important when you're young unless you're a very practical, conservative type person, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean financial security?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like in a way you're saying it's hard for you to argue your way with him because you don't have any, in his eyes, base to argue your point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because my father if-okay, he backs everything with a very practical, reasonable scheme. He just-he just wouldn't go for anything that was on impulse or anything like that because he's in his fifties and he's just not used to it, I guess. Like he always answers, he says "Well, you're young. When get older you'll feel differently." And maybe I will. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way you're saying that even though you can sort of see these things now, it just isn't that important to you to have that security. Then you stop and wonder whether he's right, based on religion or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think about it like if you have to go to the hospital or anything like that. I don't know, things are just getting so out of line and out of proportion as far as money goes anyways, today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't look like you'd ever have enough anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose you could have enough but then you might spend it foolishly. I know that I could have enough, say a certain amount. But I guess if you have more than you really need, you start buying things that just are luxuries. I know that if I had more than I needed I probably wouldn't save-I'd buy a few of the things that are necessary like insurance or something like that or hospital insurance. Probably just want to have a good time with the rest. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way you're saying it doesn't seem like it's possible to ever get the kind of security that your dad had where there was always more than enough stashed away somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think it's possible for me right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like all you really want is enough and you can work that out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I find more and more that I really dislike handling money, period, because I've heard so much about it from when I was younger and I-I just hate people who quarrel about it and that type of thing. I mean, as long as I have enough to be comfortable and everything, I wouldn't-I don't think I'd really care about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds to me that you're saying you really don't like money very much. [18:39] </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't. When I don't have money, Diane, when I don't have money I'm much better off and happier than when I have it and I have to worry about all my-I have to spend it and everything. It's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you really had a (inaudible 18:56). If you just have enough to get by and not think about it, that's the ideal way to be. I guess that's really important-that's the business with your father. You don't really want that kind of financial security and you don't want the house and the car. You don't want the bank account. You don't want to be having your head full of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I ever had enough money, I'd probably have some accountant take care of all my financial-and also when I meet somebody new-say like, you know, when I was-a couple years ago if I'd go out on a date or something and the boy was an economics major or he had a summer job or something with money, it just-I just-turned me off for the rest of the evening and to him, period. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really important for you and this new way that you're working on for yourself that it not be materialistic or that there be some other kinds of values in it that (inaudible 19:57).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know-I-well, I don't even like to use that word, materialistic, but just more that I don't see the dollar signs with a lot of green stuff in it. It's like my dad used to argue over every dollar with my mother and everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In one way, the only way you can not worry about it is not to have anything. It's the easiest way not to have to think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible20:27).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 20:29) some kind of bad (inaudible 20:30). When I think about what you're saying in the context of where your father challenges your lifestyle, it seems like you've chosen not to win that argument on his terms.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just downright insults anything different from his. I mean, it's not just-it's anybody else that's... It's strange because my three other sisters have extreme attitudes on money, too. My younger sister, the one right after me, she spends it like water. The youngest one, she's really like a tightwad and I think the only practical one is my older sister. She just has an even balance on that. Maybe we were all affected by that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the level, it sort of sounds like you couldn't ever win with him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the only...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've sort of given up (inaudible 21:44).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's true. You know, like-money, for example, say if we-if my whole family went on a trip or something and the bill would come to a thousand dollars or something else like that and my dad would pay it all at once and say "See when you save what you have" or something like that. He never realizes he's wrong-he really doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's real extreme. It seems like you really bowed out of a (inaudible 22:11) in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you're not going to try to impress him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think everybody just lets him argue and says what he wants and then goes and does what she wants. It's the only way, I suppose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like if you ever got a lot of money again-if you ever wanted to-even if you did it-then he'd still be disapproving of you for something else. Like, you would be working.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably say I'm not handling the money right. Yeah, I think my father just likes to gripe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I suppose it makes it easier for you in a way to know that it's a situation you can win in so you don't feel disappointed when you don't win.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just-I still feel disappointed because I know, say, for example, if we're arguing I know that I'm right and I have all this stuff to back it up and he still won't give in. It's disappointing because I know that I was right but I've learned that he's just going to keep on and everything. What the heck. I don't know. I think I was the only one in my family who used to argue with him about it, because my other sisters just knew then, when they were younger, what I know now. That he does want something to gripe about so it's just no use to even fight back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like the hard part is that he won't recognize your point of view as legitimate for you somehow. All he hears is that you're not saying what he thinks and that's bad or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, he says "You're young. What do you know?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you feel that having that baby gives you more right to say that you (inaudible 24:05).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I tell everybody that Adrian and I are growing together but my dad, he comes every once in a while and he says "You're twenty-five years old. You should have some responsibility now" and stuff like that. He says "Show some brains and do that right" and I still think he thinks deep down-he knows that-or he thinks he's the one that's always right. [24:47]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like when he says you should take some responsibility, what he really means is that he'd like to take over and show you what to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or he thinks that I still don't know, you know, you should take some res-respon...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it feels like he doesn't have much faith in you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, he probab-I don't know-I think-I don't know if it has anything to do with faith at all. It just has to do with he's the father, he's the man, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You believe that, too? That in some ways it's best for men to know what's happening and you're supposed to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just-I was just saying that I think was my father's case that he was the only man in the family, you know, the father and everything. No, because it's strange that my older sister married a guy who can't even take care of money or anything like that or the bills. He just throws everything all in a lump.</p>

<p> I guess, in a way, you know, what happened from that relationship with my father is that all of us came out being able to take the lead as far as handling the bills go, you know? Because like Robert, he just throws everything in a pile, too. He won't take care of any bills at all. So like with him it's a big drag because I have to take care of it all, too. And I don't know about Trish and Elliot. I guess it's about fifty/fifty. But knowing my younger sister the way she is about her money, she'll take care of it (laughs). She'll take care of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you learned some of those things from him on the way. In a way you took the father part for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Financial? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty hard for you, I guess, to see your mother as someone who you'd want to take her part because it looks so, sort of trauma. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just thinking about it. I guess in a way, though, she's happy. I mean cooking and taking care of the kids and everything. Because she's a very homemaker-y type.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Sort of like that's what she wants but (inaudible 27:41).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I-just with a little more-I don't know what word-but a little more respect or sympathy, I think, from my father. [27:54]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about just staying home and taking care of the place sort of gets her in a position where nobody really has to listen to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she works-she helps my dad two or three times a week. She's a Librarian-he's a Professor. So she helps him in the office but I mean still she's taking the orders from him again-fixing stock or organizing shelves or something like that. And she says she'd rather stay home and cook and that type of thing than work in the office.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you make of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think she would because she's not-my dad's not at home at lot of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just to get (inaudible 28:48).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I think she likes being home much better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think she (inaudible 28:58).</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think your mother-that she likes to be by herself? Does she talk to you about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, she always says that my father drives her crazy and everything and I'd believe it, too, because my father, he drives me crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's really a hard guy to take.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really. He's good at a lot of times and everything. But he's just one of those men that are very domineering and very energetic and everything and you admire them from a distance if you don't have to live with them. If you have to live with them it's another story. They're miserable. But, yeah, she always makes comments that she's glad he's at the office or something like that. He always-my dad always-seriously, I think he says to my mom when he retires that they're going to get a one and a half room apartment and live together in that. My mother says she'd kill herself first because he would drive her crazy.</p>

<p> My dad said well he'd keep busy and take walks and go to meetings and do some things but, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he wouldn't mind being closer to her but she really couldn't take it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he did it to save money or something. I don't think he was doing it specifically to be closer to her. Because he has all these things to keep him busy and stuff but he likes to have my mom around to cook him something to eat out of a clear blue sky because he eats at odd hours. He just wants a slave is the best label, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's always at his call, kind of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because she really depends on him, you know, because he doesn't pay her at the office. I mean he gives her the money for the regular stuff but she doesn't have any money, really, of her own. She can't really go out to work because she has-her leg is stiff. She had an operation. She had arthritis and it was stiffened because the joint was taken out. So it's really hard for her to be on her feet for a long time. In that way, she's pretty dependent on my dad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all the doors closed all around her in some ways. He sounds like a hard guy to be dependent upon. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he lets you know that you're dependent upon him and that nobody else would do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like she has to live with it and learn to be grateful that she's got a roof over her head and food...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think she does more than enough to be thankful and to deserve it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of seems to you like she earns it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's always giving her the message that he's doing her a great big favor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really an ideal marriage (laughs). [32:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's hard for you to figure out how to make a marriage look attractive after all that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I really haven't seen any. I've never really seen one that I thought was really attractive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you think of yourself, you don't really think of yourself being alone with Adrian. That's not really being married (inaudible 32:41).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't-no I don't-I don't really-well I feel like Robert, Adrian and I are family but I don't feel like I'm his wife, you know, or I'm married to him. Although, maybe I'd feel married to him, but I don't feel like I'm-you know, like I wouldn't call myself his wife or I'm sure-I don't think he'd call-or I'd call him my husband. (inaudible 33:06) said that to me once and it bothered me because she said-I don't know-she'd say-she said "After all, you're his wife" and I said "I'm not his wife" like that. But I think of us as a family but not really-but not really like the standard or old fashioned type family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mostly like there's two parents to a child. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, you know, people together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like the idea of being Robert's wife is hard but just that being anybody's wife sounds bad to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think mainly because of my parents and their marriage. I think I'm really afraid to get married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like, you know, I've-I haven't seen a marriage that's really lasted twenty years that's really happy. I mean, some of the stories my mom tells about her married friends in the suburbs and stuff it's really like a freak show. The things that happen, you know, you don't even see that in the movies the things that happen. You know, it's really something else.</p>

<p> You know, like my oldest sister, she's got friends that have been married for just like four or five years and already they're saying that they're not happy together and the only reason that they're staying together is because of their kid or something. So I haven't really... [34:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because more than anything, I think I'd want my marriage to work. I'd want it to be-not exciting every minute, but really a live type thing. Not really just something that's there and not really taken for granted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really saying something about the whole business of the words and the ideas and everything about marriage and husband and wife. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All these things you think about are really awful things in a way. And when you think...</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're awful things?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...about good things, they're just about people together but they're nothing to do with marriage. They're kind of like lives and relationship and it has nothing to do with marriage.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's true for a lot of people because the minute you start pinning down words and asking for definitions and-I don't want to sound like I'm a hip person or something but it's true-I've always disliked red tape, you know, things that consume time or just a lot of paperwork and things that don't really get down to the brass tacks and stuff and I don't know, I don't think it's really important to a lot of people to say that "Oh, he's my husband and I'm his wife" and everything and just come across as a family and just relate to each other really well. </p>

<p> That's fine. But the minute you start trying to put tags on everything, I think people get really-you know, it's one of the things that really start getting messed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As soon as you label it it's like boxing in to some conventional pattern or something. And that part that feels real to you is the feeling that you have with someone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because if you're doing something, you know. Say, if you're even making a dress and you're going along and you're doing it, you're enjoying it and then say the minute someone else comes in and gets technical about it, I don't think you enjoy it half as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One thing I hear you saying is that experiences that you have feel real and, in a way, that's all you can ever trust to be real. Like descriptions of experiences and how you're supposed to do it. All that other stuff is sort of bullshit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's-maybe it's too hard for me. I can't cope with it to try t have all these experiences and to try and label and explain it, too. Because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They really feel like different kinds of thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well the minute I start doing it I-then I have to go back and think about it and then I-you know-then I start thinking about all the things. It just isn't as nice as before and it just sort of messes up the feeling for me. I've always been like that, Diane, but I haven't been able to realize it to explain it until just recently.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. It seems to me that another side of this stuff that we're talking about now-but in a way when you have to look at thing that you're involved in the way someone else would see it, like the dress that you're making and your friend sees it or your relationship with Robert on somebody else's terms, but you lose something important. It's hard for you to keep track of how it really was for you or something. The easiest thing for you is just to not look at it the way other people look at it. Or refuse to or choose to analyze that. [38:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, like, like, I think you've gathered from all the sessions so far that the minute I start going over something-well, I think it's true of everybody-just gets more reaction to it and you're not fully sure how it felt in the first place. </p>

<p> I think the only time I can really explain something is when it doesn't relate to me personally. Like say I can explain about a movie or something that happened to somebody else pretty well, I think. You know, right on the spot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or your mother's feeling or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when it gets to be about you its sort of like in a way you're afraid you won't be able to keep track of what really happened to you if you talk about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but actually I don't think I like to talk about it either way. You know, the other, the other way out there. Although I think about it an awful lot, I have to admit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 39:39] lesson.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think about it in my mind-like just like-the situation I think when I came in here the first time I was just over-thinking about, over-intellectualizing about all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like it doesn't feel too good to you to be thinking about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Like I just worry about putting everything into categories, too. When I think-in all reality I don't even... Like in school I even hated to pull out all those cards. You know, thirteen sets of cards or whatever it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what thinking feels like-it feels like bullshit red tape and all, just completely removed from the real part of whatever it was you were thinking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, I think-that must-I don't know-stem from my laziness, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds to me, also like one thing that happens when you think about it is that you can't keep doing it on your own terms or something. Like it always starts with somebody else's system of category. Like your dad's system or the world's system. Somebody's system that's not yours anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Possibly because like I told you before, I don't really feel secure about my own-my thinking and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you just go with the (inaudible 41:12) it seems to you and keep it like it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because no matter what it is, there's always these other people adding their two cents or influencing it in some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like your father has been so forceful that even if he's not there, his little voice is sort of hanging around doing it for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it-not so much as before but kind of. I mean, like my sisters and I would always say things to kind of irritate and egg my father on. You know, sit there and kind of giggle. I think he knew it, too, that we were just getting him stirred up but he'd go on because he likes to shout and speak his mind and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess on just about anything you can think of, you can imagine what he'd say about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we're used to it. He'd just drum it in our heads so long that even if you're not paying attention you hear it because he's go this sort of voice. Everything he says he repeats at least four or five times. I'm not kidding. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To anyone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother's starting to do it. She finally picked it up from him, so it's really bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like having a little portable father walking around imposing his categories on your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everything that my mom or dad did, I mean, is a complete opposite. Like when my sisters-we only say something once. I don't know if we're really doing it on purpose, checking it ourselves. I think it's something deep inside us know. We only say it once. We never repeat things to people unless they ask.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like in a way you give your father a lot of credit in your life now, just by reacting against him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know-but-I don't-yeah-well, I don't know if its really a reaction against him. I think it's just being in contact with a different type of people and feeling more comfortable with them. But I don'-I guess it is also just getting away from my parents there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everything that feels comfortable is sort of just the opposite of the way he is. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a lot of (inaudible 43:37).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because my father was just so formal about everything. He wanted the table set perfectly every dinnertime and he wanted all these big family conferences. I don't know, stupid stuff, you know, once a week or something family conference. It was like he was running a corporation almost and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of funny now. I always said that I was going to write a book about my family. But at the time it was really hard to live with. And everybody laughs when I tell them these stories but it was really bad. [44:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of getting easier to laugh at the longer you (inaudible 44:24). I can see, listening to you talk about him now, how the red tape stuff felt so offensive. Sort of like it was a substitute in your house in a way all these formal little things for the real interaction. </p>

<p>PATIENT: One thing that always got me, you know, my father would say "Let's all sit down and have a nice big meal like a normal family" and you see all these families where you live, they don't sit down to a ten-course meal. The kids are all bopping in and out picking up sandwiches and stuff like that or ask can they be excused. And my father he's expecting us to sit there through all the whole meal and have desert and say grace at the end or whatever. You know, just talk about things that happened (chuckles) to us during the day and that wasn't just-that wasn't normal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now tell us, Christy, what did you do today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now tell us, Christy, what did you do today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today? (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And all our friends were outside after meals getting back on the street ready to play ball again and stuff. My father has pulled tricks like having the table re-set and everything because we all didn't come down or we all didn't eat at the same time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean "What do I mean?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like half of you would come down and you'd have to sit through the whole meal all over again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, my sister or somebody would say they weren't coming down or say they were out and they called and said they'd be late. Half of the kids would want to eat and so they'd eat anyways and my dad would have a fit and my sister would come home or something and he'd tell my mother to re-set the table and get the food on again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The whole meal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know. He really pressed that stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess the longer you get away from it the more it's easy to see it when it doesn't have so much (inaudible 46:25).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean when you're there at the time, it's insane to re-set the whole table. It's really-and we had to sit through it and-(inaudible 46:40).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you'd be sitting there being harangued and you hear kids laughing outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 46:48). My father's word for anybody who isn't normal and decent, he calls them a pagan (laughs). Dad's really-he's really a character. Everybody else, though in the town and the Temple and everything they'd all admire him and think he's such a wonderful man and everything. They always told my father "I bet with five girls you never get into the bathroom to use a mirror" and everything. We were thinking to ourselves "Oh, God, he's the first one in there." He has it the whole half-hour before we got up and we're all upstairs in the other bathroom. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like anyone who can just relax a little and do their own thing is a pagan?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is a what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is a pagan? Is that a word for people who don't follow all the directions and things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, people who aren't moral and everything like that. Or who even drink. Not even alcoholics, but just people who drink, period. You know, an after-dinner drink or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like all the human pleasures are (inaudible 48:04).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well my dad used to be really wild when he was younger. He was. He was all over Europe. My grandmother never knew where he was. He was always calling and writing for money and stuff and he-now he doesn't remember it. He-no, it wasn't so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He was always (a person ph 48:25). I guess it's hard for you to do anything in your life without him looking in the mirror.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's for sure. [48:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, the other thing about all the formal things. You know, I said something earlier about it sounds like they substitute for real the real feelings-real things, you know, like real conversations. You couldn't have those so you'd have these formal family functions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well actually my dad was such a nut about everything that nobody would want to talk to him anymore. He just like took all the spontan-spontinuity-whatever it is out...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Spontaneity.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...of everything and, you know, we'd just-I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you pull back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, we'd just sit there through all that drudgery and just make simple, crummy conversation with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like sort of enduring it until it was finished.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he wouldn't have liked what we did anyways if we even told him. So, we'd sit there and say "Aw, nothing, we didn't do anything all day" or we read a book or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 49:44).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and like he's not even tolerant of-he's really bright. He knows all about history and he's got Master's and everything and stuff like that. Now, he just has narrowed down his interests in music and stuff to just one thing. He doesn't even like to listen to anything else. It's really a shame because he is so smart and everything and he just-if he were just natural about it, there would be so many things that we could talk to him about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like on one level the hardest part of him is that his potential for being a really good father has always been there in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like he really could do it so well but he just doesn't or can't or something. It's really disappointing. It's sort of different than somebody who has a father who (inaudible 50:52).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just-I don't know. He just doesn't know how to relax and let himself go. I mean, even on vacation he wears a suit (laughs). I don't know what his problem... It's really-it's sad because he's in his fifties, too and I want my mom and dad to have a good time and to enjoy themselves and they just don't. I don't know why. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 51:13) and like these walls sort of came in from all three sides or something and just gradually boxed and boxed and boxed himself in and he's sitting in this little cube and nothing else is allowed to come in, nothing else is there. If you come into it, he just cubes you in, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like he complains about people so much. He doesn't like this or that about them. It's gotten so that even his friends-there's no more friends, they're just dwindling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They didn't fit inside the cube.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he always finds something he doesn't like about them or something's wrong. And everybody he likes everybody else thinks is crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like he's really a man with a lot of unhappiness in him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he doesn't think he's unhappy, though. But, I don't know, I just think his life is pretty, you know, yuck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 52:24). </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard, though, I don't think we'll really know the truth about him from his life when he was younger. Everybody says something different, but I have a feeling his parents kind of drove him really hard. Just really made him feel bad about a lot of things and, I don't know, I think they just made him feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think something like that-he sort of went off wild for awhile and then he felt so guilty he just snapped in double hard into the opposite direction?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Possibly. I don't really know. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure that thought makes you sort of be extra worried hanging on to your perception of how important it is to be able take some (inaudible 53:20). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think the thing that has helped me a little bit more is I do have three sisters. I know that I'm not alone as far as my parents go and I know that my reactions to them aren't really far out because my sisters feel the same way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's important to know how your sisters feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I have them for a security type thing whereas my father just had these two people drilling him all the time. He was, like you said, kind of locked in because he wasn't able to get outside opinions or anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you had sort of like a supporting structure for going off on your own. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, even if I was locked in, there were three other girls in there with me, so we were able to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess they've been pretty important for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. You know, thinking about it now, I can very easily see how one person alone with two parents could really be intimidated and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If the parents are intimidating. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it would be sort of like you wouldn't have anyone to get strength from or be convinced that you had a right try out some other arrangement. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think also in my case that it was just other people I knew that kind of helped me along. They said your parents aren't a hundred percent right and that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 55:03)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think the (inaudible 55:06) happened at a good time, too, I think. Going away to college like one, for example, was a good thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where did you go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went to a couple places. I started out at Loyola in Education and then I dropped that and I transferred to a girls' school, (inaudible 55:24) and I changed my whole program to English and Journalism. But and I think just going to the east coast was something else because everything, you know-the lifestyles and just words that they use are so different out there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really exposed you to another way of thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was able to travel back and forth. My first boyfriend was in Massachusetts and he was one of the biggest helps as far as helping me become a separate thing from my parents, you know, because he was kind of going through the same thing with his parents. So just, you know, that whole thing with (inaudible 56:12) bringing him to school helped an awful lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of seeing the other reality. We're going to have to do one more.</p>

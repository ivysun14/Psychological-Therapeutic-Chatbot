<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually left work 15 minutes earlier than usual today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was not a fun ride. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see you took a left onto (inaudible at 00:00:09) and a right onto the Ave on Tuesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I won't do that again. But the rotaries they're always terrible. At least they can improve the rotaries. It can't be that much work spelling left instead right but it actually was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have another thing that you could try or something else to try but today you may not... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know you could do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just have to do like a little looking at a map probably. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It can't be any worse than coming down (inaudible at 00:01:04). I tried taking the Street exit but that's really a crapshoot. Since there are a lot of bicyclists it's just backed up for ever because there's no light across and so it's a free-for-all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. I got you. Yeah this is, I think, maybe one exit before that. And then you wind up on the Avenue you can just take a left into the traffic circles. You're actually much quicker going that way because you'd be on (inaudible at 00:01:34) or you could kind of jog (inaudible at 00:01:43) or however you come in. It probably sucks pretty much any way you slice it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) My date last night was terrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things happen. [00:02:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was kind of the stereotypical kind of privileged techno crap libertarian asshole that I realize is very common in my social circle just because so many people in my work are IT graduates. I have some people affiliated with IT and unsurprisingly fall into the same trap that many very smart people tend to fall into thinking that because they're very smart and they mean they can't possibly be prejudiced, or sexist, or hold appalling politics and they actually do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try not to get to invested in first dates especially people that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the first date and all. [00:03:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And especially people I meet on the Internet (pause) the success rate is very low. This whole Internet dating thing has been really, really weird because for the most part I've always dated people I already knew, was already friends with, and so there was none of this getting to know you awkwardness. And it's like you generally have a sense of whether the person I was dating was going to pop off with some kind of horrifying misogynist thing or go on a rant about one of my best friends. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are those the things that happened last night? [00:04:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yep. But at this point I've had the same circle of friends for long enough that pretty much anyone where there is going to be a romantic attraction it would've turned up by now. So yeah. I've never really done the going on a date with someone whose a near stranger before so it's all just been very strange. But apparently this is how most of America dates. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure most of America likes it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) Fair enough. (Pause) I have a friend who's getting married next summer to a guy she met at a bar which I didn't know that happened. [00:05:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not since 1995. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like something from "Sex in the City" but it's real, and they're a great couple, and he's a fantastic guy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They met at trivia night at the bar. (Pause) There's this thing that's actually been consuming a ridiculous amount of my thoughts recently, and I feel like it's really trivial given the amount of time I've spent waffling over this. So in two weeks the County Festival is happening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's in Chicago? [00:06:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, Chicago. I didn't know this until I was mentioning it to one of my coworkers but it's famous for having some of the worlds most successful silver thieves in this county. (Laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But yeah the Festival is a really big festival. I guess every state has one. Not every state. State festivals are fairly common but the one here is one of the biggest in the country—one of the biggest in the mid west. I've gone for the last couple of years and had a really good time. And Dave and I were planning on going, and we both requested time off from work, but we both have major work deadlines at the end of October, and we're both kind of overscheduled for October. We have events booked for every weekend this month. It's a long drive and Dave can't help with the driving because he doesn't drive a stick. [00:07:13]</p>

<p>I just bought a new spinning wheel this summer, and I haven't finished using up all of the fiber and yarn that I bought last year. So I can't decide if I want to go or not because on the one hand it'll be lots of fun and there are things to do other than shop although kind of most of the attraction is the shopping. I'm surprised fiber art is something of a niche market so there are very few brick and mortar stores in any one town where you can go and look at what you're buying so a lot of people in the hobby buy their supplies online. But at these big festivals you get something like 400 vendors who will come and bring their goods so you can look at stuff and compare them in person and that's really nice. So that's the main attraction but there are other things. [00:08:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's in two weeks; the weekend of the 19th. But yeah there are classes, and demonstrations, and meet ups... I'm not really into the meet up part of it. I've tried to meet up with people I know before but online relationships just didn't translate into being able to talk to them face-to-face. It doesn't always happen. Actually I have reasonably good luck with online friends becoming real friends in different contexts. But you know when all you have in common is a shared hobby and nothing else it's a little bit harder. So yeah it'll be lots of fun but I'm A, worried about the time and that I'll just collapse in a puddle of exhausted quivering mass by the end of the month if I don't have a weekend to just vegetate at home. [00:09:15]</p>

<p>And I'm worried that if I go and I don't buy anything I'll feel resentful of myself for saying I'm not allowed to buy anything new. But if I do buy stuff then it'll just be added to my stash of stuff that then starts to feel like a chore instead of a fun hobby. I have to use it all up. I have to hurry up and spin it all because—I don't know—it's wrong to have stuff that I'm not using. When I say it out loud it sounds kind of crazy to me. But yeah having a stash of crafting supplies that I'm not actively working on a project or buying books and then not getting around to reading them makes me feel horribly painfully guilty. [00:10:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it's almost been like you've bought just for fun?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to for function?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would see some of the fun is just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The using of it yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean it's (pause)... Part of it is (pause)—I don't know. I almost feel like if I buy a set like several balls of yarn or a pound of sheep's wool that I've made a commitment to it. And if I get distracted and work on something else then I'm being disloyal to the projects that I already have in mind. And then there's also it's a waste of money if I buy stuff and don't use it. They're just going to sit and gather dust in the closet. Then I hear my dad's voice in my head talking about how Americans have so much stuff and when he was growing he didn't own anything. It's all of this kind of shaming around having things that I'm not using. [00:11:21]</p>

<p>(Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like there are a bunch of moving parts. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have friends who want to go to, and they're looking for a ride, and they want to make plans, and I told them if I go you're welcome to ride with me. A couple months ago I told them that and now they're saying well it's in two weeks. We need to know if you're going because if you're not we need to arrange another ride because they don't own a car. And I don't know if I'm going or not. It's actually been remarkably stressful trying to decide if I'm going to go or not. And I feel really silly for being so stressed about this because it's like a three hour drive from here. We don't have a hotel reservation. We're going to camp in a state park which is what we've done for the last couple of years and it's a lot of fun. And while I'm off at the festival cutting with sheep and going to classes Dave just goes hiking and has a good time with that. [00:12:38]</p>

<p>(Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it sounds like it's pretty clear you'd be excited to go, but you're concerned about the downside such as (pause)... It's unclear to me if you'd be taking time out from work but whether or not it's that or just being tired from it would make it tough to get through work especially with the big deadline the following week and a half or so. [00:13:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other work concern is there's this stupid policy that came down from on high that we're all being required to spend vacation days the three days before Thanksgiving because the company wants those vacation days off in their books. It's a liability and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An accounting thing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And our stock price has been dropping so they want to put up profitable numbers for Q3 and Q4. But I already have vacations booked for the spring and so I'd planned all of my time off for the year before this policy was announced. And I'll be short vacation days if I take this vacation in October. And my boss has said this isn't a big deal. You can take the vacation days and we'll just bank them against the future like I'll let you go into negative vacation days and as you earn them back get them out. Don't worry about it because this policy is stupid you shouldn't have to change any of your plans because of it. [00:14:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I kind of feel vacation day impoverished right now. I just made that word up: vacation day impoverished. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I get the gist (pause) which I guess is just a bad feeling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's the problem with being vacation day impoverished? [00:15:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other than my feeling irrationally like I don't have enough there's nothing wrong with it. I mean if I don't have spare vacation days then I can't just take a day off because it's a beautiful day and Dave and I want to go have a picnic. Not that we've ever actually done that but I like having the ability to do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I understand. To feel like you could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to have that freedom for like if a friend from out of town comes and visits. It's good to have a couple of days in the bank so I can say yeah a friend's coming from out of town next week. I'll be gone all day Friday and not have to worry about it. [00:16:17]</p>

<p>(Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you thinking about? [00:17:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking of something I can't remember and it's right on the... I'm a little bit spacey today. I don't remember. Oh yes I remember now. There's a wedding tomorrow. It's not a wedding because they're already married. The (inaudible at 00:17:33) priest at my church—the one who I don't hate—got married about three weeks ago. And he got married in his bride's hometown in—I don't know—somewhere in the cold and frozen Midwest, and they're having a reception tomorrow. I feel like I'm obligated to go even though I don't want to because I don't know them that well, and I don't know their families, and I have friends who I do know and care about who are coming in from out of town this weekend for other stuff who I'd like to see and it's going to take big chunk out of my Saturday. I don't have that much free weekend time this month to begin with and it's all... I was just kind of stewing in resentment that I feel kind of obligated to show up for social reasons even though I don't really want to. [00:18:28]</p>

<p>(Pause) Oh and Sunday we're observing Saint Francis's Day at my church which means people will bring their animals to church. And I have nothing against pet ownership in theory they're bringing animals to church—animals that I'm allergic to and it's going to be miserable and wretched because animals are mammals. Did I mention I'm allergic to them? So I'm just kind of looking at this weekend I'm thinking you know I'd probably almost rather be in the office all day Saturday and Sunday than doing anything I have planned this weekend because it'll all suck. I also feel selfish for being annoyed at both of those events; the wedding and the Saint Francis Day celebration. [00:19:35]</p>

<p>(Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I guess you're starting to sound more annoyed having initially to spend kind of uncertain what you were going to do about the festival. [00:21:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. I'm still a little uncertain about what I'm going to do about the festival.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. It didn't sound like that's much clearer. It seems like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I got from point A to point B if we're talking about vacation days. And I said something that made me think of kind of saying peace out. I'll see you all on Monday at work. I want to take the day off which reminded me of this friend of mine who sometimes if he knew the person giving the sermon at church was going to be really terrible—he's moved to Chicago since—after the peace he would say it and then he'd just leave and skip the rest of the service. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which had me thinking about church and Saint Francis's Day and having to go to the wedding. So that was the... [00:22:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The internal segue way. (Pause) I have so much more leisure time if I weren't religious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) It alls sounds to me like you were a bit admiring of him for being able to bail on things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you would like to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or at least in part would like to do and it was a bit refreshing to think of him apologetically. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doing that. Which when you pull it together it's like this weekend but also just with the festival like yeah, fuck it, go on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:23:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because what's on the other side is mostly like responsibility, and obligations, and stuff like being vacation day frugal. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And energy frugal (inaudible at 00:23:33). </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not so much about the money. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is about the money in the sense that I still have a lot of shame about spending money on things that I think I don't need. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like practically about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But I mean there is plenty of budget for hobby expenditures this month. (Pause) I'm really weird about money. Like today my boss decided that we all needed to go out to lunch because he was worried we would all work through lunch if he didn't drag us away from our desks which is probably true. So we went to this burrito place near the office and I ended up ordering based on what was cheapest on the menu instead of what I actually wanted to eat and it was only a difference of like $2.75. [00:24:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The burrito place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I just had this voice in my head saying it's ridiculous to pay $9.00 for a burrito. How could you? (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess lunch is more about the principle of the thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a sort of you didn't have that (inaudible at 00:25:05) but you can sort of in a way. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gosh I guess it must be so easy to feel guilty with your father growing up things that he might have. [00:26:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: My first thought is as though you're somehow leaving him alone if you (pause) get more stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. It's kind of like a much more personal and violent form of but there are starving children in Africa so you have to eat all your broccoli (pause) which you can critic that from a political or economic point of view that systemic problems like starving children in Africa aren't going to be solved by personal (inaudible at 00:27:11) . It's not going to do any good. Guilt is not a way to solve problems that fall in the bucket of tragedy with comments like problems. You need much more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess it's a way to express sort of loyalty or solidarity. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:27:48]</p>

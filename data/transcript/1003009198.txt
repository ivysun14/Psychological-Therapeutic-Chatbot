<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I have, well, I was going to have [INAUDIBLE] first period, I mean first period [INAUDIBLE] have English.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your C in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, my C was in, I should have 2 Cs now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Astronomy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Astronomy, that's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, very hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of new stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do they have you out looking for night sky?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no, not really, we're doing a bunch of math, math in it, it's really not that fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there are some nice, you could see some planets last night.  You ought to go out there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And look.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you see them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which, what planets?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Venus and Jupiter I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think so.  I couldn't decide if the one was Mars or Venus, probably Venus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We, we said, we said, we were talking about it in class today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's what he said?  Venus and Jupiter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I don't know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They were pretty bright up by the moon, aren't they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they were.  And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, you're appreciating astronomy already.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].  Right.  Um, but I'm trying to do the math, that's hard.  Everything else I've got, I've got a C in English too -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And everything else As and Bs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm very happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You studying much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I study occasionally, but I don't study as much as I should, but [INAUDIBLE] if I made a C without study then obviously -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Obviously what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I studied, I'd make an A, but now I do study my astronomy mainly.  I'm writing down notes everyday in class when everybody is sleeping in class, I'm writing notes and I'm learning in class -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take from what I've learned in class back to the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you learn when you take notes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's how I learn.  That's how I've done things all year like whatever the teacher tells me, I write it down and to look at it and to write it down is a big help to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 'Cause it's like memory.  It's like sticking in my memory.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how's your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No problems?  Side effects or otherwise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You take them regularly everyday?  Pay attention in class and listening and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I find it fun now.  It's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like I'm so bored I'm like it's fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You like to learn things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  Yeah, I might as well do something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As long as you're there, you might as well just learn.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't waste, don't waste your time, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now the Zoloft, you're on 1.5, is that right?  And the Adderall is morning and afternoon?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.  'Cause she's taking 1 of those in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not 2 a day?  Just 1?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What time does it wear off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Around, probably at the end of the day.  I mean, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Makes, doesn't make homework too tough for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  Well, my senior year, we don't really have that many, much homework.  We have like, like a worksheet and we'll do it in class instead of doing it at home, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like you're more doing it in class than you are -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have, uh, projects or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No sir, not yet.  But we're, we should be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No senior project?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, sir.  I think in astronomy we're going to make our own planet or planet or an alienation.  We're going to make like an atmosphere.  I mean not an atmosphere but another, what is that called?  Galaxy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're going to make a galaxy, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're pretty powerful to make a galaxy, huh?  Make planets.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you and your boyfriend are okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he treating you like a princess?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes sir.  He, um, he got a puppy yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, now, you're in love.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He got a Black Lab named Dixie.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You girls and puppies.  They tell me, I have four boys and I tell them if you ever want to attract girls, take, get a puppy and go sit at the park.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's right.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A baby or a puppy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't like babies.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but you would be, you'd be over there checking it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So whose dog is it?  His dog or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's both of ours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it yours and his?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He told me I could keep it for now, when it gets older 'cause he has a bunch of other dogs -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your mom think of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You guys having a joint dog?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, as long as I don't have to feed it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll feed it.  I'll pay for it.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, how long have you guys been together now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a year and eight months, eight months now.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Serious, huh?  You think he's the one, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  I'm glad you don't know.  You don't need to know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's he doing next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, he's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And what are you going to do next year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Go to college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm thinking about like going to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then transferring somewhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stay at home for two years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're not applying anywhere are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I applied to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] here?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] a couple more pieces of paper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How far's that from home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, not too far.  I mean if I went to [DEIDENTIFIED], I probably would stay with my grandma.  She lives like right down the road from it.  Well, not right down the road [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] down to [DEIDENTIFIED].  We're kind of about halfway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Where's [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Or what are you talking about?  Where's, where's [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's in the middle of the state.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So [DEIDENTIFIED] probably be your best bet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your mom thinking about you living with your grandma and not with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably [INAUDIBLE] but then I can take care of her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take care of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doesn't she take care of herself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she does, but she's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who's going to take care of you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Myself.  I'll be old enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a lot of responsibility.  Get yourself fed, get yourself to school, study on your own, nobody to check up on you, nobody to bug you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that make you nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Is, now [DEIDENTIFIED] I've never seen, been to that campus.  Is there a lot of very nice -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's pretty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've seen it like I've been, I [INAUDIBLE].  It's pretty nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where's it at in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right off the bypass [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that a growing campus, you think?  Is it, uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  That's [INAUDIBLE].  They said, um, in the next two years maybe, it's going to go to a four-year college instead of two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'd probably be better going there if you're going to go to a four-year school rather than tech.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  But I'm kind of shooting for tech 'cause I really think that I need to have some like I want to get used to college and then [INAUDIBLE] college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, [DEIDENTIFIED]'s not big.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, but it's growing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's growing.  So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should go talk to them -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And see what they, what it's like there 'cause [DEIDENTIFIED]'s is pretty big.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty big.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It has a lot of students 'cause [DEIDENTIFIED] may not have quite as many and I know that some of the [DEIDENTIFIED] branches that I have been to, the people there just seem real proactive and helpful with their students.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went to the [INAUDIBLE], but I don't know how [INAUDIBLE].  I mean I saw the classrooms and everything [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you wouldn't commute there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what I was kind of thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], but there I'm [INAUDIBLE].  Well, I'd really like to [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They had huge screens -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They treat it like a movie really.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you ought to go see [DEIDENTIFIED].  Do you have a preference where you want her to go?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hum-um.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you go to tech, make sure you take classes that can transfer.  Sometimes kids end up taking classes that can transfer.  Whereas at [DEIDENTIFIED] they'd pretty much be assured, because it's part of the same system.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's exciting for you.  You don't think about it too much though, do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'm trying to think about it, but it's just like I don't know.  Like I don't know.  They get, I, I'm just glad to be [INAUDIBLE] but I honestly don't know where I want to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know you don't want to spend another year in high school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know that [INAUDIBLE].  I want to go to like, hmm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] would be okay and if it doesn't work out living with grandma, you could live at home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, 'cause if you went to tech, you'd live at home, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you kind of think it'd be better if you stayed with your grandma?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever stayed with her for any length of time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?  How was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it was pretty good.  It was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're going to be gone most of the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm catering right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's that going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's fine.  I'm, I've been catering on Wednesdays.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They pay you something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I get, I get pretty good money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  What are you doing with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, using it for gas and spending [INAUDIBLE] 'cause I have one check coming in from Wednesday and I have another check coming in from Saturday after I get [INAUDIBLE].  I'm going to be wore out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your attitude's been pretty good?  Your worries aren't too bad, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You worry about your boyfriend much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not too jealous?  Is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He can be.  Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because you're around all those cute boys at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and he needs to be [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that what you tell him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he going to adult ed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's in the process of trying to find somewhere to go and [INAUDIBLE].  He doesn't know how like, he doesn't know if he's going to be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he not too organized?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's organized.  He's smart, he is.  He knows, I mean he can do stuff like [INAUDIBLE] in order for him to get a good job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where's he work now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, his dad's trying to find him a job within his company [INAUDIBLE].  They make a lot, [INAUDIBLE] dollars an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He doesn't work now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's he do all day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That'd be boring.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's, he can't [INAUDIBLE] and he won't do jobs [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do?  You're going to take him to work then too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Make sure he gets there and does a good job and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what is, when does his responsibility come into this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think you can, uh, make people do that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like that.  He's going to have to motivate himself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean he's motivated.  He just, um, sometimes he doesn't [INAUDIBLE] with things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sound discouraged with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I want him to get a good job because I know he can do [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eating good?  Energy's okay?</p>

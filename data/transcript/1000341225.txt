<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey, Susan! How are you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Pretty good! Pretty good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me what's up? It's been a, (sighs) hooo, almost two months now since we've been, uh, working together and since... (counts in low voice) 2, 3, 4.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Session number five.</p>

<p>(paper flaps)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, bring me up to date, if you got some...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, (clears throat) I haven't really experienced many, uh, panic attacks at all and, uh, I've been using the tapes and uh... Ahhh, going through the exercises, and it seems to have helped considerably...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhumm. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Ah... I don't seem to have, be experiencing as much anxieties as, I've was. (breaths) And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, tell me about your attacks, and a little bit about what happened?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, actually they weren't that bad. Uhmm... I've been using the tapes that you've given me, and, uh, practicing the exercises. And uh, uh-uh, really, the first onset of anything happening that, uh, seem like it could be, the start of another panic attack, uh, I am, would begin the breathing exercises and, uh, become aware of what was happening. Uhum... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, do you anticipate these attacks at all?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, I realized that when my, uh, heart starts and uh, uhm, and my breathing is, uhm, rapid... that, uh, it doesn't mean that's, it's relating to anything that's catastrophic that, uh, I can control my heart with my breathing. And, uhm, nothing bad is gonna happen...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...as a result of this, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, the breathing was the most threatening to you? At one time I remember, particularly when we were doing the panic indulging. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: It was, yes, uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And wha-, what are you telling yourself about the breathing?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, that breathing s-, in through my, nose and out through my mouth I can, control that, and uhm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like it really forced it before it even...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yes, it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scratches it and...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...alright, good. So, you feel, you feel real comfortable like that's... a pretty reliable technique for you?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yes I am. I-, I think, the more that I, uh, the more that I have the opportunity of using it, the more confident I become, with it...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...you know. And uh, if there's e-, even a slight... uhm, occurrence, I will just implement that, whether it's the onset or not of the panic attack...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I'll just, sort of... So, I become pretty confident about it. And, uhm, so, I... And Oh! Yes, we already started going to marriage counseling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh! Yeah. He, he, we-, he can send these over there?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Yes, he did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: It was he, the goer... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: (sighs) Work on things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And hopefully, uh, as time goes on, and you feel better and better in the relationship, uh, hopefully that'll build some of my service with you and, uh, skill that uh, contribute to your feeling a little better by yourself. Well, you gotta hang in there a little bit and I think, uh, the thing is to be as honest as you can about it, uhm... But you know, see what you're doing is you're confronting, you know, the issue...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhuh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that we talked about and other issues that come up in your life, whether it's, uh, your self-esteem or more is uh-you know, lack of self confidence. You've got to address it the same way. Because again, as I had said to you that the anxiety is a warning signal that something else...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...underneath is in...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know... your...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I, I think that's absolutely right. I, I've really learned to uh, over the past few weeks to meet the things that I f--uhm, fear... the things that I've hesitated meeting head on in the past...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhum.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I made an effort to do that now... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...and the...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So, no more showering things under the rag (ph).</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: No. Not at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright so, very good! Well, look, what we're gonna do at this point is, uh, I think we're gonna stretch some of the follow-up thesis out. Uhm, I would like to see in about a month.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Okay. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll do a follow up... but in the interim, uhm, I want you to continue with some of the exercises. It's very important that you do that, so that lot of people get, kinda tender let it drop and, and get lazy with it because you know, soon as things settle down then, they wanna be done...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wanna urge you to continue to do these techniques...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and you know, keep track of any attacks that you do have and also continue to fill out the, uh, Beck anxiety inventory every week just so, we can get, kinda get an idea, weekly if where your anxiety is at. So anything else that you want to uh, to go over, you have any questions about that?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhm... not that I can think of again, I'm really, I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know we do have some followed business plan but, uh, you keep in mind you, you know you can call me anytime. Should you have some difficulty and, and don't hesitate to do that we can have some booster sessions in between.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's, it's been known at times when people have some difficulty with that...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Uhum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But uh...</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: That's good to know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Alright!</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Well, I can do that. Thank you very much... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: ...for everything.</p>

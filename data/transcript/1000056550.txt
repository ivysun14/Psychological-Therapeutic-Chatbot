<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client 0518-014. Session number 7. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:28) minutes late.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't late (inaudible 0:29)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 0:30). A poor black guy bumped me and was sick with worry because he thought he was going to be sued or something. (Inaudible 0:44) anyway. Merry Christmas - (inaudible 0:50) today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you going away?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going away this afternoon.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where do you fly to today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Berlin.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Straight to Berlin?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so. It stops in London or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Holy shit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't that weird? Not that I'm going but that I'm (inaudible 1:15) friends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing like a really good rest with the girls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yesterday I was real spaced. Yesterday was real horrible. I'd been really looking forward to that dance that was yesterday and I was really out of it, or something like that. I was like, I couldn't even dance. Usually I really love dancing - and I'm a good dancer - but I couldn't get into the music and couldn't get into the dancing. I was really looking forward to it so then I felt real awkward.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really outside because I have a whole bunch of friends and I'm always asked to dance a lot but I just felt out of touch with myself a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it wasn't that you were outside the group, it was just that you weren't in touch with yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 2:41). You probably shouldn't (inaudible 2:43) more. I'm not sure about it but it might.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that - what is that? Where's the microphone?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I put it over here. 0:03:00.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I don't know. I have been going over to my old apartment recently and I figure that I was going to move back in. And then I found out that Jen, who has been my friend for the last bunch of weeks - we have been doing stuff together and feel really good about each other - she might be moving out to (inaudible 3:34) - do you know Rebecca? Rebecca and Meredith have a house - Meredith is a friend of hers - and they have a room in it because Evander is in jail or something. It's an unfortunate way to (inaudible 3:45) a room but still Jen - our apartment is driving Jen crazy too, so she's thinking of moving out. Then it would be impossible for me to move in because it would just be Diane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't have a friend there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right - no ally at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In that court thing - I haven't found a lawyer yet. I mean, I might have a lawyer - the Weatherman lawyer - and I know a bunch of Weathermen. The Weatherman lawyer is living with a friend of mine - or he is living in a house with some girls that I know. He used to go (inaudible 4:24) as a Weatherman. She wouldn't do it for me but I haven't really like been calling people up about it. It seems like I'm not dealing with that either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. You are letting all these things slip by you and you're not dealing with them and being kind of spaced out and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also I got worried about two things. I talked to Emma the other day and...I got worried about two things. One thing was that also that (inaudible 5:11) because Emma told me lots of stories about the conference center that she felt that her privacy had been maligned or something. I all of a sudden thought that - I knew you wouldn't do that - but I also got uptight about the tapes and thought they were really weird because, I don't know. I don't really know that many people at the conference center but I know people...I know it would be really uncomfortable for people to know that they were my tapes. I also remembered that when I agreed to come, it was supposed to be for 20 sessions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:05:59.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: I also thought that if I wanted to see you more then I wouldn't be able to because I made this agreement with her. I felt weird about that. I was upset when I explained things as to what would happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I might not be able to see you. Then I started getting worried about those two things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd have to go back on a waiting list at the end of the 20 sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I was afraid of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That means you can't (inaudible 6:33) stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible 6:41). I don't know. How many sessions are over? Do you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is number seven.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Seven?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, there are a whole bunch more then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay - that sounds much better then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That there are a whole bunch more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's still...I don't know why I want to say this but (inaudible 7:12) there are only 13 more. Maybe that's because of what you said about not dealing with things...(inaudible 7:28) you're not at all happy because they're...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm just not feeling that (inaudible 7:39) deal with, or just dealing with it after that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you (inaudible 8:35)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem kind of, like, sad (inaudible 8:46) - really sad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I cry?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 8:57) 0:08:57.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like some kind of (inaudible 9:16).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of it but I'm also scared of getting so spaced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha, yeah. Something like, "Will I ever get back out?" "Will I ever get in touch?" You're afraid that you are going to drift away and away and away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 10:02) everywhere I go. (Inaudible 10:31)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how to get back. But sometimes I try to act (inaudible 10:44) and I'm not - that really hurts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know how to get there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're in some place where you're lost and drifting, and it is not alright.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I'm also afraid to act spaced around my friends because I'm afraid that none of them could reach me. 0:12:39.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I pretend that I am (inaudible 12:45). Everything I say is just not quite right. It's like (inaudible 12:50).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I just kind of figure that something is wrong and I didn't know what all to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But didn't that just lose touch with a part of you that's off somewhere? They didn't want to just want to talk to you and grab hold of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I lost touch with it too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess it's (inaudible 13:55) where you're spaced - some place where you're drifting off. You're getting lost. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 15:26) in touch with how I'm sad. 0:15:28.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel really alone (crying). 0:18:26.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. There's nobody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There really isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need to be comforted: you need to have some help to carry all of this stuff. You need to have someone take you in so you can (inaudible 21:16). Mostly, you need somebody to reach behind the space, to hold onto you so you don't get lost. What's happening? 0:23:27.2</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: First, I keep on seeing the faces.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep seeing different faces. (Inaudible 24:04) probably scared to ask. (Inaudible 24:11) anybody to be there. Because (inaudible 24:33) to do that? (Inaudible 24:35)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I was trying to decide if I should say it. I tried to measure how (inaudible 25:18) still felt. (Inaudible 25:20) that's not true. (Inaudible 25:42) or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you still care about her: you still need her to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel the only time I wasn't spaced last night was at this dance when she came up to me for a minute and started dancing with me and I just remember being totally flabbergasted. But then I felt right there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then she (inaudible 26:48)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you faded out again too. 0:27:00.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's strange like. I was always pick people who can't give me what I want. Some boy - some really nice boy - who I met a couple of times wanted to...I told him...He saw me and said I look really tired as if there was something wrong. I told him I was pretty spaced and he just kind of sat there with me and he was a little upset that I was so spaced. I think he likes me though. (Inaudible 27:57). He asked if he could read me poetry on Saturday or something. He has been talking about this John New chap who is (inaudible 28:03) he really likes. (Inaudible 28:14). I don't want to see him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about what he wants to give to you but you don't want it from him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, I am starting to do funny things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What have you been doing? Are they scaring you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Crying.) At least (Inaudible 30:27) really move. My hand can still move. 0:30:31.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha. It rolls around and it rolls around and it's scary because it won't hold still the way it should. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Crying.) It also feels like as though things are happening to me - what am I doing to myself? I mean, when my eyes start doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, but you can't even trust your own functioning - on top of all of this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 32:35). When I woke up this morning, I knew that I wasn't going back, just (inaudible 32:51). I didn't let myself - even last night - because I was at the dance and trying really hard to be there. I didn't allow myself start to know how spaced I was. (Inaudible 33:11) just feeling it a little bit - how spaced I am. 0:33:17.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to find out more and more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (inaudible 33:23) always this spaced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and how much more is there to come and, like, this is frightening enough without more of it. I don't know; maybe it's really serious or something, you're thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As soon as you start saying that, I feel the same. Like, "You can do it; you can do it - or you can crack."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something in you is going to keep you going, make sure that you (inaudible 34:16) things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got scared for a minute because you won't be here. I am going to start crying again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it hard because...you needed in your mind to hold on to...I was here if you needed to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know I just felt that until now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My eyes are (inaudible 35:07).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did it not make your eyes red? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking that it would be nice to go home from here - home and have some tea. I was just thinking about my (inaudible 36:21) 0:36:23.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 36:24) - a nice comfort to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I need to put (Inaudible 37:56) back together because (inaudible 37:58) time so - is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's 12 o'clock that we started. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was afraid to look at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was thinking maybe I'd like to give you somebody to call when I'm gone. Would you like that? (Inaudible 38:32) or somebody you knew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like for me to call him now and see? He's not with the counseling center - he's with New Beginnings. I find him a good person to talk to. (Inaudible 38:59) 0:39:15.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's another thing - a lot of it you can find ways of pulling yourself together so you can get going and manage. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think (inaudible 40:19). That can wait. (Inaudible 41:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He sounded really nice. (Inaudible 41:05). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is New Beginnings?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a group of graduate students who see people. You (inaudible 41:41) therapy. "If you have a problem and need someone to talk to, call us." But they do therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they do therapy. You just call them. 0:42:00.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be a little bit strange. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be nice to have somebody who doesn't (inaudible 42:20).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I could give you someone's name at the counseling center. (Inaudible 42:37)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels good. It feels like something you would (inaudible 42:50).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels like my nerves are really close to the surface, like I (inaudible 43:00) touching or feel a whole bunch. (Inaudible 43:23) does it every time. I don't know if I should avoid feeling how I feel (inaudible 44:18).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right now you may have (inaudible 44:29)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 44:32)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What should I do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a (inaudible 44:55). It's almost like if I said, "Well, follow on your heel (inaudible 45:06)" sounds like I'm still there or something almost. I don't know, maybe stretching something out for you to do between the time I'm gone and the time I come back. Yeah! (Inaudible 45:36). You need to be. 0:45:39.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just all of a sudden I had this fear of what was wrong. I should wind back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You shouldn't be so childish because you should face a problem - or is it something different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something different. I'm not sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something bad happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something bad happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just (inaudible 47:23)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. (Inaudible 47:51) sexual?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What was it that you were saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 47:57) sexual? 0:48:00.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just having (inaudible 48:48).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the voice in your head is mocking you - it's a sarcastic voice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does it destroy you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it human?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. I had that feeling too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost a relief (inaudible 49:59).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The faces are scary because they make your eyes do funny things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The faces are scary because they make your eyes do funny things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe their (inaudible 50:20) faces too. This is horrifying because it is a grotesque person. 0:51:14.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: I must have bad dreams every night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're different all the time: (inaudible 52:17) them as soon as I wake up. One was about a crematorium. One I had two nights ago - it was the first dream I ever had like that - it was about one day Jenny and I were being arrested for being into women stuff, and women's abortion. First, we were raped by this black guy and a whole bunch of people (inaudible 53:12). It's the first time I've ever had a dream like that. It's almost kind of funny and it doesn't bother me. Usually they are just confused and not (inaudible 53:39)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 53:49)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (Inaudible 54:36) 0:54:38.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a really scary thing to be arrested.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it was. It feels so scary. I think it was an (inaudible 55:03) It seems like there was a jealousy (inaudible 55:16) Sometimes I'd just laugh and agents would come by to see what was wrong what was happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 55:33) It wasn't quite real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not quite! (Chuckles.) Not at all. I wish I could tie myself together or something. IT would be time (inaudible 55:52) before you go away and (inaudible 55:54)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want me to worry about you? You do want me to worry about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit of both. I'll be okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe I'll call (inaudible 56:55) (Calls)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am cold. 0:57:29.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am cold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have got someone. (Inaudible 57:56). They do it this afternoon.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tell me how I can reach him. Who is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: His name is Jesse Cursell. He's a graduate student at (inaudible 58:16).</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's a graduate student at (inaudible 58:19).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's a friend of yours?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. Give me an address so I can send you a post card.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Gives address)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your parents' house?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's (inaudible 59:44)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Phone rings.) Hello...Yeah...Can you call me back here in three more minutes? Thanks. (Hangs up phone.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: When will you be back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I will be back on Tuesday week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible 60:36)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see lots of people?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In therapy? I think I have five.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When's a good day?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like Tuesday afternoon?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine. What time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One o'clock or three o'clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How about one o'clock.</p>

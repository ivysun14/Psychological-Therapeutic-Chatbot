<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was waiting for you to talk more about how you do analysis and what you think of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any more particular questions or interest in . . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was talking to various friends this weekend and there are two people who have done analysis. One is someone who did traditional Freudian analysis for a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ]? (inaudible at 00:01:06) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, no. [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:09) Sorry. She was going on and on. She was like, "When I was in Europe." Don't care. And with an ex-boyfriend of mine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that Elliott? At least with Elliott, what I didn't like is that his analyst didn't really say anything and that makes me very uncomfortable. If I was going to do analysis, there are a lot of good analysts in the area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The big cities, really big hotbeds in psychoanalytic activity. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I mostly know because some analysis group sponsored two movies that I had been to last week. I was like, "Oh. Psychoanalysts. Who knew?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know which group?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember any more. All I remember is being like, "Oh, I didn't reaEmilye that analyst's groups sponsored movies." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there a [ ] might be on the local Psychoanalytic [ ](inaudible at 00:02:25) . To answer your other question, I don't believe I do analysis much different from how I do the kind of therapy that we've been doing, really. As I was saying the other day, pretty much because we use the couch it's different. It's possible I'm a little—I suppose I could say a bit less. It's not so much I pay attention more or something, like I'm trying to do . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:14) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe a little, but I don't think significantly less than I'm saying now. It might feel different if we're not facing each other. I certainly don't have any kind of rules or dicta in mind that prescribe anything different. I guess maybe sometimes when people are using the couch and free-associating and coming in that often, their thoughts can be a little more—they can be in more of a reverie and all over the place in a way, which is fine; but it can take a little longer sometimes to put that together than when you're in something that's more like a usual conversation. [00:04:07] That may be one reason, but it shouldn't [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:18) reactive, at least for me. It's probably true for any analyst these days. They're sort of the stereotype of the silent, aloof analyst. It's probably generally less true these days than it used to be. And yet, for myself, I don't think I'm particularly different. Given the nature of the thoughts that emerge it can certainly take a little longer. I can be a little quieter when I say something, but it's not a matter of trying to hold out more observationally. Am I answering your question? [00:05:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it does. The other question I have is how would it be different from me coming in more frequently during the week? Is it basically the couch or . . ?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the frequency is actually the biggest difference. There are times I've seen people actually sitting up face to face like this for analysis. Different things for different people, blah, blah, blah, but I think, in general, the bigger difference is the frequencies. Probably the biggest difference about the frequency is that it intensifies the relationship between you and me. Problems that are being talked about on the outside have a way of finding their way into the treatment relationship with the more frequent meetings. It's not entirely different from—I don't want to get myself into trouble—dating somebody versus living with them where, when you're living with them, (chuckles) so many things f**king become issues. You know what I mean? Your lives are up against each other's in a way that causes things to come up between you and intensify between you and hang out, in a way that's different from if you see somebody more casually. It's a little bit like that oftentimes in one way or another. [00:08:00] In a way, it's kind of because you can't help it if you're always in each other's space like that and lives like that. That means that the stuff you could have managed or kept under wraps or kept out of things that you didn't want to have to deal with and may have been in some ways socially incorrect and have not been dealt with, there they are. That becomes a lot of the stuff of the treatment, if that makes sense. [00:08:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And those generally relate pretty closely to one's issues with intimacy, emotional withdrawal, [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:57). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been talking with one of my friends, Ashby, and I would just be like, "Sorry, I've just been really depressed really early this year." I feel bad for Ashby relating to me when I'm feeling really depressed. That's not fun for anyone. So I've been thinking about it. One thing I was thinking about was frequency of appointments makes me feel—I don't know—somehow more crazy. Like, "Wow, if I have to come in this many times a week, what's so wrong that it can't be resolved in one visit a week?" Part of that weird—I know where some of it's from. You know my mom and my brother and my dad are all kind of weirdly vaguely opposed to therapy. They both are and they aren't. I don't know. It's very strange. It's sort of like on the one hand, therapy is good because you're getting treatment, and that's good; but why are you going so frequently? In the beginning my mom said, "Once a week is okay. More than that—there is just something crazy going on." I can never tell if she thinks there is something wrong with the therapist or if there is something is wrong with me. She felt that way when my brother was doing outpatient, like going every day. [00:11:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like to a day program?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think he had daily group therapy and I think regular individual, and she was really freaked out by that. I mean, there were a lot of reasons, but the idea of him seeing someone every day made her worried. It definitely made her more worried, more worried than when he was in the hospital; that somehow being in outpatient, going back every day, was worrisome in this weird way that I don't fully understand. [00:12:40] The other thing is Ashby and my crazy arguments about her therapist, which now is just ongoing. She refuses to see her therapist more than twice a month. Her reasoning is that it's too expensive, but she also ends up getting extra co-pay reimbursement in some confusing way that I don't understand. If she goes weekly, that would mess up the confusing mild insurance scam she's in, which I think is basically her therapist is charging her insurance like she's going four times a month, because the therapist gets paid more. I don't know. [00:13:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be very sketchy if her therapist were billing for visits than she wasn't attending. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I believe it's something like that. [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:58) include, but she complains about it. She ends up complaining about how she can't see her therapist more. And I'm like, "I don't know. You have six months of rent stashed," and then she just freaks out about how it's too expensive. Then she freaks out about how she doesn't want to go to therapy more frequently because she's not that crazy, and that if she needed to go to the therapist more frequently, that would be a sign that she would be in the middle of a mental health crisis if something was really wrong. [00:14:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Okay." Then we had this discussion about the artist, who I was talking about, who is voluntarily living in the hospital.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think you mentioned her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I mentioned this to Ashby and her reaction to this really surprised me. She was really angry at the idea, seemed really offended and angry. I was kind of poking at why and she was like, "Well, she's using her mental health. She's using the mental hospital as a crutch." Her theory was basically that she had moved into a mental hospital because she doesn't want to deal with day-to-day life and doesn't want to get enough treatment that she can handle daily life, so she checked herself into a mental hospital. She also well enough to create art so, obviously, she's not getting treatment for whatever is wrong with her. She's abusing the social safety net and is refusing to get treated so that she can stay in the hospital and still create, I guess. It was very confusing. But she felt that it was really selfish. [00:16:34] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it is something like a secondary gain, like she was getting something out of her illness that she otherwise wouldn't have gotten, in a way, here, so she tends to stay [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:51) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was really interested in what was going on, I didn't expect Ashby to be so hostile and angry about the concept of it. I thought that it was interesting that her first reaction was that obviously, she's refusing to get treatment in order to create her art. I was like, "Well, but she's in a mental hospital." I felt it's kind of like she's doing something. (chuckles) [If they let her out, so clearly she couldn't live on her own.] (inaudible at 00:17:41) It's sort of like, I don't know. [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:51) It was not what I was expecting. I'm not sure what I was expecting. (pause) [00:18:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think these are all sort of reasons how treatment is bad, especially more intensive treatment, like a crutch or something we can take advantage of. I can imagine some of your mother's worry is that it can make you crazier or be a sign that you are crazier, in itself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think to that extent she does think it's borrowing trouble.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:46) I'm not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she actually feels like if you're going to therapy more, then that actually causes you to think that you have more mental problems than you actually do. You might not notice when you do have more problems, because you're worried about it subsequently. [00:20:25] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that these are also things that—maybe not as much as she or Ashby though—I think you do worry about if you were to come in more often.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of my worry is that friends and family won't be supportive. I can imagine my mom saying, "What's wrong? What happened? What is the reason why you're wanting more intensive therapy and wanting something new to happen?" I think she would be freaked out and worried and upset. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And certainly, in being those things, wouldn't be as supportive for what you're doing. In other words, she'd feel bad and that would be bad, and also she wouldn't be supportive of doing it exactly. [00:22:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or even if she was supportive, she would constantly badger me about it and when am I going to stop? It's one of those things; like I still have not talked to my parents about [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:27) or anything, which I probably want to do before Thanksgiving, when I'm next there, but I don't really want to. I'm also thinking like when Ashby and I mentioned something about it [ ]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:48) I'm worried that they'll think I'm being too self-involved or too [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:22) or too something. I remember when my friend, Emily, tried to talk to her about what therapy was like, because she was upset that her then-husband, she felt like it wasn't doing anything concrete. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her then-husband was in it? And it wasn't helping, according to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it wasn't fixing the things that she wanted done, I guess. (both laugh) And I'm like, "Well, um, it's not really like you go in and get a list of ten things to do." Probably, I don't know. She was like, "Well, what's the point?" I think there was a point, but if what you want is him to come home every week or every other week with a list of things he's doing, you're not going to get that. And I knew it was much more about she was frustrated with her husband. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually that's what I do when I get a call from a spouse. They're like, "Is there something that he's working on and you just nod? Look, I heard my spouse said, 'Sorry, that's just not going to happen.' I mean what are we doing here?" (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was so weird, especially since she was like, "It was one of those things where we both agree that he needs to work on this," but if you both agree that he needs to work on his self-confidence or something or his need to communicate. I don't know. She never tried to call his therapist and that was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I've only really gotten calls from spouses a few times. (both laugh) I have, but more common is if they bring in their kid because the kid is not what the parent wants them to be or thinks they're supposed to be. (pause) [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:14) </p>

<p>CLIENT: One friend of mine, who I'm also not [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:51) but she pointedly said to me that she thought therapy didn't work because "I wasn't fixed yet" and that was both shocking and incredibly hurtful. And part of me was just like, "I didn't realize that you thought I was broken," which what the f**k? Also, part of what we'd been talking about was that she was considering therapy and I was trying to encourage her to consider it. I talked about that I thought it was good. I didn't really expect a knife-in-the-back situation. (pause) [00:28:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I'm thinking about is what you're bringing up is the way that coming here more often would make you vulnerable or subject at first to me [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:41), but especially to people in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I haven't talked to many of my friends about it, mostly because it seems like such an effort to do and I'm just really worried about what someone will say. I was thinking about [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:40) analysis and I know she would get caught up in all of these details like, "What kind of analysis are you doing and why?"—she's the one in medical school—and that's all that she would be focusing on. I don't care. It's not something I want to talk about. I don't know. I thought of calling her and I just didn't want to talk to her. I don't know why I didn't call her. It was mostly just that I'm so nervous or feel tense of her not being supportive enough of my worries about my job, although when I just saw her, she was sympathetic. That was kind of weird. I'm also just, from a previous relationship I was in, it's sort of unfair to judge her in this way, I was in my early twenties and I was dating this woman, Susan, and she was married. I thought we already had talked about her? Yeah. Chris was super judgmental. She was like, "What did you expect? She was a cheater. You were cheating. She's going to cheat on you." She had just had a huge blow-up with an ex-boyfriend who cheated on her, so she was a bit militant about that. I haven't talked to her again since [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:16) because I'm just afraid she's going to say that again. (pause) [00:32:39] I guess I want to give my friends a chance to be supportive, but I don't want to give them a chance to be negative or condemning. I just don't want to go [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:02) (pause) [00:33:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are at least worried and maybe also don't anticipate that their responses might not be that much about you, like they might have some general view about going to therapy, let's say, or analysis; but it's not like, "Oh, yes. That sounds like a good thing for you," or "I can see why you would want to try that out for now," or "other things you are hopeful or worried about it." You know what I mean? Or even like, "Maybe that wouldn't be good for you right now because of blah, blah, blah." It's kind of generalized, the way you describe it. Like, "They just think it's self-involved." It's sort of like a broadside, in other words I think it's going to make you in particular more self-absorbed rather than them. (chuckles) I'm sort of struck by that in how you talk about it. [00:35:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a hard time thinking of someone saying directly, "I don't think you should go to therapy more," even though that sounds like a general statement and I would feel that. I also sort of think about when I talk to friends and try to be encouraging it's sort of awkward to say, "I think you'd really benefit from therapy," in a way that doesn't sound like, "I think you're really crazy and should talk to somebody." [00:36:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I certainly hope it's clear that that's not what I'm saying. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I know. I just think when I talk to people, it tends to be a little more general to kind of avoid sounding stigmatizing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not like, "Yeah, maybe it could make things easier or less stressful or it helps to get out some things to make you feel better;" but like "Wow, yeah. You really ought to "[ ] (inaudible at 00:37:51) </p>

<p>CLIENT: There is this mental health activist, who is working on destigmatizing mental health in African-[ ] (inaudible at 00:38:11) communities, and so she did this event, where people should talk about mental health problems without being ashamed. It was interesting and also intense to read. One of the things I was thinking about was how I can talk about my own individual experience in therapy and why it's been helpful in general ways of how it's helped with this or it's helped with that; but I find it hard to talk to someone else about why they, as an individual, might want to. I know I shouldn't find myself being circular, kind of vague or waiting for them to say, "I was thinking of going to a therapist because I've been having these problems." I'm like, "Yes, that's a great idea." [00:39:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if it's, "Yeah, I think it would help?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could imagine that you are also concerned about being controlling or autocratic. I'm thinking about your mom sort of insisting stuff and things and you are, I imagine, not wanting to be that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Also having a couple of friends who are vocally, intensely anti-psychotic medication and vaguely anti-therapy in a way makes me more tentative about it, I guess. I don't know. I'm sort of thinking about it and I definitely have friends who see therapists regularly who do various things, but they don't really talk about it like it's a little bit—like I have friends who are more specific about their sex life than if they're taking psychiatric medication, which, talking about sex life is certainly interesting and more fun than talking about whatever drugs you're taking. It just becomes this weird thing where I sort of feel like it's this taboo where we stop talking about it? Are we talking about it? I feel like there is this secret, invisible line of, "You may have this much therapy and no more." And if you do more than that, then you're either super mentally unstable. Gwyneth Paltrow is really self-involved. She has a magazine called Goof, in which she talks about she is very self-involved. It's her magazine. It's sort of like an e-mail newsletter but it's also her spending lots of money on things and talking about herself and why a $500 [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:29) was emotionally painful. It's really weird. When I talk about "Gwyneth Paltrow problems" is when you're annoyed that your farm share doesn't have enough organic parsley or whatever; or you're mad that you can't find locally-sourced wheat. I've been worried that my friends will be like, "Oh, wow. Karen is getting some Gwyneth Paltrow problems there. Does she really need that? Is she just being self-involved or selfish or something?" (pause) [00:45:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's possible we'd spend most of our time talking about local-sourced organic wheat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is something I think about. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are things you struggle with and that cause you trouble and that, I think, have been hard to do away with in a way you like. I think I also could help, probably make it easier to get some sort of traction on. As I spoke the other day, I certainly don't think it's something that you have to do but is sort of like optional treatment or anything like that. I think people often have the experience that it's, in a way, easier and in a way harder to work on things in analysis. It's easier because you convey your instinct to them more. It's more invasive. It's more like the roommate thing. The problems are right there and you are confronted with them in this direct way where you can then work on them with no time off in the relationship. That can make it more emotional in certain respects. It can be more intense or more vulnerable in certain ways and, at the same time, easier. [00:47:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I find it both scary and encouraging, doing more intense therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something I always say—that sounds about right. Sure, it's more scary. That's kind of the thing, but [ ] (inaudible at 00:48:14). We should stop for now, but we'll talk more next time.</p>

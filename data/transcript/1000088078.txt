</p><p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: 1970. Client Number 0735-103 Number 10... (phone ringing)

</p><p>PATIENT: Are you game for blind dates?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why?

</p><p>PATIENT: Got a friend of ours that stays with us for about three weeks, and we're going to this party Saturday night and he's coming out Saturday night and spend the night and goes to church with us Sunday and everything. Got this party come up so, I asked if you want to come out early. So in the process I said, "Well, are you going to bring your date or do you want me to see if I can find you one?" He said, "Well, you get me one." (Robling) And I said, "Well, I'll see what I can do." He's about 28 I guess or so, single of course, tall about 6'3" or so I guess it is, thin, average looking I guess you'd say. He's a manager of this Grocery Store out in Colchester I believe it is. I thought maybe if you want to come out and go to the party with the three of us, why I would present it to you, if you didn't, well fine.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Thank you, I don't think that would [inaudible at 0:01:27.3]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think though that... 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's awful late to be trying to find a date.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [overlapping voices]... wanting to just see more of me in some way or other?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I just thought maybe you might want to... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like it might be a nice thing that was going to work out well for everybody concerned, huh (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. For you and him, not for you and me, that's why I was asking. But I did keep in mind certain things, like maybe you didn't want him to know about this, feeling it would influence it or something, and I thought well, I could introduce you as somebody else...and then it would never have to be said where I happened to know you from or anything. Let's see now, where am I? No more weird dreams. Things on my mind right at the moment are, this possibility of having to go out of town tomorrow or the next day. So the first thing that appears in my mind is, well, can my wife go with me, see?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: So and things are a little bit, just a fraction more compatible now than they were 20 or 48 hours ago, see. So I called her and she said, no, she couldn't get off. They had a girl quit and they just, she couldn't...didn't have anybody else that could work her place and all this, so. Okay, fine, I accept that. So the next thing I say, well, now how can I be out of town the least amount of time it would be beneficial to her? So I thought well... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The least amount of time that she'd have to try and get away with something?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I thought, well now let's see, if I leave tonight and I'm in the lab all day tomorrow and get back tomorrow night, now that would give her almost two nights there that she could arrange something. So I thought well, better still, I'll try to leave tomorrow night, get in the lab the first thing Friday morning and get back Friday afternoon late...so that I wouldn't... (makes noise) Then, since then, why they, it has been a possibility that I won't even have to go on the trip, so. My boss has a real tight austerity program. The first way for him to cut down on money is to quit sending me on trips, because I pad my expense account something ferocious...and he knows this. He approves them but he knows it. He knows when he sends me out on trips it's going to cost him some money, because I buy steak dinners and I put it down as steak dinners plus... But I mean, he goes out on a trip, he buys hamburgers and hot dogs and puts it down as hamburgers and hot dogs, and if that's what he wants, fine, not me. He's trying to put off this possibility, I mean, and I think he knows that I'm going to have to go down there to the lab one of these days, so he's trying to make sure that I accomplish as much as possible for the amount of money he's going to have to be out to send me down there, and well he's kind of put it off for another week or so. [0:04:42.8]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he doesn't have to send you twice?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess that's okay with you [overlapping voices]... 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's fine with me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're wanting to keep your wife on a tight leash?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right at the moment, yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not give her any rope to play with?

</p><p>PATIENT: This idea of me trusting her completely and her trusting me completely hasn't really got off the ground yet, it's still kind of running along the runway. And then last night, [inaudible at 0:05:09.6]... yeah, the last night, the phone rang and so, I was downstairs watching TV. I thought, well I'll just kind of amble upstairs and get me a drink of water and kind of in the process see what's going on. So I went upstairs and she was talking on the phone, and when she got through why, of course she says, "Well, I'll just see you later John." And this, is one of her boyfriends see. So I said, "Well, what's happening?" "Oh," she said, "well I called Jill, this guy's wife, in the middle of the afternoon to ask her if she wanted to go, her and him, wanted to go play tennis with you and I and Rob and his wife." And she said, "Oh, it sounded fine with her, she'd have to check with John when he got home." And so when he got home, he had been to this funeral, a fireman's funeral, he's a volunteer firefighter, and he was kind of tired from that, so he didn't want to go. But the way she talked on the phone, I, the first thing that I asked her after that was, "Then you all got something planned for tonight?" And instead of her giving me the answer that I was really wanting, she kind, "No, just, you know, had called to see if they wanted to go play tennis with us." And all this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What did you want her [say about it?] (ph) [0:06:23.6]

</p><p>PATIENT: I wanted her to get a little upset about it...kind of get mad about the fact that I was questioning her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, get concerned?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, get concerned a little bit, just a little bit at least. But, like I said, this I think influenced the idea today, why if I have to go out of town, it's going to be that I'm out of town the least amount of time as possible.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean like when she didn't get concerned, that said to you she's not very involved, and that said to you, you better make sure you're not out of town?

</p><p>PATIENT: That reinforces the fact that there's still a little bit of a question in my mind. Is she really... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...going to hold up to her word? Because to me it, it's just inevitable that if I go out of town for a couple of days that there's going to be something happening. And this time I don't think she'd tell me about it because of the fact that she's supposed to be...changing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's for you is like, it's inevitable. Like, you're off the scene, you know she's going to go start seeing someone?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't know, let's put it that way, but I would have 85 to 90 percent... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...suspicions that she would if I was to put it down in numbers.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I kind of treat it as the way I would be if I was in that situation. I might say I was going to do something but then...if I ever had the opportunity to go back on my word I probably would but just, maybe I'm just that type I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what you'd do, so...hell, if you'd do it, you know she's certainly going to do it.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's in my mind that when we go driving around someplace...it's always, well I wonder if she's been to that restaurant with one of her boyfriends...or something like this? And the other night we were coming back from someplace out west and came through this forest and as we did, why she was telling me about this place that she went to eat with one guy one time. And right now, this forest here, is a bad memory to me, so to speak. Nothing may have ever happened in that forest, but it's just that it was told to me in that forest, about something that did happen and I associated this forest with this bad thing, so to speak. And so consequently, the two have a bad omen in my, or the forest has a bad omen in my mind.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Almost like, everywhere gets structured in terms of, is this where she met some guy? Like this, is important enough that, that's how things in the world get categorized for you? [0:10:24.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: And if I were ever to tell her things like this it would be, oh, that's childish...or you're acting silly, you're acting stupid or something like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You see it gets him?] (ph) Ana (ph) probably trivializes it or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it may do that from her standpoint, but for me it just irritates me. I keep thinking, well, now I've got a college education, she's only got a high school education, yet she tries to present it as the fact that she's got the PhD and I'm just a grade school grad or something like that, and that serves to further irritate me, and... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What right does she have to tell me I'm silly? Has she received a PhD or something? [blank audio from 0:11:44.1 to 0:13:03.1] You've got to try to talk to her.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm setting here sorting out my thoughts to see what I should say that would help the sessions.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh?

</p><p>PATIENT: And kind of pushing the things aside of that I don't think very, are important, that would... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...not add or subtract or anything like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: This little episode, just before I came over here, is passing through my mind that, the boss and I were talking, we ate dinner together, and we were talking about this piece of equipment there in Missouri and what we needed to do on it before I went down there. And so, what I needed to do was find out what the cooling system on this equipment was and then he wanted me to go over next door and talk to this specialist on it. And I called him to find out what's the cooling setup was on the equipment. And I called over next door and the specialist was in the lab up on the west side of New York. So I got to thinking, "Well, first thing the engineer will ask me is, what we want to accomplish? And probably the second thing is, what type of funds do we have to accomplish this with?" And as I sat there and asked the questions to myself about what he would ask me probably, or I asked my boss what he thought I should do...just out of curiosity, and he said, "Well, call up on the west side and get a hold of this guy." And, to me it wasn't that important to call the guy in the lab when he might be working...to try to disrupt his schedule that he might have. And so two things, either I solve the problem myself or I find another specialist that works with this guy and ask him the questions. And as I sat there and asked the questions to myself, I decided that I could accomplish the same thing by just...just doing a little research on my own. Because my boss hadn't even given me the credit ability of being able to do this, I guess, and so he just said, "Well, now you go check with this specialist and..."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He just assumed that you couldn't do it yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it gives me the impression that he just assumes that I can't do certain things and then writes it off.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Writes you off?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that may be true. That's why I keep hoping someday I'm going to find another job I can go to, and then he can just write me off completely and then he'd, after I've left he won't, he might change his mind about me. [0:16:00.9]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, like maybe when your reflection comes on he'll appreciate you?

</p><p>PATIENT: If there is a reflection. I understand they had, well, they had about six guys or so in there making applications right after school was out...a bunch of new college graduates they interviewed and then, from what I can gather and nothing official, but one or two of them that they tried to hire turned them down. And this to me is kind of amusing, to find out that nobody will work in that job for maybe the pay or the location or whatever it is, but nonetheless, he is going to have trouble finding somebody to replace me, is sort of amusing to me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you'd just have friendship (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: To a certain extent.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I was just thinking about an approach somebody might have taken to your boss was to, just to tell him, "Look, you know I don't think I need to go out and talk to that specialist on the west side. I think I can manage to handle that by myself." And that...I guess like, how come you didn't do something like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I, what I did, he was in the office working on analyzing a form, a customer complaint form, and when I decided that this was a simple problem that could be solved by...by myself, and instead of going over, I've done this several times, I've gone to the specialists and presented what two or three facts that we had, and they ask questions, of course, that I couldn't answer because it wasn't my... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:18:19.7]

</p><p>PATIENT: ...position to answer these questions, and it made me look rather stupid. So what I did was, sat down and I drew a little sketch of what we needed to do and left it on my desk, and then turned around and walked out and came over here, in hopes that he'd come by there and see that...what the solution to the problem is. He'd either think that I had talked to this guy or someone else or had solved the problem myself, I don't know. But anyway, nonetheless, I left that little sketch there hoping he'd notice it. And when I go back I'm going to present it to him, "Now here's the way we solve the problem." And if he asks did I talk to this guy, which is going to be probably the first question he asks and I'll say, "No." You know when I first went to work for this place this guy was a sort of a father image to me. I went in there with a great deal of respect and admiration and all this...and if he said anything, it's got to be true. And then as things went, I don't know, it became evident to me that his word always wasn't law. And the guy that works there in, well the other, the guy that's an specialist that works there with me, treats this boss with a sort of a, oh, brotherly treatment...and he'd talk right back to him like..."That can't be done, we can't do that. I don't care what you say, it's not going to be done." And this type of stuff, so...it finally came to me, "Well why don't you...stand up and treat him the same way?" And here lately, I've been assuming more and more of this independent competitor type of thing..." Well okay, if I think what he says is the best way to do it fine. If I don't, I'll stand up and say, 'Well now there's another way to do that.'" Or trying to be somewhat tactful about everything...I might say, "Well now we could do it this other way." Or something like that, and there's none of this father image... [0:20:34.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...to a great extent. Maybe there's just a little.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's not your father anymore?

</p><p>PATIENT: He's not my father anymore maybe.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But like, you're telling me about this incident and like I got that you didn't want to go to the other specialist and get asked questions that you couldn't be really expected to know the answer, but still, it would make you feel foolish. But what I don't understand is like, why you're letting this sketch be discovered instead of saying, "Here, I worked out this thing. I didn't go talk to the guy, I didn't really need to. Here it is."

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know, I just didn't... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...think of it in that realm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Was it kind of like, well he told you to talk to the specialist?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, he told me to talk to him and so he told me to do it, so I thought well, I should do it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if you don't do it his way maybe he'll be annoyed at you or...?

</p><p>PATIENT: He does hold the purse strings.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Better not cross him? [0:21:54.6]

</p><p>PATIENT: I cross him enough it seems like as it is, but... I still keep it in the back of my mind that he, well, he's tolerated me quite a bit, and I think I think of this to a certain extent. There have been times when the people that I have been associated with have told him that I do a lousy job, and so, he has turned around and a couple of times laid the law down to me...and kind of verbally whipped me, you might say. Which I'll admit it was deserving. A lot of times I don't do any more than I have to, and when I don't have to do something it sometimes doesn't get done. Like I said, when he threw this last raise at me and I was more or less insulted by it, rather than being pleased or anything like that, it just came to the point where I then said, I'm going to do what's necessary and that's all. What's necessary just to maintain my job and after that forget it. I keep saying to myself, "I can do a hell of a lot more, if I was just getting reimbursed for it." And in a way I kind of feel sorry for the guy, because besides me he's got this intern who thinks he's a specialist, doesn't do his intern job at all. In fact he doesn't do much of anything really, when you get down to it, he piddles around and calls what he does research, I guess you'd call it, and has decided to promote himself to a specialist, and he's hired as a intern and is paid as a intern and things like this, and this further tends to disgust me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It disgusts you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I see if, well if he can get away with not doing anything, why should I try to do anything more than what's necessary?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [I see, I see.] (ph) If he's slacking off and getting away with it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: So why should I work?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:24:38.7]

</p><p>PATIENT: Especially when it comes around to doing his work. Every once in a while, well let's give him a hand, do his work...and this really cuts across the grain. So I feel sorry for the guy in a way because he's got problems with the people that work with him and he doesn't really seem to know how to straighten them out. Now if it was me, I wouldn't (ph) solve the problem in certain ways and, or I would try to solve the problem in certain ways, whereas, he tries to, or he gives me the impression he's just tried to ignore it, in hopes that it will go away, I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I was just thinking of, well you've said this several times, like give up, like he doesn't pay you and so you're not going to put out when he's not paying you decently, and...you're not going to let yourself be taken advantage of that way. You know it kind of sticks there every time.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think that's the whole crux of the problem. To me that would solve a lot more problems than just getting me to work. I think if he paid me what I felt I was worth and I got to working, the other guy might decide that he'd, to work too, or... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if there's anything you could do about this situation? Like you're doing, you're certainly doing one thing, you're looking for another job. But is there anything that you could do to make staying more satisfying for you, until the other job comes along?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't think there's a lot I could do because I don't have control of the situation. Unless I was given complete control of at least myself, well then I couldn't do a whole lot.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by complete control of yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, for instance, if I was to, if he was to say, "Now here's this equipment, we need to do this that and the other for this reason." To do it and give me complete control and...if I felt, well I need to jump in the car and run down to this lab just to check out these few things and come back, and didn't feel that I was going to be reprimanded for spending money, when I could've just called down there. You can't accomplish the same thing really by calling as you can by looking at something. Things like this I feel would be what you'd call, give me complete control of myself at least. [0:27:48.9]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, kind of trusting you and giving you the responsibility?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I said, there's a lot of changes that need to be made and until he makes some changes, I don't think that I can be expected to change too much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Is there any way you could get him to let you do that?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I could go to him and have one of these father and son talks like I've done before I think, but whether it would accomplish it or not, I don't know. I've gone in there and asked him if I could talk to him. We shut the doors and we have a little father and son session type thing.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's questions, there's something icky (ph) about him, like you feel like the son going to the father or something I guess?

</p><p>PATIENT: And sometimes I feel like I'm crawling in there on my hands and knees, and I'm expected to be the servant coming to the master and saying, "Now look... " I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of humiliating?

</p><p>PATIENT: "...here's the way I see things." And of course, in that situation, he said, "Well, your opinion is your own you know." And that's as far as it will go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like he'll say, "Yes, I recognize that, that's your opinion, but that's..."

</p><p>PATIENT: His opinion to the situation is entirely different. And that's the impression that I got when I talked to him about this raise last year, that I was putting myself on the block and then he just won't chop my head off, why things would be much better. I mean, as far as I'm concerned he chopped my head off, so.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So well like, you have every reason to expect it will be like that again. Like he won't pay any attention to what you say?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's more like pouring water on the duck's back.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just bounce off. [blank audio from 0:30:01.5 to 0:30:40.0] So like, why humiliate yourself for nothing?

</p><p>PATIENT: It seems like I've been relegated to this intern's role, where you don't know anything, you just do what you're told, type of thing...and to me it's just not compatible. I just won't accept it. And this, I do what I have to and that's all, is my way of fighting it. [blank audio from 0:31:07.1 to 0:31:49.6] I keep thinking, "Well the next job I want to be in the position where I'm sort of a manager and at least the things, well, I think I can do a better job now." And then I keep thinking, "Now you might just fall flat on your face, so you'd better watch out about getting into a situation where you're the boss." And so there's this battle going on, should I or shouldn't I try to get into a position where I'm the manager or where I'm a boss or something like that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In some ways that's what you really want, but in other ways, you're not sure that you can do a really good job?

</p><p>PATIENT: A long time ago it...in my mind it came to me that this, is the way this place ought to be set up. That this guy ought to be the boss and he ought to have this other specialist and myself as sort of his subordinates and each of us have, maybe an intern working under us. And I never have presented this to him and I doubt that I ever will, because it's just not what he would accept I don't think, from several standpoints. And to me this would be an improvement, but like I say, I'll never present it because it's just not what he would consider feasible. One time I presented an idea to him and it got, well more or less you might say, laughed right out of the room. So I said, " I'd just as well, okay, he's the boss, I'll let him figure up the wise ideas." And not too long ago I had this project up in Maine where a customer came to us and they wanted these specimens tested, and so I let him set up the project the way he would do it...and, "You do this and you do that." And so I went and did what he told me to. And come three months later, "Well now, why didn't we do this?" And I just sat there and looked at him..."Well, you're the boss, why didn't we do it?" In my mind, I didn't say that to him, but I was thinking, "Well, now you're the boss, why the hell didn't we do it?" And it was a real big mistake you might say, and I think he expected me to come up with this idea, "Now, you should have thought of this you know." Or something like this and I think, "The hell with it, you're the boss, you're the one that should have thought of it, I'm not getting paid to think of it, as far as I can comprehend." [0:34:09.2]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess he's going to laugh at you when you give him suggestions. Well, he can just go...you're not going to give him any helpful ideas when you think of them. I mean, he can stew in his own juice if that's they way he wants it. [blank audio from 0:34:26.5 to 0:35:02.2]

</p><p>PATIENT: I keep thinking, "Well, the next job I would just as soon be a guy pushing a broom down the street, at least I'd have complete control over the broom."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Makes you really bitter not to be trusted to handle your own things. [blank audio from 0:35:27.4 to 0:36:12.0] And I guess, like it sort of implies in what you said, it's like he has to give you trust. Trust isn't the kind of thing that you can take.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think he looks at it from the standpoint of, he's tried it and it doesn't work, so he's not going to try it again. So, it's what you might call a Mexican standoff.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I won't move and he won't move.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And he won't move because according to his life, he's already tried and it hasn't work. And you won't move because you're damned if you're going to humiliate yourself again. But I guess, what I keep pushing you on today is like, isn't there some way you can make a move that isn't humiliating to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know, maybe. You know, what the next problem is, is whether I'm going to have the ambition to make that move or not?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like there's some sort of fundamental sense in which you're really tired?

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean like to me I'm getting this 'you're not capable' from more than just him. I get it from my wife. I get it from my kids it seems like. It's just that it's surrounding me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How come voices on every side say, "You're not capable." And one over there saying, "And I don't think you're capable either."

</p><p>PATIENT: So I'm just going to sit there and show them my incapability. - Excuse me, could I run to the restroom for a minute?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure. [0:38:27.8]

</p><p>PATIENT: Thank you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess like, it hurts and depresses you to have all of them saying you're not capable?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, from the standpoint of work it kind of disgusts me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But taking them all into consideration, I guess you might say it depresses me, yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of zaps your ambition and vitality.

</p><p>PATIENT: A lot of times I've gotten into a situation where I...didn't like all the surroundings, and then sometimes, I was able to just pull up and get out of it you know? And to a certain extent here, I'm kind of trapped until I find something else, and maybe that enters into it too. Or I say a lot of times, it seemed like sometimes you're able to just withdraw from the adverse situations and improve the whole picture maybe. What I'm think of is, the one time there in the service, when I was, had gone through basic and then I had been assigned to a logistics school. And gone to the logistics school and decided I didn't want to pursue it and I was smart enough to figure out how to get out of the thing. So I went back for reassignment and had taken a test to prove to them that I was a draftsman, which I wasn't, and I passed that. And so while I was waiting for assignment, why I mean I had to just kind of sit there and do odd jobs around the base... And so, they had assigned me to this dispensary, where I was to work at odd jobs, anything from sweeping up to pushing pills to giving shots, just anything that they thought you might need to do. For some reason or other, I decided that, that was an adverse situation and I just came in one day and told them I'd got my orders and I was supposed to be shipped out... I hadn't gotten my orders but it was...a good way to get out of this situation that I had decided that I didn't want to be in any longer. Things like this...you wish you could do that now and say, "Well, I've been assigned over here, so I'll see you all and good bye." And maybe you haven't been assigned over there, you just kind of get out of the situation you're in at least. [0:41:37.8]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, get the hell out of the situation. Because I guess that some situations that you, they've already gone too sour to want to patch them up any?

</p><p>PATIENT: Seems like to me that's the easiest way, is just to kind of remove yourself from bad places and... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, find yourself a good place.

</p><p>PATIENT: ...find yourself something else that may be good and may not, you never can tell, until you've been in it a while. That's kind of one reason why I've always been highly in favor of these trial marriages you know. It would be nice if you could just kind of go in for a year or so to try it out. If you like it then fine, make it official or something. But I think ours wouldn't have lasted past the first year if that would've been the case.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Once you both had a chance to see what it was like, you would have both known that it wasn't for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: But now that you're in it and so, well, it's gone on because of the fact that you thought it was too hard to get out, and now it doesn't seem to be any easier to get out of the situation. So you just decide to let it go on and on and on. Kind of halfway in the back of your mind, hoping that some day the situation will change. Maybe I'll die and she'll be free to go on her happy way or maybe she'll die and I'll be free to go on my happy way or something. I don't know, or just kind of hope for the impossible to happen maybe.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: My only dying would really fix it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's the cheap way out, yeah. At least it seems that way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And to an extent, it looks attractive because it is a way out.

</p><p>PATIENT: I used to, to a certain extent, envy people who were sick, because they had all this sympathy that people were feeling for them...they felt sorry for them or at least they said they did...and they brought them presents and flowers and things like this...and they really had it, or the best of all possible worlds maybe. It's a childish way of looking at it I guess you'd say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But still like in a, it would be kind of nice to get a little of that sympathy sometimes, because you sure don't see much. [blank audio from 0:45:20.8 to 0:46:18.0] Yeah, I was just thinking that it's awfully cold for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: I was thinking about the same thing more or less. I was thinking about things that happened last night. We went to play tennis and I took my sunglasses off and laid them next to the tennis court and a little two-year-old got a hold of them and I told her to take them to her mother. And then we got in the car and we drove off and went down the street and halfway home I decided I couldn't locate my sunglasses. So I asked my wife and no, she didn't have them. So immediately I put the full blame on her because of the fact that she was just sitting there next to the tennis court and she should've been more responsible for...the things that were laying there. And she completely, was irresponsible I guess from my standpoint, because she hadn't even worried about what...was there. So I blew up and told her that she owed me a six-dollar pair of sunglasses because when I put them over there that meant for her to take care of them and she didn't, so.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like what really got you peeved there, was that she didn't care enough to worry about your sunglasses?

</p><p>PATIENT: She doesn't care enough to worry about anything it seems like a lot of the time. She doesn't care enough to worry whether I'm sick or well or anything it seems like. The house is clean, the house is dirty, who cares? And she gives me this impression that she could just care less about what's going on. I buy a paper every day and I read it from front to back and I know what's going on...in the world, in the city more or less. And I said something to her about such and such a thing in the paper. "Oh, I didn't read that." She hardly ever reads the paper. So here lately she's been picking up the little paper out there in the suburbs and then she'd ask me something about what's going on in the suburb and I said, "Well, I don't know, I don't read that paper." And she comes back with this, "Well, you don't know what's going on. You read the world news and don't even pay attention to the local news." Fine, I don't give a damn what goes on out there. I care more whether we are bombing China or not, than whether city hall is trying to put up a new city hall down the street from us or what goes on around there. Our philosophies just don't match up. Our ideals or whatever you want to call it. [0:49:17.2]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just don't share ideas about what's important?

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't change her to accept mine. She can't change me to accept hers. So it just seems like it sort of is another Mexican standoff.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [blank audio from 0:49:38.6 to 0:49:59.0] And it sucks. [blank audio from 0:49:59.7 to 0:50:27.2] And I guess [we should end there.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. [blank audio from 0:50:28.9 to 0:50:57.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And next Monday, two o'clock good?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. [blank audio from 0:51:02.4 to 0:51:47.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Bye. [0:51:59.1]

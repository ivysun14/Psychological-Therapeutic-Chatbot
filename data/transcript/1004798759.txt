<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (clears throat)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so today when I left work to come over here—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was having like so, like—periodically I'm having this feeling of (pause) not just really depressed, but... I guess just don't want to go. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was after I had left work, I was kind of leaving work, frustrated about something, and then when I was walking down the steps, I just wanted to sit down and not like... And it wasn't like not going to therapy, it was just like, I just want to sit down and not do anything? Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was happening a little bit, like, before I left. (pause) It feels kind of weird to me that (clears throat, pause) it doesn't feel like necessarily anything happening that's extremely difficult. Like—I guess it's not like it's a new stressful situation. Does that make sense? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I don't want to—I just don't want to. I was so surprised when I felt that in the morning. But also, just, other times, I kind of just want to sit down somewhere and not... I think I just have to deal with just things that I have to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (clears throat) (pause) [00:02:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um. (pause) I don't know, there was also... Today at work was a lot of (pause) I guess just, like, stupid, like minor irritations, bickerings. Like stupid things happened, I finally had use of the cell phone, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Chet agreed that us meeting every time was, like, weird and stupid, so I was like, "Yes! That's great!" He brought it up out of nowhere. But also, there's this conference I wanted to go to that Chet wanted to send me to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the one in Chicago?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so, Chet talked to HR, and their response was, well, I'm not really an employee, I'm just positional, the Fair Labor Act says you can't send me to a conference because the conference might run more than seven hours, and I only get paid for seven hours of work. So I can't go. (clears throat) Yeah. I can, however, work an additional fourteen hours the next two weeks, and then bank that time, and then use that. (clears throat) Yeah. Which (pause) is really don't—and my other thing is, I can't report it in our time management system because it would be overtime. They don't formulate bank hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's this weird, convoluted—and so Chet's going to be away for the next two or three weeks. And my temptation is, well, I could just say I worked an extra forty hours. And not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because no one would know. And I'm debating that. (sighs) Because I think it's really stupid. The other thing that has been frustrating to me is—you people put your problems to me, and lately I've had a lot of bad people say, "Well, it doesn't work." And when I ask for details, they get really frustrated and say, "It doesn't work, it doesn't work, it doesn't work." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, "Well, did you try..." "It doesn't work." So... and so far every single time I've played on the computer, I've fixed it, so it's super frustrating. Um... and so today, I noticed one of the scanners has got a weird out of order sign. It's got a scan but one, you're supposed to date it and put your initials next to it, so I didn't know what happened and who reported it to me, and then there are these weird signs that like, you know, "This machine is not working properly. This machine is broken. IT, we ask that you please repair it ASAP." Normally it just says, "The machine is out of service. This machine is not working. It will be serviced. Call for service," stuff like that. And the signs, do you know we disagreed about that? So at first I couldn't find who put the signs up, and I asked around and no one knew. So I'm like, "Okay, this like, bugs. Who cares who put up signs?" But this was printed out, so it was kind of weird. And then one of the signs was on the wall on the thing, and at least one of the computer signs had not been there on Monday, when I was done but were there on Tuesday, which was also weird. </p>

<p>And I think I figured out who did it, but I don't know why. It's cool, because he's very like, freaked out by technology, and any deviation from what he expects, and he just freaks out and says, "It's not working. It's not working." Or he'll get really upset and stressed, and like, he doesn't deal well with change. So I think he started leaving them, and I think it might be... Like it's new that he's been leaving signs. Normally he just does the normal procedure, informs me the second something's down, whatever. And I asked him in e-mail about it, and he was saying, "Well, sometimes the scanners weren't working, sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, I wanted to put this on this here and on your list, but I didn't, so I just put up a sign." (pause) And (pause) I thought it was really obnoxious. Especially because almost every time someone complains about the scanners, it's a problem that's like referred on the back next to it. And that I've explained to everyone, over and over, and yet... </p>

<p>The biggest problem is the USB drives. Like the little... so people put them on their keychain, they put them in their pockets, they just get damaged. And some of them have crazy software on them that tries to install itself. So if you put it in the machine, the machine's like, "Oh, you're trying to install something," and it's broken. So the system wouldn't be doing that if there were ten USB drives that got tested, knew they would work, students could check them out, it doesn't save to the drive, Like if it doesn't save to your drive, it's probably your drive, go check out a USB drive. And whenever someone's like, "It's not working, it's not working," I say, "Did you try the USB drive?" But it worked, you know, four months ago, or why is this not working? It's the USB drive that's not working. They're not indestructible. Um... (pause) so... it's really (pause) It just feels really petty and passive-aggressive to (pause) A., never remember the things I taught you how to do, but B., (pause) now he's insisting that the machine just doesn't work randomly, and it needs to be fixed. So I'm not doing whatever I need to do to make it get fixed. (clears throat) Even though he's like, you know, like, "Where's the magic fix?" And I keep on explaining it, and I keep on getting it... It's going to become the world's most thankless job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that was part of it. For a little while I was sitting, going over this e-mail, asking the question like, "Why did you do this?" when I'm not going to get an answer I like. And the other thing which some library employees have started doing is refusing to troubleshoot any scanners, printers, or computers, because they feel that it's not in the job description, and because they're already overworked, they shouldn't troubleshoot. They should just put up the sign, and maybe call IT and find out. It's their form of protest against being overworked. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that means you then have to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, there are other areas that aren't mine that are doing it, but yeah, they're doing it up and down my side. I get to deal with it. (pause) And also, I'm pretty sure they're... I mean, the expectation is they're supposed to try something. Like before putting an out of order sign. Especially something that super people use. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) [00:13:32]</p>

<p>So (clears throat, pause) I'm thinking about (pause) your comment earlier about not feeling like coming here today. I understand that that's not all you meant by that, because that happened with work and a lot of other things too. (pause) Um, and at one level I guess it could be coming to both of us that (pause) you anticipated coming here and talking about things that are frustrating and upsetting. And (pause) um, focusing on the way those things make you feel bad. And (pause) technically, you weren't looking forward to that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually wasn't so much not wanting to go to therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That wasn't the thing it was for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I misunderstood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was... I was just thinking like, "Okay, well, after therapy I have to pick up my furniture, my new chair, bring it home, and I have to do all these things."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I just really don't want to—like it's more like there's these things I have to do tonight, and I don't want to do any of them. And like, walking to here is sort of like, the beginning of the things I have to do this evening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's not actually the therapy part that was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I misunderstood. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, we could probably say it's what comes after.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. More like just having stuff you have to do. And sort of like, as much as walking and getting here, and knowing what to do next and having to go do that. It was more that than the actual sitting here and talking part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like other times I feel that way, it's very much like, you know, I don't want to leave the house because leaving the house means I have to walk to the bus stop and go to work and do these things, and then come back from work and do these other things. And I just want to—I just don't want to do any of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause) It's like a slippery slope once the step you take goes out the door.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And also just this moment of, if I just sit down, and don't go, like physically move, then I don't have to worry about it. These things I don't want to do. It's like there won't be consequences. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I want to do, I guess, is just sit down, not go, and just have everything get done, and have it not be a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have it all go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) [00:18:13] </p>

<p>(clears throat)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's also kind of despairing, you know what I mean? As well. It's just like (pause) it wouldn't help me to try and think, okay, well, how am I doing? What's going on? And (pause) you know, it's almost like I could cry. If I could—I know I say that a lot, but I would just be a mess. And the other thing circulating was, um (pause) overwhelmed. It just seemed like even though none of these things are difficult, and each individual thing is fine, it just feels like there's just too many things to do and not enough time, and I don't feel like (pause) I'm not sure I'm capable of doing it all. (pause, shifts) It makes more sense to me when it's the morning and I have to go to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But this is like, I wasn't getting upset, I wasn't upset about coming here, getting my new chair, I get it from friends who I can go and talk to, so like I get to go on the bus, pick it up and go home, and then there's... Yeah, nothing difficult. And they're things that I like. Or at least just (sighs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it unclear what exactly you're reluctant about there? (pause) [00:21:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (shifts) I feel like I'm battling to get out this feeling, usually, actually now, like I find myself, like my eyes are red and I start tearing up. But I don't feel upset at anything (cries). Well, I mean, that's not true. But I don't know—I'm not really sure what's making me feel oh so upset, and I start crying about it. Does that make sense? The feeling of crying is separate from the emotional part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds to me like (pause) what you're upset about is unconscious. Somehow it's being like evoked by what we're talking about, but hasn't merged its way in and you're kind of cut off from it. That's not unusual for some of the feelings, or the signs of the feelings to come first. The feeling itself lags a bit behind, and the contact shows up somewhere else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just weird. It's kind of upsetting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (crying) I don't cry a lot, and I don't let myself cry a lot. And usually when I do, I'm super upset about something. So (pause) I'm like, okay, I'm crying, which means... it should mean that I'm really upset about something, but I don't, I don't know what the thing is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And you don't feel it on the inside? (pause) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>Do you think not wanting to go places might have something to do with wanting to be able to just, like, sit down and sort of take care of yourself? Or like, do something that's more comforting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (shifts) (sniffles) Maybe, um... (pause) It's partially that, and also like, I guess I'm scared that if I stop and take care of myself that I won't be able to (pause) I guess stop. Being scared. It's a slippery slope of, "Well, if I take this day as my off day, will I take tomorrow off the same way? And this day, and that day?" (pause)</p>

<p>So this weekend, one of my friends was talking about how (pause) she's going very ingrained in the process. And she was saying how she sort of doesn't want to have a moment of breaking down and crying, or telling someone what's going on. Because she feels that if she does that she won't be able to put herself back together and do anything else. Um, (pause) and so we were just like, well, for her, she's associated with the idea that you have to be a strong black woman, and take care of all the things, and you don't have time to break down because you have kids and the rent and your husband, and the thing, and the thing. And so Wanda was, we were talking about parental figures in her life, had really explicitly said to her, like, you can't break, you'd have to be stronger than—you get to be extra strong because people around you are white. So (pause) she told her husband and her husband's... and people were like, well, if she was raped by her husband. But I also felt very overwhelmed, like, "Well, I'd have to keep it together for my kids, and then... there's a need to do all these other things, and then other relatives and other friends and family." And so now, considering she was basically told, you have to be strong, you have to keep it together, you have to keep your family together. And that's what that person said to me. So I do get the feeling of (pause) like it's not okay to be (pause) vulnerable with problems, it's like I guess protecting it together, that sort of thing. I do have someone, my dad. He always had to have this pulled-together exterior, and be more than because you'll be judged on the outside. (pause) So there's that. </p>

<p>And then also Ashby started group therapy, which she hates everyone in her group therapy. And one of the things she was sort of ranting about (pause) I think like two or three of the people aren't able to work. One of them has a trust fund, which obviously is not me. And she was really angry about it. (pause) What she was saying was, I go to work, I pay my rent, I do these things, why can't you? Why are you abdicating responsibility? Are you so sure that you can't go out there? And then also, she's being like, are you aware of what a safety net you already have that you cannot be able to work and still have, like a house and insurance and things. I guess that makes sense. Um (pause) I think it's good that she says that, some people are actually homeless. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) [00:32:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was, um, it wasn't a surprise. I did find it—I wasn't surprised that she hated going to therapy. That's just going to happen. I was surprised at how intensely angry she was, though. (crying) Um, one she was talking about was how people are like, oh, you know, we're sort of supporting people doing things that Ashby probably thought were very small. Like, "You left your house this weekend. Good job." And (pause) she was mad because she was like, "I go to work every day, and you know, it doesn't drop."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess these all sound like—</p>

<p>CLIENT: (blows nose)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —directives or fears about (pause) why you're so afraid to fall apart.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (crying).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mad at you for (pause) you know, like consequences of parents and others you're really unable to stop. (pause) </p>

<p>I wonder whether (pause) I was concerned a few minutes ago that it wasn't just knowing what was upsetting you, but knowing also (pause) being upset in the first place. (pause) Just kind of interesting to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And also I think that I don't like the idea of (pause) being one passive-aggressive coworker away from (pause) like... one passive-aggressive coworker is what I can cope with today, ordinarily that's not good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to be one passive-aggressive coworker away from a crying bathroom or just being really upset. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (clears throat) Right, and this was like, you're pretty sure that your motto is like, if you keep yourself from getting upset, that will make you sturdier later. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause) And no, I think it's more (pause) I guess it's kind of like, I can't be really upset because there's all these things that I have to do, so (pause) I have things that need to get done. Responsibilities. I feel like I won't be able to feel ultimately responsible at the end of the week. I can't look any better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. We'll talk more later on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And can I pay for the extra session on Monday? The extra session?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to pay me now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I want to pay in a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, that's fine. (pause) Wait, you just, I thought you said can I pay for the extra session?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The session that I missed on Monday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You can pay for it next week, it's totally fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll see you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, have fun.</p>

<P>ALIGNING PERCEPTUAL POSITIONS<BR>Connirae Andreas</P>
<P>TRANSCRIPT OF VIDEO FILE:</P>
<P>______________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>The field of NLP includes a wide range of methods for personal change and transformation. These are available because NLP provides us with models and filters that allow us to notice new possibilities. One way the field continues to evolve is through noticing when our current models don't fit with our experience. This pushes us to create a new model that can account for these unexplainable events. Once we have a new way of thinking about things, this in turn, opens up new possibilities for what to do. The concept of Aligning Perceptual Positions occurred to me in this way. The earlier model of three perceptual positions, which will be described on this tape, seemed very useful. And yet it didn't always fit with my experience and that of those I worked with. On this videotape, you'll observe a demonstration of this process for reaching greater personal alignment and congruence. The process allows us to feel more centered and more resourceful, particularly in situations of difficulty, and with relationships that have been troublesome. The demonstration was videotaped at the Rocky Mountain NLP conference in Fall, 1990.</P>
<P><BR>CONNIRAE: This morning, the topic is Aligned Perceptual Positions. And what is that, anyway, right? How many of you know what perceptual positions are? Most of you. We went over that yesterday morning in the introductory track. Most of you got that in your practitioner training. I'll go over it very briefly. Perceptual positions--there are three of them, three key perceptual positions. There are different perspectives that we can take on any situation, interaction or memory. So, if I think back and recall a vacation I went on--well, let's say, later on I'm remembering being here; I'll use that as the example. If tonight I'm thinking over this presentation and kind of thinking about how it went and what I could do better, I could take the position of remembering it from Self position, and looking out of my own eyes, seeing you from this position. That's Self position. </P>
<P>Or, I could take an Observer position (She steps over to the side, and faces where she had been standing.) and I could look at the whole thing as an outside observer. I could see myself doing the presentation. I could see you sitting here and being so interested and attentive and all that, but as an observer watching from a different perspective, right? Any questions so far? </P>
<P>OK. And the third major position that I could take in remembering this later, is I could be one of you. (She turns around.) I could be one of you and looking at myself as a group person and observe from that perspective. Any questions about those three key perceptual positions? OK. So, there's Self, Observer and Other. And those are all very rich, rich perceptual positions. In fact, in the last few years in NLP--many of you know this--there's been a lot of talk and discussion about considering limitations to be the result of being stuck in one or another of those major perceptual positions. </P>
<P>So some of you may feel familiar with one position in particular. You may remember most of your experiences from your own point of view, right? And this will result in certain strengths for you, and it will mean certain weaknesses, and a certain gap of information, if that's the one that you typically remember from. Others of you may find, "Oh yeah. The Observer perspective; that's the one I always take. I'm such good impartial observer, I can--" And again, it has strengths and it also has weaknesses. The position of being an Other has strengths and it has weaknesses. There are certain kinds of information that we can get uniquely from each of those roles. So there has been talk/discussion in the last three years or so--or maybe four or five--in NLP about many limitations being the result of, "OK. That person is stuck in second position or Other position. Or that person is stuck in Observer position, or stuck in Self and not able to be flexible and utilize all three perspectives usefully." Is that familiar to many of you? OK.</P>
<P>Now as I started thinking about this and thinking about my own experience; thinking about working with clients--people in seminars--I began to think about it a little bit differently and that's what led to this presentation this morning. I began to think that maybe it's not so much that we're limited when we're stuck in one of these perceptual positions, but maybe it's that when we're limited, and we're not as resourceful as we want to be, maybe that's a result of having our representational systems split in the different perceptional positions. Now I'll tell you what I mean by that. And if anyone doesn't know what representational systems are, those are the major sensory systems. So, visual--our seeing ability, auditory--our hearing ability, kinesthetic--our feeling ability. Those three major representational systems. <BR>So for example, if kinesthetically my feelings are in first position (so I have my own feelings when I remember something), what if visually I'm looking at myself from the outside at the same time? Now that would be an interesting thing. What if auditorily, I'm primarily hearing from the other person's perspective? That's one example of how I could have my different major sensory systems in a different perceptual position--that's split at the same time. Make sense? OK. Or, it might be that I'm, let's see--sometimes I've encountered it--I'm looking out of the other person's eyes, but I have my own feelings; sometimes that's the way it is. Or sometimes, I'm looking out of my own eyes, but I hear an Observer kind of voice, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," a very neutral, Observer kind of voice. So there are many, many, many ways that this can be sorted out in each of our individual experiences. But thinking about it that way led to some very interesting results. </P>
<P>What I'd like to do is demonstrate for you now, number one, how can we identify--how can we begin to notice in our own selves when we're out of "alignment," when our three representational systems are not lined up in the same perceptual position. Because what seems to happen is that when we get them lined up, and they're in the same perceptual position, it becomes tremendously much easier: number one, to be more resourceful; number two, to go fluidly between all the three major, important positions, so that we are truly wise--so that we can get all the information that is there for us to have. So I'd like to demonstrate that for you, eliciting that--how we can notice for ourselves--and also how we can then line them up. Once we've noticed, "Hey, that's really interesting." If there's time we'll also have you do that in small groups of two. I suspect if we get that far, that you will find some real interesting things in your own experience. I have certainly found many fascinating arrangements with other people and in my own self. When I discovered what I was doing, I went (humorus amazement) "I was doing that?!" Noticing that kind of thing--the way I think about it--it means that you have the opportunity to have more, and to be more, because it means that you've just noticed a key way for you to be more aligned and more resourceful. So it's a really nice thing to be able to notice that because then you can immediately do something about it. </P>
<P>OK. So let's do a demonstration. What I'd like to have is someone who would like to explore this with me here; you're comfortable talking a little content. We don't need very much, but we just need the general category. And you all might think of--well you need to think of, for this--a situation of difficulty or some situation involving one other person that you consider not fully resourceful for you; it's somehow difficult or problematic. One woman thought of, "Oh, you know, my relationship with my mother. That's always been the worst for me." It could be a situation at work. Preferably it's something that you deal with on an ongoing basis, so that it will have real meaning when it's different for you. Not something where, "Oh, that was one time in my life but it's never going to happen again anyway." OK? Is it clear the kind of thing that I'm asking for? OK. Is there anyone who would like to explore that with me? Judy. Great. OK. So you have a situation in mind, and give us the general context. There's one other person involved, right?</P>
<P>JUDY: Difficult client.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So this is a client that you've struggled with; for how long?</P>
<P>JUDY: Six years.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (group laughs) OK, good. That counts. Just want to know if it qualifies. All right. Now, when you think about dealing with this client right now; when you just think about that, I'd like you to notice what is it that you see and especially from what perspective do you see it?</P>
<P>JUDY: I see her. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: So of course, when you ask me the question then I immediately go to all different positions. When you say which position, then I--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Then you try them all out and just check them..</P>
<P>JUDY: Right. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: But when you just spontaneously do it, you see her?</P>
<P>JUDY: Right.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now, where in space do you see her? Is she over here, is she over there, is she over there? (gesturing to her left, front, and right)</P>
<P>JUDY: In front of me. Not too far away, but not too close either. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (to the group) OK. So what we're getting so far-- So far this looks like Self position visually, right? Right out here from-- Now what I'd like you to check, is are you looking exactly out of your own eyes or is there even a slight dislocation? Are you looking at her exactly out of your own eyes, or is there something that's not quite--like front or back or side? As you explore that for yourself, I'd like to comment for you all that frequently people, even when they first go, "I'm in Self position. I see out of my own eyes and I'm looking at the other person," frequently they notice a slight dislocation. And sometimes, it's, "Oh, actually I'm seeing from kind of this point of view right here (gesturing to the left of her head) or actually a little bit of to the side or a little bit off this way. (gesturing to the right of her head) So that's the next thing that I have people check for--if it seems to be out of their own eyes. One person had a very interesting one to me. When he finally understood what I was asking him, after telling me many times, "Well, I'm seeing out of my own eyes," he said, "Oh. What I'm really doing is, it's as if I'm looking from a point-of-view that keeps rotating around my own eyes." And he had one where yeah, that's what I (chuckles) thought too. I thought, "Oh, wow. That's interesting." But literally, his point-of-view kept rotating around his eyes and never quite was out of his own eyes, exactly. When he thought about it, that fit with his experience, and he said, "Oh, that makes a lot of sense out of things for me because I have had this feeling of not wanting to be pinned down. (group laughs) So I just keep moving." So it was really nice that he was able to notice that. Even though it was a really subtle difference; it was an important one for him when he was able to then realign it. (to Judy) OK, so as you check on that, what do you sense for yourself?</P>
<P>JUDY: I can be aware of being somewhat out and above myself. (She gestures with her right hand about 6 inches above her head, and a little to her right.) I don't think it's like an outside observer, exactly. I think it's more like seeing myself a little bit. Not my whole self--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh. Uhuh.</P>
<P>JUDY: Not the front of myself, but just kind of skimming the top of my head.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: From kind of like right here? (gesturing up and behind her head; group laughs) Put your hand exactly where your eyes are, if you can do that. The eyes are seeing from up here sort of. OK. Great. Nice. And she noticed that really easily. So now it gets into the tricky part is how to code this on paper. (She diagrams this on a flip chart.) So, this is Judy and here are her eyes. Kind of looking from that point-of-view; something like that. Just something so I can keep track of it. OK, great. Now, is there anything else you notice about what you see?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, it's more about what I feel.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, yeah. And we'll get to that in a little bit. (group laughs) Soon enough, soon enough. All right, before we let you do that though, we're going to do auditory. So, what do you hear? What are you aware of in terms of the sound when you check?</P>
<P>JUDY: I'm very aware of my own voice feeling annoyed, frustrated--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: She's slipping (into feelings) (group laughs) Humor me, Judy, stay with it. I picked that up. So in terms of the voice part, tell me exactly what you hear? A little dialogue. Word for word. What do you--</P>
<P>JUDY: I don't know.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Did you say you hear the sound of her voice?</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh no. Oh no. It's in my own voice.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: In your own voice. And is it something that you're saying to yourself that you're aware of? </P>
<P>JUDY: No.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Something you're saying to her?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yes.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: But there's a quality to how I'm talking to her that I don't like.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So is what you're hearing a replay of an actual interaction with her, where you did say this to her?</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh, yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Got it. So it's the auditory external that you're hearing. Now, I'm going to ask you a really strange question. Where are you hearing this from, exactly? This is sort of like with the eyes. Where are your ears located? If you could check-- Yeah, where are you hearing it from? Is it exactly through your own ears or is there a slight dislocation?</P>
<P>JUDY: I don't know about space dislocation, but it's very big. It's--you know, because I don't like it, it makes it bigger.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It makes what bigger, exactly? </P>
<P>JUDY: My voice.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Does bigger mean louder? Or are you seeing something that's larger, or--</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, it's funny, because I know I said "bigger." And I know if I stay in auditory it should be "louder," but it really isn't louder.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It doesn't feel that way. OK, good. Good.</P>
<P>JUDY: It's just bigger. Like more--taking more tension.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. And we may find out more about what that means when we get to the kinesthetic system. Right? (group laughs) Where the size comes into this. OK, and as you listen to that, check again for are you listening exactly out of your own ears or is there any slight dislocation.</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, I'm not aware of any.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. And that's fine. That's fine. Now, another question. Are you aware of any commenting voices. You can hear what you say to her. And also, do you have any commenting voices going on too?</P>
<P>JUDY: No, because I do my commenting out loud. So I'll say to her, "I'm aware that I have anger in my voice and I don't like it," and the reason I do, and blah, blah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh. OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: Some people might do that internally; I just say it to her.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Yeah. (group laughs)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: "I'm aware that I have anger in my voice, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." OK, so her voice has-- The pronoun is "I" that we're hearing so far. And this is why--now, when you hear your own voice saying that to her, where is the sound coming from, exactly? </P>
<P>JUDY: (She shrugs, and then takes a deep breath) I don't know any other place than my ears, I mean I mean that I hear it in my ears.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: You hear it in your ears. Where is it? </P>
<P>JUDY: It's coming from my mouth.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So it sounds like it's coming from your mouth as you hear it? (to the group) These are really weird questions, but you'd be surprised at the answers you get sometimes. </P>
<P>JUDY: Well what I keep hearing is--whatever I'm doing is--that it's big. It is still very big. (Judy's right hand gestures in front of her stomach as if cupping/holding something.)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And how are you-- (to the group) She keeps gesturing over here (in front of her). She does that, which does tend to be a kinesthetic access. So as you check-- Let's do the kinesthetic system next (group laughter) and just find out-- Finally, OK! (laughing)</P>
<P>JUDY: That's where it is! (laughing)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I'll let you do this-- I do this last, because for many people the feelings are the result of dislocations in the other two systems. Not always, though. So OK, let's check out the feelings. Whose feelings are you having?</P>
<P>JUDY: (nodding) Mine and hers.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Both of them?</P>
<P>JUDY: I think I am.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: All right. Tell me a little more about that, so I can understand. Do you feel like you're having them both at the same time? Or like some kind of mixture? How is that? How does that work for you?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, they all start out feeling like they're just my feelings. A lot of times, when this anger comes up for me, and it gets most difficult, she is completely shut down kinesthetically, like she's not having them, so I'm having them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>CONNIRAE: So you're having them for her? That's kind of your feeling of it? </P>
<P>JUDY: Uhuh.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. All right. So, kinesthetically, she's going (writing on the flip chart) Other and Self, both. </P>
<P>JUDY: I think the Self comes first; I don't know if that matters.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. This order. Now where do you feel them? Is it exactly in your body, or is there a little dislocation somewhere?</P>
<P>JUDY: (sighing) They're all over the room. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Here's where we get to the "big" part, right?</P>
<P>JUDY: I start being aware of them first in my body. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh, uhuh. </P>
<P>JUDY: And then, of course, I start verbalizing about it, to try to figure out what the hell's going on.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: This is where you talk to her?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Out loud?</P>
<P>JUDY: Mmhm.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: And I become aware that the whole room is filled with these feelings.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Hmm. No wonder they're fairly (big)-- (group laughs) That would do it. OK. Now, I'm going to ask you one other question. Go back up to auditory. You first have that little bit of anger that you feel, right? And then you start talking about it. When you first do that before you open your mouth and say it out loud, is there anything that goes on inside? . . . </P>
<P>JUDY: Maybe.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: How do you know what to say?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, this has been, of course, a process. And it used to be that all this would be going on and I wouldn't say anything to her. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Mmhm. Mmhm. And now you do.</P>
<P>JUDY: And now, my goal is to say it--the sooner the better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. And in that split second before you actually get it out, do you hear it on the inside?</P>
<P>JUDY: No. I don't hear it; I feel it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So you feel the feeling, but you don't translate it into words before they come out of your mouth?</P>
<P>JUDY: Not consciously. I'm not aware of--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Check unconsciously. . . .</P>
<P>JUDY: I'm not positive. I could say, "I'm feeling angry," or something like that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. And if you were to say that right before you said it on the outside, where would you be hearing that from--coming from? Let's check on that location again. The exact location is important.</P>
<P>JUDY: In the middle.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Like right here? (touching Judy gently on her chest)</P>
<P>JUDY: No.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Where? In the middle of--</P>
<P>JUDY: (gesturing toward her forehead0 In the middle of my brain or something.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. In the middle of your brain.</P>
<P>JUDY: I don't know if that's true.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Well, we're all making this all up, so-- (group laughter)</P>
<P>JUDY: But that's what it seems like. It didn't seem like here (gesturing toward her body) that's for sure.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. (to the group) And sometimes that's a good way to get ourselves and others to be aware of this, as we start here and do something for contrast. So that by contrast, I can start, "Nope. That's not it. It's off." And it also clues me in to the fact that while we are on some level making this up, on another level we're not. This (gesturing to her chest) is clearly not a fit, and this (gesturing to her forehead) is. OK, good. So it's up in the head. And the feelings are big and they are Self and Other. Now (to the group) this is actually more aligned than what I usually find with people already. And that's not a statement of how big a difficulty she may or not experience it to be. It's just for your information. So let's go ahead and align this anyway, so that you can observe that, and find out what happens. Then, if we have time and if you guys want to, we'll find somebody who's got even more out of alignment.</P>
<P>JUDY: Is the idea that once it's more aligned this problem will be less of a problem?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Or may not be one. We'll find that out.</P>
<P>JUDY: May not be a problem?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah.</P>
<P>JUDY: I vote for that. (group laughs)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I just want you to keep all your options open.</P>
<P>JUDY: I'll take it. (laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (to the group) What people often tell me after they do this-- One woman said it really nicely, metaphorically. She said, It's like if I want to cook a meal, it's not that it's all made for me, but I get to do it in a clean kitchen now. So that's what tends to happen. So here's what we do. Let's do the visual one first, and we'll find out with each system what happens. I'd like your report back. When you make the adjustments inside, what else changes in your experience as you do it, OK? And I'll be telling you what to do. First thing is this. As you're in that situation, you have had this--your eyes kind of up here (gesturing above Judy's head)--seeing from that point of view. Let them just come down and let them be (Connirae gestures from above Judy's head down to her eyes)--whoosh--right here in your eyes. You may want to close your eyes. Yeah, that's right--so you can do it more completely. Let those eyes in that point of view just--whoosh--right there. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And notice--be aware of-- As that point of view, yeah, clicks into place there, what else shifts in your experience? . . .</P>
<P>JUDY: (softly) I'm breathing better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. (to the group) We can see a real definite breathing shift from that. Did you see that? Are you in a place where you can? OK. Freer breathing and fuller breathing. Anything else that you notice that happens as you have that point-of-view exactly out of your own eyes?</P>
<P>JUDY: It gets a little smaller.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>JUDY: Which is very good. (laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Really? Somehow, we knew that. (laughter) It was good, yeah. (laughs) You notice I wasn't asking, "So, do you like that better or worse?" (chuckles) OK, good. So already you notice that. Now--so we've aligned this one. Now let's go for this one. (auditory)) And again, she's got fairly much alignment here already, in the auditory system. Umm, you know how you were sensing that voice coming from the middle of your head before? I'd like you to find out what happens if you let that move down (Connirae gestures with both her hands from head to chest) so that it's coming out of your own chest and your vocal cords--whoosh--from this area (chest) instead of up here. (head)</P>
<P>JUDY: The one that's saying I'm angry?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. The one that says it to you, where you go, "I'm angry," right before you actually say it out loud. What happens when you hear that--the first time you hear it--coming from here. (chest) So it moves down, just like the eyes kind of slip down, the locus of that voice will kind of--whoosh--drop down also, so that you're also hearing--the very first time there's anything to do with sound, it's from right in here. (chest)</P>
<P>JUDY: It's scary to do that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, and that's not a surprise. Can you tell me a little more about how it is (scary)? Because usually that's how it is that we somehow split our rep. systems--is that something at some point in time, anyway, wasn't quite all right about just having it come fully from ourselves. So it's something that, as that emerges, I want to be really sensitive to, and make sure that we find a way that's comfortable--fully comfortable--to handle that. So--</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, that's really interesting when you said that. What I knew right away was, um--like growing up, for example. I mean anger was this big deal, "You're not supposed to get angry."</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh. Yeah.</P>
<P>JUDY: You're not supposed to have it. So for me to let it come from in here--it's different from--intellectually, I know it's OK to be angry, so I can have it up here. (gesturing to her head)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Right.</P>
<P>JUDY: So I can have it up here. (gesturing to her head again)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Right. (laughter) Aren't our unconscious minds wonderful? We just come up with these great solutions for things. Yeah. So, find out what happens now, as you give permission--because now that you've--you've known all this intellectually. As you let that knowledge move into your body, too, to your whole body. (gesturing to Judy's body)</P>
<P>JUDY: OK, before I can do that, I would like some reassurance that it wouldn't get too big. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh. Good point. Yeah. And I'm glad you brought that up. (to the group) When you do this kind of thing with people, it's really important to do it with a framework of, "I want your objections so that I can honor them, and find a way that's really respectful to deal with them." Because that's--that's essential. And fortunately Judy is forthright with these things. (laughter) Judy, I won't do it if it's tough. I know I can trust her. So that's great. Here's my suggestion. Find out if this takes care of that for you. With everyone I tried this with, when we're done with the whole process, it's much less. And in the event--just for you to know--just in the event that it would be different from any other person for you, what you can do is put it back the way it was. (JUDY: OK.) So this is an experiment. It's all an experiment. You like it better; you do it. You don't like it better; you move it back. (JUDY: OK.) OK. So, you're comfortable just finding out what it's like, now?</P>
<P>JUDY: Umm. Almost.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Almost. Anything else that gets in the way?</P>
<P>JUDY: I don't really think this is likely to happen, but if when I did it, it got so big that I couldn't just put it back, would you help me?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh, yeah. (laughter) You better believe I will. It'll be for my own protection. (laughter) And what we might do is ahead of time, would you just check inside and find out if you have that agreement with yourself, OK? That you're willing to put it back if it's too big.</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh, I am. I know that. (laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: No, I'd like you to check with your inner self that that's OK and that in putting it back, you'll honor it by finding another way to deal with it, that you won't just put it back. (JUDY: Mmhm.) OK. Good. And that it's OK for me to assist in doing that. Just check on that. OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: What I need is to make sure you'll really be there.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. You got it. (JUDY: OK.) I'll be here. And there's another way that would be slightly easier for me to handle this, but you might have a harder time tracking, so I'll tell you about it later. OK. So, and you might notice and be surprised because--I don't know if it would be a surprise for you if you find out that it's actually less. For most people, once something is really honored, and it's OK to have anger, for example, it's sort of like, "Oh! Well then I don't have to fight so hard expressing it. I don't have to make such a big deal out of it because it's OK to just have it be present." And you can find out if it works that way for you to have it just be present in that way.</P>
<P>JUDY: I really don't mean to be difficult.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh, it's good if you are. (laughter) Then they know you're not a shill. (laughter)</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh, OK.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Otherwise, they're going to be wondering. </P>
<P>JUDY: No. I'm trying to think. I'm not quite ready to do this. I can tell. (group laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. All right.</P>
<P>JUDY: I mean, I'd like to. I want to. And so, I'm asking myself, "OK, what do I need for this to--"</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And I think I know what we're going to do then. Do you know already what you need? (JUDY: No.) Then I know what we're going to do next to make this possible in an easy sort of way. (to the group) And that is, rather than continuing to align the Self piece--to me, this is an example of-- Even though the physical dislocation is not that much, it's very profound in terms of her experience, and what will be sorted differently for her when she makes that shift. So, it's going to be important for us align the Observer position first. We're going to do that. And here's how we do that. (She writes on the flip chart.) We've been aligning the Self position and now we're aligning the Observer position. And then, she'll know fully that she has that safe haven to go to, so it's much easier then, to really be in a position that's not fully comfortable, for a moment. OK. So here's what I'd like you to do. (Judy breathes out). Yeah. Take a deep breath. Thank you. Whew. Let that go. (group chuckles) This time what I want you to do, is take the position of Observer, as you naturally do when you think of this situation. (Judy shifts her position on the stool she has been sitting on.) Tell me what you see, first of all. </P>
<P>JUDY: Is this a new Observer position? Or the one where I'm looking from above my head? (gesturing above her head)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: No, not in that one, but when you on purpose take an Observer position right now.</P>
<P>JUDY: I can do that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so what do you see exactly, and where do you see it?</P>
<P>JUDY: I see both of us, sitting there.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Where exactly?</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh, I'm over there (gesturing to her left) and she's over there (gesturing in front of her) and we're facing each other.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Now that's interesting isn't it? She's over here, and the other person is over here. OK. So it's something like this. Visually, it's like, here she is. (drawing on the flip chart) If we're looking top down, she's facing this way. And here is her Self and here is the other person; something like that, right? That may be a little off, but close enough. Now, are you looking at eye level, or are you slightly above or below at these two people?</P>
<P>JUDY: Slightly above.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So slightly above. Great. Now let's check auditory. In the Observer position right now, what do you hear? What do you comment on? Do you have a commenting voice, or anything like that?</P>
<P>JUDY: I'm just paying attention to what they're doing. They--me and her.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. "I'm just paying attention to what they' are doing." So I'm listening for pronouns as I ask this. I want to know what pronouns she's going to use. So she's using "they," which is an Observer position word. "They." If you were to have any internal commentary voice, what would it be like?</P>
<P>JUDY: The voice?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Mmhm. What kind of things would it say? Like as you're just observing "they."</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, it wouldn't be critical or judgmental, or anything.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: What would it be? Give me a few samples.</P>
<P>JUDY: It would be like--I don't know. It's so weird, because I don't think I do this, but--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh. (to the group) So we'll add that in for her--if she wants it--really. This is about enriching and making sure we have all representational systems fully available in each position.</P>
<P>JUDY: So I might say things like Um. (to Connirae) I don't know how to do this. No, I'm saying this to you.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Good. So go ahead.</P>
<P>JUDY: I don't know how to start. Like, "I'm aware of--" or "I notice you are--" or-- I don't know how to start.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: : OK. That's good. "I notice you are--" Who are you saying that to?</P>
<P>JUDY: I guess her--me.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. "I notice you are--" And what position is that word (you) by the way? "You" is a word used by another participant in the interaction, not by an Observer. So that one isn't an Observer kind of voice. </P>
<P>JUDY: It would be "she," wouldn't it?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, exactly. Now if you were to say something in this role or make some comments in this Observer position, where would you be hearing that from--that voice from?</P>
<P>JUDY: Which me?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So now you're the Observer. You're in the Observer position. And you're seeing Judy and the other person. So if you go, "I notice--" or whatever it is that you'd say, where would you hear that voice from?</P>
<P>JUDY: Where would I, the Observer hear it?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Mmhm. The commenting voice.</P>
<P>JUDY: I'd hear it in my head. (Her right hand points to her right temple.)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Where, exactly? Like right in the middle, or like right up here? (gesturing to the top of her head) Right in your jaw? (gesturing to her jaw)</P>
<P>JUDY: No. If I weren't holding this (microphone cord) I'd do it like this. (gesturing with both hands pointing to her temples)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. (writing on the flip chart) So right in there, sort of behind the forehead. OK, good. Great. As an Observer here, watching Judy and the other person, what are you aware of, feeling-wise?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, if I'm observing, I'm not going to have a feeling; she's having the feeling. (Judy chuckles)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: That's a good choice. So she gets to have all the feelings. The other person doesn't and you don't either.</P>
<P>JUDY: Right.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. All right. (writing on the flip chart) So kinesthetically, neutral; pretty neutral. Now let's go back and align this. (to the group) What I started to notice when we started experimenting with this, is that aligning the Observer position--one of the keys to that is usually in the visual system, getting things set up so that we are observing other people from a point of view that's equal distance and eye-level. That makes a tremendous difference. So, let's find out if and what difference it makes here. So as you take these two people--one of them is kind of off to the side. Let them--whoosh--swing over there, so they're both equal distance from you. They can be closer together than you are to them, but each of them is an equal distance from you. We've got an isosoles triangle here, for those of you who like those types of things. If you don't, never mind.</P>
<P>JUDY: That's hard; I'm aware of them.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. And again, this is an indication. When these things are hard, it's an indication that there's something real here. And it is a shift to move it like this. So as you let that just happen--and again, you can put it back if you end up not feeling it's as useful for you. So you can just let that go--whoosh--over there (Judy nods.) until it sort of falls into place right in front of you, equal distance, so that you can notice what's different when you do that.</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, I feel more centered in my body. It's also--I don't know why she stood over here. I don't have any objection to moving it over here.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (to the group) So she says, "I feel more centered in my body." Her body had to go through a few shifts to let them just sit there, didn't it?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So, as they are just there now, are they already at eye-level, or are you still a little bit above them?</P>
<P>JUDY: I'm still a little bit above them. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So notice what happens as you let them--whoosh--be at eye-level.</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah. And I might add, that's much better than telling me to go down. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh, good. Thank you.</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah, that's good. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It's not so much fun to go down to their level.</P>
<P>JUDY: No. (group chuckles) Part of it has to do with me sitting up on this (stool).</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh. OK. So now they're eye level. And what changes in your experience when you do that?</P>
<P>JUDY: It feels better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: How? Going to make you specify.</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, I can breathe more easily, and um--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (to the group) And are you seeing the shifts too, from the outside? Great. Because there are muscle shifts, breathing shifts with each change. And it looks, literally more aligned with each change--more symmetry, more upright posture. OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: Softer. It's gentler.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Her feelings--even though she called her feeling neutral before, they're much more clean--what I'd call clean Observer feelings now, if I compare this one in contrast to the one before. Now let's go for the auditory. And this--since you weren't aware before of a lot of auditory commenting--it's fine to just let that come in, and be an additional part of your experience. And you can notice how it's useful to you, and what the value is--how it is that you want to utilize that. So as you observe this from eye-level and equal distance in front of you, notice what kind of voice now naturally comes to comment.</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, would you be willing to give me an example of something I can say?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. Good, good. (group laughs) I guess. You asked three times, so (group laughs) that's a charm. Now what I might say are things like, "Oh. They are doing this. She's doing that. She's doing that." That kind of thing. So, "She this, that; she that; they that--" You can say, "I see that they are doing that," if you want to. Most Observer voices just go, "She's doing that. She's doing that. He's doing that. They are doing that. When she did that, she did that. When she did that, she did that." </P>
<P>JUDY: OK. Do you want me to say that?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Or, "They aren't getting anywhere here," or "I think that this really isn't moving in the direction that they want," or anything like that.</P>
<P>JUDY: No. See, what I would say is, "She's getting angry and I'm glad she's talking about it out loud. I know from experience that that will work." And then, "She will change her behavior and then it'll get better." </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. All right. And where do you hear that from? Is it still from right here (gesturing to Judy's temples) or has it shifted location?</P>
<P>JUDY: No. It's up there.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Now, let's just experiment. (to the group) With the auditory voice it's not quite as crucial exactly where it comes from in the Observer role. I just check on what fits better for people. Find out what happens when you let that voice move to be coming out of--again as the Observer--out of your voice box. Yeah. Do you like that better?</P>
<P>JUDY: (smiling and nodding) Yeah, it's fuller. It's OK.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Mmhm. Yeah, it is fuller. Another little difference. OK. Good.</P>
<P>JUDY: The one thing I didn't say out loud just before then, I said it to myself, was, (ruefully) "Here we go again."</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. And where did you hear that from?</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh, all over.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: All over your body?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Here "we" go again. Whose voice is that? Whose voice is that? <BR>FRED: One of the participants.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Who does that belong to?</P>
<P>JUDY: Her. (Judy chuckles) </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So that's wonderful that she told me that, so that she can put that where it belongs. </P>
<P>JUDY: It wasn't very conscious.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I know. Was any of this? (laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: These are things that I think-- (to the group) None of us were aware of these. And as we notice them, it can become more fluid by flowing in and back out of our conscious awareness. And I think of consciousness as a way to, as things fluidly flow into consciousness, we have the opportunity to reconfigure them. If they're reconfigured in a way that fits with our being, then we can put it back and let it drop into unconsciousness again, and we don't need to attend to it anymore. So, as this has emerged, and you can thank your unconscious-- Wherever you heard that voice from, like all over here, hear that and feel that and see that move over--whoosh--to her. Because you as the Observer go, "Oh. She's saying, Here we go again.' "</P>
<P>JUDY: Oh. What I started to do as the Observer was, (ruefully) "Oh, here they go again," (chuckles) but that wasn't much better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. So you go, "Here she's saying, Here we go again.' " Yeah.</P>
<P>JUDY: (nodding) Yeah. That's good.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: All right.</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah. It'd be better if she didn't do that. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: You've noticed that. And any time you start feeling intense feelings as an Observer, usually they belong to one of those two people. And what you can do is put it back in the person that they belong to. So just kind of let the feeling go over there, or let the voice go over there, if it belongs to one of those two people. Did you notice any other voices that really belong over there, somewhere? So that you can again notice what it's like to comment on that from the outside. If there are, you can just sense them all kind of going,--whoosh--over there. </P>
<P>JUDY: I can do that really at will with Judy.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. </P>
<P>JUDY: (doubtfully) But with her? I mean, I know that there are feelings that belong to her, but she won't take them. (group laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (laughs) OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: So what do I do with them?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Let me ask you this. Whether she--she won't express them, I think is what you're saying, right? She won't demonstrate; she won't notice them, even. Right? She's going to block them off to that extent. Now, to say she won't take them-- If she really wasn't taking them, they wouldn't be there for you to pick up. Do you know what I mean? They are still her feelings. That's how you've sensed them, whatever aspect of that is hers is really hers, so you can let her have it. (joking) How's she ever going to feel them if you keep stealing them? (group laughter) </P>
<P>JUDY: That's what I said. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: "I keep walking into this office and I feel like my feelings are being stolen." (laughs) Yeah, OK. So you have a sense that they-- It's a different thing to think somebody should be expressing them than to just let her have them at whatever level she's at right now, right? OK. Good. </P>
<P>JUDY: It's like, I don't know if this is true. I think that the way it works now is that I need to feel them before I know what they are; that's how I know what they are.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh, we'll get to that next. You don't need to do that when you're an Observer. Everything in good time. (JUDY: OK.) Now, I'm going to comment to you guys. A lot of what I've been doing as she comes up with objections and "This is scary," and "That, and that, and that," is utilizing verbal patterns. Those of who who've been through the master track with us or with someone who does verbal patterns in theirs, you've probably noticed some of those. I want to be sure you're aware; it's not just a conversation. It's a conversation that's hopefully in the service of what she wants. And if--when she gives me feedback, "No, this isn't what I want yet," then I adjust it; I make it different so that it fits better for her. OK. Now. So what happens when you let any feelings that were still there that really belonged to her go over there? As the Observer, knowing that when you want to, you can step into her too, that's just a different phase. OK. You don't have to, yet; you don't have to ever. So you just let them go--whoosh--out of your body, over there. </P>
<P>JUDY: It's great.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Really. It's a lot easier on the body. Yeah. OK. So now, notice if anything else changes, now that she's got her feelings, and she's got her voices, and they're all over there. Is anything different about how you see that now, than the way it was before? Just check. And now I'm asking for submodality differences, . . . for you to notice if there's a change. </P>
<P>JUDY: When I changed my position, they got below me again. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So let them--whoosh--come back up.</P>
<P>JUDY: This is not a very comfortable seat, which is why--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Do you want to just stand up?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I'll move it away so that you won't think that that's for you.</P>
<P>JUDY: Umm. So I need to raise them up, huh?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Just let them come to their natural place. Right there, eye-level. </P>
<P>JUDY: OK. So differences now from before?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now from before. When we first put you in Observer position. Do you notice any?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: What?</P>
<P>JUDY: It's brighter. It's bigger. I know I'm using the same word as before, but it's different.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (overlapping) It's different, isn't it? We can see it's very different. (group laughs) The picture is bigger now.</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And that can be a more useful thing to have bigger, so that you can see more--</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: --and get more data, right? Is there any difference in clarity?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, it's brighter. I mean, it was clear before.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. OK. (to the group) For some people, it goes from fuzzy to clear when we do that, so I wanted to check. Hers was already clear. Now it's brighter, and so on.</P>
<P>JUDY: Brighter and bigger and--I mean, the big thing seems brighter--the most important thing seems brighter. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. OK. (to the group) So guess what submodality is important for her? (laughter) We get these subtle cues. All right. (reviewing the flip chart) So we've got the visual; we've got the auditory from here as the Observer person voice. "They-- She this-- She that. Oh, she's saying this to herself. Oh, I think she's feeling that. Oh, I observed this." OK. Good. (to Judy) And now, let's just check, and double check, that your feelings right now are neutral or some kind of Observer feelings. Check for that. Is there anything there that you notice that still belongs to one of those two people that you can let--whoosh--go over to them? (Judy shakes her head) OK. And it looks clean now. OK. So now that we have the Observer position aligned, what I'd like you to do is close your eyes for a moment, so that you can both consciously--and more important, unconsciously--let yourself memorize that. Let that be a part of what's an option automatically, and a choice for you, when it's the right thing for you. And you'll know more about that by experimenting and trying it out and utilizing it in different situations, and noticing how it works for you, how it is--what it's like to have those two others just there at eye-level, equal distance from you, brighter and bigger and with that commenting voice that you can utilize to describe. OK, great. Great. So now that you have that memorized in you, what I'd like you to do now--now we'll find out how much easier it is to be in Self. Because now you know that you can always come--any time you need to, you have this position to come to. (Judy nods) It's a position of true neutrality and resourcefulness. <BR>OK. So now what you can do if you're ready, is to let this now shift--whoosh--so that you're now back into Self position, looking at the other person. OK? . . . Yeah. That's right. So you can see the other person, right? (<BR>JUDY: Mmhm.) And check that you already have it right out of your own eyes or do you need to let yourself drop down again? Let yourself do that. OK, so that it's right out of your eyes. Good. And when it feels like it's sort of locked in there, in your own eyes, then you can turn your attention to the sound. Check and let that-- Now that you know within you that you always have that Observer place to pop out to when you want to--even for a split second, or for longer. Find out what it's like now to let that voice drop down into your body, that goes, "I am angry." And you may also have a sense of more permission or welcoming or accepting that, "Yeah. That's fine. And it's OK that you know, that I was judgmental about it in the past and all that. That's OK too. And right now, it's OK for me to just have that be here." OK, good. Tell me what that's like now, when you let that drop into your being.</P>
<P>JUDY: To feel that, "I'm angry," coming from here?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Mmhm.</P>
<P>JUDY: (neutrally) It seems OK.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Yeah. "What's new," right? (laughter)</P>
<P>JUDY: Doesn't seem like a big deal.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: No big deal.</P>
<P>JUDY: That's kind of strange, but--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, isn't it? Do you see the contrast between this after we align the Observer and before? Now it's no big deal after and before. Now it's no big deal. It's just, "Yeah, OK." Great. Now let's check from in your Self position here--from your Self with looking out of your own eyes and hearing from your own body, check for--are there still any lingering feelings that belong to the Other or do you now have your own, only? Do you notice anything else besides your own feelings there?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, . . . I'm not sure.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: Because I'm not sure which are mine, and which are hers.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (overlapping) Which are yours and which are hers sometimes? OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: I mean, I have some anger, irritation, whatever, toward her because of how she's being. She has anger, or should have, or does--I mean, we know she does toward the perpetrator.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: She ought to be angry.</P>
<P>JUDY: I don't know. I think the reason my anger--I think, I'm not even sure. The reason my anger is so big is because I have hers too. If she had some and owned it, then I think mine would be less. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Let me find out if this is helpful or useful in any way for you. As you check, you know that you're angry, and you can feel that "I'm angry about this." Now, is it OK for you--because that part of it is yours and you can have that part and that's your business. Is it all right for you to allow her to have hers, or not have it as she's ready for that, and as she's, you know (JUDY: Mmhm.) OK. And for her to have--blocking her feelings for a while, if that's what's right for her right now to be blocking them. Because then you know that's right for her and it wouldn't be-- And what I'd like to invite you to do, too, is as you turn inward and just sense what are your feelings. And you're not clear always on, "Are they mine or are they hers?" And that's something that is very difficult for a conscious mind to sort out in a definitive kind of way. So what might be easier is to just invite your unconscious being--all of the rest of you--to sort that out to the best of your ability right now at this moment in time. To make that distinction between what is hers, or actually it's hers as your guessing it to be. So to let your unconscious sort between that and what is really yours. And when that sort is made, to allow everything that your unconscious determines belongs over there to her, to let that flow right out of your being--whoosh--over to her, so that it's out there. And there's no need to understand exactly what went over there to appreciate the difference when--after that's happened.</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah, I can feel a difference.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So what difference do you feel?</P>
<P>JUDY: It feels better. It's a relief. Whew.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Really. OK. So did anything change in the image when you did that?</P>
<P>JUDY: I wasn't looking.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Check. Go back and look now; how you see it now. </P>
<P>JUDY: I can see her now.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. What happens?</P>
<P>JUDY: Well I saw me, but I'm not supposed to.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Well, that's OK. So you went into your Observer position.</P>
<P>JUDY: I went to the Observer. I didn't realize it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Right. Yeah. And that's all right because we want you to end up being fluidly able to do that--to move back and forth between the different positions.</P>
<P>JUDY: But I would go back.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Sure. So now just slip back into you. Notice if anything changes in how you see. (to the group) After those are aligned, it's much easier to cleanly become the other and to get information that has a much greater probability of being accurate rather than contaminated by who we are, and what we think, and what we believe, and all this kind of stuff. Because when our rep. systems are all over the place, we're likely to get a few of ours in their body when we try to step into them. </P>
<P>(to Judy) So, if you're willing and interested to find out what happens-- (JUDY: Yeah.) OK. What I'd like you to do, is out of the Self position, first let things shift so you're in Observer position. And now, she can move if she wants to, to do this, or just move her internal pictures; either way is fine. </P>
<P>JUDY: I need to move. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, you move. So move over to the Observer position first. OK. </P>
<P>JUDY: Oh, Observer? I can do that in my mind.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. All right. So now, the other two are over there. Just notice again that it's equal distance, and all that kind of--those Observer qualities that you have in your being. And now, whenever you're ready, let yourself go into her, with a frame that "This is for information; this is for data."</P>
<P>JUDY: I couldn't have done that before; I can do that now.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. It does get a lot easier. And if any of you were in my morning workshop yesterday, some people were asking, how can they make it easier to get into the other person and get back? And this is one important answer. That when we're clean in Self and clean in Observer, it makes the ability to step in someone else's shoes immediately better. OK.</P>
<P>JUDY: So I'm here. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. In the Other? What do you notice? Particularly, check for anything new--any difference--</P>
<P>JUDY: It's real scary.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Uhuh. And you can step back out when you want to. You don't need to stay there very long to get a sense of it. And now you can just look at it from the outside, right? Good. Now, after having stepped into the Other person, does anything change in what you see?</P>
<P>JUDY: I'm not aware of anything.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. And I like to take the time to check. Sometimes it shifts and somehow the picture has a lot more detail or there are Other codings on it that have the data in it that the person got.</P>
<P>JUDY: It feels different; I mean-- </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: How? (to the group) Guess which rep system is most in consciousness here? (group chuckle)</P>
<P>JUDY: Well, I feel more compassion--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Great. </P>
<P>JUDY: --in the moment. I mean, usually I do. It's just that sometimes--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Well, I think compassion is-- (laughter) And I know you do. For me, compassion is one of those things. I can never have too much of it. It's like, I can always add, and then be that much more of who I want to be. So, OK. And now, what you can do is slip back into Self so that you can end there. And usually, that's where you want to end up. To make sure that a person can end up being me in my own body, speaking with my own voice about me and what I observe and want and so on. OK? All right.</P>
<P>JUDY: There's a little thing missing for me.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: What's that?</P>
<P>JUDY: That is-- (clears throat) So now, you know future pacing in my mind, I'm thinking about--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (overlapping) Yeah. And that is a piece missing.</P>
<P>JUDY: And I don't know how I want to do it differently. I mean, I know how I--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: How you want to act differently?</P>
<P>JUDY: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. What we might do here-- What I'd like for you to do now and to invite your unconscious.--I was going to just tell you, but (to the group) it's better if I really let her do it here, is to--taking the knowledge in you that you have these three perceptual positions in a clean way and especially the Self position cleanly available to you, and you have that in conscious memory of how to be that, and you have that unconscious memory of how to be in the Observer position, and you know that it's easy to move back and forth when each is clean, and that when appropriate, you can also be the Other and get data there, and moving back into Observer, and moving back into Self. That's the knowledge and the wisdom that I'd like you to take in your body with you as you sense yourself moving into the future, and knowing that you'll be with her in a particular time and place--knowing that you have this ability there with you. OK. And you can just notice now how that begins to unfold differently. So it's not so much planning it all out, as just noticing how it begins to unfold differently. </P>
<P>JUDY: I got it right away. (smiling)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. I can see that. (laughter)</P>
<P>JUDY: It was good. (nodding)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Great. Great. So thanks for getting me to do that here, officially.</P>
<P>JUDY: Thank you for doing it. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. You're welcome.</P>
<P>JUDY: That little piece made all the difference. I mean, it all made all the difference.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. It was all necessary for the whole thing to be complete. Good. Thank you. </P>
<P>JUDY: And the other thing that was really--I don't know if you all heard it, but the other thing that really helped me a lot was when you would go, "whoosh."</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh yeah. (group chuckle)</P>
<P>JUDY: I'll be telling them about that. (laughter)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: You get to make the weirdest sounds that your mother always told you not to make at the dinner table when you do this kind of thing. And it's all right. People will even like it. </P>
<P>(Brief Break)</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: A number of people have been asking me during the break, "Do you align the Observer? Why didn't you align the Observer excuse me, the Other role, the Other position?" And I'd like to comment on that. The point of aligning Self and Observer--is so that I can-- One of the points of aligning Self and Observer is so that I can cleanly go into the Other without taking a mess along with me, so that I can do it. Now the Other person is not aligned, necessarily. And who knows what their experience is? So my point--what I want to do when I'm being the Other, is just get as much as I'm capable of. As clean as my sensory apparatus allows me to be at this moment in time, given who I am right now, I want to--as cleanly as possible--pick up them, who they are to whatever degree that's aligned or misaligned, or whatever else it is. So I'm not going to purposely go in there and mess with it. I'm just going to find out about what it is. Does that make sense? <BR>Then, I'm going to pop out with more information and data in both Observer and Self role and how I can interact effectively, given what I've just learned. OK. So, any other questions? Just general questions. I will go through the overall steps with you. Yeah, Linda.<BR>LINDA: Wondering why you didn't keep her in the Other position longer in order for her to be able to observe more?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Umm, well-- Did you hear the question? "Why didn't you keep her in Other position longer?" Several reasons. One is time. You know? It might be useful to actually do that. The other is I don't like to keep people in that position too long, especially the first time that I'm inviting them to do it in this way. I like to develop more of a sense of fluidly being able to go in and out, and make sure the person has that physical knowledge that, "Oh yeah. I can easily go in and out." So I'm more likely to have them come out fairly quickly, so that they have that experience that "I can do that." Now, they can always go in and get more data later on. Now--a couple questions here. Yeah? <BR>GUS: Normally people talk about three modes: the visual, the auditory, the kinesthetic, but the fourth mode, the intellectual mode gets dropped off an awful lot of the time. I'm wondering, if the intellectual mode is the person being stuck in Observer mode, dissociated mode, for the most part, and whether you've worked at all with this?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. And that's something that we would get more into--we do that more in our practitioner training. Usually what people call "intellectual mode"--you have to find out for them what it is. For many people, it is as you're saying, being in mostly an Observer role and watching from the outside. For other people, it's any combination--it tends to be visual and auditory and not much kinesthetic. So when people use words like "intellectual," it's a combination of other--other--what I consider cleaner descriptions. Because if I say, "intellectual," you might not know what I mean by my intellectual mode. OK. What else. Somebody else had one. Yeah.<BR>STAN: How much contextual variation do you find? If someone has a problem in one area, is it pretty much the same in others?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Oh, interesting question. Going across context. I found that for me, my configuration was pretty similar across context. Now that was really interesting to me, because then, that meant, again, OK, for me to move--this is going to make a good shift across context. And I've noticed for a number of other people, it's been that way, also--that we tend to get a certain style and way of being misaligned, that we tend to do across context. What I found out for myself is that I was--and this is partly what led me to explore this, I was looking-- Let's see if I can get this straight how it was. Oh. I was seeing myself over here. So visually, I was disassociated. But it wasn't the clean one where I was clear out here. I was sort of over next to myself, and I still had my own feelings. So there was that kind of contamination. And you'll tend to find this, that if people go into--visually--an Observer position, but they're closer to one person or the other, usually they'll have one rep. system that belongs to that other person (that they are closer to). Usually, it's feelings, but not always. So--and I was wondering why VK Disassociation never worked for me, you know. I go, "Well I can see myself really well, but I still have the feelings." And it's because I didn't have a way of getting my feelings disassociated cleanly. Yeah?</P>

<P>MAN 3: What was your mystery noise that seemed to make all the difference? </P>

<P>CONNIRAE: (chuckles) The mystery noise. Yes. Known as anchoring. Sound. Auditory anchors are very helpful in engaging our unconscious processes in doing this. Language patterns are also very useful. And some of you, I'm sure, were tracking those as I was going along. You don't have to use that. It will work for many people without those things. So if as you do this, you aren't sure what to do, just do it regularly. That's fine. But if you're comfortable with adding those things in, please do. </P>

<P>MAN4: Do you do that when you want someone to experience a state, or--</P>

<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Well, try this out for yourself. Take a feeling that you mildly don't particularly like. Let it be somewhere in your body for a moment. And then--I'm not in a good location for you to do this really well, but-- Then, as it's there, envision the spot out in front of you where it's going to go to in a moment. OK? Whenever you're ready. And then, just let it (swoosh) slide over there. So, see the real answer is feeling what it does in your own system, and how it works. Swoosh. It sounds like things that would just be almost vacuumed, sucking something over, you know? So it just engages something that our brains recognize as, "Oh, a change is happening now. It's moving now." Engage it and allow it to happen. It's just making it easier. As I do that, what my experience is, you know--I see it, and I hear it, and I feel it moving, too. And that helps me make a sound that's going to be appropriate. So it's going to be more engaging. And I always set the stage first. You see, if I just do that sound to begin with, they'll be going, "What is she doing over there, making gross noises?" (laughter) But if I've created the frame of, "In a moment that feeling's going to go over there." And then we do, so that it--swoosh--slides. So they know what's coming and what to do. Their unconscious is informed. <BR>The first position I align is usually the one that people are almost all in already. So when someone is almost all in the Observer position, that is a clue. They would be freaked out if you tried to align them in Self first. You know? So you align the Observer first and get that fully done. And then after you've done that, then you do the Self. If the Self is almost aligned, do that one first and then do Observer. That's what's seeming to work well so far. And then, if as happened for me, you're aligning Self and the person goes, "Uhh?" That's a clue. (laughter) Do the Observer one first. And then--you saw that big change, what happened after that. OK. Yeah?<BR>JO: Often times when I've done this, I have found what sometimes makes what seemingly is a small variation in eye level has a tremendous effect.</P>

<P>CONNIRAE: Yes. Jo was at NANLP when I did this same presentation. And in the visual system, I would like to go over the clues with you and then let you go ahead and have some experience. The eye-level being exactly equal--exactly--is what's going to create a really effective Observer role. And the equal distance piece is extremely important. And the looking exactly out of your own eyes. And I believe all of those are on here under visual. So that if it's not quite out of your own eyes, it can get right out of your own eyes. So that's aligning the Self position, right? Oh no, wait a second. We were--I did some of each. Sorry about that. For the Observer, it's the equal distance and eye-level. For the Self, it's exactly out of my own eyes. Exactly. Any questions about aligning at the visual level?<BR>OK. So, let's go through the rest of--actually, let's do Observer. I'm going to go through the rest of Observer. That is, in addition to visually seeing equal distance, same level, listen to pronouns. If they say, "I" or "You," those are not Observer position pronouns. Observer position pronouns are going to be "he," "she," and "they." "I" is a first position and "You," is in Other position. Self position and Other position. Yeah? (A clarification: If a "you" in a sentence is the subject, as in "You should " that is an Other position voice. But if the "you" in a sentence is the object, as in "I don't like what you did." Then it is a Self position voice.)<BR>BETTY: What was the part you were talking about both visual and auditory in terms of where you saw it, and you heard it, and getting that aligned?</P>

<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So now we're into the auditory part. If we're aligning the Observer role auditorily, we want to be hearing, "he," "she," and "they." We want to be hearing it, probably from out of some location right here, in me. It might be out of me as Observer out of my vocal cords. It might be--some people have ended up having the voice actually kind of coming from out here. (gesturing all around her) And that's worked fine for them. And I always have them try it out coming from within them as Observer, but to choose which one works best for them. Then--so that's the auditory piece. Any questions about the auditory piece on aligning Observer? OK. Then the kinesthetics. That's where you go, "Check your feelings." Because you want all three rep. systems to be in Observer. Do any of those feelings belong to one of these two people over here? Or are they already clean Observer feelings? And any feelings that really belong in one of those locations, you use your auditory anchors--and visual--and go swoosh. "You can just let them--swoosh--slide over here--or over there."<BR>SALLY: In the auditory system, when you're the Observer, would you be talking about the situation, or would you be bringing the sound over?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Generally, the Observer is-- No, as an Observer, you're not interacting with them. You are describing and you're going, "Um, she's doing that. He's doing that. And when she does this, he does that. And they are doing this."<BR>SALLY: And that's OK?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yes, yeah. 
<p>SALLY: And what feelings are in Observer position?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Observer feelings tend to have some kind of "neutral" quality to them. They're not flat neutral, though like Judy's were to begin with. They have some kind of vitality to them. And they might be described as being sort of like, sort of present/resourceful, but not really engaged or intensely emotional. Any questions about aligning the Observer?

<BR>OK. We'll do aligning the Self then. To align the Self, get the eyes exactly out of the own eyes. The voice, usually that's coming from my own vocal cords and out of my own mouth. If I hear it coming out of there, that's a Self-position voice. And hearing exactly with my own ears. This guy who had the eyes going like this, around in circles, he was hearing in the same way. (group laughs). He was dancing around his ears. That's more unusual. I haven't found that very often. In terms of pronouns, it's going to be "I." And this one to really check for. With a number of people, I've had where they've said, "Well, I aligned it, but it's not resourceful yet. Then, I've checked and frequently I've found that the voice is still a "you" voice or is something else. It's not an "I" voice yet, and maybe not quite inside the person's body. And that the feelings are the feelings of "self." 

<BR>In a phone conversation several months after this session, Judy said she noticed a definite difference with this client. In particular, she said she was more tuned in with her client's fear, which she felt was much more useful than the frustration she had been experiencing.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The DVD from which this transcript was made, "Aligning Perceptual Positions," is available from NLP Comprehensive: <A href="http://www.nlpco.com">http://www.nlpco.com</a></P>

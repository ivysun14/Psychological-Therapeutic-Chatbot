<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Looks like a nice day out, is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you have class today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What'd you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ceramics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's you making?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Teapot, a teapot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How far along are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not very.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not into the kiln yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not yet.  We just finished [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What else have you done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We made two, um, large, just like [INAUDIBLE] and then we had to make 10, um, fertility [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think parents want you making those.  What did Mom say?  The whole class had to make one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In ceramics.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what are you grades so far, you're pretty much Bs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bs, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In ceramics too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, we haven't gotten those back yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yes.  As long as you can explain yourself, you'll get a good grade in the art department.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just means as long as you can BS your, your reason for doing whatever you did, as long as you have a good reason why you did it, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  I just had to get up the nerve to talk [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They make you do that, because they buy it.  How much of it is not BS?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it all, I think it's all BS.  I do.  I mean if you look at some of the stuff you're just like really, because like we have art pieces all over our campus—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some of them are just like, I don't know, really, they put that on campus.  That's horrible.  Why would you do that?  That makes us look bad, but apparently they had a good reason behind it.  Somebody thought it was good, but I don't like to make anything ugly, like that bothers me to make something ugly even if I have a good reason for it.  So I just had to make something pretty and girly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that how you see yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Girly?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Most, yeah.  I'm pretty girly.  I'm tough too though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not like manly or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's girly maybe, a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that how you would want to be seen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about the tough part?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like them to know that too.  I think most people, they should [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's hard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been sleeping a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Too much.  A lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like going to bed early or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like before midnight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't last night.  I don't think I went to bed until 6:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Six thirty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum in the morning, this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  What'd you do all night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I did some homework, uh, and then I went and saw one of my friends and then I went and saw another one of my friends at school, like she works the desk in one of the dorms, you know, like security type [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I sat with her and we talked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't really tired.  And it's nice to have like friends [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the middle of the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What time did you have to be up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eight thirty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's when your class was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My class was at 9:00, [INAUDIBLE] a fast jog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You made it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh, I didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I missed it, but he wasn't there today, which he should have never told us.  I don't know why he would tell us he was not going to be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you weren't planning on being there anyway?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was.  I set my alarm.  I set my alarm and then I shut it off and I accidentally went back to sleep, which was my fault, but that's the only reason why I've missed class recently is that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you don't go to bed till 6:30, that's pretty tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that's the second time I've done that.  I don't do that all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But ordinarily you're asleep by?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm usually always asleep by 2:00, if not before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and get up at 8:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or 7:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or 7:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do you do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  And I take naps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You must take a bunch of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you just said a minute ago, you were sleeping like a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's 2 hours or 3 hours, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're sleeping at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I sleep a lot.  Mostly on the weekends like I'll sleep all day.  Friday.  Like I [INAUDIBLE] because I don't have class on Fridays, so I sleep all day Friday because I go out on Thursday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're up all night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On Thursday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Friday night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Friday night, I went out this Friday.  I go out a lot, which is bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you drink too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wednesday I drink too much.  Wednesdays and Friday I drink too much.  Then I get, um, but I made my Thursday class at 8:00 in the morning.  I was pretty grouchy though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you just stayed up all night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I actually did go to sleep.  I went to sleep for a little while.  Um, but I made it, but I didn't pay attention.  And I took a shower before I went.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know how you get Bs with this schedule.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, because I am really smart.  I know what I'm doing, but, but I usually don't go out that often.  I usually only go out on Thursdays [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do know what you're doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I know what I'm doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that mean you're in control?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm in control maybe.  What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like how?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You say you're going to do something and you do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have a plan.  You stick to it.  You follow through.  You can count on yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not always.  Just with this one class.  Normally I [INAUDIBLE] I usually stick with the plans.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My life.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You say you're going to be somewhere.  You're going to do something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You got to be, uh, pretty consistent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Become more assertive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you, with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Like I, um, I designed our tee shirts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was talking to you about it, that I like print them.  I think it's something that I wouldn't like and I was like let's do this.  No, I don't like that.  Let's do this, and I made him change it, and I usually wouldn't have done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't want to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He didn't want to change it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, but he did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More work for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was really easy stuff though.  It wasn't like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he didn't complain too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if he would of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would have been like, I don't know.  I would have been like okay, never mind.  [INAUDIBLE] didn't mean to, but I was pretty proud of myself that day because he did it one way and I was just like no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is good.  You ought to be proud of yourself.  Of course, the next step is they're going to disagree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or you compromise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  We compromised on some of it, and they turned out really nice and everybody liked them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I think everybody.  I liked them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess in situations like that you have to reach some kind of conclusion because something needs done.  Other times your assertiveness is going come up where you'll need to assert yourself by expressing yourself and nothing needs to be resolved, nothing has to be decided, but it's more a matter of your self expression, for instance, like, um, you know, somebody upsets you.  You can say I'm pretty angry when you do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I feel, um, anger or sad or whatever it is, and that's a situation that they can disagree with you on or they can agree with on.  It doesn't matter.  The point is is that you assert yourself and express your feelings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In some ways that can be easier and some ways harder in reaching compromises or not wanting things a certain way or partly more, more often than not it's harder because it's about your feelings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, but you'll probably have opportunity to do that than you will other because people are going to do things that you're not going to like on a regular basis.  And be able to say, oh excuse me.  Let me, I just need to say something that hurts here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if you say nothing, it's assuming that you agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  So why am I sleeping so much?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you don't sleep at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, but when I do, like when I do sleep at night, I still—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't get 8 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not on a regular basis.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what you have to look.  You have to get a regular pattern.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But they're not like hour naps.  They're like 4 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or all day.  [INAUDIBLE] like when I get home, I go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Unless I have something to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You always have things to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I could do my work, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who does that?  Um, but I do [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The last minute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any projects, uh, outstanding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you're behind on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Residential [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it hard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's going to take you some time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're going to get started when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Today [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's due when?  I know not tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, not tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this was assigned when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But I'm sure you'll do fine at it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I will.  I did it [INAUDIBLE] overwhelmed, so I just stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I have so much to do [INAUDIBLE].  I just get overwhelmed.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But then I do [INAUDIBLE] but I'm trying not to do that on the next one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often do you say that to yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've done it and you're not going to do it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I changed my major.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What to what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Art history with a minor in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you like art history?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, it's interesting, and I'll be done with my minor after this semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'd be nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And be able to graduate some day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I will.  I'm only a year behind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I'd have a year of summer school or summer sessions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you'd graduate when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two thousand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ten.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ten?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  And that's okay because, um, [INAUDIBLE] working 4 years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] as a sophomore, I'll get one more year.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You doing much with them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  We had a [INAUDIBLE] retreat this weekend at the lake, but I didn't go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I was supposed to work on my project.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which you didn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't appear happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I am, just that project [INAUDIBLE].  That's really the only thing.  Like once I get that done, then I'll be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Until.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'll be fine after that because then I'll be able to start on the next one and not get behind and I'll feel better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For how long?  It does seem to help, but then it doesn't stick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  [INAUDIBLE], but everything else is going fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And by that you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My other classes are good.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You seem to doing well in school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really any big problems.  Sorority is going good.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're just stupid, but other than that, it's good.  Really the only thing I can complain about except that one class, and it's my fault [INAUDIBLE].  So I can't complain.  Happier that I changed my major because I was very unhappy before I did that, but once I did that I was better.  I got to drop one of the classes, so that was good.  So that's it.  Everything else is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You keep saying that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have not said one thing about your guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really don't know how I feel about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something else happen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not really.  He wants to go to a bar[INAUDIBLE].  We'll see if that happens.  He usually backs out.  We'll see.  So we're just having a good time.  [INAUDIBLE].  I mean I like [INAUDIBLE] but I don't think I could handle anything serious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't need to focus on something like that.  I need to focus on school [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just get kind of sad [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get kind of sad still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In general.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Not as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't cry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I mean I just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't cry as much you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have to have something to cry about to cry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  That's a good thing that I don't, I mean I cried, but like once or twice, maybe twice.  I mean it's not that I couldn't cry, but crying all the time is bad, but I'm not doing that, so that's good, but I mean like I said, I just don't have anything to be sad about right now.  Well I do, but I just don't think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't think about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's the number one thing you don't think about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just family that's all, but, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't talk much about family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't really want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would guess that's why.  You ain't going to do anything you don't want to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really don't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you don't want to, you're not going to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Be assertive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I don't know about that being assertive.  I think that's more being [INAUDIBLE], don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well see, it sounded better as assertive, not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Interesting that you brought it up though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually when people bring things up, it's something that they want to deal with.  It is something that it would be nice to have dealt with it, not to have to deal with it.  Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like if you're already to the point of having it behind you, put it.  And if it was behind you, you have to dealt it.  It is behind you.  What difference would that make for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wouldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I mean if I don't think about it ever, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that's your big issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it doesn't bother me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, but it's the number one issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, if I was to think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you were think about that, but you don't think about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have that effect.  What else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What else about it?  Your relationship with your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yes.  Yeah.  And I don't call as much because I don't feel like talking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because every time you call—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They want to talk, and I don't want to.  I want to go okay, how you doing?  I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep it light.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I'll talk to you later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't let them know much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I'd rather not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because if they knew.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then they would probably worry and my Mom always, she worries now because she knows I sleep too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She knows you what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I sleep too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's worried about this ADD thing, but that's all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] pretty positive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how much of this comes back to you not wanting to disappoint your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Most of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're feeling like you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little.  A little bit.  [INAUDIBLE] so I shouldn't worry about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't agree?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not entirely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your tiredness came come from a lot of different things.  One thing it can come, come from is worry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can worry yourself into exhaustion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What else?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What else can cause you to sleep too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think it's your medicine, do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.  I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it's most likely a depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can be part of the boredom.  You can say you don't have other things to do.  It's probably more you don't have other things you want to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And sleeping serves purposes, especially sleeping in the day and staying awake at night, you're avoiding most people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's more to this family thing than just your worry that you're disappointing, isn't there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.  I really don't know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I heard.  What would happen if you did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.  I just don't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you be sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you be angry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Not angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] whatever it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who knows this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who knows what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever it is you don't want to talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nobody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nobody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not even one person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A person that was involved in this somehow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if we talk about it, you're afraid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually I'll be sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of being sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  So let's not.  See, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you don't have to.  All you got to do is think about it.  Well, I'm sorry whatever it is that's troubling you so.  I wish I could help you.  And it takes a lot of energy to keep it buried.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too bad you didn't have somebody that you could talk to that keeps things confidential.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I guess I could, but I just don't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Because when you talk to me, it's no different than talking to yourself.  It doesn't go any further.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there anything else you want to talk about?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  Sorry you're so upset.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's fine.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, if you ever want to talk about it, we can.  Are you taking your medicine regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That make any difference?  You ever take any other stimulants before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Adderall or Ritalin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  You could try something.  Make sure it doesn't make you irritable or more irritable.  [INAUDIBLE] help you feel more patient, calm, focused.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you have to work with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] lifestyle habits, you know, sleeping when you should, just in general.  You know what you need to do, just taking care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something that, uh, you're certainly capable of, but struggle with.  You tend to be pretty hard on yourself.  I mean, you know, I don't how you do it, but you're doing good in school [INAUDIBLE] this other stuff, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, I'm not, I mean [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are though.  You might not think it's good enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the problem [INAUDIBLE] really bothered me though [INAUDIBLE].  Well I mean [INAUDIBLE] bothers me.  Otherwise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean what have you done, uh, to have been successful at that's, and something you could say yep, I'm pretty proud of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You really have to think, don't you?  Your mother wouldn't have to think that hard.  What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's happy with anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's happy with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not because her expectations are so [INAUDIBLE].  She doesn't think you can do better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Get your, uh, Lamictal prescription filled?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to this week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get them.  You're not forgetting it, are you?</p>

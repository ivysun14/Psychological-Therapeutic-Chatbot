<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I wanted to read you this text message that my mom sent me. She sent it on Monday and it just, I sent it to my best friend and I forwarded it to my boyfriend and they were both like really. So, I just wanted to read it to you so it maybe it gives you a little better perspective of what my mom is like. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>So, she says good luck on Friday and I hope all works out for both of you. When you want to talk about things, I will be here. I will not talk to you though until you apologize for talking to me that way. I am and always will be your mother no matter how old you are and respect is what you need to give me. Like I said, I really hope you two work out your lives and you get back on track. </p>

<p>So, you know, she sent that to me and I'm like I don't, I didn't respond to her. I didn't say anything to her and I think I was I just more annoyed by it and just angry that she, I don't know, continues to act the way that she does. I guess I'm not quite as surprised as maybe I normally would be because I'm fairly used to her doing that and that's exactly. She will write me these long very passive aggressive text messages all the time and I guess when I got it I really didn't even get angry about it. I'm just like okay. Here you go. Here's another thing. [00:02:30]</p>

<p>I am not going to apologize to her. I can't keep being the one that always has to apologize for something that I don't necessarily do and she's choosing to I'm not talking to you until you apologize to me. So, it's like alright, well, you know, if I don't apologize to her, she'll never, she won't talk to me because she thinks she's right and she's always right. She's never wrong and now I'm kind of at this point where I don't want to apologize to her. I am just tired of apologizing to her. I'm tired of every time something happens like when she kicked me out of my own house I had to apologize just to have a relationship with her again. I don't know. I don't want to say that I don't care, but I'm just so tired of it. I'm just so tired of why do I always have to apologize and she never, ever takes responsibility for anything and it's just kind of at the point where like do I just not talk to her and see what happens or, you know, maybe eventually talk to her, but right now I have no desire to. [00:04:00]</p>

<p>I guess I don't really have to. I mean there's nothing saying that I have to talk to her and, sadly, I just have so much going on I'm not really missing conversation with her. I'm not really missing the extra drama and the other stuff that comes along with it. So, I am actually sort of okay not talking to her and I think that alone kind of makes me angry and kind of frustrates me and upsets me that I'm just okay with not talking to her because she causes so much drama that it's just not worth it to me and I don't want it to be that way, but I feel like she's never going to really take responsibility for her own actions no matter what. She seems okay not talking to me. I mean she went, after she kicked me out it was a year and half before she talked to me again and it was only because I apologized to her, so apparently she's not overly distraught about it or if she is, she doesn't say anything. [00:05:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A year and a half?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. I didn't realize it was that long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, she kicked me out in January and then maybe it was longer than that. I moved back in and I only lived there for maybe a month and then she didn't really start talking to me again until I moved here, so maybe. Yeah, I guess it was about a year and a half. So, maybe it was two years or two and a half years? So, she doesn't seem like she has such an issue with it and she just does, you know, and I guess she acts upset and then she talks about me behind my back and continues to do that. I can only imagine what she's saying now. [00:06:25]</p>

<p>I don't know. I'm just so, I think I'm just so over it and so done with having to deal with her being that way and getting these text messages and everything and I don't really even know what to say to her. I still am just at a loss and right now just I don't want to say anything to her. Even if I replied to that, it would just, it just sort of like adds fuel to the fire no matter what I say. Even if I said, you know, like, I am sorry that you feel that way and was extremely nice about it she would still then continue to send me paragraphs of text messages and everything like that, but she'll never say anything to me on the phone. I mean there have been times when we've talked on the phone and she's had an issue and she just sort of, you can tell. She hangs up and she sends me this long text message because she just doesn't even want to say it on the phone, but she has to be however about it and write me this long text message which bothers me too. [00:07:40]</p>

<p>I mean why can't she just say while she's on the phone what is bothering her. Instead she has to wait until she hangs up, write out the long message, give it a good minute or so and she has to send me the message. It's just really getting old and I don't need all the extra stuff, especially right now given that court is tomorrow, and I have enough anxiety about that and what is going to happen. So, right now I think it's just probably better if I don't say anything to her. If I want to say something to her at another point in time then I will, but I have no desire nor do I sort of actually feel bad.</p>

<p>So. Yeah, that's kind of where I am at with her. It's just always one thing after another. I think sometimes she sends me those messages just to provoke me in to conversation and then if I respond and I know that's what she wants, but then if I don't, you know, she'll just every once in a while send me something else. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>I just don't understand why she does that and why she thinks that's an okay way to get her feelings across and how she doesn't realize that's just, it's just hurting me and it's hurting our relationship and it's just not an appropriate way to I guess to address situations and yet she continues to do it even when I tell her, you know, it's not okay. You can't talk to me that way. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you looking for from your boyfriend and your friend in showing them the text message?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, I guess was kind of. I don't know if I was really looking for them to really say anything. It was more so just, you know, like and yet again, just another showing because, you know, they both sort of understand how my mom is I'm like, you know, and now it's just sort of like yet again here my mom goes with her text messaging and all of her other things that she says and, you know, of course they were like just she's why? You know. It just makes my boyfriend angry. [00:10:30]</p>

<p>He's like I don't understand why your mom doesn't get the concept that, you know, that being respectful, you know, being there for someone kind of go hand in hand and she doesn't have to act the way that she does and she just doesn't understand the whole idea of doing things for people without just because you want to and because you are family and whatever else and she just expects something all the time and then she always has to make it about her. You know, my best friend she's just like yeah, that's your mom. Like, she's crazy. I don't understand why she feels the need, especially at this time, because she knows I have all this stuff going on and she, you know, continues to have to say that. [00:11:30]</p>

<p>I said she thinks that she's being nice because she said well good luck and I hope you sort everything out. She'll say, you know, to whomever, probably to her boyfriend that well, I was nice enough and that's what I said and, you know; now it's on her. I said something to her, so now it's up to her and she has to apologize to me because that's what she always says. You know, I'm just sort of... </p>

<p>I've really had it and so many times I just over the years where I'm like I have just had it and I don't want to talk to you and I don't even feel terribly upset about not talking to her and then when I do start talking to her she goes in to, you know, well, you just start shutting people out and that's your problem and you won't talk to me, but it's really I can't talk to her unless I have to like go back crawling on my knees begging her to forgive me for whatever it is that I apparently wronged her in some way. Whether I said or did anything at all, but she makes it out to seem that I did and I have just really had it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you are looking for validation from your boyfriend and your friend? [00:12:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. In just like I did ask my best friend like am I reading this wrong? Is she trying to be nice? Did I say anything wrong to her? You know, she, she's very; my best friend is very forward with me. She doesn't just say oh no, everything's fine. If she thought that I had said anything wrong or did anything wrong she'd be like no, you should probably apologize, but she said I don't think you did anything wrong. I'm pretty sure your mom is doing what she usually does. You know, expecting you to come groveling back to her. You know, my mom I think she just, sometimes she wants to make sure that I still need her and then when I sort of display that I actually don't, it makes her mad and so then she just, she won't talk to me and I basically have to, you know, do the apologizing and somehow make her think that I need her and then she feels better. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>She's always like oh, you need me. You always need me and I'm like I don't, really. I feel like sometimes I'm way better off without you because you sort of just make my life crazy and I just, I just don't have any desire to talk to her right now and that could change at some point, but right now, I have nothing to say to her because she is just making me angry that she continues to do this. I am frustrated and I don't really know what else to do because I don't have anything to say to her and even if I try to say something nice to her, it's not going to work and I feel like I have to put my foot down at some point and just say like I am not, I'm not apologizing to you for something that I didn't do anymore. I mean it's been long enough that I'm constantly having to apologize and you can't just keep telling me that I have to and that I don't respect you and that I don't do anything when all I asked you was that you can't freak out and you can't yell at me when I'm trying to do something. So, I just, I think I'm just not going to talk to her and sort of see how it goes. [00:15:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For the two of you or for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so for me. Right now I've, you know, I don't, I don't want to say that I don't care, but I need to sort of focus on my life and my feelings and how I feel and getting myself to the point where I don't feel like she's constantly badgering me and I don't feel like I'm constantly, you know, living to make sure that I don't say anything wrong to upset her so that she doesn't feel that I'm being disrespectful to her or anything like that. Like, I don't want to have to tiptoe around her. You know, if at some point I feel like maybe I want to talk to her or maybe I want to say something to her I will, but I'm not going to apologize to her for the things I'm not doing. If she wants to talk to me, that's fine, but I know she won't. That's just how she is. She'll go and it doesn't, it won't matter. So, I just don't think I'm in the right frame of mind at the moment to be able to talk to her and say what I want to say, I guess, which is frustrating. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Would you like to be able to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to be able to, but, you know, I think I've always just, I've always known that okay, this is how she is. She's never going to change. I've always had hope that maybe she would or maybe at some point in time like something will happen and it will change, but she's just really not and what had happened, you know, what's going on right now and everything that is happening is a big deal to me and to my boyfriend and, you know, everything else. It may not be a big deal to anybody else, but it is to us because it's happening to us. Every person has been supportive. I mean I haven't told, you know, like my family or anything like that just because I don't really want to get them involved. It's not really any of their business. You know, like my best friend and the people that I work for have been really supportive. The other family that I sometimes work for and, you know, I hang out with them, you know, on a friendly basis have been supportive and my mom has not and I don't. I don't know. I guess I don't really feel like I don't really even need her and she's just, no one else is really making it about them. Everyone else is just, you know, lending an ear and saying, you know, we'll do what we can do for you and if you need a break, just ask and whatever else. [00:18:50]</p>

<p>But, you know, with my mom, it's just all about her, her, her, her, her and I don't think that's really fair and I just, I don't need that in my life and sadly, you know, yes, it's my mom and I thought she was going to change. I thought maybe at some point she would be able to step it up and say like okay, well, this is a big deal and, you know, I need to be there, but just flying to Connecticut and then going home and not really doing anything and then turning around and making it all about her just is not being supportive at all and it kind of made me realize that she just doesn't have it in her. She just cannot do it. She's not going to change, so either I have to sort of just accept it and move on or continue to deal with her unnecessary drama which I don't want to deal with. So, sadly, if having to cut her out so that I can sort of get to where I want be personally, then if that's what I have to do, then I guess that's what I have to do. [00:20:15]</p>

<p>I feel like I have been fortunate enough to have a whole bunch of other people that have been supportive and helpful and everything else. So, I mean I'm sure had I told anyone else in my family they would all be supportive, but she just can't be. So, I am cutting her out of the equation for the time being for however long that I need to sort of just as I guess sucky as that is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it like for you the last time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When she kicked me out?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. When you didn't speak. When you were not speaking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really, it wasn't that bad. I mean in the beginning it was kind of like, I think, I'm trying to think. I don't know if I have ever really gotten upset that I don't talk to her. It's more the frustration of the fact that she's being so dramatic and she, you know, is continuing to just, I feel like everybody is out to get her and everybody hates her and, you know, it's frustrating when you have someone that is constantly saying that. [00:21:45]</p>

<p>Even after we started talking again she still felt that way about everybody in our family. Even if I said anything that would be sort of against her, it's just all she ever says is how people are out to get her and no one likes her. So, it's just, it's exhausting and frustrating and you can't talk any sense in to her. You can't say anything to her that's going to change how she feels about it. Not talking to her, you know, I just kind of went on with my daily life. I went to work every day. You know, I was working long hours and I had my dog and I was at that point in time I was living with my aunt. So, you know, I would do things with my family and I would go places and I basically just carried on with my life. I hung out with my friends and did stuff. You know, did whatever I wanted to do. I made the decision to move here and all that other stuff and she just wasn't around. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>I can't say that I was necessarily upset about it. I was just more angry and annoyed that she just keeps doing it and here we are again. She's doing it yet again. It's almost like it's her mo that she kind of blows up and has this big ordeal and she acts a certain way and she throws a temper tantrum and then she'll be fine for a little while. Whether it's, you know, a few months or a few years. She goes through this whole big thing where, you know, it's like she has to create some sort of drama and then she's fine. It's always me having to say I'm sorry and I don't know if she ever says I'm sorry. She worries more about my dog than she does me half the time. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>I mean I have a six year old dog who I have had her since she was a baby and my mom, like immediately after everything happened two weeks ago, was like she needs to come back to Pennsylvania. She needs to be here with me, but she's my dog and she has been with me or I had her with my ex when I lived in Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>So, she has been with either one of us and she just came up to here to Connecticut in the last like five or six months and she has been living with me in Wallingford now and she's perfectly happy and fine and she loves the kids and you know my mom's just like you're traumatizing her and she needs to be here and she needs to be in Pennsylvania. I'm like she doesn't understand states or anything like that. She's a dog. You know, as long as she's being fed, and loved and walked and, you know, I'm generally around, she's fine. She yells at me for that. Like, you're not, I can't believe you would leave her home all day. I'm like she's a dog. You know? She's just over the top about it and I don't even want to hear the nagging about my, about the dog. [00:25:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like she identifies with your dog about being abandoned. Not being cared for. Somehow like she identifies with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I have no idea, but she just... It's very frustrating and you know and I've said to her, you know, like, she's my dog and I will do what I need to do with her as I see fit and you know when I was working outside of the house, you know, sixty hours a week or more, she stayed at home all day while I was at work and she was fine and you know she's on my case if I have to leave her for a few hours. So, I just don't, I have resigned to the idea of just not telling her, you know, like what happened. It's like the dog ate chicken bones this past weekend and I called the vet or whatever. Then my first thought was if I told my mom about this she would absolutely be freaking out. She would be yelling at me and how could I let the dog eat the trash like it was my fault. You need to take her to the vet and you need to go get her stomach pumped or something like completely over reactive. [00:26:40]</p>

<p>I'm like it's nice that I'm not telling her and I don't feel like I have to tell her nor, so I don't have to listen to it, you know, and she was fine. Like, nothing happened. I did call the vet and, you know, everything was okay. It was just so much less of a dramatic situation because I didn't tell my mom. I just, I kind of enjoyed not having that extra drama and I think not talking to her right now is probably my best option, especially since I can't say or do anything that will make a difference. It's kind of just where I'm at with her. [00:27:40]</p>

<p>Other than that, it's kind of been a long week because the little one has been home sick from school. Other than that, just being anxious about tomorrow. My boyfriend is flying in tonight and he's very just miserable and worried about what's going to happen and trying to talk to the lawyers and back and forth and whether we need the people that I'm, that I work for there because it was their chair that got broken or anything like that. It has been fairly, I guess fairly quiet given well, Monday, except with my mom, but other than that I've just been sort of doing my own thing. Staying home because the little one can't go to many places, but that's it. Yeah. [00:28:40]</p>

<p>I don't really have anything else about my mom. She's just frustrating. So. I don't know. I do kind of wonder how long it will take her to kind of, if she will call me first or if she will eventually just say this is ridiculous or what she will do if I just don't talk to her and see how long she'll go without talking to me and it's just funny because someone whose is always saying how worried about me she is and how concerned about my well being and she has yet to pick up the phone in two weeks and now is saying that she refuses to talk to me because I am disrespectful to her. It's like mixed messages. So, it's almost confusing. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>Like, do you really care or do you just want to make drama and you just want to have something to talk about when you go to school with all your teacher friends? I mean it's sort of at that point where I'm just angry and annoyed that I think why does she still keep doing it? Does she, you know, really need something to do? Is she just bored with her own life or what? I don't know. Her boyfriend over Christmas kept saying, like, she, all she does is yell at me too and it's all she kept doing. You know, she was getting angry with him and stuff while I was there and it's over silly stuff and the second you even remotely try to tell her that she's getting angry over silly stuff, she starts to freak out, so sometimes I just wonder if she has no idea what it's like to live without having drama and just going about your daily business without being angry for some reason or feeling, like, feeling attacked in any way and because I don't even know if she's ever lived that way. [00:31:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just feel like there's something. It's always something. Like, my grandmother isn't talking to her or someone at school said something or so and so is, you know, being this way or that way and I don't know. She's just, I try to imagine like what her life, like, what goes on inside her head and I couldn't even begin to kind of form any sort of coherent thoughts about it because she's just all over the place and for someone to just be totally fine and okay with not talking to their only child and going a long span without talking to me and talking behind my back and all this other stuff is just, to me, it's just so silly. [00:32:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's just, it's almost like it's more sad for her and less sad for me. Just that she constantly has all of these feelings inside and she's not honest with anybody and she doesn't, you know, when she goes to her own therapist I know she's not saying anything, not anything, but most of it can't possibly be true because she will tell me some of the conversations that she has and I'm just like really. I mean you talked about that? You know, or are you sure? You know, I'm thinking in my head like that's not remotely true what you're saying to him, so he has no idea and I just I'm starting to just sort of just feel sad for her because she's alienating herself from everybody in my entire family and she doesn't like her boyfriend's family. They're all, there's something wrong with all of them and my grand mom is this way and my aunts are that way and her own daughter apparently doesn't do anything for her. [00:33:40]</p>

<p>So, it's like all she has is herself and her boyfriend who somehow puts up with her constant ranting and yelling and whatever else. So, I think sometimes I used to be just really angry and really upset more for myself, but now I think like the tables are turning that I'm just more upset for her because she, you know, the more I think about it, she doesn't really have a lot of people and all of her friends are married and they have kids and they are busy and I'm sure that they think that she's a little coo-coo or whatever or they believe whatever it is that she says. So, you know, it's just she's going to find herself all alone one day and she has burned so many bridges along the way in doing so. [00:34:50]</p>

<p>When she first started dating her boyfriend she refused to bring him around the family for a year saying that he didn't want to meet everyone and he didn't want to be around anyone and I'm not really sure that's true. I think that was her. Whether it was her own insecurities or her own sort of paranoid delusions about how everyone would be so she just sort of stopped showing up and stopped participating in activities because she didn't want to bring him around and then she blamed it on him and she, so I guess over time my aunts have all been like well, if you don't come to anything and, you know, she's upset because no one invites her to stuff and my one aunt goes out with my other one and then they have cousins who are fairly close in the same age. So, they will go out to dinner a lot or they'll just meet for drinks or whatever and my mom gets mad. Like, well, they don't invite me. [00:36:00]</p>

<p>But, when I've talked to them all, they just say well, we used to invite her all the time and she never came and she just kept saying no, no, no, no, no. And when I said something to her, like, you know, if people keep inviting you and you keep saying no, eventually, they're just going to stop inviting you and that's sort of how it has happened, so you can't really be upset that they're not inviting you anymore because they kept inviting you even after you kept saying no. I wouldn't invite you either and, you know, that was the wrong thing to say. Then she got all upset about that, but it's sort of like the truth hurts and it's just an ongoing cycle and I am sort of feeling sad for her. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>You know, I, you know I know I'll always have my mom, but at the same time, she has never really been a person that I can fully lean on and trust anyway in a mom fashion, so it's almost like I'm not really losing as much as one would sort of think when you say oh, I don't really talk to my mom. It's like yeah, she's my mom and, you know, she did a lot for me. She, you know, being a single mom for my entire life and she worked a lot and she went back to school and she did a whole lot of stuff, but just emotionally she could just never be there and to me I think it's more, that was more important than, you know, working all the time and making sure that I had every single materialistic thing that I could possibly every want that was not really making up for her not being there. Then, later on, her being controlling and directing. Wanting to direct my life in any way that she wanted to and getting frustrated when I didn't make the right decisions up until now when she is still acting that way and I would just rather her be someone that I can talk to instead of someone that just buys me things. [00:38:30]</p>

<p>You know, if I want something I get it and I don't really need that from her. So, it's almost as if like I'm just losing someone to buy me stuff and it's less sort of less upsetting. I guess it's upsetting in two ways or one. It's not upsetting that oh, well, I'm just not going to talk to her, but it's upsetting that that's how it is. It's frustrating all at the same time that I feel that way and that, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That this is the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That this is just how it is and I have no other choice. I can't change the way that she is. She's not ever going to change and I just have to sort of accept that and if that's, you know, what I have to do then I guess that's what I have to do. You know, it could change later, but right now, that's just sort of how it has to be and it sucks and I don't really, you know, I wouldn't want people to, I don't know. I don't want people to feel bad for me because to me it's like well, I'm losing so much drama and so much unnecessary baggage by not necessarily having the relationship with her as other people would have with their mom. Whereas, if I decide to have a relationship with her, then it just adds a whole new element of dramatics in to my life that I don't really want or need at this point . [00:40:30]</p>

<p>Then maybe later I'll decide that, you know, I can have a relationship with her, but it just has to be in a different context. You know, just sort of fair weather this is how it is and be able to kind of know when to put my foot down and to stop expecting things that are just not there. So. It's a lot to swallow and I probably, I've probably always known it. I just didn't really want to say it or think that that's how it had to be, but if I went almost two years not having, like, not talking to her and functioning and not, you know, needing to be committed because I wasn't talking to my mom, you know, and doing what I needed to do and making my own decisions. I think I'll be fine. [00:41:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's complicated to lose something that you never really felt you had to begin with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, trying to like make sense of it all and I think this is the first time I've like sort of actually verbalized a lot of it and, you know, just still now having to sort of think about it and actually have it, you know, sort of like become real as time goes on and, you know, not talking to her and just swallowing it and like realizing that I'm not losing someone who has been caring and supportive. It's been more someone who has been filled with drama and trying to control my life to where she wants it to be. So, it's essentially more weight off my shoulders than not. Whereas, most people would look at it the opposite way because I guess not everybody has normal moms. [00:42:40]</p>

<p>But, everyone I know, you know, they can talk to their mom and have a conversation and not feel like they're afraid to say something to her because it's going to be like domino effect of all kinds of stuff. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I just need to sort of swallow that and think about that, but right now, that's sort of on the back burner given that I just need to get through tomorrow and figure out what's going to happen there and that's it. I think that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're slightly less anxious about it now? Tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow? No. I think I'm, well, in talking to lawyer he basically said look, he's, he's going to get arraigned tomorrow because the DA- just doesn't really want to talk to anybody, but now it's sort of just a matter of getting the charges dropped from here. [00:43:45]</p>

<p>So, maybe I'm not less anxious, but sadly sort of resided to the fact that that's what's going to happen, but I know that my boyfriend's just really, really anxious about the whole thing and mostly about telling his job. He's just afraid of how it's going to affect his job and all of that stuff. So, you know, I kind of am worried about him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he required to do so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So, after he gets officially arraigned tomorrow on the charges, he has to tell them just because he's up for in 2014 they do different boards for his security clearance and he has top secret security clearance and so it could affect that and if they do a background check on him then and he never told them then it sort of raises more eyebrows like you had this happen, but you never told us and I think he's more worried because he is an officer. So, and he's working at headquarters doing a much more important job that he recently got. So, he feels like he has a lot more to lose and he's sort of nervous about that. [00:45:00]</p>

<p>So, I have resigned to the fact that he's going to get arraigned tomorrow. I think he has too, but he just it's getting the courage to talk to his boss about it. So, I'm a little anxious. A little just kind of want to get it over with sort of thing. Having my mom, this whole element of my mom and her drama, on top of it is sort of making it not as, I don't know. It's sort of making it less of a priority than my mom and her drama and it should be the other way around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're having the same attitude towards both which is sort of resigned this is what the reality is. You know. There are certain things you can control and there are certain things you can't and with both these situations you can't control them. [00:46:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, I'm usually fairly, you know, I always need to control things and I always need to sort of, I have a little bit of that in my mom. Like, I'm a planner and I like to know what's going to happen, but, you know, the lawyers have just been like you've got to let go. Like, there's nothing you can do about it. Like, you can't go in there and change anything and, you know, I've just kind of come to the okay, well, we'll just get through this and then we'll move on and we'll get to the next point and that's sort of basically how I feel about my mom. Like, I'll just make the decision of how I'm going to be now. It can change later if it needs to, but, you know, it's not set in stone necessarily, but at the same time, like, you can't do anything. She's not going to change and I'm not going to keep hoping that she does. So. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, right now we'll leave that appointment on Thursday since we don't have Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That works because you have something to do on Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know my schedule will probably be a little crazy, so instead of having to like juggle a new thing, I will just come on next Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If for any reason, you know, given what tomorrow brings up a lot of feelings and you feel you want to come in earlier, just let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Otherwise I will see you on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I will see you then. Good luck tomorrow, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

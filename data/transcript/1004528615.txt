<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey. Oh gosh. (pause) I (pause) It's weird because I've making a really big effort since I started coming here to talk about things that I don't really like to talk about especially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also just trying really hard ... you're going to disbelieve this really. But I've actually been really hard trying not to put a positive spin on things so that they, you know the things I do at work to be like, "Oh well this is the bright side of this." Or you know try to stay and come up with a cheerful attitude even when I don't. And so it's (pause) it's kind of emotionally exhausting to come in here.</p>

<p>(00:01:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's good for me. It's so (pause) wildly uncomfortable sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) tell me about the discomfort and the exhaustion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well mostly just because there's things in my life that (pause) I'm not especially (pause) practiced at talking about, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they're just to your face wouldn't talk about it, you know? And (pause) so they're just sometimes difficult for me to figure out how to express them adequately, I guess. Or even just talk about them really, you know? Something I'm just used to doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so some of them are uncomfortable just out of embarrassment purposes but some of them are just like I don't even understand what I'm talking about this kind of, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) (sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean how much does that affect you and how does it? Like do you leave here and need to crash? Do you (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Normally I come ... if it's Tuesday I come in and crash anyways because I'm exhausted because I just came from work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A few days of work usually, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's the end of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday for me. Usually that's different. It's more about the fact that I'm just (pause) I don't know how to explain it. I'm just (pause) first of all I swear a lot more in this room than I do like become blunt at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>(00:03:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I sometimes call my dad on the way home just because it's a good way to multitask, that kind of thing. And he remarked that on Thursday mornings when I call him I swear an awful lot and, "Do you talk to other people like this? Is this the way...?" I'm like, "No, I'm just around in a situation where it just gets into my lexicon and it takes me a while to get it out."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently my husband told two therapists that I hate going to therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just like I mean I don't think I hate it. I just (pause) get grumpy afterwards, pensive afterwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean maybe I have been getting the idea that I hate it but it's not the same thing. There's a lot of things in the world that I dislike doing and I still do them. Like I hate getting allergy shots.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't imagine that like too many people would be like, "Yeah allergy shots."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible_(00:04:08) do them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. It's about the only way to get over allergies if you have things that are just on, like you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that analogy actually sounds apt to me in that, like (pause) you're confronted with like a little bit of the bad stuff to prevent outbreaks later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's more like a vaccine than an allergy shot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually that's actually what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that how it works?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Allergies they give you very, very small amounts to try to get your body to stop reacting to it so badly. So yes it is. Vaccines are one of those things. So not like the same thing, but yeah. Though it's funny that I came up with that one. But you know (pause) there's just so much about like Mike's addiction that just makes my skin crawl. Not necessarily about the actual acting out, though I'm not especially thrilled about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's stuff that I just don't even want to have to own up to in my life, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you talking about (pause) things like ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Intimacy. Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have this unfortunate thing in my head right now. I have a very arbitrary decision making process that I will make certain at certain periods of time in which I don't know why but (pause) I know I have a concrete like decision is how much sobriety needs to have for me to be interested in sleeping with him. But I really don't want to like if he's been acting out recently. Which doesn't exactly make him especially honest with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>(00:05:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though (pause) not that he's dishonest it's just that (pause) I sincerely think he forgets at this point. I really do. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can imagine (pause) any number of things that might but what is it that turns you off about his acting out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a lot of things. The most immediate thing is physically he often can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Afterwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a biological reaction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me extremely upset. (pause) And I don't show that any to him at all but it does make me pretty upset, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How? How so like ... does that I imagine by the is one of those things I suspect you would like rather chew glass than talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talk about? Yeah. Yeah. Well for example, special evening planned, you know? Something like that, you know arrange to have the dog away, arrange to do this, arrange to do that. One would think he would think to himself, "Maybe I shouldn't act out." That kind of stuff, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He sounds like hurtful that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. Really hurts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And so (pause) it's just, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It must be such a painful (pause) rejecting (pause) kind of feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. (pause) And so (pause) you know it's ... I've tried very, very hard to casually bring things up like occasionally. I don't want to be like a (pause) a pain in the ass but just like, "Oh so how long has it been since you acted out? I'm planning on maybe, you know propositioning you later." See this is the kind thing I'd rather not talk about at all. But I do, I think it's important. You know like casually ask like, "You know?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, no that ... I see that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's just like (pause) I don't want to have to have these kinds of conversations, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You want to feel good about your sex life. You want it to be something that makes you feel good about yourself, good about the two of you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cared about in certain ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And it's (pause) it's not what I want it to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) just starting to feel like my life is over, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>(00:09:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) in many ways (pause) the best years of my life are gone, you know? And I'm getting gray hair. I am starting perimenopause, god. You know if I knew that I would have such little sex as an adult I would have been a slutty teenager, seriously. (pause) Because common sense tells you to put these things off for later in life. (pause) And it's just really painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I already like ... the thing is that (pause) I don't know. It's so complicated. There's so much going on. There's so many things that come into play with this that it just (pause) either it's physically not possible for me to be able to sort out what exactly is happening, you know? I mean part of it is the fact he has an endocrinologist who has no interest in treating him until he loses thirty pounds. (pause) That's the only thing she can think of to make him better. (pause) Yep. I don't know. I'm trying to get him to go see somebody else, you know? Although he has no testosterone and he has no, what's it called? Cortisol. What's the thing with people with too much cortisol? From stress?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He actually can't make any. (pause) Not very much at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he doesn't handle stress very well. If he'd know that years ago this would have different, but you know all this other stuff. So... there's that problem. Then there's the problem that he has of just being perpetual with the medications he takes for his depression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they try and play around with it and for a while they went through like, you know the SSRIs and then they went further back and like things that are older and older.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible_00:11:17).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we had the problem with his mouth getting so dry that his teeth were rotting and like I mean this was just (pause) ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and he was getting very like ... he was having a lot of problems with other stuff and it was just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So pragmatism says that it should be ... we should just keep with the medications that kind of work but you know make life less (pause) happy, you know?</p>

<p>(00:11:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As in like there's really no good solution here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So ... (pause) and I know for a fact he isn't exactly telling certain doctors about other things because I don't really think that he thinks it's relevant and I'm pretty sure it isn't but you know it's like ... you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know he's told his psychiatrist that he has problems with his testosterone and I remember that they took him off of stuff so they could figure out what was going on with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I'm pretty sure that like the endocrinologist doesn't know that he's depressed nor anything else, you know? (pause) And so ... and I know for a fact that his psychiatrist does not know that he has problems with acting out. I don't know why he hasn't told him that. He's only being treated for the depression from that. I don't understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I would think you'd want your psychiatrist to know about your major mental health symptoms.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know this isn't up to you but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (pause) But there's nothing I can do to control it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like it's ... well the last time he talked to a psychiatrist about problems related to that I think it was very embarrassing for the psychiatrist.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He wanted to explore options for chemical castration and the person seemed very unhappy about talking about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: First of all because they didn't know anything about it but second of all (pause) the person was very, very uncomfortable with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>(00:13:33)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... This was years ago. I mean (pause) he is very ... I mean both of us are very easily conditionable by bad uncomfortable experiences making it such that we can never really do something easily again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Like stuff after you've been burned kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I mean that's quite a thing to go in and sum up the courage to talk to somebody about I would think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then to have that person seem uncomfortable and be unable to really have a (pause) a reasonable productive conversation about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. So the doctors said that it was only done in (pause) like things related a criminal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not even that, just criminal related things and it was only done by court order, which is not true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's just one of those things where it's just ... it's deeply frustrating. I don't want to push to this. I already feel like a freaking pervert, like bothering my husband all the time. So ... not a pervert but a least a nag, you know? (pause) And so it's just extremely uncomfortable. (pause) I know that (pause) he is (pause) like I said I just know that a lot of it he tries to immediately forget afterwards too, so. I'm not thrilled about, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were things like sexually for the two of you early on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He never really had much of a sex drive. Mostly it's due to the fact that it was stress (pause) things like that and it was really more so but not too much. I mean I would ... the first year we were married I didn't live with him. I was traveling for my job so didn't see him that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:15:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there other periods in the relationship where you'd been satisfied?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right before we got married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With having ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even remember what it was like. I've been married for almost fifteen years. But I do remember at least it was relatively okay. (pause) But you know you just sort of put that kind of stuff off because you think, "Oh that will resolve itself in time. You know you just need to talk about things and just, you know grow up a little bit." And that kind of stuff, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's incredibly painful and awful to talk about it and think about it, deal with and frustrating and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But when you're twenty, twenty something like that you think to yourself, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This will get better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not go away as much as just need to ... you know there's so stress going on, give it some time you know, just keep trying, that kind of thing. That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is really hard because (pause) everybody who is in the, you know field says that, you know these kind of addictions aren't sex, but they're not sleeping with an addict, you know? (emotional) That's real easy to say that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like they're in a field, meaning my field I assume you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah like (cross talk). This is not on sex. This is entirely different than sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: About vulnerability, it's about this, it's about that, you know?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like to me anyway there's an aspect of bullshit to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that possibly it's true because it seems like (pause) he acts out at the most ridiculously stupid times. It's not like it's when he is interested and just doesn't want to deal with being alone and with anybody. Doesn't want to be somebody in terms of interaction it seems. It's more like, "Gee I stubbed my toe today, I guess I'm going to go do this." You know it's the most ridiculous things. It's like ... and it doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How (inaudible_00:16:44) I mean like (pause) I mean the idea that this has nothing to do with sex sounds to me like bullshit. I mean I understand there are underlying causes to vulnerability and intimacy and any number of other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:18:23)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depression. But (pause) like (pause) it's a kind of sexual acting out, I mean ... (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's obviously not gambling and it's not like he ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It affects his libido and it affects how he is with you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean like that's ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But you know they have all these various like books and they all, you know they talk about this kind of thing being, you know it's true I guess, sort of. But you know what? I'm sick of compartmentalizing my life. I've compartmentalized my life so much that (pause) and isolate it so that I can look at it objectively. I look at too many fricken things in my life, fricken objectively.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes I do.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:19:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm the kind of person who put off everything in my life because (pause) the ubiquitous they being you know? People are older when you say things like, "Oh don't worry. There will be plenty of time in your life to go do this later. What you need to do is do this now." And I did it. Like I'm supposed too. Like, "Oh you don't need to go in that until your twenty-two. You're a twenty ... keep you nose in the books, don't worry. You're sixteen don't worry about, you know boys too much, you know. That's time for later. Take sometime to really figure out who you are, that kind of thing. You know what? (pause) There is no later. I put off going to nightclubs and by the time was old enough to be able to go I couldn't go because I can't dance - I can't move. (emotional) (pause) I put off so much in my life till later and (pause) it doesn't really do my a whole lot of good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. There wasn't any later for you, that's tough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel kind of bitter. (emotional)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:20:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm the kind of person that puts the most unpleasant things first so that I can be able to later on enjoy doing things later, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was not your (inaudible_00:21:14) that drove you to graduate school and research?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) I just feel like I missed out on a lot of things. (pause) I don't know what but I feel like I missed out on a lot of things, you know? That being said, you know I've had a reasonably good life. I've traveled to most of the world, you know? I have ... I really don't want for much of things in my life but at the same time it just (pause) it's awfully hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:22:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (pause) have so little about my life that is ... that I can share with others that it makes it sometimes that I can't (pause) you know have casual friendships very much, you know? About hobbies or what I do or why things are the way they are, you know?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I don't understand, I mean you went through a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went through a lot of things but mostly, I mean trying to (pause) it's (pause) I just feel like there isn't as much to connect with almost all the people that I work with who are roughly my age have kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or they're (inaudible_00:23:00).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know or something like that. So I neither go on amazing benders nor do I have a family, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have very little to connect with people about, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yes. (pause) Yeah I see. You have really neither of those kinds of lives.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just don't have the kind of thing that makes ... I just don't feel like I have as much about my life that I really can share or talk to people about, you know? (pause) And so it's hard to connect with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Sure.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know I had been trying really hard to get him out of the house more often on his own without me, I feel like it might help him, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've had a couple of people basically mention the fact that Mike, you know just like, "You've got such a big personality it doesn't feel like, you know, you feel comfortable being himself." I'm like, "Okay if that's true, fine." Roam around the house, don't come till midnight, every Friday night go play like, you know your board games and I'll see you later and I'll chat with some girlfriends of mine and that's fine, you know? (pause) And (pause) you know it's I guess true. I don't know. Seems happier. (pause) But (pause) It's just ... sometimes it's just rough to get, you know ... it didn't used to be like this. Before like this like totally like the depression and the acting out, everything just started taking over his life, he used to enjoy going out to things, you know? Sure he was a little bit socially awkward but people knew who he was and he understood that and just liked him for who he was, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's actually a lot less socially awkward than half the people I knew, you know? (pause) And so like (pause) I don't know. (pause) It just (pause) I just feel like ... and maybe it's just because I need to spend with being around people that already know me so I feel like I'm not necessarily have to explain my life to them. Because sometimes that's really, really hard, you know? (pause) Luckily Hanover is a little bit easier because it's eccentric.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:26:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where is when most of the people I meet out in like Salem for some reason like the kind of things that they're interested in or like in general are like the kind of things that, you know that they feel as if they are paying me compliment really aren't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Like I actually had someone tell me how great it was that I felt comfortable wearing like crazy socks to work. I'm like, "Really, really?" Like I don't know how to take this, you know? It's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. In a way like (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My real socks are not that crazy by the way. I mean they're a little weird but not that crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not to really.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But Hanover is at least a little bit better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Really not trying ... people are doing sort of ... there's a little more diversity in the kind of paths like reviewing the pages and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So ... but I don't like spending time with people online because I don't feel like it's very genuine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On top of it the people that I've been speaking with that I ... are of something that I know that I'm not thrilled about and my husband is especially not thrilled about so I have been mostly speaking with a ... how do I explain this. The turn of the twentieth century there was artists, they called them schools but they weren't schools. They were people that all worked together as a group. Kandinsky and I can't think of much, basically artist that they like all had stuff that they had different points of view but they put out things that were all, you know something that a had a similar theme to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This group of people would like to think of themselves that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really they produce smut. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the most bizarre thing in the world. It's basically almost entirely women between the ages of thirty and fifty who ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah his stuff yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who do discuss ... and most of them they're lives like you know I've occasionally helped them with things like (inaudible_00:28:12), this or that or like how to prepare things for sale online in terms of like ebook, like epub stuff that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:28:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so most of them are pretty normal people but I think that (pause) I don't know they just (pause) having that be the only thing in common is like watching Anime and that kind of stuff is kind of weird, you know? It's reassuring to know that it is normal but still kind of very weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't really like to spend a whole lot of time chatting with them; I do it about once a week or so. They have like 'meeting of the minds' in which they talk about things primarily related to like production, art that kind of thing, you know? Actually if you didn't know what it was you'd not actually think any of this was being what it was. Because it's really talking about like things about the way media ... in terms of "Oh wow. Do you scan things in or are you drawing it in watercolor, are you scanning it in, are you doing this, you know in this media? It really is a lot more technical than you would really think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's basically a bunch of writers, a bunch of artists, you know I get asked a lot of questions about video production, that kind of thing. And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying it's like (pause) middle brow, like upper middle brow (pause) piece of production value?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of it is exceptionally good production value.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I say the problem is that the plot is horrendous sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it depends on who it is. Some people ... you have to be invited to be involved in this group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so most of the people there are actually fairly good ... like what they do but occasionally once a month they invite people who interested to ask questions. This is such a weird thing to even talk about. They invite ... like basically it's almost like ... it's called 'Meet the makers' and basically you can ask questions like, "How in the world do you like write multi-chapter things or how do you do this or, you know how do you stay consistent in tense? You know like you get all of these questions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of that or "How in the world do you ... you know "How in the world is it that you do this with that?" You know whatever? And so ... but for the most part you actually ... the people who discuss their inspirations and production stuff and all that mostly actually are pretty down to earth people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:30:51)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But only once a month do they allow just random people in there. And the other night we were discussing the fact that there's often ... in fact more often than most of us would like to admit extremely, extremely curious young girls involved and how to read this out and out, you know to handle this kind of things. And so that was one thing that I think my husband was really freaked out about the fact that we were discussing the fact that, you know that we have to have a united front on this. You know that whole thing with, "You may think you're really mature. No it's not a bad thing to be interested. Sex is ... even with this and that. However, you know the law says this and I don't care if your mom says it's 'Okay' you cannot have anything to do with this. I'm not trying to shame you, I'm not trying to say this is bad or nasty or rotten but we need to stay on this side of the law.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like we had this two hour discussion about having a unified front about what we're going say about this kind stuff. And so I think that kind of weirded him out because I think that a lot of ... although this has nothing to do with his addiction I think that the actual porn industry has no interest whatsoever in being involved in that. You know in terms of like having a stance on this at all, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the porn industry ... go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They make a whole industry on barely legal porn and they will turn their heads for a lot of things, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:32:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so like they're not interested in making sure that they have a common ground on that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Like if I follow, though they may do certain things for legal reasons because they are not being sued. They're not principled about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and one of the things we wanted to do is make sure that we had every positive (pause) every positive like (pause) thing for being interested but yet at the same time saying, "Yet you know this is not, this is not for you. We'll see you later." You know? And so having that kind of stance on it is actually ... mostly because a lot of these people are parents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I think that made them feel kind of queasy because I think that ... not queasy, but like uncomfortable because the concept of having to like (pause) had the dichotomy was really uncomfortable with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Of saying, "Yes. Sex is positive. It's normal to be curious. This and that." You know? (pause) But at the same time being like it's normal to be curious but we still don't want you around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we need to verify a lot more than just like you say, "I pinkie swear that I'm over age eighteen."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (inaudible_00:33:42) that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even if though most of the stuff is not especially in anyway explicit in any way it just happens to be that almost all of us have the nightmare of having somebody's parents find out that their fourteen-year-old girl is interested in gay sex stuff, you know and then coming down on one of them, you know? Because they let their daughter do this, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's very (pause) it was very important to make sure that, you know it being protected but yet at the same time not being negative about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that maybe that just really bothered him a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... (pause) there's a lot of things that are very ... because they're ... although almost everybody had a very similar background in what they do (pause) I think that they have different life stories that got them there that it's just kind of a weird thing. So ... (pause) And I think it just ... I don't know it just makes him uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't want me not to talk to them. He's never asked me that. (pause) You know that kind of thing but he's basically (pause) is kind of uncomfortable with all this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there (pause) much that's erotic about it for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Very much so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It ... you know but I'm not (pause) you know, that's not really what it's about. It's a lot of ... I mean yes it is. But most of my involvement is ... Okay, yes it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But most of the involvement is actually like other things, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like most of the actual time you spend with this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Or like even like it's much more interesting talking to people about like the aspects of it more than the actual like mechanics if you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it sounds like it's both.</p>

<p>(00:35:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's both. It's both. But (pause) you know (pause) it's more (pause) I'm a romantic, you know? And I like seeing people in love.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other night we were out somewhere to eat and there was some adorable people they were obviously on their first date and it didn't matter that to me one way or another. I was just like, "Oh my God look at that. They look so cute. You remember back when you were like that?" And he's like, "We were never two Italian men." And I'm like, "No that is true."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh) Wait we weren't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Look at them they are like so cute and smitten." And most of the time he's pretty okay with this kind of stuff but he didn't, you know he never passes up one to make a joke about that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both of us make a lot jokes when we're uncomfortable about the situation. But you know it's just ... it's nice, you know. And so ... but (pause) it is what it is you, you know? And so (pause) I think that also the fact that I'm telling him pretty openly about this ... I didn't want to have no secrets from him on this kind of thing, you know? Because I think it's wrong. I think that once you start having secrets about things like this that that's where things go wrong. You know start separating your lives and you know start (pause) I don't know how to explain it. That's where you start drifting apart, you know? So like for example, you know I did tell him because one of the people that I know there, she is currently right now ... she has MS and she's stuck in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Hopefully she won't be much longer. She's getting ... unfortunately in the U.K. it is very difficult to get the access to medical care that you get here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The ... what's it called? Oh I can't think of what it's called now. It's basically same similar stuff that the stuff I inject myself but slightly different for the different part of the immune system.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it wasn't until she basically couldn't move from the waist down was she able to get access to the Interferon were she here would not necessarily ... you would have to wait for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) and her and I were just discussing the fact that like quite frankly with mobility issues that there are intimacy issues, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And how it's basically for her right now she just ended a relationship and she's so unwilling to start one because the fact that then you have to explain things and then you have to modify things and all this other stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I can imagine (pause) it's difficult and like (pause) sensitive to navigate through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so her and I were just discussing this kind of thing. Not very much, not even anything in detail. More even just like on a level of it's just geared towards that but it's ... I mean quite frankly when you have mobility issues you have mobility issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And trying to explain to somebody, "Oh by the way if you stick around long enough it's going to get worse." I mean that's really hard to tell anybody even on an emotional level.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:39:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so (pause) you know I think that (pause) he feels guilty, I guess. I don't know what it is it bothers ... I can tell he gets moody when I tell him that I've been talking about this kind of stuff. I can tell he gets very moody about it, you know? I don't think he's upset that I'm telling anybody. I'm very open about the whole thing. You know it's just ... am I'm certainly not in anyway I've never told any of them about his problems. (pause) Other than that basically that one-day he came out and he said, "This is my favorite character in all the shows. Please don't make him gain anymore." And I'm like, "Well seeing as I'm not and I don't, that's not really an issue." It's like, "Please don't read anything more with him gay because I like him." (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, I want to try to understand. So this is his favorite character and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Out of all these T.V. shows out there he's like, "Please don't ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you're watching?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that show that we have watched ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the past he's like, "Please don't like, please don't like, you know have anything to do with this because it could happen."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, "Well I really don't have a whole a lot to do with it but I just mentioned the fact that my husband says, "Please don't let that happen anymore."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly because a lot of people tend to let's refer to a ship; I hate that phrase. Basically whenever they write pieces of literature about two people when the big characters that they have they often refer to a ship thing and I don't know why. With somebody who's much, much younger than and it's actually borderline like (pause) not really pedophile but like somebody who is thirty and somebody who is like eighteen, seventeen and so that makes him feel very uncomfortable, I guess.</p>

<p>(00:40:42)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I might need some explanation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Traditionally in this world people who write for this tend to put ... say characters, one character who's thirty who Mike likes with somebody who's like somewhere between the ages of sixteen and nineteen through the whole show.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's makes him feel like ... he hates the fact that it has to deal with ... the person is a gay and pedophile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's (inaudible_00:41:07) like literature.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. But when you said show.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes. I should explain this is all based on fan fiction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah almost all the anime stuff and this stuff is based upon things that are already out there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So it's like (pause) characters in shows or movies that are appropriated ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Almost none of them made it in the U.S. So not like anybody we'd actually see on T.V.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it. Okay. Now that's clarified.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. So ... yeah I should have probably explain that, yeah. Most of the time people steal from (inaudible_00:41:42) and they write based upon that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So he's like, "Please I like this person. Please don't ..." I'm like, "I don't really have the power for this. I don't write. I'm not a writer. I'm not an illustrator. I don't really have like I just ..." I occasionally act as like you know a technical help for people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't have the power to do this but did mention the fact that he was kind of upset about that and so I don't how he felt that I actually said that. But I just said, "You know what I want to know if other people's husbands had problems with that kind of thing." You know? And most of them don't but you know they also don't probably have as much emotional baggage as I do. (laugh) So I don't know. But the fact that I don't really tell anybody about my husband's problems because really that's not relevant, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(00:42:31)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mostly like, I format things. I take things ... I take text and put them into ebooks. This could quite frankly be like ... it could be 'Levi' you know or it could like the Iliad. It would be about the same things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So for me not as ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're on the production side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm on the production side not on the creativity side very much. (pause) And so like (pause) you know? But it is nice to talk to people, you know? (pause) You know it's (pause) it's kind of weird though. But you know I think it bothers him that I, you know mentioned that kind of stuff, you know that ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You didn't have to believe it. Because apparently they all thought it was really hilarious that there was one person that he didn't want ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's broken with the rest of world but there's this paper person, please don't say that but don't (inaudible_00:43:24) this guy anymore, okay, please? I'm like, "Okay, sure, whatever." You know? So ... (pause) It's just such a weird world right now and I don't like ... you know I like being around real people. If I could be around real people I would get rid of this in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like (pause) yeah it's like (pause) so you're around real people and you'd rather things were like (pause) much better sexually between you and Mike.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they were I'd probably wouldn't be interested in this either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other than from the cute, fluffy aspect of things, you know? Like and they do that. There's a lot of fluffiness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I emphasizing the other side of it right now mostly because the fact that it's uncomfortable for me to talk about and I'm trying to make it sound like it doesn't exist, it does exist.</p>

<p>(00:44:16)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. Now I the times when you kind of felt kind of a knowledge like (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The sexual side of it as well as ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But to be honest it's about the same as every other relationship, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But to be honest though it's not the big thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most of it's about relationships and making it work. (pause) It just happens to be in Japan and it tends to be like that's the kind of thing that's more interesting that they do ... they do that all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll see you on Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. You too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks.</p>

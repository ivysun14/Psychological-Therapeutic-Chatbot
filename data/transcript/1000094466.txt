<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: How is it going?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty good. A little tired.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll bet. It's the end of the week. I generally see Cynthia on Wednesday nights. And Cynthia is never at a loss for words. So, I seem to get shorted on sleep on Wednesday nights. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So sorry about that. [laughing] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did you apologize? You anticipated what I was -</p>

<p>PATIENT: wondering. Ah well, being sleepy isn't exactly a socialable trait. And- 0:01:04.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, still, you know. One might ask -</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You know I am actually sick of laughing actually. Did I mention that? I probably mentioned that, I decided that probably what was going to happen was that I was going to laugh more today and I also decided that I was plenty tired of doing it. And this is getting down right boring. So hopefully, I am probably doomed to do it today, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am hoping to discuss the level rising above the giggle level and really brings us through. Or at least brings me through, so. 0:01:59.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, do you, I guess I am wondering do you feel like laughing, or do you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's funny, as I was coming up here, I was, I can't remember there was some sort of vague memory of that feeling of what happens when we head into things here. And I started giggling. It was just, it was just like [snaps fingers] right there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just in thinking it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean 50 feet out the front door out the school, you know, where I work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know 60 feet out the front door, it's dull and it's boring. 0:02:37.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have, it seems to me that you have really strong reactions to your laughing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I like a nice clean interaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Clean interaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Clean, yeah. Sure. I mean it seems, it seems like a defense mechanism. It seems pretty, I think. I mean yeah, it seems pathological. It seems like something is not working correctly. I will classify it as that. I don't like going around laughing. I don't like the feelings that are generating inside. Something's up. And I know it. And I can't get to it. [inaudible] Cynthia actually had a negative experience or sobering experience yesterday, I had a very strong temptation to, you know, sort of be miserably, miserably low about it and say I told you so. And then checking that, it was just, I was utterly vengeful feeling, though I never said anything. But I felt the giggling coming, I felt like just shoving it in here face. And saying I told you so. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel now, telling me about it? 0:04:09.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Neutral. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't look neutral for a second there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, you know, I mean. You know, it seems like the giggling is [laughing] - great. Spaceship has lowered and taken over my body once again. Oh great. And I don't mean that the smile was associated with the retelling of it. I think that seems sort of blended in with being back here again. We should really try this two sessions in a row thing from time to time. That's a money [inaudible] 0:05:04.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's worth doing if I can afford it. In any event, I actually don't think, I don't feel particularly much feel like giggling towards Cynthia's. I actually do feel like telling I told her so and finding a way to express that. I do feel like that. Because I feel the very same, it was a departmental evaluation and she got reamed. Basically people saying that she was blaming the other, not focusing. I have been saying the same things to her with respect to our relationship. And that had been transient and so on. So that was really quite a temptation to the neh neh na na boo boo. You know kind of really take it there. 0:06:09.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I am tempted to. I think actually the temptation was to sort of let her have it. You know. And do exactly, say something basically down right cruel. Not necessarily cruel, but certainly blisteringly honest. Which is thankful. Sometimes when I have giggled with you it's been because I had something pretty sharp that I was willing to say and I felt it, I felt like a noble man inside that I wasn't going to say it. So. 0:06:53.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I still find myself wondering actually what it feels like for you to talk to me about this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This with Cynthia. This strong urge, lets say to tell her something sharp. I guess maybe I wonder because as you said it seems like a similar thing happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, with us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh with us and with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So but the question is--</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I was quite surprised. I mean all of the sudden her I was and she was, you know. I mean I would have been thrown out the door 4 seconds later. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So my question is. My question you is how is it to tell me about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why would it, there would be no, there's no. I mean this is just a side story. I mean there would be no particular reason to have to strong feelings about that. 0:07:47.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or any feelings, I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean, I don't know. To me it's just, I mean telling you just seems like a piece of the. I mean okay now we have an outside, I mean when it was. I mean confronting you about something that you did, then of course there is all kinds of reason to be embarrassed or shy or strange or fear reprisal or something like that. With her it just, I'm telling you about somebody else doesn't seem like I am risking very much so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its safer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel fairly neutral about it. 0:08:24.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think, you know, how do you think I may react to hearing that you were tempted to saying, well you know, something that might have seemed a little mean? Honest granted, but -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I guess I don't really know where you stand on all this, so I don't really, I mean, I assume that part of what you are wanting me to practice in here is being straightforward. Or at least being, or clear headed. And I guess perhaps my take away message so far has been if you are thinking it, say it. You know, get it out. That's probably not what you are. That seems a little to simplistic for you. You recommending that would basically be you recommending anarchy. And I can see a couple postal workers coming out of your session here and going. I guess its not postal workers anymore, now its lottery administrators. 0:09:46.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lets stop for a second. What is going on? You're joking again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] I mean, I beg your pardon. Oh my god.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So lets stop for a second. What's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not joking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: that stuff about the postal workers? That wasn't joking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, you started off by saying, how might I feel hearing about this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I am asking was what was happening right then when you started joking. How were you feeling then? That's what I want to ask. 0:10:36.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, bored.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bored?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I was bored.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And were the jokes to liven things up a bit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know. Self administered cup of coffee. Yeah, I guess. I mean I don't feel, that didn't feel like a defense mechanism it just felt like, I don't know. It's just sort of like I am working through this stuff and just kind of tired. So that was sort of a breather. So at the point the joke isn't really obstructing, obstructing dialogue at least for very long. Anyways, this is sort of a brief interlude. 0:11:43.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you seem to be saying it was different then the other kinds of jokes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I mean there have been times when I joked for, yeah. Well yeah I agree I joke to shut things off, lighten things up, shift it, delude it. I don't feel that it was that. I didn't feel, that wasn't really joking actually, I think it was more cynicism. Or see I must, yeah. 0:12:22.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure that I see the difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Between the joking and cynicism. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not in general in that case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean, I was saying, I was sitting here trying to say that, sitting here reflecting on learning in here or trying to learn in. So the first few weeks I am in here, the message is quit self editing. You know what I am saying. But and then I was saying, but so then I was sort of as I sat here and reflected on that. I thought, oh that too simple, he can't. This can't be the end of the story. There must be some other story, better. And so the brief interlude was postal worker/lottery administrator. So, yeah, well what can I say. I mean. I feel like I am sort of slogging through. I mean. I feel like I am sort of slogging through this. And so boredom on the one hand and frustration on the other, because of course you're not going to tell me the end of the story. And or at least not now. 0:13:58.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, how about that? I mean, you talk as if I am withholding something from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I know that when we hit the 47th minutes, you'll sort of open up again and give your summation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, but-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems to be clinical practice is it not? Try to get a wrap on, you know, let him start, let you finish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum, that's interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not clinical practice?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well lets back up for a second. So it is because of the way things, if I understand what you are saying, then the way that things have gone the last couple of sessions. Right now, when you are struggling with trying to figure out what the take home message is, lets say. I might be holding that back. 0:15:09.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know why I am laughing again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe something was funny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You honestly, this honestly requires reflection on your part. I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem, you're surprised that I would be interested in this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I am surprised that you have, I mean this seems like an obvious thing that you, that you are waiting till the end of the period to discuss the take home message and this can't be a shock to you. 0:16:04.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me put it to you this way. You seem to be very good at extrapolating a take home message. I'm not ever really sure that I have one in mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, oh dear. Well okay - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am quite serious. I'm quite serious. I don't really approach each session like I want to get something particular across to you. And so -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you do have a paradigm that you work with in. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am still wondering what is happening here, you're questioning something. Yes, no? Lets stop for a second, we seem stuck on this. I feel like we are kind of missing each other here. Do you have that feeling? 0:17:19.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes and no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think is going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I had to say what is going on, I would say that you have like this really nice radar set. Picks up anything, you know, sparrows, flock of geese, equally sensitive, you know. Sets it off and you can access that information instantaneously and say stop, you know. You know, I get half a sensitive out, you see the smirk. I mean you are picking up every thing, and it's great, great feedback mechanism. I make a brief aside and you know, sort of clunky joke. Actually I don't think that it was clinically significant or relevant. I don't think I have to like plug it into my souls or anything like that. But it looked a lot like the things that did, so we had to stop and cross that one. Process that one. 0:18:46.6</p>

<p>It actually wasn't a soviet missile, it was a flock of geese. And so now we are now kind of going over information that realty isn't all that relevant to me. I actually, I kind of like the fact that we experiment back and forth at the end, of. You know, you kind of have a take about what has been going on this hour. I like that. I don't exactly starting too much. But it seems like it makes sense, it is a process. And it seems to work. At least every session that I have come in here. I go out feeling a little better at least I have something to think about. And it seems to get me through the week. Okay, that is cool. So actually I don't feel like you are withholding anything as in being sneaky. I do think that you are waiting kind of to see how the session goes. And that you are going to draw a conclusion at the end. That seems reasonable. So basically I think that, I basically think that for some reason that we have gotten kind of, I don't know, it just seems like a friendly mistake or something like that. And it - 0:19:58.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The mistake, missile versus flock of geese mistake. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Missile versus, yeah. I made a wise ass crack about the New Jersey lottery and you picked why up you joking out of all of this. And you don't know that I am Marxist and I can't stand lotteries. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I am a lot more sympathetic with postal unions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you seem to have a reaction to the fact that my radar was too sensitive in that case. 0:20:42.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I like your radar, I need your radar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean. It just seems reasonable that it you have a great set of radar set you are going to have to dismiss some things as geese and some things as missiles and just trust me, no that was nothing. Or I don't think that one's a waste, I don't think we need to stop that one right now. And then we sort of continue with the story. I don't know. On the other hand I might be, you know, slipping back into some axis two personality, but I don't know.  0:21:28.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess what I am -</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what I am, I get the feeling, you know, you were, I interrupted you in the middle of something that you were saying to point that out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Now we are doing, now we have this sidebar thing going and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. The sidebar thing. Well tell me about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well okay, so I am grumpy. Now I am grumpy that we are doing a side bar. I mean I get about five minutes of it. 0:22:19.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You roll your eyes at. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Moi? [laughing] So lets talk about the sidebar. Well you brought it up, it's not me. It's not my topic. We can either talk about it or just stop it. Jesus, oh this process is so ridiculous sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think this is such a good move here Jim. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To agree that this process is ridiculous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no, to agree that this is exactly what I am talking about with this sidebar. And stuff. That's seems to be part of your reaction. Is that this can be really ridiculous. That is can be that there are relevant things to talk about and irrelevant things. And we seem to spend a lot of time on what seems to be, to you, to be the latter. 0:23:36.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here, here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And one might go further and say that I am the one that focus us on those things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the laughing about now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know, okay well since we are in the land of the absurd here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The land of the absurd.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, now there you go again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean really, the land of the absurd. See I don't think that I, I really, I don't think that that kind of comment is insignificant. 0:24:18.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] you know, -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: let me put it another way. It seems to me you have reason for saying something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well now absolutely. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh god. Shit. You know I had this. This keeps happening. Okay I'll play this out. Lets -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get on the phone with Cynthia at 10:40, and uh, 10:40 the other night. Yup I was on the phone with Cynthia two nights this week. First phone call she uses my first name instead of a term of endearment. And she clearly like, I can tell from her tone of voice that she is using Chap Stick or something. She's got like two or three things going and I can clearly see that I am like, I am the sidebar. I am the, I'm like one of the, she's multitasking and I know it. And I say, Cynthia what is going on, you know. Where is your head right, you sound distracted and stressed. No I'm not. And I said well it sounds like you are chewing something and it sounds like your putting stuff away while we are talking. You know, thought we agreed that when we talked you would, you know. We ended up going in this no, I'm not. No I'm not. 0:26:08.8 </p>

<p>I spend maybe 25 minutes getting to the obvious fact that a) she was distracted, b) she was multitasking c) it is a sign of disrespect and d) she had the fucking common sense to realize that if she is going to call me at 11:00 when it is time that I go to bed that there could have been a good night component to it. Okay. Phone call number two. She's opening her mail. Its in the middle of the day, she's opening her mail during the middle of the day. I hear the ripping in the background. She's distracted again, this and that. She's got 40 minutes before her next class. Again I spend 20 minutes going over a) your opening the mail b) you're distracted by it c) its impolite and d) you don't have to do it, you can wait. You could have waited to. This is like significant chucks of time going over the obvious and so. 0:27:15.8</p>

<p>And so I don't know what to make of all this except that you know, to me these things seem obvious and to me it seems obvious that, that what that I am more than willing to take some, I don't know. I am more than willing to take some - I don't know, I keep wanting to say some theoretical knowledge and apply it. You know, it's like Ted, part of what we are doing here is this. You can say that at the beginning or you can say it at the end. I don't care. I am happier at the beginning, but I guess I am, I am getting disgusted because this seems like more kind of noise. You know, like we got side tracked on this thing where I am grumbling about postal workers or grumbling about whatever. And it does, it did seem sort of tangent. I don't know where this is going, I don't know where this is coming from. 0:28:44.2</p>

<p>But it does seem like this process of kind of constantly monitoring every, you know, its like every .3 seconds, you take a sample of our discussion and you know, it's like where are we [inaudible]. And of course this is going to generate, you know, of course this is going to generate a) lots of insight and b) lots of noise. So I guess that I am just lobbying for, I don't know, at some point I mean I'll sort of debate this for a while but at some point I just want to say that one was in the way, lets just get on with other discussions. But of course now, of course now we do have this little side insight of the phone call with Cynthia when I had to come up with the same thing. 0:29:40.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me exactly how you have in mind, how this story relates to what is happening here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't really, except that both of them were really annoying. I don't have great, I don't have a great reason for bringing it up except that I was seeming to involve ten fifteen minutes of going over the obvious. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both of those stories, or</p>

<p>PATIENT: All three stories.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This included. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. New Jersey lotto, letter opening and multitasking at 11 pm, while talking to boyfriend. 0:30:34.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So actually it's probably only a very vague connection. Probably mostly just pissed off about the other two incidents [inaudible] in here. So. I just sort of, I just sort of ended up here by the fact that I was still bitter about it. In fact that might be why, okay. So what do you think is going on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I, you know, I. You know, when you tell those stories, they seem to occur to you at that time. So I wondered why tell them now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which the phone stories? 0:31:34.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the answer won't be in here, it will be out there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well I mean, I don't know, I don't care. Well all week long I have been angry at myself for not being, for being such a wimp in those two discussions. I mean I was such a fucking boy scout in those discussions. It's like honey, are you, are you building a bomb. I mean are you building a jeep. You know, are you okay? And it's like and inside I just, especially the second one, this is not even close. This is rude. What she is doing is rude. And its, it makes me feel like I'm dating a 15 year old and I want. And it makes me just want to dump here over and over. You know, its like look, wake me up when you want to get serious, okay. Or come around some other time, but, you know. Why don't you of put baseball cards in your bicycle spokes and put your hair in a pony tail and play with the other girls okay. 0:33:22.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't say those things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I want to, but it was, I mean it didn't occur to me until to me that it was just really ridiculous that she was opening her mail and talking to me. Just, and maybe. But part of me was going yeah well perhaps you are just too demanding. 0:33:41.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me ask you this. How are you being a wimp in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well now that's what. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean how are you being a wimp right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's a good question. I don't it didn't feel like I was being wimpy. I could have said, you know, Jim lighten up huh. I made a joke, lets move on, I want to get on to the other stuff. You know I could have said that. I could of, I could of. But I didn't have the presence of mind to do it until we had spent ten fucking minutes going over it. 0:34:29.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ten fucking minutes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ten fucking minutes. You wasted ten of my minutes, which I pay $1.10 per minute for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So wimp. I started off with good intentions, you know. Its like, maybe he's got a point, I'll think about it for a second. And then at the end of the nine minutes we had spent going over your point which I thought was stupid. But I was willing to listen to it. But I am giving it nine minutes of airtime, then all of the sudden it had credence and we were still talking about it. Now we were like on your. Now we are like talking about it and it has, now it has got like merit. You know. So now I have to a) fight the original, the original this is gone and now we've got ten minutes of in between time which I have to like, I have to like screw it all out and the original thing which was. The original claim didn't have merit. Plus there is all the other, there is nine minutes of text in between. Which has even less merit then the first thing. And I've got to deal with all of them. Okay, so I'm annoyed sure. And so then it brings up the thing with Cynthia. So okay now I have a [inaudible] on me the last twenty minutes. 0:35:55.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say that like what good does that do me though?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I can see that it did some good, but. But, I can see it. [laughing] this is a maddening process. I can see, I can see that you are right. Well let me, well excuse me. I'm sitting here now having to swallow, as I, having this inane process I can now see that there was some merit for going through the inane process. Because without having gone through what I think was an asinine nine minutes, I would never have sort of realized how angry my 49 minutes with Cynthia was the other night. So. So now - 0:37:06.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe how angry you're 37 minutes here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I am more like to be angry at Cynthia then I am about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be that as it may. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. That's true. Okay, fine. Well I am pissed off at you both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I've got to tell you. I feel like just now when I said that, I feel like, I wonder if you pick up in this, and maybe it comes across even in the way that I say it. Almost like I am catching you at something. 0:37:54.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: The old hand in the cookie jar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well its, its there. That's a fair description.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then you, you criticize me. You criticize me for being attentive to it. You know. I said some thing, it started off with some comment. And oh I was tired and I said sorry anyway. You're sorry, really? 0:38:25.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah rocket scientist, hello.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you took that as critical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. I mean but, what. I mean this is sort of hand in the cookie jar. But my hand was not in the cookie jar, I was apologizing. It seems well within the norm. Well within the established norms of the American middle class to expect that the person that you are talking with to be awake. Okay, I wasn't awake, I fell outside the norm and apologies indicated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perhaps I understand that you were tired all day and you're tired. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but its not like, I slept all night. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, and then worked all day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, so I had a bad excuse. You know, because I mean I said last week. You said long day and I said no short night. Okay, had a bad excuse last week had another one this week. So it just feels, you know, I feel like I am shorting work because I am slightly groggy there. And I come here and I feel like I am doing the same thing. I fell like I am shorting myself. 0:39:35.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you apologize, I look curious about that. That seemed like I was on you for something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not on me but - as I said it just seems like a norm. I should be awake.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should be awake. But -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I can you this, if show up, you know sleepy hung over, I'll be pissed off I guarantee you. You know, in fact I want, I might be a little pissed off but I'll just say, look, lets drop this. It's 5:15, I am going to head back to work. You sleep it off. See you later. You know here is your seventy bucks, I'm out of here, right. Okay, I mean I'm not going to do it. I might get a little pissed off and I am not going to hang around. 0:40:39.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See that seems like more of a reason to me then social graces to apologize then. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For what? What seems like more of a reason?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well given that. Given how you might feel if I showed up tired. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I apologized to you because I projected onto you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know it we would call it projection for what we call it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok, fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But yeah, I guess that what I am saying is you know, if I showed up tired and hung over with out a good reason. I wonder if you would expect me to apologize. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, fair enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's all besides the point. What was interesting to me in what you said was that you took my curiosity as critical. As criticism. 0:41:37.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is true. Well, or is it? No I rolled my eyes. It was just like, that was different. Because I always feel like some reason we take something which seems obvious and then go over why it isn't or you think it isn't or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me the apology was obvious. For you, why did you apologize? Wake up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wake up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That was cute, that was a good one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? I didn't mean it as a joke. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you find funny about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, because we are talking about being sleepy, I thought that you were making a little word game. You were, weren't you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it is interesting you said wake up. I am not sure what to make of it. You know. 0:42:58.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: You were just being thorough huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually wake up sounds a little, frankly it sounds a little insulting. It sounds like a small jab, you know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Now you realize that I was paraphrasing like a hypothetical situation when I said the term wake up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You didn't say wake up when we -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't say it. No, yeah, I didn't. No, yeah that is right, I didn't say it and - 0:43:54.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No you didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't - oh yeah that's right. Well, okay fair enough that's critical. What did you call it? Insulting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Insulting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Insulting. Yeah, well. I don't know, a norm's a norm's a norm. You know. I mean, if -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean. 0:44:34.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you haven't internalized a social norm, it is by your own reason, it's sort of your own sleepiness. I mean if you haven't sort of been aware that, you know that being sleepy is in the classic description of things impolite in social interactions then. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We seemed to have moved away a little bit though from what I was thinking that we were talking about was that you saying wake up now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't it to you just now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. But even saying and reflecting back on that previous interaction. It has a little bit of edge to it. 0:45:31.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you actually think that I was saying that to you? Do you think I was saying it to you implicitly or explicitly? Or that there was a component of that, because actually I didn't mean to. What I was saying, I was using it as an ideal case of when I roll my eyes, come on Jim wake up. I'm not; I should be apologizing to you. Take it, its normal. People apologize for being being tired.  I wasn't saying wake up you stupid bastard. And if you got that, I am sorry I didn't mean it that way at all. You know, it's more like the Jewish kind of kvetching, wake up, my god. Now I don't know, I don't know if you like were actually just insulted now, but I certainly didn't mean it that way either. I mean it was, as they would say the ideal typical case. 0:46:34.8</p>

<p>It's just, you know, the rolling my eyes, you know is come on man don't make me go over this, I should be apologizing to you. It's normal to apologize for being sleepy. I have a lousy excuse; I would have a good excuse if I was up taking care of a sick friend. You know, that was a good excuse, I am not going to apologize for that. Okay. I was up last night late, or I might apologize but it might be a social grace kind of apology, rather than, I'm scum apology. So, I hope, in any event I did not mean it in a sense of you were being inattentive. Or I didn't mean it harshly, offensive. If there are degrees of intensity to kind of wake up, I certainly didn't mean it in the sense that you were being inattentive.  There are certainly different degrees of saying wake up. It wasn't a 10. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Hum. But I find myself what is wondering what is going on right now though. 0:47:47.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: well I will tell you what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean, you brought up, I mean you used the word insult twice. And so I felt like god he must have his feeling hurt, I better explain myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, yes okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that clear?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that clear? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I checked in twice on this topic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I asked you and you didn't, you were evasive so I assumed that you wanted to say yes my feelings were hurt but you weren't going to say it, so I felt like oh I see I have to go a little farther here and so he is not going to come out and say it, but its clear that you want something said, so I am going to say it anyway. So I had to go - 0:48:28.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I mean, I don't know. I am just, you're saying a lot, and I am trying to, there seem to be a number of things that I could respond to actually. But I wasn't, to tell you the truth, I wasn't sure at the time that, you know, we have to stop real soon, but I wasn't sure at the time that there wasn't something that I need to have said or wanted you to say. But it did seem to me like you had a very strong, you reacted very quickly to the possibility that you might have hurt my feelings. You wanted to make sure that I didn't misunderstand you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You gave me no reason to indicate otherwise. I asked you twice if you had felt insulted, or implicitly or explicitly you felt like you hesitated. I filled in some blanks and said must be. You hesitated, you chose your language carefully to the extent that you spoke at all. And I realized this must be a possibility, I better [inaudible]. Why wouldn't I do that? I mean. 0:49:42.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I am not sure that I understood that one. Why wouldn't you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this is frustrating. I mean. You bring it up, I respond to it and then when I respond to it, you ask me why I am responding? Is this the end of the story here? I mean. Let me ask you what's going on here, I don't understand, you brought it up. I responded. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now you are asking me about why I responded in the way that I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess there was just something that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean do I get a way out here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A way out, I mean. 0:50:41.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean do I get, I mean is there any response that doesn't generate why did you respond like that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like I am kind of cornering you and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, well yeah hand in the cookie jar is one thing but this just seems down right stupid. I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's interesting because I tell you I feel a little cornered too. And I wonder if there is something going between the two of us, why we have kind of put each other on the spot here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I think you feel cornered like anything you say that I am going to ask about. You respond and I ask about that. And so, where does it end? And I, for my part, feel like you're questioning also in turn what I am asking about. And why am I asking that, and is that really important? 0:51:46.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you seem to skip over, there was one point in the middle of this where it seemed like there was a kind of interesting insight going on. I was going to learn something. You know, I learned a pattern about my slow response time in discussions during frustration. And then all of the sudden we were, we like we lost that moment to this second wave of discussion about apologies and sleepiness and it is just like. How am I not supposed to be frustrated by this? I mean, I don't, [inaudible]. I don't feel like we are cornering each other, I feel like the process is cornering us. Or at least, again, this infinite regress seems to have hazards that are not, are not, if every question generates another question, then we need to stop and pick the berries and smell the roses. 0:52:54.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where does it end when we -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: -have answers instead of a question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is a question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was a question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, sorry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you want to end on that one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lets stop there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perfect. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next Thursday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think next Thursday is good. And maybe we can talk next Thursday about because you said that we should double up again. And we will just scheduling wise we need to do that eventually, but we can talk about that next Thursday. 0:53:26.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Next week might be a good week to do doubles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually I can't do it next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't do doubles next week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't do Wednesday anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But we can talk about when would be good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, so Thursday at 5:00. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'll see you then. 0:53:50.2 </p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tomorrow is my last day at work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm kind of glad about it, but I know it is difficult. You know, because of the clients. It is funny though, between today and tomorrow I'm dividing my good-byes in each group. So I went to two groups and you know, they're mentally retarded, and so I'm talking to them and I really don't know what they were thinking, they just looked at me. And then I explained to them that I am no longer going to be working there, tomorrow is my last day, and it was nice making their acquaintance, and making friends, and that I liked them very much. They just looked at me. So I thought it was comical, for me. But you know, I don't know exactly what they're thinking. [0:01:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had planned to start to tell them last Friday that this was going to be your last week. Did you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some of them. Not all. Because it gets really busy there, so it didn't work out that way. But for the most part, everybody seems to know. A few people come up and say, "Don't leave," or, "Nobody wants you to leave... why are you leaving?" I think tomorrow it will be the hardest. Because Don, who happens to look, or resemble a lot, my brother, like he resembles my brother a lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Out of the crew, he is Asian. He's a big teaser. He likes to make fun and he is always in trouble, major trouble, because he doesn't know the limits, like children. And he just walks up to me and he goes, "Please don't leave, please..." And I'm going, "Oh boy Don, don't do this. Don't do this." So that was kind of tough. But I'm looking forward to it. Because it really does get stressful, like I mentioned before, the nonsense there. It is really unacceptable, unreasonable. But that is how they function. That is not how I see myself functioning in the next five years. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though things stay the same, sometimes they get better, but they do also get worse. But I don't see myself dealing with that stress, that level of stress. I think it will always be there. Because the clients demand it. They have needs that need to be met and it will always be incident in parts. I'm really sad for one of my co-workers. One of the clients, they were bowling, pushed her and she broke her wrist. And she is a woman already in her fifties. So this is not a good time for her to break her wrist.[0:03:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the healing process is different when you're older. So this is the type of job that, well, [inaudible 0:03:37] matters. This is not for me. I'm kind of looking forward to the change. Which is total opposite, senior citizen skilled nursing facility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. What are you going to be doing there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Social work. I think the position is Direct care Assistant. So it is basically advocating the services of, medical services and [inaudible 0:04:15] and services for nursing and so on, so on, so forth. I think it is a good change. </p>

<p>Tuesday was ironic. I don't know if it was because I'm going through PMS or whatever, but for the very first time in a long, long time, I felt lonely, very lonely. I was very sad about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About, it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being alone. I haven't felt like that in a long time. It was ironic about it, I had this terrible, terrible compulsion to call Kate. And I really tormented myself for hours. Telling myself, "Well, why is it a good idea, and why isn't it a good idea?" Sometimes when I'm caught between a rock and a hard place, I don't know what the decision is, I say to myself, "Dear God, if this is meant to be, I'll call her she'll be at the other end of the phone, if not then [inaudible 0:05:22] </p>

<p>So I called and her voice mail came up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hung up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think that was about? The desire to call her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Again, it could be part of the PMS process, the hormones go wacky, I'm sure you know. You have an idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that something that usually happens that you feel really lonely and want to call somebody?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not lonely. Sad. It doesn't happen all the time from month to month. It will happen maybe three or four times a year. Maybe with the change of seasons. I remember years ago, same bus route, same homeless woman, one day I saw her and I started crying. She broke my heart. The same woman I see every morning. I thought where is this coming from? That is when I figured out that I go through this emotional state. [0:06:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think it was a combination of that and my mom's birthday was in May, and Kate sent her flowers. And called her and wished her a happy birthday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess they must have gotten along pretty well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. She really likes my mother very much. so my mother mentioned it to me and for the first time in a long time I didn't feel angry towards her. So I saw her last Friday, "Oh, that is very nice of her." Because my mother loves flowers.</p>

<p>I think it was the fact that she was the one that was mentioned. I was talking to Beth the other day and here's something else. They had a get together. I think that could have been it, because it was after I spoke to Beth. </p>

<p>I have a friend Britney who is not happy with me. Because she took on a lover years ago, and we were really close, and then the lover was very rude something like Fiona and I voiced my opinion and Britney didn't care for that and she just doesn't want to be bothered. And Britney was there and Elle was at the party. It was a party for someone that came from Peru. Beth's brother and Beth's lover have a group of friends in Peru, and coincidentally Elle is part of that group. [0:08:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So Beth was telling me the festivities. I really felt out of character but, I thought, "People change. The times are changing." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was out of character?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They had a stripper for the birthday girl. And she was really raunchy from what Beth tells me. To the point where I won't even tell you what Beth said the woman was doing because it is really like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry. I'm listening just not going, "Oh my God."</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is such a bad feeling. So I guess the fact that I saw, I envision everyone there I understood why I wasn't there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it was a person that I really didn't know. It was someone that Britney and Elle knew. So it wasn't like I was celebrating with them. And the fact that it is a known fact that Fiona, Britney and Fiona are communicating more and I'm not in their good graces, so... you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But do you feel like you wish that you were there, or that you had been able to go or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. What I thought about was... It made me sad that we had gotten to this point in life, where we had our differences. But not that I wish I was there. I think it was more a sadness that it is because that we have had our differences that I wasn't there.[0:10:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were talking about feeling really lonely and wanting to call Elizabeth and maybe it had to do with the PMS and maybe it had to do with her having sent your mother flowers, but it sounds like there just could be more in it, like what you're talking about right now that you had observed. That there was this gathering and you understood why you weren't there, but were feeling sad about the fact of having come to that. It sounds like you were imagining people there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is something that I can imagine goes along with the feeling of kind of wistfulness. Like you were imagining what was going on, who was there, what the party was like and it is like looking in from the outside. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I, just in thinking about our, the things that we have been talking about the last couple of weeks. You know, you've talked about not liking the idea or fearing the idea really of growing older and not having someone, and being alone. And you're leaving your current job, which is a relief in a lot of ways but it is going from something familiar to something unfamiliar. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That is going to be scary.[0:11:51]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like last week, you also mentioned that you were thinking ahead to the fact that when you and I stop working together you won't be talking about a lot of the things that we have been talking about. Because you know yourself and you know that you're just probably not talk about those things. And I could imagine that would also contribute to a sense of being alone. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is a lot of things going on actually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, this one time, yes. But what I am puzzled about is why that need, there was a great need to call Kate and in all honesty, you can be honest with me, I'm being honest with myself. It was to see if- it is really weird- to see if we could pick up where we left off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that weird?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I feel she is not the person for me. Because although she was very supportive and we worked hard to make the relationship work, there is a level of trust that I don't have in her because she makes excuses for things. Simple things, she'll make up a white lie. I know for a fact because of my break up with Willa I need someone who is up front and not feel like I can't hear the truth from that individual no matter what it is.[0:13:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Well, it makes sense on the level. On the level of saying to yourself, "I don't think this is the right person for me because..." You know, you can list the reasons based on your experience. That might be part of you that keeps you from getting back together with her or the one side of the ambivalence. But the other side, it sounds like was just feeling that you really wanted to connect and were wishing that you could pick up where you left off. I mean, it might not make sense...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you're feeling lonely and yearning things don't necessarily make sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That didn't. It caused a lot of conflict. Good things, they weren't bad things but they were negative things. And I remember sitting in the living room going, "Why am I doing this? Why am I going through this? You know you're lonely." There was this tremendous need to accomplish that. But then I felt I shouldn't, because I know she is with someone. And from my understanding, living together. And that is opening up even more trouble for myself. And interfering and you know, that is not the way I would like things to be done in general, to myself or somebody wanted to be in my relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, when you were feeling this need, this need that was obviously strong enough that it made you actually pick up the phone and dial, I guess I would just like to hear more about that. Like what it felt like at that moment in time when you felt that pull. It sounds like you tried to talk yourself out of it and couldn't really.[0:15:46]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt desperate. I felt desperate like I had to do it. I even rehearsed in my mind what I was going to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you going to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, "I just called to see how you're doing. I understand that you sent my mom flowers and I think that was very nice of you because you know how she likes flowers. How are you doing? Are you happy? How is your daughter?" And in my mind it was like, "I'll call you but..." Almost a point to find out if she was happy in the relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess part of it is, maybe part of that finding out is to see the answer, or feel the answer. Because sometimes people can tell you whatever they want to tell you but it is what you get from it, the way they say it, that tells you more or less. To see what the answer would be and maybe since I was feeling lonely and part of me was saying, "It would be nice to pick up where we left off, see what would transpire or what would come out of that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, when you've got that kind of pull to do something so that you rehearse what you're going to say before hand, in my experience there is usually there are hopes that go along with that. And I'm wondering what you were hoping she might say in response. And what you were hoping for in terms of her being happy. Were you hoping that she is happy, or that she is not so happy? [0:17:52]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well one time before when I think she first got together with this woman, she had called me. So I was polite to her and I didn't want to really hear from her, so I said, "How are you doing?" She says, "I'm doing OK." So she made it a point for me to understand, yes she was with someone, but it is not the same. That the person was good to her, but it is not the same. Her words were, "Not what is was with you." So I guess I was hoping to hear the same thing. Hoping for her to still be in that state of mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where that she would be interested in also resuming her relationship with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know about interested in resuming it, but feeling the love she said she had for me, still feeling it. Because I guess at this point I've come to terms with that she's been with someone. I think it is for about a year. Could have been over a year. So she could be at the frame of mind where, "it was really rocky with Tess and I'm not going to give this up for something that I might just go back to being rocky again." But as I'm sitting here thinking, I think I wish to hear her, "Yeah, I'm happy. Not like I used to be, but..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know what I'm hearing, an acknowledgment, well, like you've said, an acknowledgment that she still has those feelings of love for you.[0:20:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems really powerful, what you're describing. I mean the way you describe it is really evocative and I'm feeling like I have some sense of what it must have been like to be, when you were wanting to call her. Because it sounds like that compulsion that you were feeling was, in some way, a real yearning or real need to know that someone cared about you in a very powerful way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I didn't think of it as finding out whether someone cared about me, maybe that would be it but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how did you think about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure how to describe it. I guess to hear... maybe you're right. To hear someone say that they still feel for me. Because she used to say, passionately, she was in a lot of pain when I would break up with her, so obviously she was very emotionally involved. And I needed for her to, needed to hear that she still was, wanted her to validate that yes it is true. Because I guess I compare it with me and Elle, although she's such a mess up. She'll promise things and lead me on and not carry through and my feelings haven't changed for her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who, Elle or Kate?[0:22:28]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Elle. My feelings haven't changed for her. So I guess Kate was the only one that really declared her love for me, so I guess that is why she is the one that I wanted to call. Because when we broke up, for the last time, three months later she was already with someone else. And I was kind of like, "I don't understand how you could be with someone in such a short time with the type of love you said you had for me." I think I spoke of that. That baffles me, plus a few months before that, she was with someone and she was intimate with them, and at the same time telling me that she was in love, she didn't want this to end and I remember telling her, "How could you say that to me and you were with someone else?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, through therapy I realized that if you keep a person at arm's distance, it does things to them. It makes them frustrated, it makes them wonder how much you really love them and if this lasts long enough, what they do at the end is they lash out, and they turn around and try to hurt you. All the times that they tolerated and were patient. So it is, I understand it in that aspect. Well, she did what she did in her own defense. To help her come along.[0:24:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I remember when you were telling me about, some time ago when you were telling me about how the break up happened, or the sequence of events that she was with somebody while you were breaking up, and you know, three months later she was with somebody. The way you described it, it sounded even beyond that you didn't understand it, but almost that you felt kind of annoyed that she had been saying this one thing to you and doing this other thing that didn't seem to fit together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But now I can look at it and say, "Well, there is a possibility. And I believe that, her being a human being And being in her shoes, that if I was with someone like me, who was very up And down, mood swings And sometimes warm and sometimes cold, because I remember saying, "I show my affection in a child-like fashion," I can understand her going through this emotional roller coaster with me. Seeing such good parts of me And then Seeing such distant, ungiving parts of me. That would confuse anybody. So I understand it in that way. [0:26:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like, still, something in common with the period when you were feeling angry with her or annoyed with her about how things worked out, hence now, when you're looking back, And you can understand a bit more how you were feeling this yearning recently to hear some validation from her that what is in common there is the idea that she says that she loves you that she really does. And that sticks somehow or stays somehow. I don't know if what I've just said sounds very clear at all, but it seems like back then And now the thing that is in common is wanting to know in some way, or feel sure of in some way, that she still has that level of caring about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. In a different way. Yes. At that time, last year, was more tangible meaning it was happening. In a sense that she was saying one thing And doing another. And I was, "How could you say all these things to me? You were with someone else." And now it is like a need to, for it to be validated.[0:27:45]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what if you got that validation? What if you had had the conversation with her on the phone And she said that she still feels the way that she described a while back that she is happy but, she is happy, things are OK, but it is not as good as when she was with you. How would that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would feel like she was telling the truth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how would it make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if this would be a feeling, but it would make me feel like I wasn't lied to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reassured?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Reassured.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it feel good, do you think?[0:28:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I think it would. Because I know what it is to love someone And not be with them, And yet be with someone else, And still feel that level of love for another person. So if she were to sort of [inaudible 0:29:22] you know we get along. But it is not the same. It would feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. How is it for you in general when people express loving you or caring about you, things like that. Whoever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is uncomfortable for me. Like today, Don, I panicked. It is like, "Oh, Don, please don't do this." But he's mentally retarded, he's like a child. He doesn't understand what I'm saying. And he is expressing his sadness, his need to see me come back. In other words, he was trying to tell me, "I'm going to really miss you." And I'm thinking, that was today And that was more immediate. </p>

<p>When people- It is weird, my mother, up until a certain age she was kind of affectionate, but my mother is kind of cold, you know? Not just with me, in general. Beth too. Although sometimes we look at each other And you can tell that we are very loving toward each other. But it is always at arm's distance. </p>

<p>It does, but it makes me a little bit uncomfortable, quite uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is almost like, I always doubt it or I am suspicious of it. Because sometimes when, say I'm not at work, people say, "I missed you."" I'm just like, "Yeah." I read into it, I don't... Right away I don't feel it completely, but I feel, yeah right, they're just saying that. I think to describe it, it is hard for me to see people as being genuine. I see what is happening but yet I always try to see what is behind it.[0:32:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why would you doubt people when they say something like, "We miss you," or express caring about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that the case with Don, that you thought, "Yeah, sure."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I felt that then, because... because he is like a child. He really is. And I always said that child's innocence is the best thing to behold, because they don't know malice, they only know what they feel. I always said that, even as a young person. The best thing in the world God ever created was children's innocence. And people say children are cruel to each other, but they're not, they're just being honest. Which is what grown ups have a problem with. Major. Major problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They would rather ignore the green piece of meet in your teeth...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Laughter]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is true! And hope that it will go away And let it stay there for a few minutes before someone actually... Where as a child would say, "EW! Look!" Isn't that true?[laughter] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I always ask people, "If you see something in my teeth, please tell me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm the same way. Be honest. If someone is, something is hanging out of their nose, people just ignore it And get grossed out. What I always do is I look around, And if there is a tissue, in the conversation, I pick up a box of tissues And say, "You need to use this," in the conversation, make it as smooth as possible. But people aren't basically like that, they'll just let it there. So it is a level of mistrust I guess. [0:34:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just thinking about, "Ew!"</p>

<p>PATIENT: "Ew!" That is exactly what they would do. So Don didn't make me uncomfortable because I know whatever he is poring out or expresses is all he knows.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there was something that you said was uncomfortable about it though. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He would have made me cry if he would have kept it up. He would have made me cry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because?</p>

<p>PATIENT: because it is separation. I like him. He looks like my brother. Shorter. And they all have their own personalities, but he is so annoying, not that he annoyed me ever, but the stories that I've heard of him in action, it is almost comical. So I have grown to be fond of him because of who Don is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it occurs to me that what you said about adults not being honest And not being straight forward is really very true. But there are a lot of times when people say something And they do mean it. And it is honest. And you know how you said that if Don had kept it up it would have made you cry. Because it is separation And it is real And that makes it poignant. And I wonder if it is not safer sometimes when people say something sometimes like, "Oh we missed you," And doubt it. Because what if it is real? Then there is something more powerful in it, poignant maybe. I don't know if that makes sense. </p>

<p>What I'm trying to say is that if you believe what someone is saying, like when Don says, "Please don't go, I'm going to miss you," if you believe in it, it touches you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Inside. AND if you doubt it And think they're probably not telling the truth And there is something else behind it, And it doesn't touch you in the same way.[0:37:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yes. Yes, because my defense mechanism with him was, "Don't do this." Kind of like didn't abruptly cut him short, but I cut him short. Because I avoided him, getting in there. But it is really hard to think that someone can walk up to me in a corridor in a building And make me start crying. That is kind of like, a bad situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Again, I really have a problem with Seeing how people see me at that point. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think people would think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We went down this street before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I mean in this specific situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what could they think? Don made Tess cry because he told her to stay, And she's sad. That is all they can think. They can't think that I'm weak. They would just think, "He really is sad that she's leaving." That certain people are saying goodbye to her And they don't want her to leave it is hurting her. It is not a decision that she is so happy about. She has sadness. That is all they can think. because he's not hurting me, I'm not angry. He is just saying don't go. And I don't want to go from him. If I could I would take him with me. But that is not how it works. Not further developing a relationship with a body, is sad. Because it is fun dealing with them, And their antics. [0:39:46}</p>

<p>So what could they think? Spend the whole day bawling And wiping my nose And wiping my eyes, causing a chain reaction. But what could they think? They can't think something terrible of me. But it makes it easier to go through. Tomorrow is another day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of why I ask about how it feels when people express caring about you, or things of that sort, just has to do with the fact that we are ending And separating from one another And I wondered how it will play out here in terms of how we say to each other about ending. And I've asked you a few times what you thought it would be like. You haven't asked me though, how I feel about our ending. I don't know if you're curious about it. It is something that we haven't talked about [0:41:18]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is funny because, you said that And I said, "I haven't even thought about it." But I did. You triggered something there. I did think about it. Because I remember thinking, "I wonder what he thinks? If I am OK, if I'm going to be OK. Should I not continue?" Yes, I thought about how you felt about it ending.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should I say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I definitely think that you'll be OK. Because I think that you have got going for you a lot of strength And a lot of sense And a lot of courage to really look at yourself. Which we talked about before is not a common thing. People don't often want to look into a mirror And look at themselves And see what they can do about themselves to try to help themselves or change their lives. I think you have all of that going for you,. And that you'll be OK. I think that what we've done over the course of time that we've been working together has been hard fro you in various ways, And you didn't really end there, doing it, And I feel like I've been in there doing it too. And that part of what has made that, I don't know what the word is, possible? Easy? Gratifying? Something like that. </p>

<p>Part of what has made it work for me, is that you have been in there, you have been willing to do the work And that you've, I really feel like we were working together on something, something important. And I'm going to miss you, because I'm going to miss our working together.[0:44:18] </p>

<p>You know, we have to stop because that is the contract we had, the arrangement we had, you know in the same way that you are transitioning from one job to the next, you know it is something that is necessary. I still feel like it would be really nice if we could continue working together, I would like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that a possibility?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not. No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just kind of curios. I didn't even think about that. I knew it was short term therapy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I will wonder about you And how you are doing And hope that things are going well for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They'll go, day by day. So you think like a human being?</p>

<p>[both speakers laugh loudly]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not how I see you thinking as a profession. And treating me how you think the people who you either overestimate or underestimate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were thinking something different from what I just said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I envision you thinking of me as someone who you are working with on that level, but what you have expressed is more on a, not a personal, but a human level, an emotional level. Because you said, I'm going to miss you. And I think for the first time I see a stranger or someone who really is on a professional level, say it And I understand it. I understand it. I have been at jobs before And heard, "Oh, we're going to miss you." But I've never seen it before as something that was genuine. Something that has to be said. Because you work with this person, And to me, work is like living with people because that is where you spend so much time. So again it is that suspicious nature in me, you only say that because you have to. And you didn't have to say that. [0:47:14]</p>

<p>Because we also shared a lot of private things. Or, I shared a lot of private things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the other part of what I wanted to say too, has to do with that. Which is that I feel like you came here thinking this is therapy, this is what therapy is about, talking about things, And I want to make use of therapy And have kind of a determination to make use of it. </p>

<p>But that doesn't explain all of what has happened here, because you have also had to struggle with feeling safe sometimes, feeling unsafe sometimes, taking risks, trusting, all sorts of stuff. And it hasn't been easy for you, I think, And I have felt, I never know quite how to... what word to use for this, And honored partly describes that, or privileged that you trusted me enough to let me in to some things that are very personal, some things that have been very painful. Because I know it hasn't been easy, And it is not something that I take lightly, the fact that you took those chances.[0:49:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I can understand. That is nice to hear. Those are nice things to hear. [inaudible 0:49:54] Feel like I played a little from work, this. But you're right, I'll be alright. Plus I'm PMS-ing, I really am. But I know, I know that you are absolutely right, I will be OK. This has been well worth it for me, it really has. I am also looking forward to the break. I'm looking forward to the break.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can understand that, but it is also good to hear, on my end, that it feels like this has been worth it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really has. I feel like it is a beginning, a small beginning, but it is a beginning. That is how I feel. See how it evolves. Do we have much time left of very little?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually, we have none left.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. OK. Til next week. I would have started my new job on Monday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, so you just have the weekend in between.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, so I'll see you next Thursday then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today I don't have change. Do you have ten dollars or...? I could have sworn I had a ten dollar bill this morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I don't, but if you want, however you want to do it between next week And now...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'll give you twenty now, And I'll give you forty next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See you then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, bye bye.[0:52:42]</p>

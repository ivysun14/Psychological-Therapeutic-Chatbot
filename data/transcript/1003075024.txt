<p><b>DR:</b> What are you taking Cymbalta for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For my depression, and then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excuse me a sec, I'm going to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Leave the recorder on.  Nope, they didn't, they called the wrong person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, um, I have the fibromyalgia, so it, it's really helping both things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, depression and fibromyalgia.  And, what does depression do to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I get very teary eyed, I get, and I get very agitated —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes, um, but I get real, real, the anxiety is just almost, like it just, it just totally overtakes me.  I just have racing thoughts and I can't, and you know, sometimes I get chest pain with it, I just, you know, I just can't, I can't function.  I can't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Get anything done, I can't, and, um, I'm done, I'm not, like it, it, upset extremely easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, um, short tempered, ir, uh, irritable, that sort of thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not so much short tempered, but I just feel like my feelings hurt very easily and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, um, and I take saying things so personally —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and, and then I get a very unconfident about things —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, I just internalize things a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about your energy level?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I get the fatigue gets almost overwhelming —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes, to the point that, I've had times I've been so tired and stuff, I just didn't really care if I took the next breath or not.  It would be okay if I didn't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I just thought, you know, the fatigue is just extremely over, overwhelming.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The depression can be pretty painful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And I've had it every since I was in grade school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been out of, I don't know if I ever told you, I was in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I had so bad I didn't go to school for three months.  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I did not know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just been, I mean it, it's been a very long time and, I mean, since I been coming to you and I think we talked about this before about, you know, before I got into the primary care and they got, okay, you're better now.  You go off your medicine.  And I'm good, all right for a year, a year and a half, and then I start sliding back down and, and you and I have talked about it.  I just, I don't want to go there any more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It just is, it's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.  You've got to stay on your medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I mean, it's not going away.  This is not situational.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not nor —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I finally figured that out [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you've got a family history.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're, you're at risk for recurrences.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And I've got diabetes and hypothyroidism and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got sleep apnea, and all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] for have causes depression and has depression and that sounds like, I got it coming and going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm, what's been going on recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, things have kind of calmed down with the kids.  Um, things are starting to get better with my mom.  You know, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] are start, are going to get married in September and that's going okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm been leaving, you know, a lot of things up to them and I've decided, and I think we were so busy last time, talking about some of my issues, that I been going to counseling every week because I just felt like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I know you don't have time to talk to me once a week and hold my hand and, you know, and I found a really good counselor.  His name is [NAME OTHER], over in, um, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you want his telephone number?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's [DEIDENTIFIED], and, um, I got, I got it in my cell phone.  But it, you know, it's, it's been good.  [NAME OTHER]'s going a few times with me and that's been good —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it, and he actually likes him and you know he's, can be a little difficult.  And, I, it's [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, you know, it's just so many emotions with my mom and it, my sister and, I haven't heard from my sister.  She's called a couple other people but she hasn't called me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't think she is, and, you know, and, oh, my gosh, just dealing with my mom's finances and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All the, it, I mean, it's been so many things, it's just been such a mess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has the house sold?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that house, you know, it went up on market, foreclosed [DATE], and we had that short window of time to get all of her junk out of there, and then it, it didn't sell and now they've condemned it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, you know, but [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER]'s name is on that, um, deed and on that loan and I made the mistake, one day, of going back over there, telling to see how things were, and because I knew they had been talking about condemning it and see if they put the signs up —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they hadn't, well, this big dumpster was in that yard.  And, you know, we never did get to get, go through every single thing —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know me, I got to do everything.  And I stood out there and I thought, now I need to go through —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dumpster.  And, I'm going, it, I don't know, that was a very hard time, so it was like, I don't, I don't, I don't ride down that street any more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like it's just, what can I do?  It's over.  I got to draw a line with it.  It's over.  You know, we did the best we could do with the time we have, so, and I got the most important things out, I think, so, I mean, there was an attic full of stuff we never even got to touch, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  I got a, I got a let it go and move on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's over.  So I don't, I don't even ride by there.  If I don't see it, it's kind of like I don't think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I'm just trying to deal with all of her financial mess and that's just finally beginning to come to an end.  Thank goodness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your energy now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's up and down.  You know, some days it's, it's good, some days it's not.  Um, my one, my like my, I went to the pulmonologist Friday and he said I was doing really good, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My thought was, you know, my asthma was doing really good, so that's a good thing.  But I had a spell at work about, it's been two Friday's ago, and, uh, one more problem to deal with.  He's got to, sending me to the neurologist because he thinks I have vertebral vas, basilar insufficiency.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, I went to go turn my head and I got dizzy and I got completely numb and tingling throughout my whole body.  And I felt like I was trembling, and I was with somebody else and she said that I flushed from my neck up and she could tell that I was unsteady, that, well, I was close to the wall and she said I fell back into the wall.  And I thought it was my blood sugar, and I checked my blood sugar and it was fine.  And, you know, I didn't feel good for right a while, and I had trouble when I got that initial dizzy and that whole tingly feeling?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I, my vision was not for, there for a couple seconds I didn't see anything.  And, um, so he thinks when I turn my head it occluded that artery in the back of my neck that goes into my head.  So it's like, oh, my gracious, that's one more problem to deal with.  Because that ain't cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I don't know.  So, it's, kind of, I got to just, I, I just got to go to another level.  I had to realize I just can't do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I did some reading up on, I mean, consequences of a stroke, and that's not cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he was saying, you know, because I've had the diabetes, it's about 10, 12 years now, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That may impact it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've had high cholesterol, and then when I wasn't, when I was just going to my primary care, they weren't treating that like it's supposed to been, and just goes on and on and like, well, this is like, not cool and I'm just glad I wasn't driving because I didn't, I would have had an accident.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, or if I'd been going down steps or something like that, it would not have been good, so, uh, now, I guess it was my wake up call?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, when I did some reading on it, I mean, it's, because it said if it was due to atherosclerosis, that, you know, they treat it with aspirin or Coumadin, so instead of taking 1 baby aspirin, I said, well, it won't hurt me, I'll just take, I'll take four of them and maybe that will keep my blood thin enough so it won't happen again, because I want to tell you this, scared the hell out of me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like 40 times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's not good.  I don't scare that easily.  It's like, I mean, people that, you know, and like this, you know?  I'm the one that stops off at [DEIDENTIFIED] to get gas if I need it.  That's not a good area, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I don't scare easily.  And it's like, that really scared me.  It scared me real bad, so, it's just like nothing I've ever had before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who are you going to go see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my doctor, I got it in here.  I want to say [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he's over at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], no, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he a neurologist?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's a neurologist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'm not familiar with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, I'm, I can't get an appointment until July, but [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said he was going to call him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, I think the, the thing is, I need to stay calm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think, stay calm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take, take your medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING] and right, and take that damn Lipitor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, uh, no try to limit the stress and conflicts with people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And be able to say no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And when I went to counseling this morning, that was like, one of the things it's like, we got to work on —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Boundaries.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got to start saying no.  My cousin wanted me to take [NAME OTHER] up to, up to, um, her house.  And, I found out, I've had all this trouble with my shoulders and I went to the doctor, just thinking it was some bursitis and he goes, well, you got severe arthritis in both of your shoulders.  You're going to need a shoulder replacement in a while, and I'm going, oh, that's not cool.  And, it's not cool at all.  And I just went —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, to, it's been difficult, you know, because that has been like, and at times getting, I got a shirt on one morning and couldn't get the damn thing off, because my shoulders were so stiff and everything and it was, the shirt was too tight and I went, you know, it's not cool and I'm here by myself and [NAME OTHER]'s not here now, what am I going to do?  So I just had to wear the darn old thing and put a sweater on top.  Like, oh, like, not good.  So I said let's go to physical therapy.  He says, you're beyond any phys, physical therapy, it's not going to help you now [LAUGHING].  Okay.  Still that keeps piling up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's always something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's always something.  Hm, so I was like, okay.  Whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you still feel the medicine is, is helping with your anxiety and depression?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, lord, yeah.  Like, this past week I had those two days that I didn't have it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I ran out and it's like, oh, my gosh, no.  I got to have, I feel like I'm drug addict.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got to have those pills.  Got to have those pills.  So, no, as more things come up, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there's always going to be something, no, no doubt about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you've got to learn, uh, you, we can't rely just on medicines.  You've got to learn to set some limits and say no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And that's, that's one of the things.  And like when my cousin got so mad at me and I said, I can't because you've seen her before, she's, she'll be [AGE] next month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, getting her in the car is like pulling teeth.  She won't help herself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I thought, and besides that, I'm not her power of attorney.  And he says, oh, it will be worth your while in money.  Uh, no money can, that's how my shoulders —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was, I had brought her home at Christmas with my mom and it's like, and we went to go get her in the car and it took [NAME OTHER] and I 45 minutes to get her in the car, on a cold December night.  That's not cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then it's like, no.  And, it just exasperated, this shoulder condition —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's like, no.  I'm the one that suffers.  No.  She's your problem.  So, he'll be mad.  So what [LAUGHING].  And then mom, you know, when I brought her with home last weekend and she says, you're not going to bring your [NAME OTHER], and it's like, I got the guilt trip because I wasn't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's like, no.  I can't handle her.  No.  And then when I found out about this thing and, you know, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is like, he's a really smart man, you know, and it's like, okay.  I guess pulling and tugging on [NAME OTHER] ain't one of the things in my menu.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm sorry, but, so, but I knew I [INAUDIBLE] it's one of my big things, isn't it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely.  And you're never too old to learn.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING] okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For years, you, you've developed some, some bad habits along the way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I certainly have.  I certainly have.  Um, and you know, my mom was never able to say no, and look at —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The mess she got into.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Never able to say no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But we've, we've ha, have a fax from your pharmacy, which we'll fax back —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For the Cymbalta —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we can take care of you there, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, anything else going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  All right.  I'm, I haven't used, now I did have to use some Ativan last week —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, no, I'm just, I'm having trouble with my mask on my, from my —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

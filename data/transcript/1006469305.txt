<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. I’m very upset. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Why are you] (ph) upset? [00:01:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) (inaudible at 00:02:10) like me. I guess I want it in a certain way. (Pause) And that’s a very upsetting thing to want because sometimes it seems like I’m getting it and then it’s very hard to not want it more. (Pause) And then when I’m not getting it, it’s very hard to focus on anything else. [00:03:16] (Pause) </p>

<p>I can’t seem to let it go. I also can’t seem to settle in to how bad it feels because (ph) I don’t want to smell my own s*** or something. [00:04:48]</p>

<p>And sometimes I hate you for making me feel this way. (Pause) </p>

<p>Why did you take so long to reply to my last e-mail? [00:08:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Well, I’m not going to answer that, but I’m sorry I should have responded sooner. [00:09:23] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. Yeah. You should have. There’s no need for me to like go through the compulsive e-mail checking. Ever. Especially not now. Yeah. [00:10:17] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You sound pretty pissed. [00:11:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It’s important. (Pause) So sad to be compartmentalized, but I can’t compartmentalize you. Or [let go for a little while and I can’t let go of you] (ph). [00:13:39] (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I (inaudible at 00:19:25) to putting you through the compulsive e-mail checking thing at a time when I could and should have known already that you were having a hard time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:20:14) to you that it feels like I have to struggle (Pause) It occurred to me that I didn’t ask anything from you and that maybe you weren’t sure what to say. I think that’s okay to communicate to me. (Pause) What’s upsetting is that it upsets me. What’s also upsetting is that it upsets me. [00:21:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think I’m pretty (inaudible at 00:22:03) Your being upset by how upset you are now. You can’t be more easy about this. But it also (pause) –because I think at some level it builds like a kind of (inaudible at 00:22:35) questionable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, first it felt like a desperate clinging to the way that you want the relationship to be or like, sort of putting me in my place. Like at first in the long two days. (Pause) And then it changed to like, “Maybe you just don’t know what to say.” And then it changed to like, “Maybe you were busy.” And you’ll get to it when you get to it. [00:24:02] </p>

<p>I don’t know if any of those (inaudible 00:24:13). Like maybe they all are, but I don’t want to make you feel that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, you have a pretty broad range of reactions, I think. (Pause) And the first one, you’re upset that things aren’t the way you want them to be between us, which in a way I imagine us we’re not on the same page, we’re not in this together in a way it feels we should be. [00:26:01]</p>

<p>And then the second one, I guess (inaudible at 00:26:15) me kind of cruelly showing you how things are or at least hopefully (ph) what they—cruelly really. Putting you in your place, that’s a cruel thing to do. [00:26:30]</p>

<p>And then third one, and my first thought is that you’re rescuing me a little bit</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, sometimes you don’t know what to say. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t like the way I imagine it might make you feel. If I only thought the first two – I don’t like the way it makes me feel. Maybe I’m not feeling… [00:27:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don’t think (inaudible at 00:27:34) how we see that. I think you rescuing me is as much for your sake as it is for mine. You don’t want to be in this with somebody who’d do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don’t. (Pause) Sometimes I’m not sure I want to be in this with (pause) any of the ways it is except for the way that I want it to be. (Pause) Even if you are compassionate and kind. [00:29:00] (Pause) </p>

<p>You know? (Pause) It’s upsetting because [I feel like they’re not here] (ph) for me unless I get (pause) the specific kind of display of love that I want. [00:32:23] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think maybe it’s a little different. Maybe I’m wrong, but (inaudible at 00:33:11) that there’s not enough here, but that what’s here is overshadowed by how painful and maybe anxious it is when it’s not the way you want. But it feels like nothing can make up for that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think there’s been very little settling into—it’s not how I want it to be and nothing can make up for that. There’s a lot of like, “How could I (inaudible at 00:34:30) equally painful, I think, and anxious but energy (inaudible at 00:34:36) a little bit of a different kind of energy. </p>

<p>It feels like an endless, like a perpetual spinning (inaudible at 00:34:52) whereas the other one feels (pause) like something that could pass. Like whether I decide that it’s too painful and it passes that way and I leave or it passes and I stay. So emotion oriented with relating to it is—it doesn’t leave any room for…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of anti-settling. [00:35:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Unsettling. Anti-settling. Yeah, like it keeps me from settling or it feels like it keeps me from growing or (inaudible at 00:36:13) or growing with you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like it takes up too much energy and it’s too… yeah. On Thursday I think I realized that mostly what I felt in all the things I felt. Then you shared with me what you did is like really really strong clinging to it and like fear that—and like weird pressure that I need to react in such a way that you would do it again. [Or I feel that] (ph) fear that I wouldn’t react the right way and that you would retreat. [00:37:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think I received it in other ways too but yeah. I think there’s just a lot of (pause) wanting more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had opened up and if you sort of breathed wrong I would clam back up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:38:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have five minutes. (Pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: George (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:43:22) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I guess we’ll have to] (ph) see what happens. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:50) </p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________<p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it draws more people, even though they should stay in the fucking AC.</p>

<p>I parked almost near the hospital. It’s also probably because they’re doing all that construction that never ends, putting cones everywhere.</p>

<p>How’s it going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You look nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I missed you. (chuckles nervously)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it like, couple weeks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was awesome! I mean – not that I didn’t see you! I was like, “Aw, fuck, I hope something doesn’t happen” or something. And there’s nothing, it’s exactly the same, so it’s good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a relief, in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it’s a total relief, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:00:42)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know how things are, really. On the one hand, when I feel down, then I have these empirical pieces of evidence on my plate. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>My sleep is totally fucked, that’s the one thing that’s totally fucked. I’m basically staying up all night and then sleeping until noon.</p>

<p>I think that might not change until I start exercising more – or, well, at all, or something else starts to happen to give me a little more structure.</p>

<p>It’s a transitional time. My mind’s awake. I’m up at night. I’m not even anxious – maybe I am, but not in a way that feels anxious. I’m thinking. I’m up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like that was more so in the last couple weeks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Less than now.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s been this way for at least several weeks (inaudible at 00:02:01).</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>My website’s done, tentatively. I was going to send it to you. I don’t know if that’s—I don’t know if you’d want to—I don’t know. I don’t know how appropriate that is; because I’d be very curious, obviously, to see what you think.</p>

<p>I think it’s a little wordy. Everyone seems to really like it, but I’m concerned that it’s a little wordy. But then I know that that’s how I am: I feel like I’m wordy when I know that I’m not, I guess, a lot of times. I might tweak that a little bit. The only other thing I’m going to do is I’m going to make a video or something, like a very brief.</p>

<p>The trick is – I was telling my friends – the wordy thing; most of them didn’t think it was wordy at all. [00:03:04] But for me, it was like, well... I do feel like, “What qualifies me to be a life coach?” I feel like I need to explain a little bit.</p>

<p>Then a few of my friends were like, “No, you don’t.” (laughs) They were like, “Have you looked at some of these other websites?” Their bios are just general: “X has been a motivational speaker for ten years!” but it doesn’t say anything specific. That’s like me saying, “I’ve been a life coach all my life, I just didn’t know it!” So I don’t know. I might tweak some of that.</p>

<p>So that’s done. I think a big part of what’s happening now is now I’m scared. I mean, really, I guess I could launch it if I wanted to. You can always tweak your website. [00:04:01]</p>

<p>I keep telling people, “I want to get all my ducks in a row and make sure…” What else is there to get? People like the website. I mean, yeah, I might tweak it, but there’s no reason it can’t be up. Now I’m scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So scared of what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the biggest transition in my life. This is huge. Everything is changing right now. I played my first solo show – did I talk to you about that? I was going to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You were going to do it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was phenomenal. It was fucking amazing. I played a few by myself, and then Stu (sp) came up with the guitar. It was fucking awesome. It was amazing. I didn’t feel fucking nervous. I was very in-control of myself. Most of the people there were there to see me. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s the first time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Played by myself?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I did it once before, once before. But you know why that doesn’t count?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I’m pretty sure that was the night I got arrested. Yeah, I think that was. I could be wrong.</p>

<p>I did it once. It was also acoustic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s what I’m remembering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was acoustic. And I guess because I don’t even—at this point, even though that wasn’t that long ago at all, that seems like such a different time, now. I was super-fucking-nervous. I wasn’t who I am now. People enjoyed it, but I was—I didn’t… it wasn’t the kind of thing where I did it and was like, “Oh, whoa, yeah, I did it! Now let me do more!” [0:06:01] I was glad it was over. I didn’t want to do it again.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t wait to do this again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:06:08) this was your first show in this self.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:06:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like this band is the first band with this self. It was awesome. It sounded good. I liked everything about it. I’m ready to do more.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>What were you saying?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re saying how this is a turning point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, the band stuff. My relationship with my family now has really has—the way I am, just a switch.</p>

<p>Like with my mom, I really am not interacting with her much. Today, she left me a message, “Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?” [00:07:03] I feel bad. Something in me is done with making small talk; just done.</p>

<p>So that’s totally changed. You name it. How I’m thinking about women and everything – where I want to live, even. How I want my life to be. It’s all pretty awesome, I think, but it’s a lot.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this business is—in a way, you’re just describing as something that makes sense given what’s been there all along. In another way, it’s a really different venture for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, very different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very different chapter (crosstalk at 00:08:12) thinking about this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In a way, that’s how I know – actually, I was just thinking this now – that’s how I know it’s the right move. Normally, I wouldn’t be this scared, per se. Even when I’ve had teaching jobs, I get nervous – the normal nervous you get when you have a new job, especially when you have to talk in front of people and all that.</p>

<p>With this one, I can already envision myself tapping into the part of me that’s a good speaker and motivational and fucking life coach. When I envision that, it almost makes me feel shy or something. I feel like, “Wow. I can really probably do this really well.” [00:09:00]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>I looked at the office space. I remembered that in San Diego, when I was down there with Jerry (sp), we really needed to use the bathroom. I walked by this place – I didn’t know what it was, but I saw a lot of people. There was no security. I was like, “I’m just going to walk in here.”</p>

<p>I walked in. As I start trying to find the bathroom, some girl just came up. She’s like, “Do you have an appointment?” I was like, “Oh, no, I’m sorry.” It turned out that this was some common work sharing office.</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered that. I looked it up and as I was looking it up, another good thing that happened, I had an appointment with this girl Isabella (sp), who’s been in the scene a long time, who wants to help manage my music – which is really great. [00:10:01]</p>

<p>She happens to use an office like that, in the Square. There’s one called like the Bar (sp) in the Square. I was there Monday. It was like, “This is exactly what I’m talking about. This is what I need.”</p>

<p>So even there, then I had this manifestation of like, “Wow. This is kind of amazing. Not only for life coaching. I could come here and write.” It’s like guilting yourself, in a good way. It’s like, “Well, I’m paying for this space,” and it’s an amazing—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Making your job, in a way – literally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s a beautiful space. They’ve done a really good job. Even while I was there, I felt more productive. Because there’s people all—you’re in it together. Everyone’s doing their own, but there’s that energy.</p>

<p>We met in this conference room, and it was like, “Are you fucking kidding me? This is where I would…” Once you schedule appointments, then I would know when I need to be there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in a separate office, it’s (inaudible at 00:11:08) door?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s not like a gym. There are tiered memberships. You can pay, I think the minimum—I would initially pay like $125 a month. And what that gets you is a couple of hours a month, you can use it.</p>

<p>What Isabella pays is the standard, like it’s $300 or $340. She gets to use it as her business address, which is the other thing I haven’t thought of. Even if it’s a website, there probably should be a mailing address or something. I don’t want to use my house and I don’t want to use a P.O. box. So I use that as her…</p>

<p>That’s one. You don’t get an office, but what you get is unlimited use of conference rooms. So if every day, I had an appointment or I scheduled in one day, three appointments, whatever, I just make sure I block off times. [00:12:07] It’s like this size, really, really nice, modern. It was really impressive. You can hook up your laptop wirelessly to the TV, so people can look right at your laptop screen. Whatever, it’s pretty cool.</p>

<p>I can’t afford $300, $400 right now. It’s something. I think the kind of people I want to attract – what, they’re going to come to my house? They’re going to meet me at a coffee shop? That’s not going to work.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is there are all these good things happening. [00:13:00] It’s as if the reality of all these changes is slowly becoming unavoidable (chuckles) and it makes me nervous.</p>

<p>Not to mention what if it doesn’t work? Or what if it takes a really long time to make a decent amount of money? I don’t know. All that stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it’s just something is bad main part of the anxiety, it’s what (crosstalk at 00:13:33).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the main part of the anxiety is that I’m going to be good at it and be a very different kind of—I’m going to be letting out a part of me that’s been there all along. But that makes me a little more self-(crosstalk at 00:13:48).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The first time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It’s almost like in here. Sometimes I feel very comfortable, but there’s also a part of me watching me. That’s always a little discombobulating. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it feels like it’s like taking ownership of another part of yourself that’s been locked away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That does feel nerve-racking, being out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yourself out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where’d you just go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re somewhere in there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I was thinking. I don’t know. It’s just a lot, I think. It’s just overwhelming. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>One thing I was thinking, too, is that – which also is a little bit overwhelming – is I feel like, well, that whole other part of me that’s either bummed in terms of my relationship to women. Why haven’t I had one normal, nice dating, long-term situation?</p>

<p>More and more I’m realizing it’s such a simple thing. It’s really hitting home that, you know what? That’s the other part of this, is that I don’t think I’m going to find that person until I’m… it’s kind of a bummer, because it’s going to take me a while to be…</p>

<p>I really want more. I think that’s part of what’s going on. [00:16:00] I don’t know if I’m explaining it right. Not that I’m attracting the wrong people, but the better you do in life – whatever that means to you – you end up in better situations. When we end up in those situations, then more opportunities open up to meet more people – if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>Because, really, how am I meeting people? Okay, stupid, maybe at a bar. It’s just these half-assed ways of meeting people. A lot of them have fucking issues – not that people aren’t going to have issues when you meet somewhere else, but it just opens things up.</p>

<p>I thought that when I was meeting Isabella. Like, “Look at all these people. This is a whole other world, here, of people. Some are probably nice. Some are probably douchebags. Some are boring. [00:17:00] This is real-life happening, here.” So there’s more opportunity. Not even just romantically.</p>

<p>I’ve been saying that: I feel like I need certain different kinds of friends or connections.</p>

<p>Oh, my God, there is a big thing! Well, these are all big things. One thing I’m trying to be careful that I think I’m doing a really good job – especially because you were away – that chick that I was going to play?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Allison (sp), the one that invited me for the—did I talk about her?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have the kind of crush on her that I haven’t had since Meredith (sp) or Samantha (sp).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s developed. You’ve said you’ve always had a thing for her, but you weren’t saying (crosstalk at 00:17:59).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was when you were away or whatever. She to Houston for a business trip, she was texting me a little more often. She texted me from her business trip, she called me once or twice. Then she was like, “I hope you don’t think it’s weird, but I really feel like you’re one of my really good friends, now.”</p>

<p>There’s something about her that’s such a nice combo of super—exactly, in terms of the physical checklist and all that. But she’s just such a cool person. There’s something about her. We hit it off so well. She’s the first girl I’ve met who is kind of like the copy of me, in a way. She gets all my fucked-up humor. I don’t know.</p>

<p>It’s bummed me out, in a weird way, because I’m like, “Oh, I know that feeling. I haven’t felt that in years.” [00:19:02] That scares me, because if it’s not reciprocated, then I’m going to feel like shit.</p>

<p>I think she knows pretty clearly how I feel. I think she just sensed. I don’t know if now, it’s kind of weird. We haven’t been as much in touch.</p>

<p>But then, the guitar player in my band was like, “Dude, but that doesn’t mean anything. If you feel that strongly about her… Of course, you don’t want to overdo it, but don’t stop texting her. It’s a fucking text! Maintain a friendship – try to go out for a drink. Don’t profess your love for her or something, but if you feel that way, don’t… If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, but don’t squander the—” [00:20:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don’t get too scared off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I have been getting kind of scared off, yeah.</p>

<p>Sunday, I was like, “Yeah, it’s really hot, I’m going to grab an iced coffee, go for a drive. Do you want to come?” She’s like, “Oh, maybe. Can I bring my kid?”</p>

<p>And oh, that’s the other thing that’s scaring me: she has a kid. In a different way—it’s not bothering me that she has a kid. Maybe because this is an improvement on the Kelly (sp): the things I didn’t feel with Kelly, I feel with her. With Kelly, I was torn. I was like, “Oh, maybe I would be open to the kid.”</p>

<p>With her, I don’t know, there’s something. She’s here, she’s local, she’s really cool. We get along super, super well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was another factor with Kelly, the distance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, distance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her age, (inaudible at 00:20:58)—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, Allison’s 40. I don’t know she’d want to have another kid. Maybe she would, maybe she wouldn’t, I don’t know.</p>

<p>So yeah, even that. It’s not scary, but yeah, it does make me feel like, “All right, don’t get caught up in these feelings.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you don’t want to. That’s maybe the (inaudible at 00:21:23). Are you thinking (inaudible at 00:21:25) feelings have (inaudible at 00:21:26) whether this is good for you or if you want two years from now (inaudible at 00:21:31).</p>

<p>CLIENT: She’s pretty amazing. I’m not trying to make it melodramatic. I’m sure she has a lot of fucking issues.</p>

<p>I would feel weirder saying it if she hadn’t said it. She was the one who was like, “Wow, I really feel like you’re one of my very good friends.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You’re very connected.] (ph) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it’s as if somehow, we’ve known each other a long time.</p>

<p>I’ve never quite had that. I felt a lot of that with other, but the humorance? There’s something about her that’s—I don’t know.</p>

<p>Today, I was thinking on my way over, “Would it be weird if I texted her and was like, ‘Hey, I kind of miss you.’” I’m at that place know where I’m getting all fucking meta about it. I’m like, “Is that weird now if I tell…?”</p>

<p>But then I’m like, “It’s not weird. If you feel that way,” I’m not being a weirdo. I’m just saying “Let’s hang out.” It’s that feeling of when you’re really into somebody and just get all nervous.</p>

<p>(pause) [00:23:00]</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what I’ve got to do. I think maybe it’s like, “Just fucking go for it. Say what you feel.” And what’s going to happen? She’s going to be like, “No, I just want to be friends”? Well, okay, well, then, there you go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:26) nerve-racking now, when you’re saying that’s (inaudible at 00:23:29) business, too – maybe you’ve just got to fucking go for it and then see what happens. There’s a piece of that that’s like (crosstalk at 00:23:38) the plunge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With her, it scares me. She’s so—that feeling is so – in some ways – in not-a-good way familiar. That Meredith, Samantha feeling. I’m worried that if she doesn’t reciprocate, I don’t know. I’m somewhat worried that it’s going to really bum me out. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that’s the other side. If the feeling is familiar, and the feeling of forgetting—it’s almost like what happened with Kelly, in the fact that her age and her (inaudible at 00:24:17) really important to you, in the end. That gets shut aside with Allison.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that’s the thing, because there were other factors, as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which may be, but it seems like maybe there’s more just to sort about it. What are you feeling for Allison? Where do you want this to head later (ph)? You don’t have to race into it tomorrow. You can talk about it for a little bit, and then figure out what you want to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Wait, what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:50) just slowing it down, also. It’s not the end of the world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that’s the thing. I think I don’t know the difference, in these situations, between slowing it down and missing an opportunity. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>Does slowing it down mean don’t text her once a week? Or does slowing it down mean, “No, you can text her every day.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about keeping the status quo?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not sure, yet, what the status quo is. Up to the show, it was a pretty a lot. Since the show, it’s much less. I don’t know if that’s because something’s going on with her. I don’t know if that’s because she sensed how I feel about her and she’s pulling back a little bit.</p>

<p>I think I told Stu that, too. He was saying, “Well, even if that’s the case, that doesn’t mean you just let up. She could be backing off a little bit. But that could very well be not because she doesn’t have feelings but obviously she thinks you’re really—” She texted me after the show at 3:00. She was like, “You were so awesome. When are we having drinks?” [00:26:01]</p>

<p>They’re not mixed signals, but they’re signals. I was telling my friend, she’s like, “No, she definitely likes you. It might be unclear to what extent or what she wants out of it or this and that. Calling you from a business trip, sending you text messages? You want to make sure you’re not being so aloof that it fizzles out.”</p>

<p>Overthinking; it’s a lot of overthinking.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I don’t like bringing in whether you text or not text or call or not call on one day. The big picture that you said sometimes gets lost (crosstalk at 00:27:00).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I totally agree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, why did I spend a lot of time with Kelly, what if I knew this from the beginning—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or why did I put so much energy to thinking about something that really wasn’t—what’s the big deal?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:27:11) anyway. You could get caught in minutia. So that’s more (crosstalk at 00:27:14) things that you want (crosstalk at 00:27:17).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s what I’m monitoring, I think. That’s why I’m saying it was good when you were away. When it came up and I was talking to my friends, I got like this, but that’s just because I really like her, that’s just a normal.</p>

<p>But otherwise, I wasn’t really…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even that, “I really like her.” Everybody can fall hard and fast for someone for some reason, and that doesn’t mean that’s actually right (ph). That’s a whole (crosstalk at 00:27:44).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, too, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 90% of the beginning of a relationship is projection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If she really won’t like (crosstalk at 00:27:51)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think all I’m saying is I definitely would like to spend more time with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah!</p>

<p>CLIENT: For now, that’s all I really care about. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>I’m 99% sure that even if she didn’t reciprocate, I’m just bringing the past into something that has nothing to do with.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’ll be fine. As a matter of fact, I’m absolutely certain I’ll be fine. But because I haven’t felt this way in a long, it’s making me remember times when it wasn’t good. But I’m not that person anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I also wonder – and you brought this up when you started today – before, when you said, “Oh, yeah, another big thing,” and you remembered her. You were talking about—and you literally used a hand gesture to describe it. Like feeling bummed out about the feeling that maybe you’re going to have to wait until you’re here with your job (inaudible at 00:29:01) things with women to really start (crosstalk at 00:29:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is that? And then you thought of her, “Oh, yeah, there’s her.” How those feelings of what you feel you have to get to, professionally, feel (crosstalk at 00:29:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, but also there’s another feeling with her. I don’t know. But it could also be that we have met each other at the right time.</p>

<p>We’re the same age. We’re both musicians, but we’re also kind of professional people. She’s been through a lot. I’ve been through a lot.</p>

<p>Not that I didn’t have that with Kelly, but with Kelly, there was some other things that weren’t quite.</p>

<p>With her, in a way, it’s what I’m saying about everything else. What if it did work out? Then that’s a whole other. [00:30:00]</p>

<p>I think I am going to be less scared about… If you miss somebody, I think it’s okay to tell them you miss them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You told me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Good point!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that’s not so bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>And also, in a way, it’s reciprocated. She’s the one who went out of her way to tell me she thinks I’m a really good friend.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that sounds like that – the anxiety problem from being very young about your own affection being reciprocated (crosstalk at 00:30:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that’s all it is, exactly. And then, because unfortunately it got reinforced – some really bad relationship situations – now I just feel like—and especially someone like her. [00:31:06] She’s just one of these girls that just has this incredible magnetism. There’s something about her. It’s beguiling – that’s a good word about her, is beguiling.</p>

<p>So, one, it scares me, because, yeah, Samantha was beguiling. Meredith was beguiling. And they weren’t people I should have been with.</p>

<p>But two, that, yeah, that’s the scariest feeling for me. When I feel that strongly, wanting some kind of reciprocation from someone and not getting it or whatever. Or getting it and then suddenly not having it anymore. That’s a bad childhood thing.</p>

<p>Which, amazingly enough, has improved to the point where I can totally deal with it. [00:32:04] It stirs up a lot of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, also, what there is for us to—the part of you that might just say “Slow down” – not whether you say it or not say it, that’s whatever you decide – but just having some space to keep thinking about if this an old feeling. (inaudible at 00:32:26) is the part of what’s so exhilarating, that’s she’s beguiling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. That’s why I’m stopping myself. “Is that what’s going on?” Because I know she’s so desired. She’s just a super desirable person. Is it that she’s up here, in the hierarchy of desirability?</p>

<p>I need to get validation from her. I totally get that. That’s why I’ve been very, very careful. Is it because I went over all the checklist? [00:33:00] I need to know that I’m attractive to her. Once I get that, then I’m going to try to find a way to get out of it.</p>

<p>I’m being very careful about that.</p>

<p>And also reminding myself that I’ve already got that: this chick asked me to play a solo show; she thinks I’m amazing. She’s already validated! I’m getting better at realizing. Not everything’s about whether someone wants to have sex with you. It’s not that it’s secondary, but the fact that someone’s giving you that respect and seeing how talented you are and this and that – that’s a lot of validation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder, is it sex? [00:34:01] That’s the pinnacle of (crosstalk at 00:34:04).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s not sex. It’s a physical thing. When I was young, when I was little, I didn’t think I was attractive, up until recently. I was half faking it. Some of it’s that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems that it’s a validation of she wants that is physically attracted to me (crosstalk at 00:34:21) others</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, sex is almost secondary. Just knowing that a girl like that thinks I’m really attractive. Yeah, it’s a bummer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And physically, then, your mind goes to (inaudible at 00:34:36) not about your attracted to you as a person. The validation is specifically (inaudible at 00:34:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think what happens is it’s when my book came out (inaudible at 00:34:44). I’m like, “Whatever.”</p>

<p>Clearly, she finds me desirable. That’s what I’m trying to say. I’ve been stopping myself, like, “Wait a second, dude. She’s great, she obviously”—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:34:54) over it about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>Again, I’m very quick, right? [00:35:00] Because that’s a childhood silhouette (ph).</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. Wow, blowing Claire’s (sp) mind.</p>

<p>That’s what all this is about, right? Meredith, Samantha, Michelle (sp), right? They’re fucking models, in my mind. I knew that, empirically, every dude wanted these chicks, but I got them.</p>

<p>The sex part just comes with the package. It was that they somehow found me… they chose me. Physically, my face. Some fucked-up shit, but that’s what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what I’m struck by is how much else gets dismissed about you, even in your own (inaudible at 00:35:48). What else can be desirable about you (crosstalk at 00:35:51), that that’s somehow—</p>

<p>CLIENT: For example, can a girl want to be friends? Can someone be very content and flattered by that? [00:36:03]</p>

<p>Not that stupid friend-zone kind of thing, but where someone’s generally like, “Dude, you are really cool. You’re really awesome.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:36:18)</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. I get a little, “Aw, shuck”-ish, like, “Aw, thanks,” whatever.</p>

<p>But there’s a part of me that a.) totally just dismisses it, and 2.) gets a little, “What am I, a fucking puppy?” If I was a really rugged, hot dude, would you say the same thing? Or would you say something different?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is [your family] (ph)? That’s the (inaudible at 00:36:49) thing that really counts, this desirability.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>That’s what. Now that I really see all that, I’m trying to be careful.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So tomorrow (inaudible at 00:37:15).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Awesome. Tomorrow’s 12:50?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 12:50. Thank you, Claire.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you, (inaudible at 00:37:23).</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you. Welcome back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

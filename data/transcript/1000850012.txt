<center><p><b>Transcript</b></p></center>

<p>TH 1: Now it's my understanding that you folks have been part of this program and have come already several times.</p>

<p>F 1: Yeah, this is our seventh time now.</p>

<p>TH 2: So, you are more veterans than I am because this is my first time, so you will have to lead me through the field here. Adrian, can you tell me what it is you came for and maybe summarize for me what you think you got out of the seven times and if it's had any impact.</p>

<p>F 2: Well, we came here because we are having problems with Pam. For many, many years you would tell Pam or ask Pam to do something and she would either refuse to do it or she just wouldn't do it. We'd ask her, we'd call her or something, but she won't answer. She just, I don't know, she just won't give you an answer. Like you say, Pam where are you? Get no answer. Or Pam will you do this? And you get no answer. I mean you have to turn around and say it three or four times. What else?</p>

<p>TH 3:  Is that to both of you equally?</p>

<p>F 3:  Oh yeah, yep.</p>

<p>TH 4:  And even if the two of you got together and said it in a chorus, Pam still wouldn't answer.</p>

<p>F 4: She still wouldn't answer. Very rarely would she answer. You know, just to acknowledge that you had said something to her.</p>

<p>TH 5: And now you guys felt that was disrespectful, or it wasn't getting done what you wanted or . . .</p>
	
<p>F 5: I mean, it would get done because I would get angry enough where it would get done.</p>

<p>TH 6: So you just keep escalating the volume and the intensity and Pam would finally hear you?</p>

<p>F 6:  Oh, yeah. Pam would hear it.</p>

<p>TH 7:  And then she'd do it.</p>

<p>F 7:  It's a wonder you didn't hear it in New York, right?</p>

<p>M 1:  No, no.</p>

<p>TH 8:  Okay. So, you came to get some help to try to find a better way to make it work?</p>

<p>F 8:  Try and find a better way to make it work. But the last five times it was always Judy and I, Judy and I that were doing the talking. Out of the five times I don't think Pam said a dozen words. And then the one guy that we had.</p>

<p>M 2: Last week, I mean last month.</p>

<p>F 9: Two months ago the one guy we had ticked me off so bad that's why you heard me, I don't know if you heard me, apologizing to people today.</p>

<p>TH 9: I heard a little bit of that.</p>

<p>F 10: He ticked me off at the very end. And I mean I got ticked. And when I came in last month, I told them, "Well, then, don't talk to us." I understand you have to have a, I'm trying to think of the word . . .</p>

<p>M 2: A background . . .</p>

<p>F 11: Background on us and everything else in order to get the feeling of what's going on. I do understand that, but nobody ever talked to Pamela. They were always talking to us about things that we didn't even really want to talk about. Because it's not . . .</p>

<p>TH 10:  Okay.</p>

<p>F 12:  And two months ago the guy really ticked me off, I mean he . . .</p>

<p>TH 11:  He got you.
  
<p>F 13:  He got me. He got me so bad that last month I turned around and says if it happens again I'm out of here. I mean it would be the last time I would come. There would be no more.</p>

<p>TH 12: So, then, was it better last time?</p>

<p>F 14: Yes. The gentleman was from I think he was from New York too wasn't he?</p>

<p>D 1: No.</p>

<p>F 15: Pennsylvania?</p>

<p>TH 13: From Philly?</p>

<p>F 16: And anyway, he was doing a lot of talking to Pam, and Pam was doing the talking last month.</p>

<p>D 2: Yeah, I liked the guy. It was good.</p>

<p>F 17: And, it seemed to work a little bit. I mean last month we had, I mean this past month we didn't have that much of a problem with her. Things seemed to . . .</p>

<p>D 3: Change a little bit.</p>

<p>F 18: Change a little bit. Of course, we did have a wedding that she stood up to where she was coordinator for. . .</p>

<p>D 4: And he walked her down the aisle.</p>

<p>F 19: And I walked my niece down the aisle, and so she was on very good behavior situation this past month.</p>

<p>TH 14: So, you felt like that last one . . .</p>

<p>F 20: That last one worked more than any of the other five.</p>

<p>TH 15: Put together.</p>

<p>F 21: All put together, yes, definitely.</p>

<p>TH 16: So maybe you don't even need to be here today.</p>

<p>M 3: No, we don't need to be here. You've got to be kidding.</p>

<p>TH 17: So, Pam do you like it when the person sitting in my chair talks to you?</p>

<p>D 5: Yeah. Especially the guy last month.</p>

<p>TH 18: What was it about him that appealed to you?</p>

<p>D 6: I don't know. He for some reason I was able to communicate with him because he was more pleasant. I mean . . .</p>

<p>F 22: The other guys weren't bad . . .</p>

<p>D 7: No.</p>

<p>F 2: It's just that they weren't . . .</p>

<p>D 8: They were more focusing on you and ma instead of me. And when he really started getting mad, I almost stood up and said hey, we are not here for these two. We are here for me.</p>

<p>F 24: Why didn't you?</p>

<p>D 9: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 19: What do you think?</p>

<p>D 10: I kept my quiet.</p>

<p>TH 20: What do you think it is about you that the three of you are here for?</p>

<p>D 11: To get me to communicate more, talk to these guys more. Control my anger.</p>

<p>TH 21: You've got some? And is that when you shut down, when you, I mean when you are angry is that when you don't hear . . .</p>

<p>D 12: I think so, I just . . .</p>

<p>TH 22: And you don't answer and just pull it all in? Do you ever blow?</p>

<p>D 13: No.</p>

<p>TH 23: No. Leave the blowing to daddy?</p>

<p>M 4: She blows in her own way by herself.</p>

<p>F 25: She throws things.</p>

<p>M 5: She throws things and she does damage.</p>

<p>F 26: She does have her damage.</p>

<p>TH 24: Pam, what are you angry about?</p>

<p>D 14:  Nothing right now.</p>

<p>TH 25:  No.</p>

<p>D 15:  Yet.</p>

<p>TH 26:  If I keep bugging you will you be angry in the next five minutes?</p>

<p>D 16:  I don't think so.</p>

<p>TH 27:  No. So somehow something happened between last time and this time that you are a lot less angry. That means you got to talk and that made it better. So what did you get to have to say that kind of made some of that go away?</p>

<p>D 17: I don't know. I mean the guy last week it was more pleasant to talk to him. I don't know, maybe I don't know how to explain it.</p>

<p>TH 28: Okay, but the anger, whatever happened, the anger has kind of been . . .</p>

<p>D 18: From way up here to down here.</p>

<p>TH 29: Okay. So then the next problem is to be able to communicate better with the mama and the papa.</p>

<p>D 19: Uhuh.</p>

<p>TH 30: Do you know what it is that you want to communicate with them about?</p>

<p>D 20: Not so much about but like they said, I have to answer and I don't, I don't.</p>

<p>TH 31: Now the anger is gone, so you don't have to shut down anymore, so why wouldn't you answer?</p>

<p>D 21: I don't know why I don't answer. I just don't know why.
 
TH 32 So, it's a puzzle.</p>

<p>D 22: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 33: Do you let your parents know what it is about each of them that bugs you? Do you know what it is about each of them that bugs you?</p>

<p>D 23: No.</p>

<p>TH 34: If you knew, would it be safe to tell them?</p>

<p>D 24: I don't know. I really don't know.</p>

<p>TH 35: I mean if your dad behaved in ways that really bugged you, would it be safe to say you know daddy when you do this and this it really upsets me, makes me angry and makes me want to . . .</p>

<p>D 25: I can try that one.</p>

<p>TH 36: Would it be safe?</p>

<p>D 26: I can try that one. I haven't tried that yet.</p>

<p>TH 37: No? How come?</p>

<p>D 27: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 38: Is your dad an easy guy to talk to?</p>

<p>D 28: Ah, sometimes.</p>

<p>TH 39: What's that mean? I mean when is he and when isn't he?</p>

<p>D 29: Well when he is hurting and real, real angry, uhuh, no. No. I just back off.</p>

<p>TH 40: So, when he is in a good mood and he's kind of light and stuff, then he can talk to him.</p>

<p>D 30: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 41: And can you tell him negative stuff about him when he is in that kind of mood? Not angry but . . .</p>

<p>D 31: I don't know. I haven't tried yet.</p>

<p>TH 42: Never tried it. Would it be safe?</p>

<p>F 27: I don't know. What's negative about me?</p>

<p>TH 43: Oh, oh, you can't even think what it possibly might be.</p>

<p>F 38: No.</p>

<p>TH 44: No</p>

<p>F 39: Oh lord it's hard to be humble.</p>

<p>TH 45: Can you sing that for us. That was a good country and western song.</p>

<p>M 6: He used to sing it very well.</p>

<p>TH 46: Uhuh, so, but be straight with me now. Could you take negative feedback?</p>

<p>F 40: Oh, probably.</p>

<p>TH 47: Would it be easier to take it from Pam than from Judy?</p>

<p>D 32: Yeah, let me try that one.</p>

<p>F 41: It all depends on what it is. When you say negativity . . .</p>

<p>TH 48: Well, if they say dad you've got too hot a temper and you scare me and you intimidate me, would you be able to hear that?</p>

<p>F 42: Oh yeah, I mean, I used to be a lot worse. A lot.</p>

<p>TH 49: Is that because you've been working on it or because you just got older and have mellowed?</p>

<p>F 43: No, I think I got older and I mellowed out, and I worked on it. I used to drink a lot. Many years ago.</p>

<p>TH 50: And so that would kind of, you were an angry drunk?</p>

<p>F 44: Yeah, yeah. And since I quite drinking I think I've been a lot mellower and everything else.</p>

<p>M 7: Well, it's been many, many, many years though.</p>

<p>F 45: Yeah, well it's been many years. Yeah, I get angry you know like anyone else does I would assume.</p>

<p>TH 51: Do you think Pam has a kind of, you know, just as much a relationship with you as she has with your wife?</p>

<p>F 46:  No, I think she is better with me than with my wife. 
 
<p>TH 52:  Really?</p>

<p>F 47:  Yes.</p>

<p>TH 53:  Agree?</p>

<p>M 8:  Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>TH 54:  What's that about? How come it sets up that way?</p>

<p>M 9:  I have no idea.</p>

<p>TH 55:  No?</p>

<p>M 10: No, I just I think it goes way, way back. I was the one that took her to all the doctors that she had to go to ah . . . I just feel that maybe she associates me with hurt, you know, all the medical things and things she had to go through because we had a lot of things when she was a baby. And I was home so naturally it was me that took her to all this. But it goes way back when she was 4 or 5 years old.</p>

<p>TH 56: Now, does it upset you Judy to remember those times or that the relationship with you and Pam isn't better?</p>

<p>M 11: I've just grown to adjust to it, you know.</p>

<p>TH 57: I understand, but it seems like something we are talking about is upsetting you, and what I am trying to get clear about is it the state of the relationship between you or is it some of that old stuff and reflecting back.</p>

<p>M 12: Oh, no. It, I just wish that she was the daughter I always wanted, that we could be closer, yes.</p>

<p>TH 58:  Okay, so you get kind of melancholy about that. Wishing it could be so.</p>

<p>M 13:  Yeah. But I says she doesn't so . . .</p>

<p>TH 59:  Have you tried?</p>

<p>M 14:  Oh, I've tried. I've asked her to do things and come places with me and she doesn't want to.</p>

<p>TH 60: So, when you say to her you say Pam, listen I got Saturday off. I want to go with you do what you want to do. What are we going to do. She says I don't know and then she never . . .</p>

<p>D 33: Exactly what I would say too.</p>

<p>TH 61: I don't know.</p>

<p>M 15: Or it's come on I'm going shopping or come on I'm going up to the mall, and she won't come with me.</p>

<p>TH 62: So, Pam. What's that all about?</p>

<p>D 34: I don't know. I really couldn't say.</p>

<p>TH 63: Well, what about, let's build some supposes, you know. I mean, what could it be about? I mean, is it hard for you to be with your mom? Is there something about her?</p>

<p>D 35: It's not that hard, but sometimes I like to go shopping by myself.</p>

<p>TH 64: Okay, does she let you do that? Yeah? Does your mother hover and kind of overprotect you, or does she let you do what you have to do?</p>

<p>D 36: She lets me do whatever.</p>

<p>TH 65: Uhuh, but there is, I mean, because she gets kind of sad that you and she aren't better connected.</p>

<p>D 37: Yeah, that's what we have to work on too.</p>

<p>TH 66: So, what's in the way? What's the roadblock?</p>

<p>D 38: I don't know what the barrier is.</p>

<p>TH 67: You get upset about it too.</p>

<p>D 39: I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>TH 68: Have you thought about it?</p>

<p>D 40: No, not really.</p>

<p>TH 69: Do you want me to stop talking about this?</p>

<p>F 48: How many times did I ask you to be nice to mother when she comes home from work, before she comes home from work?</p>

<p>D 41: I try to.</p>

<p>TH 70: Do you have a theory as to why the two ladies don't do better with each other.</p>

<p>F 49: No. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>TH 71: So you try to push them together.</p>

<p>F 50: I try. She gets angry with me sometimes.</p>

<p>TH 72: Judy does?</p>

<p>F 51: Judy does. Because I don't know what it is I'm trying to say there, but I had in, ah. . .</p>

<p>TH 73: You would say, she gets angry with you for trying to promote the relationship?</p>

<p>F 52: She doesn't get angry. I don't know what the word would be, but she just says leave it alone, leave me alone, and walks away.</p>

<p>TH 74: Okay. Now when Adrian talks to you about your relationship with Pam, do you feel he is criticizing you?</p>

<p>M 16: No, I don't think, well, a lot of times he'll say . . .</p>

<p>F 53:  Change the tone.</p>

<p>M 17:  Change the tone.</p>

<p>F 54:  That's my biggest thing.</p>

<p>TH 75:  It's like you are being instructional in telling her how to do it you mean? 
 	
<p>F 55:  Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 76:  Uhuh, like the boss.</p>

<p>F 56:  Well, not really.</p>

<p>TH 77:  No?</p>

<p>F 57:  It's the tone that she uses would be the boss tone.</p>

<p>TH 78:  The tone Judy uses or you use?</p>

<p>F 58:  The tone Judy uses, and I would just turn around and say change the tone. 
 
<p>TH 79:  Oh, you say that.</p>

<p>F 59:  Yes.</p>

<p>M 18:  But that's just me. That's just the way I talk.</p>

<p>TH 80:  Are you bossy?</p>

<p>M 19:  I don't know if I'm bossy or not, but, you know, it's just probably the tone of my voice or something that he will always say that to me. Let's see I'm just trying to think of something.</p>

<p>F 60: I was trying to think what you would say too, and I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>TH 81: Are the two of them kind of in a conspiracy avoiding you telling them what to do?</p>

<p>M 20:  Oh yeah.</p>

<p>F 61:  No we're not.</p>

<p>M 21:  Like today. When she is home. She's got the whole day of and he's home, and then when I come home and I see the house isn't very well cleaned or dinner isn't made . . .</p>

<p>D 42: And I did good today so . . .</p>

<p>M 22: You did real well today, but . . .</p>

<p>D 43: Come on.</p>

<p>M 23: We were coming here so . . .</p>

<p>D 44: I've got to be on good behavior right?</p>

<p>M 24: Or I'll say to him how come you didn't make her so this or something. Well, he said that she was gone most of the day today again. Ah, so, I mean, you know, there's just whatever comes up or something. I'm gone all day, you know, and you know, when I come home I don't expect to have to clean house and . . .</p>

<p>TH 82: You're gone all day working?</p>

<p>M 25: Working yeah.</p>

<p>TH 83: Do you like working?</p>

<p>M 26: Yeah, I like work.</p>

<p>TH 84: Do you like what you do?</p>

<p>M 27: No, not right now, but I do like my job. When I'm, right now I'm under a lot of pressure.</p>

<p>TH 85: At work?</p>

<p>M 28:  Yeah, it's a busy season, and we lost three people and training three new  people.</p>

<p>TH 86:  They quit or they got let go or . . .</p>

<p>M 29:  No, they quit, and now I am losing another one, so that . . .</p>

<p>TH 87:  What do you do Judy?</p>

<p>M 30:  I work for a roofing company and I do the invoicing for them.</p>
  
<p>TH 88  Okay. So any type of administrative help coming in you have to train them and you just get them trained and they leave.</p>

<p>M 31: Yeah, more or less. Well this one I didn't really have to train because the one that's leaving is more in the accounts payable and I'm on the accounts receivable side of it, but she is in our office anyway, but . . .</p>

<p>TH 89: So, if you come home all weary and upset from working, are either of those two guys there for you?</p>

<p>M 32: No.</p>

<p>TH 90: No.</p>

<p>M 33: No, I don't think so. He doesn't like me working, and he's instilled that on her so I guess . . .</p>

<p>F 62: I did not.</p>

<p>TH 91: This means you are supposed to be home taking care of the two of them?</p>

<p>M 34: Yes.</p>

<p>F 63: Isn't that where every good wife is supposed to be?</p>

<p>M 35: No.</p>

<p>TH 92: It's so hard to be humble. We've got a real liberated husband over there. So how come you are working if they want you home?</p>

<p>M 36: Why, because we can't afford for me to stay home.</p>

<p>TH 93: Is that you can't afford it financially or you can't afford it emotionally?</p>

<p>M 37: No, I can't afford it financially.</p>

<p>TH 94: So you wouldn't mind being home if you didn't mind the extra income?</p>

<p>M 38: I don't know. I really couldn't say. I mean we enjoy ourselves when we are together. We spend weekends together.</p>

<p>TH 95: You mean you and Adrian or you . . .</p>

<p>M 39: Yeah, we go out of town on the weekends, and . . .</p>

<p>TH 96: Do you? Where do you go?</p>

<p>M 40: We go to Michigan.</p>

<p>TH 97: Do you have a place there?</p>

<p>M 41: Yeah, we've got a place up in Michigan.</p>

<p>TH 98: And Pam stays home?</p>

<p>D 45: Cleans house.</p>

<p>F 54: It's her choice.</p>

<p>TH 99: And you like that?</p>

<p>F 55: Through choice.</p>

<p>D 36: Sometimes.</p>

<p>TH 100: Sometimes yes, sometimes no? What determines yes or no?</p>

<p>D 37: It depends on how I feel. So If I want to go, I'll go.</p>

<p>TH 101: Will they let you go with them?</p>

<p>D 38: Yes.</p>

<p>TH 102: So, all you have to do is say yes and you get to go.</p>

<p>D 39: Yes, I want to go this weekend.</p>

<p>TH 103: So, how often do you go? Once a month, twice a month, what?</p>

<p>D 40: I don't know.</p>

<p>M 42: Well, whenever we can get up there on the weekend we do try during the summer especially.</p>

<p>TH 104: And how often does Pam go with you?</p>

<p>M 43: When we beg her to come up and help.</p>

<p>F 56: Maybe three times a year, four times a year.</p>

<p>D 41: No.</p>

<p>M 44: If you come up that often now.</p>

<p>TH 105: So, what do you do if you stay home?</p>

<p>D 42: Clean house.</p>

<p>TH 106: Just make the house immaculate so that when mother comes home she'll be real happy?</p>

<p>D 43: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 107: Do you do anything else?</p>

<p>D 44: Vacuuming, bathrooms, dishes.</p>

<p>TH 108: What do you do for fun?</p>

<p>D 45: Fun? Just stay home and watch TV</p>

<p>TH 109: Right.</p>

<p>D 46: . . . on Saturday.</p>

<p>TH 110: Does anybody come and watch TV with you? Have you got some friends?</p>

<p>D 47: I have a dog at home that keeps me company.</p>

<p>TH 111: What kind of dog do you got?</p>

<p>D 48: It's a German shepherd mix, collie mix.</p>

<p>TH 112: Yeah? Nice dog.</p>

<p>D 49: Uhuh.</p>

<p>TH 113: So you get a lot of TLC from, what's your dog's name?</p>

<p>D50: Pumpkin.</p>

<p>TH 114: Pumpkin. How old's Pumpkin?</p>

<p>D 51: How old? About three years old.</p>

<p>M 45: Three years.</p>

<p>D 52: No.</p>

<p>F 47: Three maybe four. In that vicinity.</p>

<p>TH 115: You had her since she was a pup?</p>

<p>D 53: Six weeks old.</p>

<p>TH 115: Do you take care of her? Do you take care of her? Walk her, feed her, get her her shots, all that stuff?</p>

<p>D 54: I take her for her shots, I take her for the haircut. I don't walk her too much 'cause we have a, from the gate to the driveway is a, good running area and she runs.</p>

<p>TH 116: So she has a run like.</p>

<p>D 55: She runs. I have to feed her just about every day.</p>

<p>TH 117: But you don't make your father walk her?</p>

<p>D 56: Well, we don't walk her. Uhuh.</p>

<p>TH 118: How come you don't get out and socialize? How old are you?</p>

<p>D 57: 32.</p>

<p>TH 119: How come you don't have some friends and some groups that you hang out with and stuff? You don't want to do that? You just . . .</p>

<p>D 58: Nobody that I want to.</p>

<p>TH 120: What?</p>

<p>D 59: Nobody that I want to hang out with.</p>

<p>TH 121: Really? You' re sure, or is it just that it's hard to find them.</p>

<p>M 46: Oh, she bowls.</p>

<p>TH 122: Do you?</p>

<p>D 60: Ha-uh. Oh, yeah. I go to bingo.</p>

<p>F 48: She goes to bingo on Tuesday nights and she bowls on Friday nights.</p>

<p>TH 123: Are you a good bowler? Yeah? You bowl on a team?</p>

<p>D 61: Yeah. Mixed league.</p>

<p>TH 124: Is the team made up at the bowling alley or is it made up from another place like the church or something like that?</p>

<p>D 62:  Ha-uh.</p>

<p>F 49:  From the bowling alley I'd say.</p>

<p>D 63:  Just the bowling alley. It's fun.</p>

<p>TH 125:  So, it doesn't bother you that you don't have friends to hang out with, to come over to the house, to go to the movies with? You haven't made friends with any of the people on the bowling team?</p>

<p>D 64: Oh, yeah, but, ah . . .</p>

<p>TH 126: But you never go to the movies with them or any of that stuff.</p>

<p>D 65: Oh no, because they all have family.</p>

<p>TH 127: They all have family so they are all older and they have families. Did you want to have a family?</p>

<p>D 66: Mmm, I don't know. I'm still thinking about that one.</p>

<p>TH 128: You're still thinking about that one. How long are you going to think about it?</p>

<p>F 50: Another thirty years, huh?</p>

<p>D 67: No. No.</p>

<p>TH 129: So you don't get upset about not having a bunch of friends to hang with, go to the movies with, whatever?</p>

<p>M 47: She doesn't care for movies, that's why.</p>

<p>TH 130: Oh, well, I mean, I don't know. Whatever else, the automobile races.</p>

<p>M 48: She is great because she doesn't drink. I mean, occasionally.</p>

<p>TH 131: She can't go to bars.</p>

<p>D 68: I don't want to go to bars.</p>

<p>M 49: And she does not watch a movie. I mean even on TV she will not watch a movie through almost.</p>

<p>TH 132: Really? What do you like to do, Pam?</p>

<p>D 69: Play on the computer.</p>

<p>TH 133: Do you? Are you good at it? Are you on the internet.</p>

<p>F 51: I refuse it. I won't hook up the phone line.</p>

<p>D 70: Yes you will.</p>

<p>TH 134: You won't go to the internet?</p>

<p>D 71: Huh?</p>

<p>TH 135: Why not?</p>

<p>D 72: Too much money.</p>

<p>TH 136: How much?</p>

<p>D 73: Well, it's going to run me at least $50.00 a month.</p>

<p>TH 137: Do you do the computer?</p>

<p>D 74: Do I mess with the computer? I am a complete illiterate with the computer.</p>

<p>TH 138: Me too.</p>

<p>D 75: I can't even get into it anymore. When we first got it she taught me how to get into it and that.</p>

<p>TH 139: Who taught you, Judy?</p>

<p>D 76: Pamela.</p>

<p>TH 140: Pam. Pam taught you.</p>

<p>M 50: You were playing.</p>

<p>D 77: Yeah, I taught him how. Yeah, I did.</p>

<p>TH 141: I'm going to make some trouble here now. Would you like to be on the internet?</p>

<p>D 78: I won't say internet. What's the other one?</p>

<p>M 51: She asked for it and I told him to hook up the line, but she would have to help pay for it.</p>

<p>D 79: Which is fine.</p>

<p>TH 142: Do you work?</p>

<p>D 80: Yeah, I work.</p>

<p>TH 143: What do you do?</p>

<p>D 81: In a grocery store.</p>

<p>TH 144: How many hours a week?</p>

<p>D 82: It depends.</p>

<p>TH 145: Thirty, twenty, ten?</p>

<p>D 83: No, it's not ten.</p>

<p>TH 146: So it's more like fifteen, twenty?</p>

<p>D 84: No, more than that.</p>

<p>TH 147: Thirty.</p>

<p>F 52: Twenty-eight or thirty.</p>

<p>D 85: Twenty-five, thirty.</p>

<p>TH 148: It's hard to pin you down Pam, you know? Do you like working in a grocery store?</p>

<p>D 86: At times yes, at times no.</p>

<p>TH 149: What determines whether you do or you don't.</p>

<p>D 87: The customers. Some of the customers really get to me, so I walk away.</p>

<p>TH 150: Uhuh, there's that anger thing again. You walk away and shut down your ears, right?
 
<p>D 88:  From the customers, I mean there are several that I will walk away from. </p>
  
<p>F 53:  They are usually older people. Explain to him. </p>
 
<p>D 89:  No.</p>

<p>TH 151:  Older people bug you, Pam? Do they?</p>

<p>D 90:  No, they don't.</p>

<p>F 54:  Aren't they older ones?</p>

<p>D 91:  No, these are specific customers that I will walk away from. 
 
<p>TH 152:  You mean like they are regular customers every week. You know when they are coming. You see them coming, and you go back and start rearranging the milk case rather than . . .</p>

<p>D 92: Uhuh.</p>

<p>TH 153: Now, do your parents get upset because you don't have more of a social life and stuff?</p>

<p>D 93: I don't know. I never asked them.</p>

<p>TH 154: They never say anything to you? Would they tell you if they were upset about it?</p>

<p>F 55: Have we ever said anything to you about it?</p>

<p>D 94: No, not that I know of.</p>

<p>F 56: Oh, you don't remember, huh?</p>

<p>D 95: Ha-uh.</p>

<p>TH 155: I guess that means you have.</p>

<p>M 52: Oh, yeah. There is a nice young fellow that comes around and has asked her to do things and she has treated him very . . .</p>

<p>D 96: No, I have not. Not lately.</p>

<p>TH 156: She is getting bugged at you just for mentioning it.</p>

<p>F 57: Well, he hasn't been around lately.</p>

<p>D 97: Well, he's been working a lot, too.</p>

<p>F 58: Well, I would too.</p>

<p>M 53: Some of the time what you say to him and the way you treat him is not very nice.</p>

<p>D 98: Not lately.</p>

<p>F 59: You know the old saying you treat them like dirt they keep coming back. Well, that's the way she treats him. Worse than dirt.</p>

<p>TH 157: Why do you . . .</p>

<p>F 60: Only he's stopped coming down now.</p>

<p>TH 158: Do you do that Pam?</p>

<p>D 99: I have not.</p>

<p>TH 159: Pam.</p>

<p>M 54: And he's been around since they've been in college together, so . . .</p>

<p>D 100: I just don't like, he's not my type of guy.</p>

<p>TH 160: What's the matter with him?</p>

<p>D 101: I don't know, he's just not my type of guy.</p>

<p>F 61: He's heavy like I am.</p>

<p>TH 161: Yeah?</p>

<p>F 62: He's a young man, but he's very heavy like I am.</p>

<p>M 55: Well, he just got heavy though in the last year or so.</p>

<p>F 63: He always was heavy.</p>

<p>TH 162: You don't like heavy guys?</p>

<p>D 102: I just don't like, there's something about him I don't like.</p>

<p>TH 163: Why would you think it's because he's heavy?</p>

<p>F 64: Because of the way she used to talk about him.</p>

<p>TH 164: She used to say he's a fat guy or something?</p>

<p>M 56: Well, she used to . . .</p>

<p>F 65: She said it to me anyway.</p>

<p>M 57: She didn't like him because he was hairy is what she told me once.</p>

<p>D 103: That too.</p>

<p>TH 165: Oh, you think that's really the reason?</p>

<p>D 104: I just . . .</p>

<p>TH 166: Do you want to not talk about this? What's this guy's name?</p>

<p>D 105: Mark.</p>

<p>TH 167: Mark? Where did you go so school with him?</p>

<p>D 106: South Suburban.</p>

<p>TH 168: And so you've known him for how long now? A long time. Ten years?</p>

<p>D 107: Something like that.</p>

<p>TH 169: And he still keeps coming around and you still keep . . .</p>

<p>D 107: I just don't like, there is something about him I don't want, I just don't want to deal with him.</p>

<p>TH 170:  Do your parents pressure you to encourage him?
  
<p>D 108:  I don't know. Do you? </p>
  
<p>M 58:  I'd like to see if she would be nice to him.</p>

<p>D 109:  Which I do, which I have been.
  
<p>M 59:  And if he's asked you to go out, to go out with him. What does it hurt?
  
<p>TH 171:  So you guys do worry, I guess, that she kind of spends most of her time other than working in a grocery store and bowling . . .</p>

<p>M 60: Oh yeah, well, she was going up to the truck stop all the time, and I am not in favor of her being up at the truck stop. So . . .</p>

<p>TH 172: You think she might get herself in some difficulty?</p>

<p>M 61: Yeah, I'm afraid, up there, with all the truckers and all the things you hear. I mean, granted truckers are good people at times, but then there are also some that are out there that aren't the greatest either, so . . .</p>

<p>TH 173: So, have you been trying to light a fire under Pam to get her out and get her more active socially and get her or have you been just letting her be the way . .</p>

<p>F 66: No, just more or less just letting her be now.</p>

<p>TH 174: You used to do that.</p>

<p>F 67: We used to try . . .</p>

<p>TH 175: You kind of gave up doing that?</p>

<p>F 68: Yeah.</p>

<p>M 62: Her trouble was that whenever she decided to go and do something with somebody, she would not tell us until she was leaving.</p>

<p>TH 176: How come?</p>

<p>M 63: I have no idea.</p>

<p>F 69: I mean she could have had something planned for two weeks ahead, and, you know, you know, she doesn't say nothing until she is walking out the door and maybe we would still have to pull it out of her.</p>

<p>TH 177: Well, sometimes that happens because kids think that there parents are going to ask too many questions, and where are you going . . .</p>

<p>M 64: Or, tell her now . . .</p>

<p>F 70: Well, that's the basic questions.</p>

<p>TH 178: But sometimes kids want to put that boundary in there. They don't want their parents to ask questions. They just don't like their parents asking questions.</p>

<p>M 65: But it's not just from teenage. It's been back even when she was little she would not tell me things.</p>

<p>F 71: Us. She would not tell us.</p>

<p>M 66: Well, I know she made plans to go over to the library with somebody, and their parents were picking her up. Well, all of a sudden she is flying out the door. I was down in the basement and she is flying out the door, and I didn't know about it. I didn't even know where she was going, and I just, you know, if I was there and she wanted to go to the library I would take her to the library or tell me that she's going, not sneak out on me, or . . . So, I mean this stems back from since she's been a little kid.</p>

<p>TH 179: Maybe she feels like you guys are too controlling?</p>

<p>M 67: I don't, I, I've never been, I don't feel I've been that way over her. I've worked most of my time so I mean, there is, you know, I just . . .</p>

<p>TH 180: Are your parents too controlling? Do they ask too many questions? They want to know what you are doing? They are bugging you to do this, bugging you to do that? You just want to be left alone?</p>

<p>D 110: No, they are not really controlling.</p>

<p>TH 181: No.</p>

<p>D 111: They just like to know where I'm going.</p>

<p>TH 182: And you don't want to tell them.</p>

<p>F 72: Why? Why do we want to know where you are going?</p>

<p>D 112: So that if something happens I get a hold of you.</p>

<p>TH 183: And what do you think about that? Do you think it's okay? Are you happy with the way you got life Pam?</p>

<p>D 113: It's all right.</p>

<p>TH 184: Would you like it to be different?</p>

<p>D 114: A little bit better.</p>

<p>TH 185: What would be better?</p>

<p>D 115: I don't know, I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 186: Do you think about what it would be like if it were better, or do you just not even think about it?</p>

<p>D 116: I don't even think about it.</p>

<p>TH 187: Are you afraid to think about it?</p>

<p>D 117: No.</p>

<p>TH 188: Am I upsetting you now? So I can keep asking questions? I told your parents not to ask too many questions, and here I am asking a million questions, you know. Some guys got a lot of nerve, you know. Do you ever think about the future, or do you just take it a day at a time?</p>

<p>D 118: Day at a time, yep.</p>

<p>TH 189: That works better for you?</p>

<p>D 119: Mmhm.</p>

<p>TH 190: What would be bad about thinking about the future?</p>

<p>D 120: I don't know. I just haven't thought about it.</p>

<p>TH 191: You're not afraid of it?</p>

<p>D 121: Ha-uh.</p>

<p>TH 192: Do you worry about these guys dying? How long have you been worried about that?</p>

<p>D 122: Oh, I don't know. I can't even tell you.</p>

<p>TH 193: Ten years, five years. . .</p>

<p>D 123: Oh, more than that.</p>

<p>TH 194: Yeah?</p>

<p>D 124: More than that.</p>

<p>TH 195: How often do you worry about it?</p>

<p>D 125: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 196: Do you talk about that worry?</p>

<p>D 126: Ha-uh.</p>

<p>TH 197: What do you do when we talk about that?</p>

<p>D 127: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 198: Do you guys talk about that?</p>

<p>F 73: Every so often we would, and off she would run.</p>

<p>TH 199: Now, would you talk about it as a way to try to light a fire under her by saying, you know, we are not going to be here forever?</p>

<p>F 94:  That's, that's about the size of it. We're not going to be here forever. 
 
<p>TH 200:  Because you don't look like you are worried about leaving very soon. 
 
<p>F 95:  I'm not. When I go, I go.</p>

<p>M 68:  I hope not. But, there is that possibility. I mean . . .</p>

<p>F 96:  I just hope I go before she does.</p>

<p>TH 201:  Yeah, married people do that, you know. They get into when they get older, I mean you guys are young. But when they get older they start racing each other. They get in their seventies, eighties, they start racing each other. Who is going to get there first.</p>

<p>F 97:  No, we got a neighbor who is in his seventies and he just got married.
 
<p>TH 202:  Yeah. God bless him.</p>

<p>F 98:  He got remarried. His first wife passed away, and he just got remarried. So . . .</p>

<p>TH 203:  So, what would happen to you, Pam, to you, if they died. Would you be okay?</p>

<p>D 128:  I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 204:  So you like not to think about it.</p>

<p>M 69:  See that's something we worry about.
  
<p>TH 205:  Yeah. So do you guys talk about it? You and Adrian talk about it. 
 
<p>M 70:  Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p>

<p>TH 206:  But you don't talk with Pam?</p>

<p>F 99:  Pam won't talk. She won't even be in the room with us.</p>

<p>M 71:  I think we've mentioned it to her.</p>

<p>TH 207:  Don't talk to anybody else? Do you talk to anybody else?</p>

<p>F 100:  You talk to Jesse.</p>

<p>D 129:  Well, that's different.</p>

<p>F 101:  Well, he said anybody else.</p>

<p>TH 208:  Who is Jesse?</p>

<p>D 130:  My bingo partner.</p>

<p>TH 209:  Oh yeah.</p>

<p>F 102: It's an older lady that she goes to bingo with, I guess, she could be in her seventies.</p>

<p>TH 210: Yeah? Jesse's a good lady? So you can talk to her about lots of things.</p>

<p>D 131: No, I wouldn't say lots of things, but . . .</p>

<p>TH 211: Some things.</p>

<p>D 132: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 212: You wouldn't talk to her about something personal like that though.</p>

<p>D 133: Nope, nope. Jesse spoils me like a grandkid. She spoils me.</p>

<p>TH 213: She what, spoils you?</p>

<p>D 134: Like a grandmother would.</p>

<p>TH 214: Yeah? That's good and that's bad?</p>

<p>D 135: No, not really, that's good.</p>

<p>F 103: Well, girlfriend in fact would treat you that way too if you would do things for her.</p>

<p>D 136: Please.</p>

<p>TH 215: What would happen if you won a lottery and part of it was that you go your own condo, you know. And so fully furnished and . . .</p>

<p>D 137: Let's go guys.</p>

<p>TH 216: You'd bring them with you? Yeah. You don't listen to them, you plug your ears, but you'd bring them along.</p>

<p>D 138: Yeah. 

<p>TH 217: Now you know when you are talking to a psychiatrist and you say that they are liable to say maybe you have a problems separating, you know. What do you think?</p>

<p>D 139: Sure, I'd rather stay home.</p>

<p>TH 218: Yeah? Now, is that a problem, or should everybody just sit back and accept that?</p>

<p>D 140: I don't think that's a problem.</p>

<p>TH 219: So, it's not a problem as far as Pam considers it. So everybody just ought to leave you alone with it.</p>

<p>D 141: That's true.</p>

<p>TH 220: Do you ever get kind of worked up about things and wish you had somebody to talk to about it?</p>

<p>D 142: Ha-uh.</p>

<p>TH 221: So, you're not a talker. You keep things in? So you guys are not the only people she doesn't talk to. She doesn't talk to anybody.</p>

<p>M 72: No, she talks.</p>

<p>TH 222: Oh, who does she talk to?</p>

<p>M 73: If we get out and it's a family gathering, if somebody will talk to her, she ends up rattling off, and I'll even to say to him once in a while, look at her over there talking like crazy, and I says yet she can't talk to us. I don't know what the conversations are, but you know . . .</p>

<p>TH 223: But, you know, how unusual do you think it is for well you say this went from, how old was Pam when she stopped talking to you?</p>

<p>M 74: When she stopped talking?</p>

<p>TH 224: Two or something?</p>

<p>F 104: When she started talking she stopped talking.</p>

<p>TH 225: So, it goes way back.</p>

<p>F 105: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 226: Does that remind you of anybody in the family? Are there any great non-talkers in the family?</p>

<p>M 75: Well, Pam is adopted, so we really don't know too much about her, and I just felt that, I, I just thought that maybe she kind of associated me with suffering or something because I was the one that was always, you know, taking her here and taking her there.</p>

<p>TH 227: Maybe she thinks you worry about her too much. Do you?</p>

<p>M 76: Well, I do worry about her, yeah. But you know the way things are out there, you know, nowadays, you can't say, you can't worry. Like when she comes home at night if she comes home late I always tell her to make sure she wakes me up, you know, so I know she's home.</p>

<p>TH 228: Would you say you're an anxious mother?</p>

<p>D 143: A worrywart?</p>

<p>M 77: No, I don't walk the floors.</p>

<p>TH 229: You go to sleep anyway.</p>

<p>M 78: I do go to sleep.</p>

<p>F 106: She goes to sleep but she's not sleeping. Do you have children?</p>

<p>TH 230: Do I? Sure.</p>

<p>F 107: I don't know how old they are, but when they're out late, you go to bed, you're sleeping, but when that door opens, the outside, you're really out.</p>

<p>M 79: Yeah, but you know that I'm a very light sleeper. I hear all sorts of noises and stuff.</p>

<p>TH 231: Now, you know when we've been talking both Judy and Pam get tearful. I'm not sure what the tears are connected to. Do you know?</p>

<p>F 108: I don't know. I think Judy really wants Pam to love her, to be a pal with her, and with Pam I don't know and Pam is just embarrassed to talk about it, and she is doing something that she doesn't want to do, so she will get very teary-eyed, and she's sorry that she's acting that way towards her mother, but she is still going to do it.</p>

<p>TH 232: Is Adrian right about what you are tearful about?</p>

<p>M 80: I don't know. I cry very easily. I can watch a movie and sit there and cry, and it could be the funniest movie in the world, but I still cry.</p>

<p>TH 233: So we shouldn't pay any attention to those tears?</p>

<p>M 81: Not always, no.</p>

<p>TH 234: Is there a difference between when you cry just because you are a sentimental person and when you cry because there is something really pinching your insides?</p>

<p>M 82: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>TH 235: How can we tell the difference?</p>

<p>M 83: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 236: Can you tell the difference?</p>

<p>M 84: I could probably tell the difference myself yeah.</p>

<p>TH 237: Do you let anybody in on . . .</p>

<p>M 85: No, I just hold it into myself.</p>

<p>TH 238: Mmhm.</p>

<p>F 109: I caught you a couple of times.</p>

<p>TH 239: Everybody holds up unto themselves. Do you do that too? Everybody goes off into their box, right? Pam does. She says, "Leave me alone." Mother says does and you do too. How come?</p>

<p>M 86: It's easier that way.</p>

<p>TH 240: It's easier. What makes it easier, Judy?</p>

<p>M 87: Well, there is no fighting, no arguing, or . . .</p>

<p>TH 241: So if you start talking about what's upsetting you then the fight would ensue?</p>

<p>M 88: Well, it might if it was something said that . . .</p>

<p>TH 242: You mean if it was critical or . . .</p>

<p>M 89: Yeah, if it was something, yeah . . .</p>

<p>TH 243: But suppose it was just sadness or upset . . .</p>

<p>M 90: Oh, I think we can talk about that. I think we talk about that if it was something sad or something . . .</p>

<p>TH 244: So if the tears are coming from frustration and anger and it's frustration and anger with somebody else and you try to talk about it, then it's not safe. But if it's 'cause there has been a loss, or your feelings have been hurt, or you are frustrated because things are not going well at work, then you can talk about that.</p>

<p>M 91: Probably, yeah.</p>

<p>TH 245: Now, what Adrian tells me is that you have upset feelings. I'm not sure they are hurt, that you and Pam somehow can't have the kind of connection you would like to have with your daughter. Is that accurate?</p>

<p>M 92: Well, I, yeah, I . . .</p>

<p>TH 246: And have you told Pam about those?</p>

<p>M 93: I've asked her, you know, to do things with me and . . .</p>

<p>TH 247: Have you told her about your feelings?</p>

<p>M 94: Oh, I think so.</p>

<p>TH 248: Has she Pam. Do you remember?</p>

<p>D 144: Ha-uh.</p>

<p>TH 249: Would you prefer her not to tell you?</p>

<p>D 145: Prefer her to tell me.</p>

<p>TH 250: Would you? So, if she were to tell you, "It really upsets me that you and I can't find a way to be connected and have fun together and be comfortable together." You want her to say that? Do you believe her Judy?</p>

<p>M 95: No.</p>

<p>TH 251: Why not? Why not?</p>

<p>M 96: Because if you knew Pam, she can sit here and tell you exactly what you want to hear.</p>

<p>TH 252: Is that what she's doing right now?</p>

<p>M 97: Mhmh.</p>

<p>D 146: No.</p>

<p>F 110: A lot of it.</p>

<p>D 147: No.</p>

<p>F 111: There is a lot of it that's sincere, but there is a lot of it that, because this is what she thinks you want to hear.</p>

<p>TH 253: Pam?</p>

<p>D 148: No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>

<p>TH 254: Now, you're mad.</p>

<p>M 98: Because, we've told her that.  You are going to tell us exactly what we want to hear.</p>

<p>D 149: No.</p>

<p>M 99: And nothing more.</p>

<p>TH 255: So, then if you tell her that and you are saying what I'd like you to do is to pick some things to do with me. You pick the day, you pick what we do, and I'll go do it, and I won't ask any questions, and I won't tell you what to do for the whole time we are out there doing it. We'll do what you want. I won't tell you what to do. We'll have a good time, kinda light and fun. Would she go, or would she never set the time up?</p>

<p>F 112: Never set the time up.</p>

<p>M 100: What was it? Last week Friday, Saturday. We went to get my hair done together, the two of us went. And, oh, she wanted to go out to lunch afterwards. Well, I knew it was late, and she knew it was late, but she insisted on lunch, so I says "All right. We'll go to lunch. You pick the place." And I just thought we were going to a fast food place, you know, real fast. Well, that wasn't so. We ended up at a restaurant. Well, that was fine. I didn't care. We sat there and I figured this is my time with her. I wanted this to be a good time, and so . . . And then she said, we were sitting there, and we were sitting, and I didn't know what to order because I don't normally eat lunch.</p>

<p>D 150: I said, "Why don't we split a taco salad?"</p>

<p>M 101: And I thought that was the greatest thing I could hear from her. So that's exactly what we did, and we ate, and we left, and we came home.</p>

<p>D 151: We ate, we ate.</p>

<p>M 102: But that was a great . . .</p>

<p>TH 256: So that was a success.</p>

<p>M 103: Yes. I really enjoyed it even though I was really in a hurry, but I decided this was my time with her. I might as well go.</p>

<p>TH 257: And so maybe you need to do that more? To just let it be on her time table and doing what she wants to do. Is that hard for you?</p>

<p>M 104: No. Ah, there was a time a couple of weeks ago he was out and I says to her, "Well why don't we go and play bingo together?" It was Saturday night, and I said, "We can go and play bingo." I had other things to do, but I thought she enjoys playing bingo, and I enjoy going out once in a while, and she said, "No." Then a little later on she said I'll call Jesse up and I'll get Jesse, and we'll go together. Well, I wanted this time together.</p>

<p>TH 258: Mhm, as opposed to having Jesse along.</p>

<p>M 105: And I said, "Well, forget it. I just don't care to go then." And, she didn't really . . .</p>

<p>TH 259: And your feelings got hurt.</p>

<p>M 106: Yeah, I would guess so.</p>

<p>TH 260: Now what do you think it is about Jesse that Pam's drawn to spending time with her as opposed to you?</p>

<p>M 107: Well, Jesse treats her like her granddaughter, you know, and that's . . .</p>

<p>TH 261: And you know how you treat granddaughters, like they never do anything wrong and you never criticize them. Whatever they want to do, that's great.</p>

<p>M 108: She takes her out to lunch.</p>

<p>TH 262: But there's a formula, so why don't you try Jesse's formula?</p>

<p>F 113: Because Pamela doesn't take Judy shopping. Go out for four hours . . .</p>

<p>TH 263: Well, why I'm just talking about . . .</p>

<p>F 114: That's what I'm talking about. Today that's where Pamela was today. Five hours. She went out and went shopping with Jesse. She knew we were supposed to come here . . .</p>

<p>TH 264: I understand, but, I think that, you know . . .</p>

<p>F 115: . . . and she knew she was supposed to help me with dinner.</p>

<p>TH 265: My thoughts on this whole thing would be that there would be something you could learn from Jesse in terms of what Pam feels comfortable with in a relationship. Not as a criticism to the two of you because Jesse doesn't have any of the responsibility. It's kind of easy. You know, that's one of the great things about being a grandparent, you know. I'm a grandparent now, for three years I'm a grandparent, and you know that's great. You get to go home. You get to not have to be responsible, you know, stuff like that. You get to not have to yell.</p>

<p>F 116: The ice cream you threw up tonight.</p>

<p>TH 266: But there is something to be learned from Jesse.</p>

<p>M 109: Well, like I said to him I says maybe she is looking for a grandmother that she doesn't have.</p>

<p>TH 267: Uhuh, where are the grandmothers? Were they ever there?</p>

<p>M 110: No, my mother past away when she was about, what, six or seven we decided, and his mother had also passed away when she was about three or four years old. So the grandparents, grandmas passed away very early, so she didn't have that.</p>

<p>TH 268: I don't want, I don't wanna dwell on this. I just want to ask a question about it because I know you've dealt with some of it in the other session. Is it easy for you guys to sit around and talk about the losses that you've had in your life like when the grandmothers died and when your son died and stuff, or is it hard?</p>

<p>F 117: Everybody but my son.</p>

<p>TH 269: That's ones kind of a no-no.</p>

<p>F 118: That's a touchy one.</p>

<p>TH 270: Real sensitive. Have you worked on getting that less sensitive or have you just left it in its compartment.</p>

<p>F 119: We just put it away and let it be there.</p>

<p>TH 271: Do you think it would be a negative to take it out of the compartment and work on it, or . . .</p>

<p>F 120: I think it would be.</p>

<p>TH 272: Okay, would you agree?</p>

<p>M 111: Well, we talk once and a while about the good times we had together with him.
 
<p>D 152: But that's it.</p>

<p>M 112: We remember things that we did together, so.</p>

<p>TH 273: Hey, Pam. I'm going to tell you something. You ready? I have a hunch, now it's only a hunch, but I have a hunch that one of the reasons you don't kind of move out a little bit more and find some things to do with people your own age is that you're a little bit scared, and I think you ought to work on that. I know it is not easy for you to talk about these things, but it might help to have somebody, and maybe you can talk to Jesse about it, and Jesse can help you with it. But I think that it would be worth it for you to start working on that. Does that make any sense to you?</p>

<p>D 153: Mhmh.</p>

<p>M 113: I think she needs to find a nice young man.</p>

<p>TH 274: Well, let's start getting, I understand, but let's not program it for her. I would like to see Pam take the step to do it in whatever way. I mean I don't care if it's a church social group that goes bowling or whatever she finds or whatever she wants to do. Mostly, so she has to confront whether it is that she is anxious and scared because then she has something that she can work on. And the more you guys are not hovering around to see if she is doing it, the more likely she is to do it. She will shut down and go back, you know. And it's hard not to because you wish that for her so much. You hear? I know that. But somehow she's gotta, and I think it's going to be scary for her, but I really encourage you to try to do it. She can talk to Jesse about it 'cause it's probably too scary to talk to you. She can maybe find somebody like me to talk to about this. I think it would be useful. But let her think about it. It's got to be Pam's idea or it's not going to happen, you know? Right Pam?</p>

<p>D 154: Guess so.</p>

<p>F 121: What's the small problem there, Pam? What is the problem with his last statement there, Pam?</p>

<p>D 155: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 275: What is it? What is it?</p>

<p>F 122: It's got to be Pam's idea.</p>

<p>TH 276: Don't you think that's true?</p>

<p>F 123: It's true to a certain extent, but Pam won't have the idea.</p>

<p>TH 277: Oh, but now I think there is a difference between having the idea and acting on it. You see my thought is that I bet the three of you guys, I've only sat with you for 45 minutes, but I bet the three of you guys can all be strong willed, strong headed you know? Am I right?</p>

<p>D 156: Mhmh.</p>

<p>F 124: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 278: Judy, you're not chiming in. So, I mean I would just like to see that, you know? I haven't figured out anything for you to do Adrian. That's not good, is it? I'm going to let you off the hook easy. You guys got any questions because we gotta stop. Okay, I want to thank you for coming to meet with me.</p>

<p>M 114: Thank you for coming. You came a long way.</p>

<p>TH 279: Yeah, but it's been enjoyable sitting and talking to you.</p>

<p>M 115: No, we'll keep trying.</p>

<p>TH 280: You gotta remember what I said now. Everybody going to remember?</p>

<p>D 157: Try to.</p>

<p>TH 281: Okay. I'll be checking up on you. Take care.</p>

<p>M 116: Thank you very much.</p>


<center><p><b>Treatment Plan for this Family</b></p></center>

<p>Guerin would probably begin the next session by checking in with the family to see if they had tried his suggestions. He would ask Pam if she had done any thinking about what was going on. He would check with the mother to see if she had thought about Jesse's method and why that worked with Pam and her's didn't. He might ask the father if he felt left out because he didn't have any assignments. He would then ask them what they wanted to work with in that session and he would expect that they would go back to Pam. He wouldn't be surprised if little or no change had occurred between sessions.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here's the tally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay thanks. This is a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So at least to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How's it going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So last week was weird. Last week was very weird. I was sleeping the whole week, I don't know what the fuck was going on but I was sleeping every day until like two, one. I don't know, like I was exhausted. It was really weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know and it happens to me sometimes so like its hard not to get a little hypo, not hypochondriac, I don't know if it's that I'm snoring at night and I'm not resting so like I'm not going into a deep sleep. I don't know what the fuck it is but the weird thing last week was it was all week. I mean it was all fucking week. When I left here on Monday, usually I'll go to Starbucks or I'll kind of try to get stuff done. I got all the way to Starbucks and there was something in me, I could just feel it. I was absolutely exhausted. [00:01:29] I don't know but then with all that shit with the fire department and the...it was already an exhausting week. You know what I mean? Like it was a weird week, I was already feeling that way and then with all that shit, I don't know. But here's the weird thing, Friday evening I think or late afternoon I saw this video of this army vet who went from not being able to walk that well to like losing tons of weight and I mean he was on disability, he was all messed up. So there's this amazing video of this guy who decided to learn yoga and he went to all these yoga teachers and told them his story and they were like "it's really hard for you, you can barely walk, so it's going to be very difficult to do all these poses." This one yoga teacher kind of took him in and the guy lost a shitload of weight and now he like runs, he's completely changed his life. The thing about it is I was sobbing, I was like "Maybe this is emotional? Is it somehow emotionally fucked up all week?" Cause I was like sobbing and that's not...it's very...anyone that doesn't get emotional watching this video is an idiot but to like be sobbing like that. I don't know if I just needed to have a really good cry and then like suddenly...(laughs) [00:03:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would make a lot of sense if there's something emotionally you start feeling stuck and broken inside, is it something about this video, this story I would guess? It's not just a generic good cry but something about that story let you get in touch with something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No...yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you were feeling all week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wonder what about this story?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He seems like such a nice guy, you know, and (pause). I'm pretty skeptical so it was also like the way the video was made with the music, it's just made in a way that's...it touches all those buttons but just the story itself, the guy, I mean he was a fat, he had to walk with those two things, like crutches or whatever, massive leg braces and stuff. He was an Iraq vet and they show him trying all the poses, he keeps falling, I mean it's just...it doesn't get better than someone who seems so sweet, that's so committed. You know what it is? It like, I can't explain. Part of it...[00:04:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you going to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean it's just like, puts you to shame a little bit. I wasn't crying because of that but for someone to be able to overcome something like that and someone who so seems to deserve such a sweet person, it just...I don't know, I was sobbing. It was really weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Puts you to shame?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's just like I can't go to the gym for fifteen minutes to get a little bit of exercise (laughs). This poor guy is like seriously overweight, disabled, you know. It gives you perspective. That's not why I was crying but that's one of the things I took away which I think is what you should take away from it. That was the message of the video, "Don't ever think you can't do something." I think that's what it was. The video was telling me something no one else had ever told me, you know, that you can do anything. And the fact that someone believed in him, you know, didn't give up on him. [00:06:21] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I was trying to remember the other times when I felt so exhausted, "Is this what happens? Something makes me cry and suddenly I feel a little better?" I think it might be sometimes, you know? Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You remember you were here Wednesday of last week you didn't allude to feeling exhausted at all that day. You didn't seem it, a lot of stuff came up on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did. [00:07:29] I don't know anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean all different aspects of getting in to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was Wednesday the day I was saying the weird shit my mom said or something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I often don't say that I feel so tired just because it happens kind of somewhat often but yeah I probably should have mentioned it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you remember having, that you had been feeling that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no. I was like, feeling really off all week. Really off. I mean yeah, that day that's all I did. I came here and even that day I woke up right before I had come here. Then I went back home, got back in bed and just kind of...took like a long nap, got up, kind of ate something, got back in bed, like I was just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depressed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like it was to the point to where I didn't mention it to my mom. I was feeling like so "What the fuck is going on here?" I couldn't even hide it, like in the evenings, I was just like...[00:08:50] Yeah I think I was totally like...remember I was saying I was kind of going down there and not being talkative. There must have been...I don't know. Maybe that's just going to happen sometimes, like doing this and my mind tends to have so many, I'm trying to do so many things, maybe sometimes it's just exhausting. I don't know. Or it gets to the point where it's like a bottleneck, like things are kind of flowing but then maybe there are times when it suddenly it just gets kind of plugged up so until I have a really good cry or something kind of nudges me over that hump I just feel like drained or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was it that your mother, you showed her the photo of Kelly to your mom? Do you remember when that was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was it the weekend or something? Like last weekend? Because I told you either...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You told me Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday. So yeah it was sometimes between the weekend and Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I have to wonder if that, what you told me about Wednesday was not with you as a piece of what...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:10:20] Like I was handling it kind of but in a different way I was kind of...you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was so much Brian. I mean I was floored by, in the here and now, things you were relaying she had said to you that weekend and I don't know how that wouldn't have been like a punch in the stomach and you were handling it, but how could there not be? You have a different set of eyes now and ears to hear and think about what she's saying to you that makes it now, it's just a heavy weight when this actually happens now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know. Maybe that's what it is, maybe like I just don't know what to do with that now. I'm not going to run away from my hometown just cause of...you know what I mean? It's like how do people, and I know I'm not the only one, how do people handle these things when they're still kind of around their families in one way or the other. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you do with those feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean you got to do something you know? [00:11:38] And also you know what it was? In retrospect, cause the other thing I thought after I had that good cry I thought maybe like over the weekend at some point, I mean, she shows Cecelia the kind of love she never gave me. Like how weird is that? It's just unconditional, she just melts. Like I thought of that and then there was one point where my uncle was over right around the fire department. I had gone downstairs to fix the garbage...like I got a lot of shit done, a lot of logistical, fix some stuff around the house, the garbage disposal, just the day before replaced some of the fire alarms, the smoke detectors and that day my uncle was there, he didn't do anything but he just...because he was there it kind of helped me to get some...I was like "Oh, uncle can you, I'm trying to fix this drawer." He looked at it with me, he didn't really do anything but just another pair of eyes helped me to be a little more motivated. You know, it helps. It's not like my mom wasn't grateful to me but I felt like she was more grateful to... she made it sound like he did something. [00:13:00] She's just a jerk about...she just doesn't get it, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, its stuff like that. Or like even yesterday I tried calling her all day cause if I don't hear from her for long stretches I get a little worried, like my grandmother or her in the snow or whatever. Her cell phone won't buzz or she doesn't hear it, whatever, it's like if I don't answer my phone after a couple times she gets kind of aggravated. I don't say anything. I'm genuinely concerned, I'm not annoyed, I don't give a shit if you're not answering, I just want to make sure everything's okay. It's just, I don't know, she's just a difficult person. That's just all there is to it. Like I said, it's not just with her, kind of with the whole family. I just don't...I'm just finding things more, in a weird way more exhausting when they actually happen, when little things happen that really annoy me and maybe cause now I just know what's what and I know there's really not much to say. I mean it would be ridiculous to have some kind of blow out, so it's almost like this very deflating kind of feeling, I guess. [00:14:41] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's a very good question what you'd do with all the feelings you're staring to have as things happen and you see them for what they are now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't think there's much more that I could do. I don't, you know, I mean even if I go down there I generally don't spend that much, at the most maybe an hour, I'll just visit for like maybe an hour but rarely...it's usually just a few minutes. I don't know what else you know. I don't think it would even be really that different if I lived across town, you know what I mean? You're in the same...you're here. My memories are here, my...and I don't want to run away. I don't put myself in this, you know? I'm kind of looking toward my future now, that's my house, I don't want to give someone else a grand or two grand, whatever it is, for some shitty apartment when I have a home that I'm comfortable in. So it's a balancing act of I love it here, I don't want to live in another town, I love it here. [00:16:07] So (pause)...I mean I think it is what it is in some ways, that's...you know. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I've been feeling better. I have a much more (pause) like I'm just taking care of myself, you know, they're not going to change, they're not. It is what it is so I have to try to...you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you say more about what the feelings are though? What do you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feelings about what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When she compliments or thanks you, is appreciative of your uncle and not you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like hurt and angry, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Angry at?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know, like...the thing is when I think about it, it's again the problem with all this shit is old feelings, because that day when I first, at the end of the day it seemed like she was thanking him more but you could argue it's because he was leaving and in a way she's also a smart lady. She wants to let her brother know, she's giving him a little extra to let him feel like she really cares that he comes around and it's...she's kind of sending him a signal, do you know what I mean? [00:17:54] But earlier when I first got home she hugged me "Oh, my son's here, he's doing so much today." In Assyrian she said very nice things. She gave me a hug so it's one of those things where if I had made a stink about it I would've just felt stupid, right after I had a blowout I would've felt like "Oh, that was..." So what I felt in that moment had nothing to really do with that moment. It's just years and years and years of just feeling like she doesn't appreciate or she... It all goes back to it doesn't feel unconditional, it doesn't feel, you know? She's a fickle, kind of difficult person who sometimes is very blunt and kind of oddly callous when she's usually not like it's this weird...its very my grandfather. [00:19:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what you were talking about last week was the photo and all the exchange around the photo. It wasn't just about the past. Do you know what I mean? She's actually saying things in the present that are very, very critical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I guess when I say the past what I mean is that if everything else had been different, your mom or your dad says something whacky in the present, you deal with it differently. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'd be much more like a little glitch, like "Come on Mom." There'd me more of a lightness about it. So that's what I mean. I think, I mean maybe not everybody's, but from what I've seen around me I feel like a lot of parents say some odd things that they maybe don't intend to say but that can be kind of hurtful, frustrating, whatever but when its coming after years of all this shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it's a rare comment that comes from something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it is pretty rare, she doesn't really say that stuff...I don't know. I'm not trying to defend her, it's shitty. [00:20:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah what about that is hard to stay with how I felt, wanting to defend her and protect her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What? No, no, it felt shitty. There's no way around it. It's awful. I don't even know what to say about it. I guess I'm so focused on the absurdity of it, maybe that helps me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're with me you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Focused on the absurdity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you're by yourself you complain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, yeah I don't think I'm focused on...I mean I think I tell myself that to try to feel a little better but...(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's harder to feel what you felt watching this movie when you're here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've always been like that right? I don't really cry in here that much, you know? It's just very private I guess. [00:21:24] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if it would help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if it would help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To cry? I'm not against it it just...I mean, I have but it has to feel, it has to come, it has to...can't force yourself. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another place where the couch can help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that? Oh, well maybe, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again it's just a tool but that's also one of the things sometimes it can do. You can find feelings in here without someone staring at you. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Maybe that's what I need to try. (pause) [00:22:42] I mean what I like about the way I'm handling all this stuff is I think there is a lot to be said for having a kind of like "It is what it is" attitude and not in a bad way but in a...I don't know, I think it feels kind of healthy to be like "You know what? Sometimes this is going to happen. Sometimes I'm going to feel whatever I felt last week or whatever. You know what? She's old and she's not going to be around forever." That doesn't excuse shit but it helps me to just...I don't know, like in tandem with this, because this is so like vulnerable and three days a week. It's awesome, I look forward to it but I think the balance of this is, it feels kind of good to be tough in a good way. [00:23:49] Like without ignoring how she is (laughs) or whatever but just be like "You know what?" The way...you know how you handle it? You handle it by giving a talk at the Assyrian library, you handle it by doing your work. My art, not the job job but...You know what I mean? I got invited to do a poetry reading, whatever, the biggest kind of creative writing association is having their conference here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. So not just a locally based thing you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it's a national thing. It's like the MLA. My friend who runs this workshop, whatever the fucking thing, they're doing a reading and she's like "Do you want to be the featured reader?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't said yes yet but I'm going to, you know? It's really not a big deal but these are the ways...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you considering not saying yes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of. I kind of don't care but I'm going to say yes. I think these are the ways, there's no other way. My mom's not going to stop saying bizarre shit. There's got to be a day to day, you know, and I think that's the way. That was the thing about that video and I think...also part of the crying was again it's that mourning. I think part of the crying was I'm finally kind of getting this now at a gut level instead of up here. Now I'm like "No, I want to finish my novel and I want to do this reading." [00:25:28] I want to have a talk at the museum and finish my record. That's the only way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that' s a piece of what's changed so much Brian in the last number of years and rapidly in the last...since we've started this, is your capacity to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To channel it now into ways that are healthy for you instead of self-destructive most of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: its enormous capacity to just grow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I was thinking about it. Other than feeling shitty about missing our appointments once in a while, like things are steady, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not some programmed, where I'm not doing my homework (laughs). I'm living my life and I don't feel so guilty about the Ph.D. or whatever. I think it's going to get done one way or the other at some point but I'm not sweating it. That's not my...I'm not a fucking scholar and I don't give a shit about it. I want to finish it for me. [00:26:33] So like I think that's the kind of stuff that does make me feel a lot better. I pulled up my manuscript for the new book and I was like "Shit man, some of these poems are really fucking good." I hadn't looked at them in months. There really is no other way. There is no other way. Also with Kelly, by not letting any of that effect...we had a fucking amazing weekend, we had such...like she's awesome. I was going to tell you this, this is the first relationship I've had where the sex has gotten better with the more open we've been...even the littlest thing, this past weekend was the first time I've really felt like we were really making out. Is that weird? Like really making out. And the sex....I don't know. [00:27:58] She's amazing. So that feels good. Like I'm not bringing any of that shit "Oh she's a little overweight, she's..." I don't give a fuck, she's fucking beautiful and awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And actually to find it when you're able to be honest with each other about sometimes when difficult things, getting your first fight, work it out, that the relationship, even the physical side of things, actually grows.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well and that was the thing, it was awesome that it wasn't even a fight. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? Miscommunication.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: First issue that you have to explore each other...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's amazing, we didn't even have any words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No yelling, screaming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and she was like "Hey we haven't talked in a couple days", she came over and that was it. I already see, like Friday, I thought we were just going to get together Saturday. She's like "Do you want to get together Friday too?" I can tell she's after that little, whatever that was, we both talked, we're both scared, she's very...it's different. [00:29:15] It's different. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if Wednesday was too much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean the whole week was too much but maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're just like...and we laughed about saying mental health break or taking mental health days, maybe you needed a break from here on Thursday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. The whole week felt like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I think I may have said this before, could've been years ago, there's a psychoanalyst, psychiatrist whose well known around town, died a number of years ago but remained a legend in the area who described the process of therapy basically as acknowledging, baring and putting it into perspective as a three stage process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bring that up right now because I think what used to happen for you is you would acknowledge and it would fly you into a panic and it would be totally deregulating what you would start to get to know about...and you've been increasingly finding a way on the outside, even if just finding perspective around it and I think that's what you're describing feels so important to you that you can say "It is what it is." [00:30:58] In some ways that's telling oneself to put it in perspective. The only thing I'm bringing up is that in here I think sometimes you also want to jump over from acknowledging, jump over baring and into putting it in perspective . That the baring part is hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if we only land in perspective without ever having gone through how bad it feels, what you have come to know, it's a shaky container.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Of course. Because some days that perspective works, some days it doesn't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if you've never really mourned and grieved and gotten angry or...so that you know it, know it in your bones and affectively, it's a different kind of knowing, it's more like a muscling through the perspective, which is so adapted that I think works for you a lot of the times out there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I don't disagree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you at?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just think what happens is like part of that side of me that just says "Well..." I mean there's kind of no time limit on mourning so it's not that that makes me scared but it just makes me feel like...the acknowledging part is definitely covered that, you know? I feel like the baring is like...that's kind of what I've been doing in a way. I know what you're saying but I kind of feel like...[00:32:38] I mean maybe the way I feel about it is like this is really helpful because when I'm alone I can like sob and not...the minute...you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me that's what works, it's a very private thing to me. I don't know but when it happens now I don't feel weird, I don't feel bad, I kind of welcome it, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're saying it actually could be helpful, this time it unstuck something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It always does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like for you to find the feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it always does. It always does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last time it felt very disturbing was that time I told you when I first got to London?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That felt really unsettling and that was only because I just felt really alone. I felt like there wasn't anybody I could call or hang out with and I just felt really weird and alone and just unsettled. Ever since then every time I've had a sob like that I've always understood the clear reason, more or less, and I've always felt better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So you're doing work in baring it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:33:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I feel like that stuff at home was almost like the homework, like that's the stuff you got to...you know? And I do wish it would happen in here more, I mean it makes me a little uncomfortable but I've been doing this long enough, I'm fine with it, but that's just not...it's got to just happen naturally, you can't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are times in here where it looks like it's going to but then you stop, it's like you're clamping down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you'll say "Ah, but whatever." Dismiss away from it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it mean something? I wonder what it means to just have the feeling in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I've had the feeling, the actual crying thing is hard for me to do. Not hard, it's just...it just doesn't happen in front of people that I just...and I'm fine with that I'm not trying to hold anything back. Some people...but I do know what you're saying, forget the crying thing but...[00:35:16] I mean it's hard to, you know, because I kind of don't know what to say about it. I feel it, I know it, its shit, it makes me feel like shit. I just don't...do you know what I mean? Like I literally don't know what other ways to say that it makes me feel shitty or something. Maybe you're right, maybe that's a way to not sit with it or something. (pause) Remember when I had told you that week I had lined up some dates on Okay Stupid?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I didn't go on any of them. There's this one girl who when we started talking we realized we were already Facebook friends...so is it...I feel guilty now but I'm going to tell her and send her an e-mail like "Look, full disclosure, I had a situation that was a little complicated that's no longer...it's kind of gone to the next level." [00:36:48] Is it bad though? She's like a musician, we kind of have the same circles, she's a musician and studies like trauma and therapy. So is it...there's no reason to feel guilty right? If I just hang out to make a friend, have coffee with her or something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) You're looking for like permission to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolve your guilt or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah because I feel like I'm being a little overly sensitive but I have no intention of anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've communicated that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm going to. We had made plans but I'm going to send her an e-mail and be like "Full disclosure, this is what's going on...you seem cool, we have a lot in common and we know a lot of the same people, could we just grab a coffee..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would you feel guilty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's because I care so much about...I just....you know how I get. Things are going so well with Kelly I feel like... I just want things to keep going well, I don't want any weirdness. [00:38:00] Which is why, that's why I'm saying I feel like I'm over thinking and being overly...you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although if she heard you when you met someone new who you met on...you get caught in the context, (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course. There's a grey area but my feeling is obviously that part doesn't need to come up. She's someone that I'm Facebook fiends with only she's a musician. I have a feeling at some point our circles will overlap anyway and you know how I am. I'm kind of good at networking I just feel like you never know. It's good to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your motivation then meeting her sounds like it would be more like a networking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Networking and also it is nice to...I don't meet a lot of people that are so interested in like trauma and who are also musicians. Just someone to...remember what I was saying about my friendships and like I think I...at this point they're like Donnie, Mike, Matthew, three or four people at this point who I regularly...I don't know. I just think it's important to start branching out. [00:39:12] (pause) You know what it is, deep down, no matter what? I'm still not quite over the feeling of being totally alone, you know? I think that's...in terms of like really feeling? That's the feeling. I just...I'm still not quite, its way way better, when I am with like Donnie, like I don't feel alone, I feel very connected. But because all of that is relatively new it feels like it could just go away or whatever. [00:40:47] So I realize how deep that feeling is, you know that I just feel kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can feel fragile, uncertain. You could feel alone even when you're here. That's why I asked you about actually crying and the fact that it only happens in the most vulnerable way, alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not with company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well Cecelia's there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a start.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really is, I think. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wanted to mention to you a time change possibly if you wanted it although it would require a day change and I don't know how you'd feel about it so if you need to think about it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll take it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have one o'clock on Wednesdays opening up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll take it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'd do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, so it would be all three in a row.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [00:42:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, okay, so starting next week do you want to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So next week is when I'm going out of town with Kelly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I won't be here Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...and I think I won't be back in time Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For Wednesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe next week we can...so I'll miss Monday but we can keep Thursday, Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the week after, yeah totally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay so the week after starting Wednesday the 20th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great. Okay. That works.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's awesome. So it'll be 1, 12:50 and 11?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 1, 12:50 and 11:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 11:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes and soon the 11:30 is going to change to 3:10 (laughs). Lot of changes, I know this is getting confusing with the schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no it's awesome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay so we'll stick with Thursday, Friday this week and then start the new one next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's awesome. Cool. Thanks Tricia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a good rest of the day. See you.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well I'm thinking uhm, uhm, about how, uhm, I felt nervous about coming.  (Pause) I mean I felt nervous about coming back to PKW and I, it, uh must be combined with starting work.  But uhm, (pause) I do feel nervous about coming today and (pause) — I don't know, just when I was coming in now, I, it I, well I can't quite tell what my feeling was.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>I know in part, ah well in part it seems like I might be feeling nervous because, uhm, it seems like last, uh the end of the summer or the end is coming.  Before vacation I was not doing anything and, and saying, "I'll do it all in the fall, I'll change in the fall" or "I'll, uhm stop resisting," and things like that.  And now here I am and uhm (pause) I know uh, I mean I, I imposed a deadline on myself and I don't know if I can meet it.  I guess that is it, but uhm (pause) I don't know, it seems like the other part is that, uhm, well uh, I think at first I was anticipating your being threatening or something because of this deadline that I'd set for myself.  And so I was nervous about seeing you, and then, when I did and you, you looked very friendly, and uhm, I felt like responding, but then it was as if I couldn't respond too much or uhm — (pause) I don't know. (Pause)</p>

<p>What it made me think of is something FSO does when, uhm, I'm not sure if it's when she's attracting attention.  It's, it's usually when she's feeling pretty happy and anyway, somebody looks at her or smiles at her and calls her attention and, uhm, and she's clearly pleased, but she'll sort of duck her head and, and put on this smile that's uhm, well it's very controlled it's — you can, she, it's as if she'd really smile big except she's holding her mouth all in.  And so she — it's a funny little smile that she gets in those occasions, as if she can't really let on how pleased she feels or uhm (pause) — I guess what it, what I'm saying is, I didn't, I don't want to admit that I'm glad to see you or something like that.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>That, that made me think of something that was bothering me this summer.  Uhm, I mean it's the old thing but it seems somewhat different.  Uhm, well I guess in part, part of the reason it bothered me in the way it did is because of my anticipating problems right before I left that did not arise.  Uhm, and I think in part they didn't because my parents, except for a few days, never came to PTN.  And, uhm, I'm always much happier there when they're not there.  But uhm, (pause) I don't know, I mean, I mean it, it concerns MSCZ and uhm — well I can't even — it's as if I didn't want to admit I want to make love with him up there, except I had no excuses and I didn't really want to have any excuse.  I mean I didn't even try to find one to myself except on one occasion and then we were able to talk about it.  But uhm, (pause) but, I, uh, well I could even think about making love with him before hand, uhm, but then when we did I couldn't, somehow, really get involved.</p>

<p>Uhm, I know it was, if, well it makes me think of what just happened now and analyzing this feeling I had when I came in.  I've lost the feeling and uhm (pause) I know it, it seemed like something like that was going on this summer.  And maybe it was my attempt, uh, because I wasn't coming here, not to let some things happen that could have.  And uhm, I didn't go about it right, but, (pause) but I, well, I think what really disturbed me this summer though, was that in the end, it, no matter how many times I imagined making love with MSCZ or had dreams that uhm, were clearly involved with a desire to make love — and I don't know whether it would have been, if I just can't seem to analyze my dreams on my own and so I didn't even try — I have to admit, but uh, I don't, whether in the dream I had somebody else as the object, but uhm, it just seemed like no matter what I was feeling, even if I really was enjoying making love, which did happen, uhm, that there was no, I don't know, real feeling for MSCZ, I guess is it,</p>

<p>Or uhm, I, I, I don't know how else to put it, except it seemed like the concern was all for me, and uhm, somehow he didn't, or doesn't, still matter that much to me.  Or uhm, (pause) except times did occur when I was, could see I was still trying to, well, make him do things that he doesn't want to do, which are really things he considers I should be doing, and is accepted as things z,,,, women do — and uhm, like sharing the care of FSO and uhm, well, even sometimes — not so much cooking, but cleaning up and things like this that — well with FSO he really, he does share to some extent.  But if he has things he wants to do he, he never thinks of it in terms of, well you might, too, I have to say I do, otherwise the assumption on his part is, and I guess mine, that he'll do what he wants to do, and, it made me very mad one time. (pause)</p>

<p>Z,,,,, well I was just thinking that once — and uh, uh, I mean there were one, one or two times that he helped uhm, either with something he particularly wanted for dinner, and so he did it, or uhm, I was doing something and, and he helped clean up.  He didn't do it totally, but he, but he did do something.  I mean often he'll just get up from the table and walk away, leaving everything right on the table.  And uhm, I know I was just thinking, I really liked it when he did anything.  And, I don't know whether it's, it's, is totally, (?) why this, I'm not sure if it's totally, uhm, my trying to make him take over some things that are really my role or uh, they just seem on my part more of a feeling of being together.  But maybe that's why I felt that way.</p>

<p>Then I might, then the image I just immediately have is, of the things my father does, because, well, my father has this one or two special things he'll always do.  He always will make a salad if my mother wants one.  So it's not like he really helps with the cooking unless it's his specialty.  It's like considerate,(?) but he does help clean up.  And uhm I don't like the way he is cleaning up, so I don't want MSCZ to be like him, except it seems like, on the other hand I do want him to be like him.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>I'm th, thinking back to the one time I, I really got mad and I can't remember uh, somehow I felt maybe I was being a little bit dishonest but, now I ca—, I ca—, I'm having trouble remembering it, except that I know that I got mad over just this kind of thing that — well, it happened that there were a couple of days uhm, that MSCZ really literally almost disappeared and didn't want to have anything to do with FSO.  And I mean sort of, there he was to be fed and then he was gone again.  And uhm, I was just feeling very resentful because there were some things I wanted to do.  And, uhm, even if he didn't say right now "I'll take her for the morning" there were, just in our usual pattern, times when she'd be with him and then times when she'd be with me.  And uhm, and then she was, and then on this day when I got mad she was nap—, she'd just gone down for a nap and he came and wanted to make love.  And I knew he would and I think I would have been upset if he hadn't come because I had been thinking about making love with him, and wanting to in a way, I think.</p>

<p>But this is where I'm — because of the time I'd think it I'm not sure, because I was doing readings and things connected with school.  And uhm I'd often do it while she was napping and that was the time when I'd most actively think about making love with MSCZ.  But I was doing this thing connected with work, so I couldn't tell whether I think that way because I knew I wouldn't initiate it, since I was doing something connected with work, or if somehow I felt differently about myself because it was connected with work.  I, I don't know, I just couldn't, couldn't tell.</p>

<p>But anyway, this day he came as I anticipated and I really didn't want to refuse him, but I just wanted to, first, be mad.  And he immediately reacted, "Well, alright, never mind," which upset me then, because it's almost like my being mad was too effective.  Or, I mean I did, I hardly said anything, but I just wanted him to know I was feeling annoyed.  Uhm and I, I don't know, I couldn't tell whether that, again, was to tell him, really, "It's you asking, not me" or what.  Because I knew by getting mad he certainly wouldn't change and, uhm, I don't know, do more things around the house that he hadn't done.  (Pause)</p>

<p>There's one thing that came out of that was, uhm — th, this is where I don't know how honest I was being, because I put more on his not having done some things I wanted him to do, or felt that he should have been sharing in, and uhm, some of which I knew was unfair.  But anyway, he, he pointed out that I don't ask.  I don't come right out directly about something if, if it's bothering me, or I, if I really have something I want to do.  And uhm, and I realized that was true, that — (long pause)</p>

<p>Well I, I'm just trying to think, because the part I really was feeling dishonest about is the part I'm having trouble now recalling, uhm — (pause) but, well, I don't, I don't know whether part of my reaction was just, I don't like it when MSCZ is mad, or if I really care enough about him so I don't want him mad or just what it — I think it's more, I feel threatened, uhm.  (Pause) But I don't know, somehow I didn't even feel, at that particular time, that I — I know sometimes I felt, well, if he'd just say, "OK, have it your way, we won't make love," and then go away without seeming to be mad, then I know, sometimes that would have made me feel, "Good, I got my way," I guess.  But uhm, I really think, that day I wanted to get mad and then make love with him, which I, I mean I can hear the old pattern of fighting and then making love.</p>

<p>But, uhm, I don't know, where I felt dishonest was — I, I can't recall z,,,, what I said, but I know referred to this — thinking about making love to him, which I'd even been thinking about that day, and sort of going through the two things of anticipating his coming, hoping he would, and then hoping he wouldn't, or being mad at the thought he, that I knew he would.  And, uhm, well, I guess I felt dishonest because I knew, by saying, well, I was, I had even been thinking — because this had been going on several days actually — uhm, about making love with him that that would, anyway, begin to break down his anger.  So I used it, even though I don't think I said anything that was really false, but I used it, and — (long pause)</p>

<p>Because in a way I wa—, I was just thinking that, sort of generally — well, it's almost a symbol of the way things were — because, thinking about coming back to our bed here in PKW, which is a double bed, and then up in PTN we sleep in twin beds and uhm — I don't know, that just seemed sort of symbolic of, somehow — even though things were a lot better up there.  Uhm, we, we found a pattern that was working for us, but there was this distance and — (Pause) I guess that's why I thought I, I was thinking about wanting to make love to him.  It wasn't really being involved with him, so much as, uhm, centered around me.  Because I think I always felt, uh, even when things were quite, uhm, well, very pleasant, I mean it the nicest that it's been in a long time for us.  Uhm, somehow again it seemed like we were both keeping everything within certain limits or uhm, we'd found something that was working and that we weren't going to do anything else that might cause a lot of trouble.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It sounds very much like the balance that you were trying to keep before vacation.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>You know I, I think that's probably very true.  Uhm, what I, what I started thinking about was when the CFGs were up.  Uhm, I can't, I couldn't remember — almost 10 minutes after FRA had this conversation, which went on for a while — that, somehow she, without my asking her questions, told me that she had been going to therapy last year.  And that was something, I guess, I had suspected from her reaction she had that evening when we had gone out there right at the beginning of the summer and I had asked something, and I had other reasons for asking.  It was about whether she was going to take a course this year — and I, I think I mentioned it here — and she acted very strangely to the, in reaction to the question, and I had wondered at the time.  Then I thought, well, that's just because what I'm doing that I wonder if that's what she's going to be doing.  

And uhm, so she was talking about herself for a while and I kept feeling — I suppose I felt the need to tell her because she was telling me something similar.  But uhm, I don't think it was that.  I don't think — it was more, it was uhm, sort of, "Well, you think you're doing that, listen to what I'm doing," so much as just simply, she was sharing a part of herself with me somehow.  And, uhm, we were talking about things that were problems to both of us, that we were both feeling, and I wasn't sharing with her, or somehow I couldn't say, "I really know what you're saying."</p>

<p>So I did tell her about coming here, and uhm, without saying anything about what MSCZ's doing.  And he didn't, he didn't mind this time as long as I don't say what he's doing.  Uhm, but I got a splitting headache from this conversation and I couldn't decide why.  At the time I kept thinking about it and I couldn't figure it out.  And I, it went on for a day or two.  In fact it took me awhile to re—, sort of recover from it.  Because something that came up in it started me thinking things that uhm, I guess I didn't want to think.  I don't know, I didn't, I didn't say too much about myself.  It was just, more certain concerns we had about the way we were living.  And uhm, she was it, it came out mainly in terms of whether she was going to work or what she was going to do and how she didn't really know right now.  And uhm, but I thought, but what just came to my mind was, at one point she asked me how MSCZ was reacting to it.  Uhm, and I don't think she said anything about MNO then, but I just said that MSCZ was v, very supportive but that it wasn't easy and uhm, tried to imply that he wasn't going through — what I said, without actually lying, and uhm, or I, maybe I didn't — I kept it very neutral.</p>

<p>But anyway it, I guess what it was was, it started me thinking about my relationship with MSCZ and then, FRA's with MNO.  And she said something about how difficult it was for them and she did most of the talking about how he's feeling left out.  I guess she said something about, she used to talk about things with him that had gone on when she saw her uhm therapist, and then she'd found she really shouldn't.  And then he would feel he was being left out.  And just, I don't know, she was saying something about the strains and I just, was agreeing, yes, it was hard and, without adding anything.  But then I think I began feeling, uhm, that "You're, are saying all these things about the strains, but you're probably relating much better to MNO than I am to MSCZ."  And uhm, I, I don't know, I think it, it just, it was upsetting to me because it made me feel the, uhm, sort of, sort of, they have a relationship, and sort of the lack of one between MSCZ and me.  In a way, or maybe just — it was the middle of the summer when they came up, so it was in the middle of my keeping this very careful balance between us, uhm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think I felt something else too, because I, I still don't know quite what made me feel I wanted so much to tell FRA.  Except I think part of it was, I didn't want to go on and on about things.  I don't, I, I used to be afraid of that but I found, uhm, that I really don't like getting — I mean, if it's a shared problem I don't mind talking about it, but I don't like getting into too much detail about the way I'm thinking or things I'm feeling right at that particular, I mean uhm, that come out here.  Uhm, but I, I don't know, it seems, it seems like, well, I, I was afraid of something happening.  And I don't know whether I was afraid of something that I might start talking about with FRA or if it were, uhm, just that she was making me look again at uh, through what she was saying uh, it made me look again at my relationship with MSCZ.  Or, or just what, but uhm, I think I, I came away from it feeling very much that it, I had to sort of desperately get control of things or myself, uhm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think the reason I was struck by it too, was because I think when the conversation began I was list—, I was hearing what she was saying.  And it was sort of in response to what she was saying that I first considered telling her, and then suddenly was telling her.  It must be something more, because, with telling her, I think I lost the ability to hear what she was saying, and I had some need that uhm, (pause) well, I guess that I, I wanted to fulfill.  And yet then I knew I couldn't or didn't dare or something.  Anyway, it seems like it was something in that that was causing the tension I was feeling.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, if you blurted out ah, things to her, that you would regret afterwards, what would you blurt out?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I guess basically, the problems behind MSCZ and me.  I didn't want her to know, uhm — considering my view of what I think hers are with MNO, which might be erroneous because I'm sure they have a different view of MSCZ's and mine than really exists — but I didn't want her to know how poor our relationship is, I think.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>And I think, and the feeling got stronger and stronger, I think, as the conversation went on, of uhm, (pause) on my part, because I don't know how she was feeling.  But, uhm, I don't know, it was as if I were fighting for, uhm, status isn't quite it, but I became more and more, feeling that I should be in better shape with my life than I was feeling at the, during this conversation, that I think I am, given the time I've come here.  And she's only, I think she has only gone for a year to therapy.  And the way she was talking made me feel, I mean she feels very much that she doesn't know things right now, but yet the way she was talking made me feel that she's very close to knowing or somehow.  Anyway, uhm, maybe it's more th, things are more in her control.  Uhm, and, and I kept feeling things were less and less in my control in my life or, I don't know.   (Long pause)</p>

<p>But it seems to have centered z,,,, around wanting to hide the real relationship between MSCZ and me and uhm, and, or the kind of problem that underlies it or — (long pause).  I think at the time I was feeling a bit more that I wanted to hide the, I don't know, the true state of things between MSCZ and me because I was feeling that I was making a greater mess of things than she, uhm.  (Pause) I know it's almost like being in school longer and knowing less than somebody else or something like that.  But now, when I think about it, it's almost if, I mean this would be, well, because, I guess, of my view in the last day or two more than what it was then, but in thinking about, thinking more of this distance between us that well, we both maintain, but MSCZ was maintaining it because of me.  Uhm, I was maintaining it because of myself, uhm, that it was somehow not wanting her to know, so that the, the coldness in my feeling toward MSCZ, or the lack of it, and — (long pause)
  
I guess maybe it's uhm, well, it's something that periodically has bothered me, but it seems like, I mean, the next step from thinking about this coldness is thinking, d, do I love MSCZ at all?  Or can I, or will I if I stop resisting, uhm, something?  I don't even, I guess, want to name what the something might be, but uhm, (pause) I know.  And then, then I think, well the only, well, I guess I'm still afraid of being able to really look at that.  And then, uhm, I keep concluding the only way to maintain the marriage is to maintain it the way I was this summer.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think this is, well, I'm getting back to that time when I felt I was being dishonest with MSCZ.  I mean I, this is part of it too, because, I know us.  I mean, this kind of balance is the kind of thing that uhm, I mean, part of it that makes it work, that it keeps him just happy enough so that he doesn't just get sort of desperate.  And yet he is not really happy.  And, and it's almost like I know what I'm doing now, so that it's not fair to him.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about FSO uhm (pause) — and wondering, I guess, how she is.  Because uhm, well, it's not so much who I left her with — I left her with FTPZ, uhm took her over to MVE's — but it's uhm, more I guess that this is the first, well she didn't really remember FTPZ, and when we got there MVE was still napping.  He hadn't gotten up so that — I think she'd remember him if she saw him — uhm, but this is the first time I've left her, except for one evening this summer uhm unless she was in MSCZ's care, the whole, the whole month, and, so she looked like she was about ready to cry, except she wasn't crying.  (Pause) And, I don't know exactly why I think of it, except I do know that coming home and thinking about my relationship with MSCZ that, uhm —  z,,,, we've talked about this too — that what we're doing is, or I mean it's mainly me, but, sort of, FSO is the foundation of our relationship.  And, uhm, (pause) I can emotionally respond to her and then, and then I can't to MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Z,,,, and then I think, again I know this is something that we've talked about here, but, uhm, (pause) I, I guess I'm not probably thinking of it quite as, uhm, well, maybe not just in quite the same way, but, uhm, I mean it does seem like, now, now that I have FSO that's all I need to be.  Except it isn't, really, but it's part of this balance.  That's where I fulfill my emotional needs or something like that.  Uhm, well I, I was just z,,,, thinking about the, well I mean I can't say I never want another child, because I know there are times when I do, but it's because then I'm thinking of having a boy.  And so that becomes something else, but it, in just thinking of having a child, just a child, uhm, I mean this is why it makes me feel too, that, I mean as, I mean many other things do too, but that FSO's fulfilling something that she shouldn't be for me, because, when I think about having another child, often I don't really want to.  (Long pause)</p>

<p>You know, I was thinking about, I saw a girl today, uhm, somebody who responded to one of the notices that FDO put up in PBB and, uhm — FDO had already left PCHN (a foreign country) — but the uh idea, the, the man she lives with interviewed her and he seemed to think she'd be all right.  And then we corresponded and uhm I met her today and she seems nice enough uhm, but I, I, z,,,, I mean I just think I'm being very, well it's not being critical so much as I, I'm feeling very reluctant to turn FSO over to her, but I think I'd feel that about anybody.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because I keep, I, I think the fear I had about this is that I'm going to be with her, uhm, very little time, although (?) really isn't going to be that little.  But when I think about, now that I'm with her practically the whole day, it seems like, or having just been with her the whole day, it seems like it's very little time.  And so that then our relationship will change.  And I guess what basically I'm afraid of is that I won't be important to her then.  Or uhm, I want her dependent on me and, uhm, and somehow too I, I'm feeling, even if she is, I won't know her.  Somehow, by being away so much and FSO being with one other person, which I think is best if she could be with just one other person, but that then FSO will know that person and turn to that person and that person will know FSO the way I have known her.  And I don't know whether it's just having control or uhm, and of the feeling of having total control over her, which I guess I feel now uhm —  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, we have run out of time.

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>Inaudible at beginning</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: not much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "(chuckle)" What's up with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(chuckle)" What's up? I don't know. umm, things are pretty good, I guess.</p>

<p>I think I was just thinking on the way over here in the taxi that I can't believe I'm 32 years old, I still feel like such a child you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ummm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I was thinking of a conversation I had with my par-, my mother I guess, that I just feel like such a child whenever I talk to them. I guess I was just remembering a conversation in my mind and thinking, I'm 32, "(chuckle)" I'm not you know, I'm not a child anymore but I feel like one whenever I talk to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ummm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ummm, other than that, uhm, I don't know things are okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Last week we were talking about ah you were angry with your parents, do you want to pick that up or . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, I guess when I try to drum it up it is really you know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh if it doesn't come to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is really deep "(chuckle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are you today? Like where, how are you feeling about being here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I guess last week was a little strange "(chuckle)" so . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just uncomfortable, I don't know that doesn't necessarily have to be strange.</p>

<p>Again, I just have the feeling of like I'm not getting it you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are not getting it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah help me out; can you explain a little bit more about not getting it? Or feeling it while you are here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I just think it makes me feel "(chuckle)" really uncomfortable. Obviously a (inaudible) laugh. But uhm, uhm,</p>

<p>I don't know, I mean maybe I'm expecting, I was expecting something different I guess. I don't know, I feel like, I don't know, I really</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were expecting something different? A different kind of therapy? Or a different experience?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a different experience. I mean I don't think I was expecting anything in particular from the therapy. I wasn't sure, you know, I didn't analyze what it was going to be about. But I 'm not sure if we are getting anywhere or we are you know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhuh, what is that like to say that to me? To say uhm I'm not sure we are getting anywhere, I have some doubts? Bringing your doubts in here? Is that part of the uncomfortable . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, yeah I guess it is. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it hard to tell me that you are just; you know you are not ahh sure about the therapy . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: . . . sure about me as a therapist?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess in gen "(chuckle)" yeah, yeah. But I'm general that it would be hard for me to do that, because I don't think I like to uhm impose my feelings upon people I guess. I just, I guess I deal in my own little world and I don't, I'm kind of very accepting of everybody else and what they feel and they don't, you know. Like that is what I think. Who says I'm right? I'm not necessarily right, you know. I guess I'm not a very aggressive person in that way.</p>

<p>2:10</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you afraid of when you tell me, you know, I'm not sure about this, I'm not sure about you? What are you saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, it's just not a nice thing to say I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are afraid of hurting my feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just, it feels like such a mind game to me. I've never felt this way before, I really haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A mind game?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah like okay, I figured I came in I went through the whole evaluation talked about the issues I think I have. And uhm, I mean maybe because I know this is the research project, maybe that's skewing my opinion a little bit, making me try to figure out you know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If we are doing it to be innovative and different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (talking over counselor) Maybe I don't I don't. No offense, I don't mind innovative and different. But maybe, maybe I just don't trust it as much because I feel like and because I don't understand it. I mean if I "(chuckle)" understood what was going on I wouldn't feel this way. But because I don't understand the type of therapy and I feel like, I don't feel like I'm not getting anywhere because certainly these issues that have come up a little bit about my parents and about anger I'm feeling. Certainly that is something that I don't deal with at all and that is there. So I don't feel like we are not getting anywhere, I just don't understand the process and it makes me very uncomfortable. And it makes me questions if you even understand "(chuckle)" really what is going on, you know what I mean? And then that leads to, well whenever you say like explain your feelings you know, I just feel like, well it's just like that is what I mean that I feel like it is an experiment. Like you just want to see how a patient, not necessarily me, but a person in this situation would react like is that what this whole thing is about? Trying to see how, you know, the pers-, you know, the patient is going to react, I don't know, maybe . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: yeah, yeah. So I heard a lot of things there. I heard, you know, you have some, you do have some maybe not doubts but just questions about you know really what this is all about. And maybe some doubts about whether it is really useful for you and the fact that you don't understand (inaudible at 3:39). And then also, whether I'm really taking you into this, as someone I'm hoping is an instrument in a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I feel that yeah. To a degree, not completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhuh. How do you think I feel? Do you know what I mean by that question?</p>

<p>4:01</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah. I guess in a couple of different ways. I think that, I have felt a couple of different ways through the different times that I have come here. Once, one time, not last time but the time before I felt like I trusted, like your feelings were more genuine and I trusted you more. Like I felt more of a connection and like you really cared. And I think you care, because you are supposed to, because that is what it is about for me you know but</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I care because I'm a therapist and I am supposed to care about my patients</p>

<p>PATIENT: right. But, uhm, I think you don't understand me. I think you have said that to me, that is why I think that I mean you have said I wait, you know, you have expressed confusion also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhuh, uhuh. What is it like when I have expressed confusion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's scary because I feel like you are supposed to know what is going on "(laughing") you know what I mean? "(laughing)" But I don't think that necessarily has to be true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know when you laughed just now I smiled too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I wonder you know, you said it's scary. That is not, you know, that is something important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is scary about that? If I don't know what is going on all the time? Or if I don't know what is going on maybe at all? What, what is so scary about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess then I don't, and then I don't understand the point to this. If you don't, you know, if you don't understand what is going on, maybe it is about figuring out what is going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's about me teaching sort of not taking care of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably "(laughing)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it seems always to be my issue. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No because I'm this stupid grin. But no yeah, it's just, I guess that's what it is all about, figuring out how to be okay by myself and not feeling like someone else has to take care of me or my feelings, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know again, I would I would prefer if you could just sort of look at the fact that you don't feel taken care of when I say I don't know what is going on. That is something that you feel and I think it is important to look at and understand. I'm not as interested in just putting it aside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I try something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With you? You got a chair here. If you don't feel comfortable just</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, you can stop me. But uhm, why don't you explain to maybe to me I could be there about how you feel when, you know, this person doesn't seem to be taking care of you. You know talk from that place where you feel that you want to be taken care of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what? "(laughing)" It makes me mad. "(laughing)" I can't talk to an empty chair. "(chuckle)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, you want to talk to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that, do you feel like I can't talk to you unless like, like it is easier not to tell someone directly how I feel that if I'm just like taking it out on nothing I will feel better about it?</p>

<p>6:01</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I thought maybe some of these feelings you are having are hard to express to me and I thought maybe we could work with a chair or maybe you know what I also thought that maybe they are hard to express because you put a lid on them and think I shouldn't feel that way. Very quickly, so I thought maybe you could work with an empty chair.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you want to tell me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is weird because I'm not trying to avoid the feeling "(chuckle)" it can come up again "(chuckle)" you know. But when I start feeling that way and maybe it is what you are supposed to be doing and maybe it is working, but when I start feeling that way I automatically it's not anger towards you it's anger towards my parents. You know, like a big ball comes up.</p>

<p>Like when you said how do you feel when you don't know how to take care of me, I started to feel angry. But it wasn't really towards you, it was then, then it goes back to my parents. It makes realize that I'm, you know, maybe, maybe my whole life I have been mad you know at my parents and I have never addressed it, then I have just swallowed it. Because I don't think I'm mad at you. "(chuckle)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe when we turning it back on your parents' life you are turning it back on yourself. And not expressing it. I mean I'm the one that didn't take care of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)" But maybe you are not supposed to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But those are your feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I am just so good at twisting it around, aren't I? "(laugh)"</p>

<p>It feels weird to be angry with someone I don't know. I don't think I am angry with you. I really don't. Maybe the situation because I don't understand it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel angry with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: For one flash of a second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't believe, I'm just thinking am I really do I have all this anger inside of me? I'm thinking I'm not angry person; I'm not an angry person. Or it never happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: uhuh, uhuh. Last week you talked, I think as strongly as you ever have about feeling angry with your parents.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? "(chuckle)" I guess it is a very uncomfortable feeling for me, I don't know, it's just it's totally unfamiliar to me. I don't know if I learned somewhere not to be angry about things, where? Because I don't remember ever in my life having a conversation about it or thinking about it or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: uhuh. What is the uncomfortable part?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just doesn't feel natural to me, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel natural. It doesn't feel natural like when your angry or feeling angry it doesn't feel comfortable if you (inaudible at 7:45).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't like, if anger comes up, I guess I don't know how to deal with it so I just don't. I just uh uh I don't feel that way, I'm not going to feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just put a lid on it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't. It is not as if I think I have so much anger pent up, because I don't, I really don't. But obviously, I have some, I just don't, I don't</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about this feeling anger? What are your . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it makes me feel out of control when it comes, you know it makes feel, I don't like the way it feels at all, it makes me feel . . . I'm not going to yell and scream. I'm not a yeller you know. What do you do when anger comes up? What do you do? It is an uncomfortable thing to feel. And is it productive? What do you do with it? What? Do you know? "(chuckle)"</p>

<p>8:16</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you do with anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you asking me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean do you take it out on someone else? What is the point of that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I were to answer you and give you my answer, what would you do with that? What would that, would you believe me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it be useful to you to hear what I have to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, because I think what you do with anger is you express it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But how? By yelling at someone? Like I fell angry right now, like I'm feeling angry right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are feeling angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling angry about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess I'm just letting the feeling come up that I'm just feeling angry about not understanding the situation and not feeling comfortable. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well give it to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think anger is a self-defense mechanism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give me your anger. Give me your anger about not feeling comfortable here and not knowing what is going on and not feeling like I'm taking care of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)". I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is your, I want to know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>I feel like such a child. This is really, really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said I feel like such a child.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it is just feeling of uhm not being in control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not being in control in here? What feels out of control in here to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I'm being manipulated you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, again now. You are aware of that right now when I ask you that question. When I'm asking you those questions to give me your feelings it feels like a manipulation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(chuckle)" yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it that that is a manipulation? How does it feel like a manipulation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe it is just because it is something I'm not comfortable doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we are getting the anger back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughs)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it coming back a little bit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>So if anger comes up, which it is, I still don't know what I am feeling angry about. I feel like an actress, like I can call up emotions, like I can let myself feel emotions. I don't have a problem with that I am a very emotional person. So here is the anger but I don' know.</p>

<p>10:02</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel it right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit but I don't feel like it needs to be directed towards anything. I just feel like it is a big ball of anger that is just hanging out there. "(chuckle)" It's not like necessarily anger towards you or the situation.</p>

<p>So why am I so uncomfortable telling people if I am angry with them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well actually right now, I'm wondering if you could express the anger, whatever it is this very sort of vague unclear anger. How would you want to express it? Maybe it's not with words.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to express it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's getting a little angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)" probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "(laughing)" What do you (inaudible at 10:37)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I really don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: yeah, I think you do. You know my impression is kind of like, you are setting some limits in here. Its like you are saying, kind of back off, that's enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I am doing that I'm not doing it on purpose</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I don't, did you think I was criticizing you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no no no. I know your saying that as far as I am comfortable going obviously like I am you know that I am putting, setting limits. But uhm like consciously I don't feel like I have to, I don't. I just don't understand the feeling at all; I just do not know how to deal with it. It is completely unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it is understandable. I mean you are not; you have never really expressed it before in any regular kind of way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I was about to say. If I'm just, I can't even argue with people either. If I feel strongly about something, I can I can put my foot down. It's not like I don't, it's not like I shy away from arguing or being assertive or anything. You know? Then I thought about that after I was going to say that, I thought if someone were to kind of instigate and make me feel angry for some reason I think I probably would, would just like walk walk away and not deal with it.</p>

<p>Even in a conversation I don't know. That is what I was thinking. I was thinking do I ever really get angry? And I don't and if someone makes me angry what do I do? I guess I avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because there is some risk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it could be though. What? Is someone not going to like me if I get angry? I don't feel like that is it, I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there must be something that is uncomfortable about it, there must be. But we will, we'll just work on it. We don't have to figure it out right now. We have to go at a pace that is comfortable for you.</p>

<p>You look troubled.</p>

<p>12:06</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, you know, it bothers me. I'm like well "(laugh)" is this what it is all about for me? That I have all this, you know. Will that make me feel better if I get my anger out towards my parents or towards, you know, I don't know.</p>

<p>I was thinking about Cole, whom you know, things are great with us and he has like totally let his wall down. But when he deals with things in anger I don't like it all. I could never see myself being that way.</p>

<p>And I think about my father and you know the few times I have ever seen, you know, he deals with things very calmly and rationally and you know he has certainly raised his voice. Not very often. But I'm trying to remember how that made me feel, I guess I am just like trying to associate with what I feel about anger. I guess it is always, no one likes to hear someone yelling and screaming you know. I mean doesn't it make you uncomfortable when people are angry?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It is not a comfortable feeling. It is not a comfortable feeling. I think that on the other hand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I think people are allowed to be angry. I don't think it is an inappropriate feeling, I just don't think I feel it "(chuckle)" very often. And I don't know why. I mean I don't see anything wrong with it, I just have never chosen to deal with things that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But all the examples you just gave me of people that you know getting angry (inaudible at 12:57) it didn't sound like something that you thought was a good thing it's very uncomfortable for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not so worried about how you know, other people react you know to anger, it is not a very nice feeling. It pushes people away and it pushes you away when (inaudible at 13:09)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You ask me how I react. No I don't, I don't love peoples anger. It is, it is a risk. There is some risk involved.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But rather than getting mad at other people I choose to beat myself up instead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some ways it is safer. You know with your relationships, right? I mean that might have been the solution that had you come up here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>So then it all goes back to me needing "(chuckling)" to have someone take care of me and not risking, you know, anything to make that person walk away, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You somehow believe that if you did get angry they would walk away, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, I really don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. We are just guessing now, it feels like guessing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what are you thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like, being aware of what I feel like. It's uhm, you know I guess I feel a little stirred up and a little angry. Doesn't feel good. Physically it doesn't feel good. I feel tingly and tight and</p>

<p>So even if I let that feeling come up, then what do I do with it? "(chuckle)" you know?</p>

<p>14:09</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you feel it in your body right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(chuckle)" yeah. When I stop, yeah, when I'm not talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel it in your body. You feel you're tingling? Your stomach feel knotted or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just tight, just tense, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think you would feel like, if you, you know kicked something or</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would feel stupid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't see the point in that at all. Maybe, is that an easy way out for me to say that, I mean to say, you know I'm not going to feel my anger because there is no point in it? You know? Maybe, I don't know. But I really don't feel like there is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: uhuh that is easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess my parents would say the same thing. "(chuckle)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your parents would say what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean certainly, God, when I was growing up did my parents yell and scream and get mad at us? Absolutely. So it's not like, it's not like someone unnaturally imposed this don't feel anger thing on me at all.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that some people just don't?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(chuckling)" feel anger. No, right. "(chuckling)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, maybe once when I was small I threw a fit and you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, maybe once I threw a fit and I was told that's not going to get me anywhere. I can see where that could happen.</p>

<p>I don't know, I'm just thinking that there are certainly a lot of times where I should feel angry about things but I just don't, I just feel bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have at times, you know like when I was going through things with Cole where he would be really ridiculous and yell and scream out of his own insecurities or whatever. Where I probably -yawned said excuse me- should have like yelled and screamed back and said screw you and hung up the phone. Where I'd be, but no, instead I get all upset and worried about, exactly. I'm not going to fight back, because he is not like, you know, then I could lose him and yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>

<p>You know, maybe I am scared of losing people if I get mad.</p>

<p>16:02</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you said that, what, you have sort of a sadness. I don't know, I don't know what you are feeling just now. I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it just kind of felt like a resolve, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A resolve? Kind of like what can I, what can I do this is who I am?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I realize now that maybe I have done that and that I'm sure that it's not necessarily the right thing for me. Okay, so now what? You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you have made the decision to try to get angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so. I mean, I think I can try to let myself "(laughing)" it will be weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be hard too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I can't just say all right now I am going to get angry, right, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "(chuckling)"</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can be conscious of it. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem sad now, are you sad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do? Maybe, yeah maybe a little bit.</p>

<p>Maybe a little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just struck by the conjecture that maybe one time when you were little you got mad and someone said 'you can't do that'. You know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just can imagine that having happened because I just know I was so scared when I was little of you know, if I think about it, I was really scared of losing my parents, losing their love. So I'm sure I would have done anything. I don't know, that is a guess, a total guess.</p>

<p>So funny, because this is totally on a different you know thought but I'm thinking I guess what I would have done to make people love me, you know? Or why I would have thought - I just started thinking about uhm - I guess when I said that I started thinking about times that I got in trouble and stuff. You know what I mean? Maybe thinking could I remember anything that ever happened like that.</p>

<p>Then I remembered, I used to lie a lot when I was little. I used to make up stories, like I would go to my neighbors, I was literally, and oh God I don't even know but I remember this. I was probably eight or nine and I would make up stories. I told my neighbors once that I was on a ski trip and won a medal or something like really ridiculous and it got back to my parents. I just, it's like why was I always trying to get people to like me or love me or, you know? Or be someone that I wasn't, you know what I mean? Or try to make myself seem better than I am?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So people would pay attention to you? Admire you?</p>

<p>18:01</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I have always been that way.</p>

<p>And if my parents had anything to say about it, they would say 'you were born that way, you are just eccentric', you know they really would. That is my parents' answer to everything. So I have always been that way. Not that they have any responsibility in it, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Touched on some more anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: uhuh.</p>

<p>Do we have ten; I didn't know what time we were done at. Are we done on the hour?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah yeah, we finish on the hour. Why what were you thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I just thought we might be running out of time. So I didn't want to uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to get into something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I thought maybe quarter of, for some reason I thought maybe you would start standing like that's it. But no,</p>

<p>My parents' relationship is so bad and it is so screwed up. The first thing they will do, over the years as I have gotten older, if I go to them with a feeling that I have of you know, like of well you made me feel that way, you know. There is always a disclaimer there. Like 'well sorry if you feel that way but that is how you feel. But that is, you know, your problem and you have to deal with it'.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they have never taken any responsibility?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes, like sometimes, my mother feels guilty. She will say things like 'I wish now, I wish we had given you' - you know their whole upbringing theory was, no don't give them, like very harsh realism. You know, really like where all the other parents kids were saying 'oh you're wonderful and you're beautiful and you're smart and you're brilliant' even if they weren't. My parents were like, 'you are what you are' you know? Not in a bad way, they thought they were doing the right thing, they thought you know. But now as we have gotten older - and I feel so stupid because I'm 32 years old why do I care, why do I even talk about this anymore? - But my mother at times will say, 'oh I feel badly, we really should have given you more praise and made you feel more confident because all of you' - my sister, my brother, and I - 'all of you, you know your self-esteem is lower that it should be and that is probably our fault' you know.</p>

<p>They say it is their fault because they didn't you know, their approach to raising us was like, we are going to tell you like it is, we are not going to sugar coat anything. You know? They were always like, 'look you have to be independent, you have to take care of yourself and you know that is the way life is'. They tried to be very, so a lot of support was lost. You know what I mean? But they thought they were doing the right thing but it kind of backfired.</p>

<p>So once in a while you know my mother will make comments like that, you know? But uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is hard for you to tell me this stuff, right? I mean for to sort of go back and tell me some things about your parents that you didn't like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess, it feels like I'm betraying them or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you betraying them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I guess, you know in talking about their, the bad points. It's, you know, there is a good and a bad to everything. It's not you know, it doesn't mean that I don't love them, obviously. It's like they said, whenever I say that to Cole, my parents never loved, but they loved me. He is like 'why do you always do that? Why do you always have to say but they love me? That's not the point!' I mean he is really in touch with his anger "(chuckle)" so he is always trying to get me to, I guess, own up to mine to a degree and be like you are allowed to be mad at them.</p>

<p>20:07</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it feels like a betrayal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and he is like - he met my parents - and he is like 'their cold, your family is really cold'. They are, I mean I never really thought it before, but they are.</p>

<p>You know, like I had a conversation with my mother last night. I was talking about, you know Cole and how much I love him and I think we are going to get married. I do. You know she said, 'well as long as you're happy' whatever because I have been engaged before and she knew I was miserable. I'm like, no no, this is. She is like, 'well I really don't, I care about you and as long as you know don't let him be-'. Because you know I was having problems with him so I talked to her about them a little about too.</p>

<p>But like, she's like 'don't let him be competitive with you or really aggressive and don't let him beat you up and as long as you're happy I could give a shit about him'. You know what I mean? To her, that is her trying to be, like say 'you're my daughter and I care about you and nobody else. So as long as you're happy, I don't care who you're with as long as you're happy, I could care less.'</p>

<p>But that makes me feel bad, because why is she automatically willing to like not deal with Cole or not like him or accept him. Sometimes she is just so . . . black and white, and fucked up I was going to say. Really.</p>

<p>His family is so nice. They love me and totally accept me. That kind of makes me mad about my family. I never have been before but when other people notice it that makes me uncomfortable I guess. Maybe it's something that I maybe always knew but never dealt with. But lately, it's been coming up. Because I am in a situation with a family who is not like my family you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see another way they could be (inaudible at 21:14)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, everything you know, Cole's parents smothered him too much. So I mean there is always, you know, two different sides to every story but it's just that you know the nurturing and the warmth (yawned said excuse me) and the support. There are very few times I guess that I really felt like it was there, and if I did feel like it was really there I completely had to ask for it. Like fall apart and break down and have them pick up the pieces and say it was okay, you know? And stroke me. But on some level then it feels contrived also, because in a lot of times, ways I told you that my father tries to be nice and supportive and loving and warm, it feels very patronizing to me. It doesn't feel real. It feels like this is what Lauren needs to hear.</p>

<p>Always, I mean I told you when I was little I used to have to go into their room and say goodnight I love you, do you love me, do you love me? 'Yes we love you Lauren. Okay. I had to force them to give me what I needed from the time that I was little. But even then I didn't really believe it because I had to, you know, they were saying, 'yeah I love you' so I would shut up and go to sleep, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What feelings are you in touch with now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, that makes me feel a little angry but what then what am I supposed to do about it? I mean, so what? What can I do about it? I can't do anything about it. It's over. I'm not going to change my parents that is how they are. I didn't get what I needed from them. So what? A lot of people don't get what they need from their parents, you know, no one is perfect.</p>

<p>22:02</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think they love you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do. I really do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you said that do you think they love you, is that something you thought I was going to ask? Or something that . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that is me saying, okay I have to like qualify everything and be like you know "(chuckle)" even though I am saying these sad things, do I think they love me. I always have to do that. But I really do, I really really do. I don't, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard. It's hard. I can see you struggling, I can feel you struggling, I mean, with the anger. What good is it? You know, should I even be feeling this way? (inaudible at 22:28).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what, honestly, what good does it do me now to feel it? Maybe so I can understand it, yeah. I don't think there is anything wrong with understanding it but then what? I mean I'm not going to turn into an angry person, I'm not, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I was thinking when you spoke to your mother, for instance, when she had that reaction that she did to your saying I think Cole and I are going to get married.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I don't know what you said to her about, after her response.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just said, 'Mom'. You know, I know she meant, she meant well by it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You expressed some annoyance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean you know I mean my sense is that it could, you know, by becoming more in touch with your anger you could start finding out, to at least ask or to express more directly, you know, what you are feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think that when I do that, I know I'm not going to get anything in return from them. I'm not. They are going to twist it around, you know, if I said look you know, I don't, why do you feel that way, I don't want you to feel that way, and that's not fair and blah, blah, blah. Which I certainly could but I have put myself in that situation where, not yelling and screaming, but you know. Say, well, you know, that's how we feel too bad. You know they really would "(chuckle)".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what is it that you want to get? I mean, what is it that . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe warmth and support.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because my sense is when you start to just express more directly what it is you're feeling and thinking, including anger, what you get is certainly a greater intimacy first of all. Because you are being honest, you are not holding back. But it might be that, you know, they are not going to sanction what you say, but that is also not something that you can really expect either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But at least you're being true to yourself. Giving you the satisfaction that can come from that. It's not turning on yourself and being untrue to yourself like making nice only because you are worried that they don't care. And you are just kind of feeling angry about it later. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: uhuh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see you got a whole bunch out of me, you know? "(chuckling)"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah "(laughing)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "(laughing)" I often have that urge with you. I have to tell you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)" To what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "(laughing)" To you know to just tell you things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "(laughing)" So I'm supposed to figure it out myself</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I just, my feeling on that isn't so much you have to figure it out yourself, but it means more to really feel it. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: uhuh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are working it out. Kind of from your own intuition and experience, rather than someone telling you, because that is the . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no I agree. I always say that too. It's like you can't tell people, they have to figure it out for themselves.</p>

<p>24:02</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. But I don't think I mean it from "(chuckle)" I mean in the same you (inaudible at 24:05) with your parents. You know when you're a child you do need love and attention and value that is very important. I don't mean to be withholding on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, no.</p>

<p>"(chuckling)"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "(chuckles)" what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to tell me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I'm just thinking, well it's over so "(laughing)" It's like turn it on, turn it off, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So we're going to meet the Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have it written down. Have a nice holiday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You too. Are you going to . . .</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so I hope you're going to have spring break in Florida.  Any other plans for the next few months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not really.  I'm just hoping to knock out a lot of school during spring break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good.  You're liking [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And night school's working well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  How are you doing grade wise, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you don't really know until the end of semester there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's kind of like self paced so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you have a lot of homework?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not really.  It's kind of if you choose to have homework, then you have homework.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  So it's optional kind of for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you do well on the tests?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Show you know the material, that's good enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.  Good.  So how are your spirits been overall?  You've been feeling up or down or somewhere in the middle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh, sleeping okay at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Past 4 days though have been rough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like 2 nights ago I was up until like eight in the morning or so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't sleep at all.  I saw a mountain lion and that didn't help me sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Where did you see that at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In my backyard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where do you guys live?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, around Baptist Church.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know there's one around here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What was it doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was walking through the forest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long ago was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two nights ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I was up until eight in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So it was during the night you saw it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you, where you just looking outside when it happened to go by or did you hear it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, like, you can hear it walking through the forest.  Yeah, and then, uh, my neighbor's house lights sensor went off.  So it lit up their whole back yard and I could see it then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was really cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Was it a big one or a little one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, it was huge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It looked like a cougar actually and I heard we get those up here, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So for the last few nights you had trouble getting to sleep then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And are you still taking Rozerem or the Ambien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm actually out of Ambien right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  So maybe, were you sleeping okay when you had the Ambien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just need to get a refill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let me see if you have any refills left.  I may need to call in some refills for you.  I think I do.  I think it's been long enough so I'll, I'll call in some refills for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Um, what about your energy level during the day?  Do you have enough or do you feel kind of tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how about your appetite?  How has it been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what my mom wanted me to tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Just not hungry at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you know if you're losing weight, if your weight's staying stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it stays at about 120.  I can't gain a pound or lose a pound.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How about your [INAUDIBLE] ability to concentrate, [PATIENT NAME], is it easy or hard to focus, like at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, have you been worrying about things a lot lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mom told me, I think there was 1 night where you did wake up, you kind of worried about [NAME OTHER].  No, that's [NAME OTHER].  Never mind.  He had trouble 1 night worrying.  But you haven't been worrying too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Has there been anything you've been feeling guilty about, you know, out of the ordinary or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, lately I have lost a lot of friends due to drugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A lot of kids are using, you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are they using at, at Sand Creek mostly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, at Sand Creek those aren't really the friends that are doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the Rand Park kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of drugs up here, what are they using at Rand Park, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, a lot of marijuana.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, the new thing going around is coke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, coke and meth are getting huge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And there are kids getting really in a lot of trouble with it.  I mean, serious problems so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're just staying away from those kids, good, that's smart 'cause that takes kids down fast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At [INAUDIBLE] too.  There are kids that are really having severe problems, serious problems with it so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, I'm glad you're staying away from it 'cause a lot of people, once they, especially with meth and with coke, sometimes people try it once and they're addicted, you know, just change their brain chemistry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then they start craving it and they want more and more and it's scary to see how fast kids can go down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, okay, so, are you finding some other friends that aren't using them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Good.  And also, I don't know if you heard up here, they arrested a couple of, those [INAUDIBLE] kids for dealing pot.  Did you hear that in the parking lot at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They were all felony charges, they were 18.  They're going to prison.  It's not just jail, they're going to prison 'cause they were caught dealing marijuana at school.  So, and there was a kid at, uh, was it [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE], same thing.  They're starting to bust a lot kids 'cause they've got a lot of undercover cops working now.  They're busting a lot of high school kids for dealing [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I heard kids were wearing wires actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably, I mean, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] at [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.  Uh, yeah, so just, yeah just be careful 'cause I mean, sometimes even if you're not doing it, if you're around kids that are, you can get busted just by guilt by association.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, okay, or the other thing I hear is, uh, I know someone who got busted for drugs, they said, I tell you what, if you, if you get 5 dealers for us, we'll let you go free.  So this person was going out and buying drugs with a wire just to bust other people.  And, uh, you know, they just wanted to get off the charges.  They'd bust anybody they could, you know, and so, even, like the 1 person I think they busted probably wasn't a regular dealer, they maybe only sold it like once to a friend, but they still got busted and they got felony charges now.  So it's like they're really getting aggressive going after people 'cause—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They just came out with a study says the [INAUDIBLE] and teenagers has the sixth highest rated drug abuse in the county and the fourth highest rate of alcohol problems in the country.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the number 1 highest rate of depression in the country for teenagers in [INAUDIBLE] so, anyway, the cops are getting a lot more aggressive though, going after people so, um, what about, have you been down in the dumps at all where you had thoughts of suicide recently, anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  And how's your anxiety level been overall would you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Better, a lot better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So just in general not worrying about things much, not feeling as anxious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Um, and how are you doing with the Luvox?  Any side effects, problems with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Besides the eating—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you think that maybe is decreasing your appetite a little bit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what my mom thought it might be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's possible.  It normally doesn't have a big effect on appetite either way, but it could decrease it a little bit maybe.  Normally people don't lose weight from it though so we don't expect you to any weight really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So maybe a little decrease in appetite is the only side effect that you're aware of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, I know when we you on it, your mom had some concerns.  She said you took them and you were young and like flipped out or something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or had some weird reaction to it, but you haven't noticed, and she said she hasn't noticed anything like that.  Now, you haven't noticed anything like that either?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  And how much are you taking?  Or how often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, just one a night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  So that's 25 mg.  And do you feel like it's enough at this dose?  Do you feel like you're feeling pretty good overall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Good.  Because if you feel like it's working, but not well enough, we can increase the dose.  But if it's working well enough, there's no need to keep going up on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how are you going about remembering to take it?  Do you remember some nights, most nights?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Most nights, yeah.  I rarely forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Good.  And this is when where sometimes when people start feeling better, it's just human nature, they forget to take the medicine because they're feeling better.  But then if they start missing several days a week, then the blood level drops enough where it just doesn't work anymore.  People think, man, why am I not feeling so good again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if they think, oh yeah, I forgot to take my medicine, then they get back on it.  But it's better if you can just remember to keep taking it, then you don't have to go through that.  Okay.  Um, what about stress level these days?  Any major stresses that are weighing on you or that you're worried about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, besides all the drama, nothing really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With friends and drugs, you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Okay.  And, uh, is there a lot of alcohol around, too, at the parties and stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, there is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know up here it's a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now at the parties, like were, you go to parties more with Rand Park kids or Sand Creek?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, Rand Park.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Rand Park more.  You know, when, when kids go out and drink, like how much do they drink typically a night, do you know?  Like how many beers or shots?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, beer pong [INAUDIBLE] is a really big thing, I don't know if you've heard of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not sure.  What is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like, um, they get 10 plastic cups on each side and you have 2 ping pong balls, and you have to shoot and make a cup.  It's like a game—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To drink, basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, actually at parties go through 24 rack after 24 rack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so you shoot, you throw the ping pong ball and if you get it in a cup, then you have to drink the beer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The other team has to drink the beer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, the other team has to drink.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And then, if you win, then you stay at the table.  So, if you win, you basically keep drinking is the concept.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You win, you keep drinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.  You lose, you're out, then, the other team gets to.  And how many people on a team usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two on each team</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two?  And there's 10 beers up there.  So each person could end up drinking 5 beers per round?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  And they could win someone else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They don't really fill the cup all, all the way, it's just like half way normally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a lot of beer.  Yeah, and then, are you hearing about beer bongs?  Have you seen those at the parties?  Funnels with a tube on it or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never really seen that, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we've got that up here going, pour it down as fast as they can chug it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's how people get, that's how people die.  They get, their alcohol level rises so quickly that they get alcohol poisoning and then they can't regulate the body temperature and they get, you know, vomit down their lungs and stuff so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's something to be real careful about and stay away from.  So if you go to those parties, how much do you typically drink?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Five beers or less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't really drink.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't drink much.  How often do you go to parties and drink on average would you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't gone to parties in like probably about 5 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Good for you.  Especially with the medicines you're on, it's real important 'cause, 2 things, 1, alcohol will affect you differently on medicine.  Not in a good way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It hits people a lot harder so even when they don't mean to get drunk, they can get really drunk and really sick.  And also, it interferes with the medicines, the medicines didn't work.  Um, they found out a year or 2 ago that when we drink alcohol, it causes the kidneys to leak a chemical called serotonin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For some reason, we just pee it out.  Um, and that's the exact same chemical the Luvox is trying to increase.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, if you're taking Luvox, start to get those serotonin levels to feel better and if you drink alcohol, you just drop those levels and it interferes with the medicine, it doesn't work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, um, I had a lady came, came in a while back, she said, you know, I've been, she's really depressed, we kept trying different medicines and nothing was working.  And finally, she came in one day, she said, could it be the drinking and the alcohol and the pot I'm using each day?  I said, uh, yeah, that could be doing it.  She stopped it, now she feels fine.  You know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like, she knew better, but she was partying and it interfered with the medicines so she couldn't get better.  She was like suicidal so, uh, you don't want to drop those serotonin levels too low.  So, yeah, it's better to avoid alcohol and pot, anything like that when you're on the medicine 'cause it, I mean, you're, at all times, but especially when you're on the medicine 'cause it can be dangerous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, let's see, what else?  Have you been using any pot recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Occasionally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Once a day, once a week, 3 or 4 times a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mm, about 4 times a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, and the risk with, well there's a couple of different risks, I just saw a kid this week actually, he's, uh, a friend of a neighbor who, um, started having panic attacks.  His body's working, actually kind of like [INAUDIBLE] working around this ski place and had a severe panic attacks.  And for some reason, the pot triggers that in some people, not everybody.  Also, over time, the way pot works is it releases certain chemicals in the brain, which why people get high.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's why people smoke, I mean, like Barack Obama said, he thought that was the point.  But, uh, the problem is over time, if you [INAUDIBLE] regularly enough, those chemicals start getting depleted.  You don't have as many of them in your brain.  And so then, people can start getting lethargic, depressed, they lack motivation and start to have memory problems.  Uh, 1 guy I saw even had speech problems.  He couldn't, he was smoking so often, he couldn't make a sentence.  He could not form a complete sentence.  This guy was in his 40's, he had a job at Oracle and he was about to get fired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You told me about that guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did I tell you about, yeah.  And now, he off of it.  He's been off for years and he's moving up through the ranks.  But, uh, yes, you got to be real careful with that 'cause it does over time deplete those chemicals that cause our brain to work well.  If you don't have those chemicals, it's like you don't have enough gas in your car.  It just doesn't run.  The brain starts to not work well.  So, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, a lot of my friends, I kind of stopped hanging out with them 'cause it got to the point where all they called me for was marijuana and just like, you know, what kind of friend are you, you know, they don't hang out with me if I don't have pot.  And it's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, and be careful now just, I saw another kid a while back for this problem, he was a graduate of [INAUDIBLE] in second year and had to be hospitalized in [INAUDIBLE].  He was smoking regularly.  He got [INAUDIBLE] attempted suicide.  Got him off the pot, now he's fine.  He's not depressed.  He's feeling good.  He's back in school again do great so, people think that pot is natural, it's safe.  It's natural and it grow, I tell people so is [INAUDIBLE], which is a poison, you know, that grows in plants or you know, there are a lot of poisons that grow in nature, too.  So the fact that it's natural, doesn't mean it's safe.  Um, the key is, you know, what is the affects of not in just the short run, but in the long run, too.  For someone that dealt with depression or anxiety, it's even more of a risk 'cause it can trigger more problems in depression and anxiety so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there anything else besides pot, coke, crystal meth, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never seen those ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good, and I hope you don't 'cause those are the ones, like I said, that are really causing a lot of deaths and serious problems in high school kids around so, um, see, what else?  Any other concerns or problems that I haven't asked you about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you kept feeling just the way you do now on the 25 of Luvox, would that be pretty good, would you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel about the way you want to feel now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In that case, let's not mess with it then.  Uh, we have the option in the future, if we ever need to, to increase it, but there's no reason to bump it up if you're feeling good so, um, let me call in some refills [INAUDIBLE] for the Ambien.  You'll have that so you'll get some good sleep 'cause that's critical.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you still taking the Rozerem or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not too often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  'Cause if you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some nights I will if I can't really sleep too well, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does, um, does it seem to work if you take it just on a night when you need it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  'Cause for some people it has to build up, but if it works for you that way, you can just take it as needed then.  And then the Ambien, do you take that pretty much every night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's fine.  And it works well [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, let's do this then, I will call in the refills on the Ambien.  It looks like you still have plenty of refills on the Rozerem.  The Luvox, since you only take one a night, that's going to last a while, like 4 months worth and then there's a refill still so that'll last about eight months.  So you should be good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.  Anything else you want to talk about today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think we're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Why don't we check back maybe a month or so down the road just to make sure things still going well.  Does that sound okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let's see, around April 21st or there abouts.  [INAUDIBLE] your schedule, is, uh, is something like this mid, late morning a good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How about then, we could do, uh, Wednesday, May 21st, are Wednesdays good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like 10:30 again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So Wednesday, oops, I got the wrong month, that's May.  We want to go into April.  Let me back up a month.  On April 21st.  That's a Monday.  Um, actually, we can do either Monday or Wednesday that week at 10:30.  Do you have a preference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it doesn't matter to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's do Monday, it's exactly a month from today.  [INAUDIBLE].  Monday, April 21st at 10:30.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you need anything before then, just give me a call.  All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it sounds like you're doing well so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You bet.  Take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely.  You, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Thanks now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See you later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See you later.</p>

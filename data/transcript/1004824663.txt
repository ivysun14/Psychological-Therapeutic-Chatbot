<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I had a busy week. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a first date with someone new on Friday, and that went really well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Party on Saturday. This guy, I've known him for a while. We went to school together. We slept together a couple of times last year but, I don't know. He's very immature and annoying and I don't actually want a relationship with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He came to the party and just like, trampled all over everyone's boundaries. Repeatedly, with multiple people, and I don't know how to deal with that situation. And Dave was really unhappy [pause] about it. Um, and work has been crazy and there was the election Tuesday night and I went to a results election party and stayed out until entirely too late and ended up having to take a day off Wednesday. Or, a half day off because I was just not, [01:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's pretty [inaudible 00: 01:05].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was sleepy and hung over. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: As was probably half of the city. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. (Pause) So yeah, Tom. I don't really want to confront him because what that'll be awkward and messy and he's dating another one of my friends and like, the social network is just too intertwined. But he was really, (pause) really out of line. And he has been out of line with me in the past, like in public places. Like he'll (pause). He's very much in to giving and receiving pain. Which, isn't really one of my kinks, but I'm willing to indulge it in the bedroom but like in, in public places, like at other people's parties or um, there's a weekly contra dance(SL) where there's like 50 people, he'll like just grab me or other people he's seeing by the back of the neck and start digging his fingernails in. Or, biting, like in ways that, to me, feel like foreplay. And it's very, really uncomfortable, so anyway, he, at my party Saturday, he showed up and started, [02:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 02:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And started doing the same thing with me, with Ann and it was making some of my other guests who are not kinky and not [inaudible 00: 02:42] and don't really know my school friends that well, really, really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just (pause), (sighs) I should have asked him to either stop or leave, but I didn't because I didn't want to cause a scene and now I feel really guilty about that because Dave was uncomfortable, I was uncomfortable, my other friends were uncomfortable and (pause), yeah. [03:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think would have happened had you said something to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he would have tried to argue with me about how it's not that big of deal. And it's just flirting and flirting is okay. Which, (pause) yeah. (pause) And I just realized that when I go to contra dances, not only do I try to avoid being in the same, so I don't know if you know much about contra dancing. It's folk dancing that has its roots in like Victorian ballroom dancing. So it's not ballroom, ballroom dancing, the way we think of it in contemporary terms but you'll have couples lined up, so like, 30, 20 or 30 couples in a line going down the hall, [04:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it's, their moves are called like country dancing moves are called and so you end up, you and your partner end up traveling down the length of the hall, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so you'll do some stuff with your partner, some stuff with the person next to you, some stuff with the person two couples down from you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this, organized chaos as you [inaudible 00: 04:33] down the hall and then back up it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So when I go to contra dances, I try to make sure not only that I'm not dancing with Tom and not dancing two or three couples down from Tom, but I'm in a completely separate line on the other side of the hall than he is. Because it's just (pause), well A, I'm still learning the dance moves, so being distracted means that I foul up the dance for everyone around me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's not fun. But also it's just, really uncomfortable like he's engaging in what I (pause) experience as sexual behavior in front of like, 50 strangers! [05:09]</p>

<p>I don't like it at all and I've told him that I don't like it and I've asked him not to do it at contra dances and he's just ignored that. So. (pause) Not cool. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you feel pretty helpless and scared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm. I don't know that I'd say scared. (pause) He's not physically intimidating. He's short and scrawny. I could probably kick his ass its more (pause) profoundly irritating that, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: he's ignored me on multiple occasions and that he even brought this mess in to my house and was completely unaware of how uncomfortable he was making everyone. [06:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 06:21] Maybe there's something a little inhibited in your response to him. I know you said you've told him not to do this, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm. True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I, and I could be wrong, I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But something's making me wonder if (pause) you're not, if you're sort of, you could be inhibited or held back, like you're not being it with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or forceful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you could be or even another way, might want to be, given how much this is bothering you. Somehow that's [inaudible 00: 07:12] with your, not quite letting yourself acknowledge how the length you go, the length to which you go to avoid him. [07:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure what that's all about but it seems like there's something going on there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what's coming to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I was just thinking about this is all on a continuum with rape culture behavior. Like, I mean he's obviously not raping me but at the same time he's not listening when I'm telling him to stop sexual behavior and that's (pause), (sighs) you know, I don't want to draw a direct comparison but, you know, like I said, there's a continuum and it's on that continuum and that's, I don't know. I'm feeling guilty for enabling it by not putting my foot down more forcefully. [08:23]</p>

<p>(long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope not but I wonder if you feel it's a little like you're not worth [inaudible 00: 08:49] (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I think a lot of terrible things about myself on a regular basis so that could be it. If it is, I'm not aware of it. (pause) But I just had a conversation with Dave this morning where I told him I don't understand why people think nice things about me. So. [09:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 09:22] you're having to, you feel guilty for enabling his behavior by not confronting him about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where, if this is one of your friends, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm like about 150 percent sure that would not be how you thought about it. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if there's something guilty there that, devaluing of yourself that inaudible 00: 09:58]</p>

<p>(Pause) [10:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just, it sucks. Tom's behavior Saturday was such a start contrast to Edson's behavior Friday because he was very careful to check in and ask for consent for everything from a hug to a kiss on the cheek to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it, I'm looking forward to seeing him again. Both our schedules are completely absurd, so, I probably won't see him again for another two weeks, but [inaudible 00: 11:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm. Good. [inaudible 00: 11:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, thank you. But uh, (laughs) it turns out his ex is dating Tom right now and we have numerous friends in common because the area is just tiny, socially for people in the [inaudible 00: 11:37] over educated tech geeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Over educated liberal tech geeks, I should specify.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) it turns out that Edson and Dave lived in the same dorm out of nineteenth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, right? (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, Dave had the room directly above him, or above Edson's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow. (laughs) That's funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a small world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm. Were they friendly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They didn't really know each other, since Edson is about four years older than Dave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, they were only at school together for one year.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 12:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next weekend, the hay market foundation is having a gathering for hay market grantees. So, hay market is a non-profit that raises money and gives grants to community organizations that are doing anti-racism related work. So, one of their grantee's is a native American tribe that wants money to design program, curricula for teaching their language to their children. My church got a grant for doing explicit anti-racism training. There's another group that was doing science and tech outreach for young girls of color, so anything that's kind of social justice focus that takes race in to account, really. So they're doing this day long gathering for networking and work shopping and blah, blah, and they got a separate organization that got a grant to send two representatives and no one from my group wanted to go. So, I stepped off and said I would go. This was back in April. [13:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I agreed to this. And, I don't know, I'm just really, really tired. I've had commitments for like every weekend for the last month and you know, some of them have been personal, not church related like, you know, visiting my in-laws. But, I don't want to go to this thing. I really, really don't. A friend of mine, who is also an amazing musician is giving a concert in day and I really want to get on a train, go down and go to [inaudible 00: 14:33] and hang out with my friends. And, you know, take the weekend off. But I committed to this back in April, it's been on my calendar since April, it's not like I can say, oh, oops, I didn't realize there was a conflict, right? Like, if I decided not to go it would be a very explicitly, I am choosing not to do this thing that I committed to six months ago because fuck you. And now that is sort of how I feel about my church, especially after the debacle at the last festering meeting. (sighs) Like, I also very much believe that this is work that I need to be doing and I'm not, I don't regret having committed to the overall big picture of working with this team, but I really want to go to [inaudible 00: 15:27] concert. (chuckles) [15:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, (pause) there's part of me that's saying, this is something you committed to, there will be other concerts just, and, you know I went to a concert last Monday night, so it's not like I haven't been going to, hear live music recently. And I committed to it and I need to do it and there's another part of me that's saying you know, it's going to be seven hours of close proximity with my priest, who I can't stand and who, like, is probably the worst of everyone in our group. And with a bunch of strangers. And dealing with strangers is always stressful for me, social anxiety, blah, blah, will this even be worthwhile. Like, how much, how much will it gain me personally or my organization, if I network with these other organizations that have little to nothing in common with us. At first, he says, well that's just selfish and I'm trying to rationalize way, wanting to do the [inaudible 00: 16:35] go to a concert. [16:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I kind of want somebody to just tell me what to do and Dave refused, because he said it was my decision to make, not his. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should tell you, I'll probably refuse too, on the grounds [inaudible 00: 17:04] (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) That's not part of your job description? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) No, actually, its [inaudible 00: 17:15] that's really not it. The answer will be no less annoying, but, </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, first I don't know, certainly not yet, probably at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And second, it's probably contrary to how I'm trying to help to just say, I think you should do this. (pause) And as far as I can tell so far, [inaudible 00: 18:07] always the case. [18:13]</p>

<p>I know, that said, (pause) when you said, you know, did I feel like maybe I'm just making excuses, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't want to have to go. I found that a lot less compelling than the part about you not wanting to spend seven hours with your priest or a bunch of people you don't know, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: to do something of questionable value, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounded a lot more solid than just making excuses to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, this is not the first time that no one on the, you know, 20 person anti-racism team has been willing to step up and do an unpleasant task and so I have taken it on because I feel kind of responsible for the team. [19:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I was the one who went and presented our plan to the vestry because no one else wanted to. Because everyone knows how much of a pain in the ass it is to deal with the vestry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was a hay market, before we got the grant, as a part of the interview process. No one wanted to go and represent our organization to the people who were interviewing to determine whether they were going to give us $10,000. So, I said fine, I'll go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just, on one hand I feel responsible for the well-being of the group, and I really want to see it succeed, so I'm willing to do more work to a point. But, on the other hand, I'm really pissed off that no one else is investing anything. (sighs) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I guess (pause) I wonder if [inaudible 00: 20:28] of what you were saying before about Tom or what you were saying or what I was saying. You know, kind of struggling with, you know like what you have the right to do because you want to. [20:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Just, this is something that I'm only recently coming to realize, because my family moved so much when I was a kid, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, and because they just cut off ties with our extended family and never tried to work through their conflicts, but to be part of a community there, you have to have some tolerance for putting up with other people's bullshit, and just living and letting live. [21:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right? Because, otherwise you end up with my parents, alone and bitter and sad when even your own brothers and sisters won't talk to you even your own children don't want to talk to you because you're just hateful, spiteful, miserable people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, it's, (pause) and I've seen this play out in a couple of different ways and a couple of different situations recently. Like, at a party someone else threw, there were a bunch of people, well buy a bunch I mean four, people who each had started their own startup and there's this one guy who was very clearly not liked or respected by the other three, but they didn't explicitly say anything or call him out, even when he was being really annoying, because, well, part of your network, you don't want to burn bridges in case, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right? So, as just one example. Like, there's some level of irritating behavior that you just ignore because you have to when you're in a group of people that you don't want to break up. But. I don't know, the way I grew up, it was either all or nothing. People are either completely perfect to you and cow tailing to your every whim or you cut them off. And so, like, there's obviously a healthy median somewhere in between those two extremes, but, I don't know where that healthy middle ground is. [22:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm. I think also, within that middle ground, is negotiation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean? In other words, cow towing or cutting off, are both things that one does unilaterally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause) So, I mean, I have some friends that think I should just walk away from my church that it's not worth it. And, I mean in part, that's because I'm [inaudible 00: 23:29] You know, my live journal account, about church, when it's pissing me off, so they're only seeing the bad part. [23:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But part of it is, they're not religious people so they don't understand what I'm getting out of the church.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) Yeah, I don't know what you should do about it, but I, you certainly have made it clear on a few occasions to me that there are things you really value.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: About it. Again, I'm not trying to push you one way or the other but I'm just saying, I get [inaudible 00: 24:01] of your live journal, I've heard you say, [24:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 24:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like, Tom's still a very good friend of mine. His roommates are good friends of mine. We have lots of friends in common and I'm really, hesitant to do anything that, to say anything to him, that he might talk to other people about and thus cause conflict. But, (pause) (sigh) I mean, really, I think ideally, if I were just going to say, damn the torpedo's, hell with the consequences, I would tell him, you know, sleeping with you in the first place was a mistake, I regret it and I want to not have any more sexual, romantic, or flirtatious contact with you ever again. But I don't know, I'm afraid doing that will lead to, like, him having hurt feelings and acting out on those hurt feelings that backlashes against me. If that makes sense. [25:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 25:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to be clear, I'm not afraid that he'll like hit me or get physical, I'm worried about the kind of social consequences.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Well, (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I realized that was what I wanted until about ten minutes ago. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) [inaudible 00: 26:01] say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible 00: 26:07] Hmm. [inaudible 00: 26:13] important, and it hasn't been clear. [26:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also, just to be very clear on my point of view, like, I think what he's doing is not okay. I mean, it's harassing you and other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I want to be very clear. I don't mean by that that I'm telling you I think you have to do something about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope something happens so it stops.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, (pause) I don't want saying that to come across like I'm trying to make you responsible for making it stop. You know, if there's a way that you or somebody [inaudible 00: 26:55], I think that's great. [26:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean to sort of, make you responsible or put any pressure on you to do something. I'm just saying that I think it's wrong [inaudible 00: 27:11] (pause) I wonder if it's also, a little hard to act with how you focus. You get worried about, your anger. [27:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 27:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're so clear about what you'd like to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's kind of how you feel about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also feel really, really stupid because Dave told me a year ago, that he thought Tom was bad news. (chuckles) And I was like, oh, you don't know him that well. (pause) I think I was a little bit blinded by the fact that there are very few submissive men in my social circle, so, the fact that like he was this really pretty submissive boy who wants to have, you know, bdsm playtime with me, was, I don't know. (pause) Caused me to overlook, (laughs) [29:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: warning signs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not the first time one person's attractiveness has made the other person overlook potential problems.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 29:34]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 30:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I think I've talked myself out. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, during that silence, my brain went back to a problem I'm dealing with at work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, we're supposed to be delivering this product and in theory, we were supposed to do all of our final checkpoints and publish everything and just do you know, writing the technical reports to follow up this week. We were supposed to checkpoint last Friday. And of course, none of us were ready, and I'm not the furthest behind in my team and my team is not the furthest behind in all the teams contributing to this project, so. [31:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel too badly about that. But there is this one issue with transition time. The inputs and outputs of [inaudible 00: 31:26] where there are literally three dozen different reports scattered between like individual module level analysis results and then you know, there are generally five to ten modules per chiplet. So, then you've got your chiplet level results and then you've got your full chip results and there are like eight chiplets. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's all these reports, and they're contradictory and it's not clear what the results are and everyone is confused. And, so I've just been fighting with my results because I have more results being reported in my modules reports than anyone else in my team. [32:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So everyone's all like, oh, I've only got two or three or whatever, it'll be okay. And I've got twenty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got twenty reports?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, twenty,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Twenty results.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, twenty results.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like, you know, if all of those are real, that's a lot of edits that need to be made, and if they're real I need to make those edits now as opposed to waiting for the full chip build in two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, everyone else is just waiting for the full chip build because that's the actual authoritative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 32:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the, there's a lot of false positives and false negatives at lower level reporting, so the people who are only seeing two or three in their module chiplet results are like, Ahh, we'll wait for full chip. Two or three, whatever. But if all of mine turn out to be real, that's, two weeks is going to be way too late to make that many edits, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just thinking about ways I could look at the raw data that's being generated in to the reports and try to some confidence levels on how real these results are. [33:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Excuse me. [inaudible 00: 33:36] on soda's today at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Our new chief architect was addressing the engineering team. And, I might have mentioned the CO laid off 15 percent of the workforce a couple of weeks ago. They've been reorganizing, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're actually closing two offices entirely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There small offices with 50 people each in a company with 11,000 employees, so, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tiny offices. Like, hearing that you're losing its like, kind of sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 34:10] in the country?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, two are are closed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. Yeah. [34:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, the new Chief Architect we poached about three months ago, was talking to us about the plans and they provided pizza and soda to encourage us to come listen to him talk. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Like bait.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And now my stomach is upset. (pause) The part of our new company strategy going forward is to produce chips designed for servers as opposed to like laptops or desktops, based on R instead of X86. Which, that's probably [inaudible 00: 35:07] to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I've heard of the [inaudible 00: 35:13] X86 and then the lineage is like 286 and 486 and all that stuff, and that R's were originally made for mobile devices. [35:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. There extraordinarily low power.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 35:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes me nerdy for a psychologist. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yes it does. But yeah, so the question someone in the audience asked was, who the hell is going to build an armed server? Like, who's going to buy and armed chip for a server because traditionally, X86 were high powered, high performance, and R is low power, not quite as fast a performance as X86, which is why they're good for like smartphones, because you need low power for mobile device and you don't need it to be ultra-high performance. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. [inaudible 35:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and it doesn't need to be blazing fast because you're not going to play like Quake on your cell phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess maybe the next generation of cell phones you can play Quake on the cell phone but why would you on such a tiny screen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, the question was, who the hell is going to build an armed server and he was like, that's a good question, I don't know who the hell is going to build an armed server, but we're going to build it. If you build it, they will come. I was just like, ah, geez. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [36:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, if you read the financial papers, speculation is not the executive suite of AMD, it's positioning the company to be bought out by like a mobile chip maker. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's, speculation, that's not coming from AMD but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Speculation was right about the layoffs. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) That'd be like a Motorola or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like a Motorola, or Texas Instruments, or a Samsung, or whoever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, I should know better than to read speculation, it just causes a great deal of upset for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I understand you then, the thing he said that on space makes no sense, like, ah, we'll just do this, we haven't really thought about who's going to buy it. [37:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That does make sense? Or, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, I mean, so either the speculation is right and this guy [inaudible 00: 37:29] are trying to position us to be bought out. Or there's a secret customer who doesn't want their name known. They're afraid of leaks to they're not telling the rank and file because, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the Xbox thing got leaked early and Xbox was pissed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Actually, I don't think that's public. Don't tell anyone we're making a chip for Xbox.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (laughs) I can't, anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we're doing chips for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo. They've all signed contracts for chips from us. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 38:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Many, many parts sold. (laughs) [38:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not all of that is public and there have been a couple of leaks, some of which have been discredited, even though they're true. But, like, clearly the execs don't trust us because we can't be trusted because the information gets leaked. (laughs) Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's another explanation to why he wanted to say something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible 00: 38:57]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two senior engineers ended up having a fight in my cubicle today. That was unpleasant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kirk is the technical lead in charge of the chiplet that my component belongs to. And Pete is in charge of power analysis of the whole chip. And I had asked Pete to come help me debug an issue with my power analysis because I was getting results that did not look right. So he was over there and Kirk walked by and he's like, oh, I thought I heard your voice Pete. And they started talking about, Kirk sent this e-mail to the whole chip team, so like 60 people, saying blah, blah [inaudible 00: 40:04] And Pete sent an e-mail back immediately saying, don't e-mail e-mail to the team until you've talked to me about problems you're having with the flow. I think this is pilot error. And so [inaudible 00: 40:16] sniping at each other. So then Kirk stopped by my cube because he heard Pete's voice and was like, Pete, I've been looking for you all day. And they started having this fight about this problem Kirk was having, and I was like, this problem you're having, I have that problem too and Pete and I are debugging it right now. Do you want to see what the result is? But no, they, no, they didn't want to actually look at an actual test case or look at all the debugging info I had generated, I had looked through and produced all of these reports and views of what was happening, [40:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a hypothesis of what was happening and they just, nope, they were shouting at each other. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For like 20 minutes, preventing me from getting any work done, or debugging the problem. It was fantastic. And that's the sort of the thing that from my Dad, he would be just like, they're disrespecting me, I quit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We should stop, for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday?</p>

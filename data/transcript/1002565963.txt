
<p><b>DR:</b>	What can I do for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need medication and I need, um, what I would like to do is see you every three months and get my medication, maybe a little psychotherapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been, I've had a number of different diagnoses over the years.  I've been going to psychiatrists since I was in my 20s.  And, uh, I've gotten a number of different diagnoses.  First doctor said paranoid schizophrenia.  Second doctor disagrees, said it was obsessive compulsive.  The next doctor said it was a depression reaction.  And that same doctor later decided that I was manic depressive or bipolar.  I took the lithium for a year I guess before I could convince my new doctor that I was not bipolar.  And the clinical psychologist who saw me before I saw the psychiatrist decided that I was, uh, ADHD.  My wife had sent him a form to read asking him if this was not what I was, which was ADHD and he dismissed it.  He just didn't listen, he read it, but he didn't agree with it or apparently, and then about three or four months later he decided that's what it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sir?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What medicines are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I seen you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm working towards that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm taking a bunch of them.  I brought them in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see it, I got it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There are three pages.  Over the counter.  I would have a nice, neat description of it except for the fact that the power broke down.  I'll have you one next time or I'll mail it to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what'd they finally decide you are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	ADHD.  And [INAUDIBLE] obsessive compulsive behavior.  I do a lot of counting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's annoying.  But it's not [INAUDIBLE] trouble.  It's not something that I can't handle.  I don't need medication for it.  Does that bother you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, just looking at it.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>


<p><b>PT:</b>	Some of those medications cause me to, cause dry mouth and constipation and I have to have something either wet in my mouth every few minutes or chew gum or, um, my mouth will dry out, my lips will puff and I sound like I'm drunk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I brought this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have some goals.  I've made New Year's resolutions a number of years and I haven't been able to fill them out completely.  I, um, one is I'd like to develop a more intimate relationship [INAUDIBLE] my wife.  And another is I would like to develop a more intimate relationship with my children and my grandchildren.  And, um, another is I would like to, uh, not be so sick psychologically.  You know, I, uh, if I didn't have that medication I would go out of orbit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you do when you got older?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, a long time ago there was a psychotic who was released from a medical facility and he proceed to a motel where there was a professor and his wife and his son, and the son went in the bathroom and this psychotic went in and cut his throat.  And, um, they gave him a shot of thorazine to calm him down after they got him in the cell.  I said that's something I need because I blow out of control.  I have a control problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what the [INAUDIBLE] does.  We've experimented and experimented and experimented, and this is the best solution we've found so far, these things that we have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you have a temper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, bad.  I've been fighting it all my life.  I'm in good company though.  Robert E.  Lee had one too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fought it all his life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it did before I took the medication.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in Columbia, uh, where I went with him, I guess I went to see him probably, um, four or five years, and he, um, insisted that I start taking thorazine because I told him that my mind had so many thoughts coming in I couldn't stop and home in on one, you know.  And, um, that's when he picked up on the thorazine and he tried a number of times to get me to take it, and I didn't want to take it 'cause I didn't think it worked.  And then I started taking it and eventually it started working.  And I didn't have all these thoughts racing through my brain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I can accomplish tasks much more easily now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about, do you have mood swings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mood swings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  I used to teach and kids said what kind of mood are you in [INAUDIBLE].  I said do you mean I'm moody, they said, oh yes you are.  I didn't know I was moody.  I had, uh, when I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I went into a severe depression and, um, when I first started to go into a psychiatrist I was in college and, um, I went two years and dropped out and made good grades the first year, second year was a flop, and, um, my mother took me to a doctor in Charlotte who, an internist, and he examined me thoroughly and couldn't find anything wrong and one day I went in and said to the nurse I said I think I would like, she said how are you today, [PATIENT NAME], I said I think I'd like to go to some mountain in Tibet and meditate and she told the doctor that and he referred me to the psychiatrist, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in Charlotte.  He's been dead for years.  That was back in the '50s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a long time [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, uh, okay.  Um, what about allergies, anything you're allergic to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, gosh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Penicillin, and I should have brought you a whole list.  I have a list.  I go to a asthma and allergy specialist.  I have asthma and allergies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just need meds right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just need medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, medicines.  Oh, they're on that sheet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That typed out sheet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The ones that he gives me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, the ones you have an allergic reaction to when you take them.  Anything that you're allergic to that you have a bad reaction to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Penicillin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not that I can think of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, good.  Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't use all those medication all the time that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], excuse me, the allergy doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just at certain times when I'm worse, better than I'm not, sometimes I use a nebulizer, sometimes I use an inhaler, Flovent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about, any kind of, um, asthma, okay, asthma.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Asthma and chronic bronchitis.  Probably hear me gasping for air every now and then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, anything else other than the bronchitis?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm nervous, I have a tremor.  I have trouble with a mouse on the computer.  Uh, my father had this and one doctor thought that he had Parkinson's and she took him to another doctor and he said it was an inherited thing, it was a family thing, it was not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What medicines, I'm sure you can [INAUDIBLE] names on here.  Have you ever tried Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lamictal, you ever tried Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What is that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a mood, it's a mood stabilizer and an energy regulator.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's one of those things that works very well with people who have temper problems 'cause it keeps them from surging.  That's what it does essentially.  It sort of brings things down to baseline.  Most people who have, and there's, um, it's sort of the bipolar spectrum and you can have ADHD kinds of things in it.  And you have obsessive compulsive stuff in there like counting and things like that.  You can also have mood swings, you could also have temper flare ups.  You can also have lots of anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have lots of anxiety.  That's what Diazepam's for, Valium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This helps that.  It doesn't help it, you have to do it slowly, you have to work with it over time but it'll help.  And, um, [INAUDIBLE] extra energy you stop feeling like you've got static electricity, a lot of people say.  That's what I would think we need to do.  You need to stay on your same meds, okay?  We don't want to change anything right now.  But add this to it, okay?  [INAUDIBLE] reaction to it.  Um, it's been out for a while too.  Been around since '94.  And a lot of people have tried it and used it for this kind of stuff [INAUDIBLE].  And, um, you like warm weather?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I hate, yeah, I love warm weather.  I hate cold weather.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  The other thing is you've got, um, you've got cold hands and cold, you've got Reynaud's phenomenon?  Which means icy cold fingers and hands.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I stay cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, the temperature regulation's cold.  And you've got a foot that does this all the time.  You can't keep still.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know it too.  You just keep moving like this, something all the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the way I do [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see, your [INAUDIBLE] to do that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have a tremor on both hands too, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  You have cold hands and excess energy and the temper problems and the counting and everything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel that I could do something useful, uh, if I could get myself under control and, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Other than all these symptoms you're pretty normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My symptoms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, under all these symptoms you're pretty normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  I say I'm, yeah, I say I'm, uh, pretty normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty normal normally.  But sometimes I go out of orbit.  If I'm at home by myself I let go with profanity a lot, GD, GD, GD, GD, GD, if something annoys me.  It doesn't go on all the time, but occasionally I'll do it.  And I'm constantly using profanity.  And I don't want to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My father did it and I inherited it from, I didn't inherit it, I picked it up from him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What family of drugs is that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not, it's an anticonvulsant.  It's [INAUDIBLE] it's pretty well specific to itself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Has no category?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a glutamate blocker is what it is.  Glutamate aspartate blocker.  And glutamate's the most rapidly transpiring of medication in the brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I understand that.  Would you say it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is a glutamate modulator.  Glutamate is a fairly rapid acting neurotransmitter and so it's all over the brain.  You've got it all over the place.  It fires just like that.  And what's you've got is you've got too much of the stuff.  So your body's constantly being put on guard and being fired, everything fires too quickly and moves too quickly.  Your idle's too high.  You're sort of blowing your surge protector, 'cause when you fire you go too high too far.  And the medicine [INAUDIBLE] sort of help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sounds good.  Wonder why my other doctor didn't pick up on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's been a few years.  What if I just gave you 5 mg four times a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then go to 2 four times a day, two twos, 'cause you're taking 1 mg, 2 mg tablets four times a day or are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, that's what you're doing, you're taking diazepam 2 four times a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 2, four times a day.  I tried one but might as well not take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I notice that you go to [DEIDENTIFIED] one day a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How do you do that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, I've got—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some patients up there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I've got two days a week, I've got about [INAUDIBLE] patients up there.  I've got about that many, maybe 1,200 here, but then some up there too.  Then I've got [INAUDIBLE].  I was here before I went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] for five years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've always hoped that I could find a place out of the, out of [DEIDENTIFIED] because of the congestion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My wife has to drive me to [DEIDENTIFIED], I can't drive in [DEIDENTIFIED] traffic.  I can, but I had a severe auto collision and after that she protested and decided to drive me from then on.  So she had to wait 'til school was out before she could drive me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you taking [INAUDIBLE] for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you taking the [INAUDIBLE] for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Prostate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Acne.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Acne?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, that's what the dermatologist gave me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], yeah.  Okay.  Um, all right, um, you got to watch out for [INAUDIBLE] 'cause [INAUDIBLE] it hurts your kidneys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Will it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been taking it a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I took it for a long time too and all of a sudden it just, it clogged my kidneys up.  And I had to get off of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I need to substitute something for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I couldn't make that decision for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Dermatologist has to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you'd have to talk to them.  And maybe nothing, you may not have any problem at all, but it's something to watch out for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How would you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They just have to do a blood test to check your, I can do that today if you want me to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I just had a bunch of blood work done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you're probably okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And everything was all right except my hemoglobin, it was low.  And they said that I was losing blood and he ordered a, um, pill cam, and it was $1,800, and the insurance wouldn't pay too much on it.  So I decided to go see, I had some connections in [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, one of them was a doctor, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he did all my, he did my several operations on me, and I have a nurse who works there a lot, [NAME OTHER], and they told me that this [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in [DEIDENTIFIED] was one of the doctors that ushered in the pill cam for [DEIDENTIFIED], they started it.  He and one other doc, there was another doctor who had more to do with it, but anyway I went to see him and he checked the blood and he said, and that was after my doctor told me to start taking persulphate.  I took it, he said take persulphate two weeks and then come to see me.  Well, I was doing that.  I started feeling better.  He said I was anemic.  That was why they wanted to do the pill cam.  See where the blood was going.  And, um, that kindly, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in [DEIDENTIFIED] gave me, um, um, he examined me the first time I went up there and he felt a lump in my intestine.  And he ordered or gave me a colonoscopy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  What'd they find?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He didn't find anything.  He said it could have been.  See, I have problems with constipation.  It could have been a lump of excrement, yeah, feces.  And, uh, he said he didn't see any point in taking the pill cam.  [INAUDIBLE] was okay.  He wants to do an endoscopy because I don't know why but he wants me to do that and then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have to find out where the blood's going, where the blood's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Said he wanted to check things out, that's what he told me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  That sounds like a winner to me.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Soon as my deductible goes down I'll do it.  That was one of my problems that I would have asked my family doctor if I had seen him [INAUDIBLE] taking the persulfate.  I would have asked him if the blood was being lost is it still being lost, where is it going?  And I never did get to ask him that because I never went to see him.  And not only that, pretty much out of my head when—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I'm talking, I saw [PATIENT NAME], this is a bit of an unusual thing, I saw [PATIENT NAME] today on [DATE] I saw him at three o'clock and I had gone ahead and downloaded some of the cases into the machine back to Verilogue and when I looked at the machine it had continued stopped downloading and had again to record, so I asked [PATIENT NAME] if he would mind if I used that and he said no, so here we are.  [PATIENT NAME] is a [AGE] Caucasian male who has multiple, many diagnoses, all of which are probably the same faces of the same one.  He had been called schizophrenic at one point in time, obsessive compulsive disorder another point in time, and the third would be bipolar.  And now just major depressive episode.  Those I think reflect the places of which, places and times at which the various psychiatrists were treated.  Being [AGE] gives you sort of a perspective of that.  Paranoid schizophrenia is what we really called manics when they weren't, and angry manics, in the '70s and '80s.  He is [AGE], so he would fit into that category.  He is a school teacher, and is retired at the present time.  I actually knew some of his cousins who were bipolar.  And two of them suicided, one suicided.  Um, he has been married for many, many years.  He has two children.  Their health is good per him.  He did attend some graduate school as part of his education.  His wife also is a teacher and they live comfortably in retirement.  He has medical problems, he has asthma and allergies and has acne also.  He takes a number of medications including Proventil, Combivent, Dallergy, Patanol, Flovent, albuterol all for various types of problems.  I note that asthma is associated with bipolar disorder.  He also takes multivitamin, calcium with vitamin D, [INAUDIBLE] two morning, I don't know that is, fish binding oils with omega—6 he says, potassium 99 mg in the morning, and persulphate 325.  He has had anemia and is being worked up for that now.  His psychiatric medicines are as follows: Diazepam 2 mg, four times a day; bupropion 100 mg tabs four times a day; thorazine 50 mg tabs, one to two four times a day; Toxaphene 50 mg tabs one, two four times a day; [INAUDIBLE] 0.5 mg tabs, one two tabs a day.  Mental status exam revealed someone who is, um, certainly not manic, certainly not exceedingly depressed, but someone who is somewhat slow, somewhat stiff, and, um, [INAUDIBLE] controlled.  His major problem was one of his temper.  His thoughts did race.  And I watched him and shook his hands his hands were icy cold and his feet never stopped moving.  He was constantly just, his whole body was consistently writhing as we went along.  Pupils were normal size, speech was [INAUDIBLE], there was no delusions, hallucinations.  He was rather slow and in his speech but I think that fits his age and the small town that he comes from, small southern town he comes from actually.  I think he's bipolar, given his mind racing, has Reynaud's and his akithisia, fact he has a temper, fact that he has obsessive compulsive symptoms, i.e.  Counting, and that when he was psychotic he became very paranoid, but probably didn't have hallucinations or more of an angry kind of on guard person.  I elected to add Lamictal to him, 25 mg once a day for about two weeks and then twice a day.  Told him about the rash, what it looked like and told him to stop it if the rash occurs.  I also gave him a history of what the medicine acts like over its history.  And about the Stevens—Johnson syndrome that occurred originally about 1994.  With that I continue his other medications and see him back in approximately a month.</p>

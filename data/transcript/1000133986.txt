<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: June 9th  </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh god, I'm so tired. The report last week, the presentation was really strange. I'd been up all night the night before, and it was about 4 o'clock in the morning before I realized I could not possibly correlate everything that I had (inaudible).</p>

<p>I was pretty good except that I was incoherent. And I knew my material, but I garbled all my words, and my head instruction was very faulty. I would start saying something and people get really confused and not realize what I was referring to. It was all straight in my head, but I wasn't able to present it without upsetting.</p>

<p>Otherwise I think it was okay. I was just upset that I just wasn't being articulate and clear at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the formal aspects of it were faulty.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was just my… I kind of lost my presence of mind entirely, just really blew it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you see that as just an effect of having been so tired, having been so tired…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Partly tired and also partly just being really afraid of (inaudible) the presentation. So it was just a combination of that. I wish I could have brought it off better – probably might have if I hadn't been so tired. As soon as I … actually in the middle of it I stopped being specifically afraid of that …</p>

<p>But I don't like to see myself as inarticulate. Otherwise it was okay. God knows what I'll get in this paper, quarter is almost finished and I've decided not to take summer courses because it's just too much. I mean I just can't, I can't visualize myself in the middle of July schlepping on campus and sitting in a class. And I've decided that there are other things that I'd much rather do with the summer, and if I have to retake this course I'll just wait until (inaudible).</p>

<p>So Murphy kind of reacts a little negatively to that. And the whole idea of me taking the course was so I could get out of here sooner. But even if I don't take this course right now, I'll still be able to get out a quarter or two early.</p>

<p>He still has his cold. He is so miserable, he is so impossible. He goes from saying, ‘Oh you're really good to me', to ‘Why are you mad at me. You know you're not being very good to me at all. You're being really inconsiderate'. And it is really wearing, and it is also very annoying. I find it very hard to relate to him when he says that. That is when we're talking (inaudible) and I'm very afraid that I'll get (inaudible) because I couldn't stand that, having a cold sitting around the house.</p>

<p>So I have been kind of stand-offish…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In fact, right. But at the same time trying to be considerate and trying to kind of balance between this incredible nursing that he wants. I mean just kind of sitting and holding his hand, type of nursing. And complete freedom to just dump him when I feel like, if I want.</p>

<p>So there is kind of this strange tension going that I'm trying to resolve.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of tension, what is the tension?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The tension is that he has many demands, and I sometimes, that I don't particularly want to meet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean he wants you to do a lot for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean he wants a lot in terms of just general holding hand companionship. And when he gets sick he gets terribly childish, and he gets very lonely and very demanding of attention and affection constantly.</p>

<p>And I just don't like to do that. I don't like to mother him that much, that constantly. I kind of like to be there when he needs me. When he is really physically sick, I do everything possible and I give him as much support, but I am afraid that he is just asking me to pamper him just for the sake… just because he's sick, and it's a nice excuse to revert back to childhood. Like this morning, I actually got myself out of bed, and (inaudible) so I was going to do the last little bit of research that I have to do for this morning, and do it before I came here. But he was so resentful that I was going to go and just leave him and he said he felt so deserted…</p>

<p>CLIENT: … and then I just sat around. And I didn't have anything to do at home. My whole energies had already kind of been working towards getting the work done there. Looking forward to reading the article. The only thing that kept me sitting was to keep him company. And I don't have anything to say, and I am kind of pissed that I'd gotten up that early because I'd gotten to bed around 1, you know just to sit there and look at him. I could have slept an extra hour, and it was really kind of annoying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was as if he had made you do that. You mean that was what was annoying about that – to be so frustrated – I guess that is not right, it was more that you were so frustrated and this plan that you'd had. That you had already had the momentum…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right that I'd already had the momentum for it and I just felt that I'd been just kind of cut off and just these two graspy hands that kind of cling. He was just dripping all over me, and he is getting kind of hysterical and it is really awful for him. (inaudible) he is just lying under the blanket and he drops Kleenex everywhere he goes he just has to have it. He is really unhappy and he's not thinking clearly and he's getting into all these hang ups about – I'm not being good enough to him but then maybe he's not being good enough to me. This whole thing is kind of more deadly inside of his head, and he has just become very, very demanding. And I react quite negatively to it (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like—you don't want to me to see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't want to – yeah, well his demands are very, very big and demanding and all inclusive. I want to take care of him, yeah I'll stay when he needs me. I guess it is kind of the way it's done. I just feel that he's being very childish and self-indulgent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the way that he's acting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. Also I find it very hard to really understand given the way I'd react is entirely different. He becomes very clingy and graspy and wants company and like he sits on the floor with his stomach bent a couple of months ago. What he wanted me to do was basically was sit there and hold his hand until he fell asleep, and just trying to keep him company. Now I just don't get involved I think it is a total waste of my time.</p>

<p>And if he tends to that kind of thing in a minor way, because what he wants is he can't leave and he wants me to be around and be company with him, and talk to him and keep him entertained. And I do this, it just comes naturally. But there are times when I resent it because it's hanging on such demands, it has nothing to do with me really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't set the terms of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like last night we had what I consider a lovely two or three hours. For the first time in months I finally got him involved in reading the New York Times. I was just digging the New York Times, and finding things happening (inaudible).</p>

<p>But we were still talking at the same time. Like I would pick out interesting things I would read them to him, we'd discuss it, I would go on for ten minutes I'd go back to reading, I'd find something else outrageous and I'd tell him about it. And he was reading too one of the Chicago papers and he was doing the same thing. I was really liking it. I really thought it was a fine thing. We were talking about things that both of us were finding interesting and had things to say about. We're obviously together but we're riveting our attention totally on one another, and I just felt very, very good about the whole thing.</p>

<p>And this morning he said he was really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That he really had…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that he was really having problems with the whole thing that he was – because he couldn't read and he felt neglected. I just got, I really—I didn't say anything, but I really felt pissed. (inaudible)</p>

<p>We get into this pattern like often because I feel that if I'm at home and I'm in a room doing something and I'm perfectly happy and into what I'm doing. And he's like that, into what he's doing, he thinks we're neglecting one another. That I don't have to pay total, I don't have to pay physical homage to my love for him all the time. Just my presence is enough. I don't feel that I have to make, that I have to rivet my attention on him in order to be with him.</p>

<p>Because I think it is perfectly possible for us to be side by side and be doing two different things and still be together. In fact I think it is kind of necessary, you know I like it very much when it happens. It makes me very happy.</p>

<p>But his feeling seems to be that it's like he's sitting and looking through something and I'm sitting across the room reading the paper that we're not together. And that we're not spending time with one another. Spending time with one another is sitting and looking at one another and talking to one another and spending total attention on one another and that's it. And unless that happens at least once a day, he's not happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what do you think about that kind of requirement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is too forced. I think it happens and I think there are days when it doesn't happen, when we just spend the day close to one another but without riveting our attention on one another.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is – Is that to say there is a kind of pattern or some kind of pattern you've just described kind of sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. You're perfectly satisfied with it, and that is a pattern of life which he is not satisfied with, which he tries to make it be the other way, or he gets mad at you when…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he, it kind of depends on how insecure he's feeling. He's feeling insecure, he says, ‘Well we haven't talked at all today', or ‘Put down the newspaper don't you want to spend time with me'. Which depending on my mood I will either say- okay – and put it down, or say, ‘I am spending time with you – what is this nonsense', and go back to reading the paper or whatever I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see why I'm asking is because you kind of describing a difference of what optimal pattern will be between you. And I'm wondering what is the difficulty for you in that. I mean beyond coordinating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The difficulty is he says, ‘Look why are you doing this to me, you're neglecting me, you're not talking to me. How come you don't want to talk to me, I've been sitting here alone all day'.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you mean he imputes all this to you, that there's something wrong with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of negative …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right that I'm neglecting him, that I don't want to talk to him, that I'm not doing enough…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I kind of get a little pissed because we're usually running around so much between classes and work, getting various things done, that when I just get to sit down and I look at a paper or at read through, he can't just sit there and do whatever my fancy takes to do with the moment it is an incredible luxury and this is just a really nice, indulgent, fine thing to be able to do, and rush around less.</p>

<p>And I tend to get kind of pissed at him because …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is like saying, that is time you want to spend the way you're spending it. And you enjoy that when you …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I wish he would comprehend what is happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it seems to me that it is kind of a reverse housewife syndrome. He is home all day. He spends most of his day sitting around and doing what his fancy takes for him to do, like sitting around and reading the paper thoroughly, going through magazines. Kind of thinking through that and looking it up and seeing something – how things go, where you get it. If it strikes your fancy you follow it through and you go through various references, whatever that may be. He's finding it damned hard to do it. Really like lost.</p>

<p>There is a nice chunk of time during the day when I'm just not around and there is nothing for him to do. So that when I come home, the great excitement of having somebody to talk to, which is perfectly understandable, except that I've been running around all day and have been on a schedule and follow other – in an indirect way – other peoples dictates. And I don't have time to sit down and let myself relax and spread myself around and do whatever I feel like for a half an hour or so.</p>

<p>But I'm subverted to his demands, oh now there is somebody to talk to you should talk to me I haven't had anybody to talk to all day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well he asks you to do that, then what happens. He asks you to do that as a conditions of his life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right he says now put everything down, and I can't think of anything to say, I don't have anything to say otherwise I would have said it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why do you put it down then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well or I'll say that I don't have anything to say. At which point he'll get very surly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I'll put things down and try and make conversation with him. And I don't want to have him unhappy, or pouting, or peeved, or seeming rejected. Or I'll say, “Well I really feel like reading this right now.' So he'll shuffle off and he'll be miffed about the whole thing. I'm neglecting him, I'm not being good to him, I'm not talking to him. He hasn't had anybody to talk to all day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your problem with this is that it seems like you keep on making him unhappy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. At the same time, I have all these feelings about what kind of a trip he's trying to lay on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is I'm kind of the great emotional event of the day – my coming home. It is really not my fault he doesn't have anybody to talk to …</p>

<p>(interruption problem with the audio)</p>

<p>CLIENT: … you know there are times when I'll walk in and pick up the paper and he'll say, ‘Oh this great thing happened.' And obviously I'll want to hear what it is, and there is no problem. But the problem lies when nothing has really happened to either one of us during the day, that is nothing usual schedule nothing exciting – and there is really not too much that I have on my mind to communicate. Neither does he, he just kind of wants attention in what I find a very childish way, then we get in conflict.</p>

<p>And it tends to make both of us, or either one of us a little resentful to how the other handles it. And I'm never quite sure how exactly I should handle it. Should I give in to him all the time? I don't think so</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the signs of that – when you say, ‘well I should give' I guess that sometimes you think you should.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know that I should… that who else does he have to talk to in a really intimate way, and when you're close to somebody that way you should be really interested in everything that is happening with them.</p>

<p>Except the timing isn't right for me. I'm not comfortable with it, I don't particularly want to hear it right then and there, I have to unwind my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sound like in a sense two things make you think you ought to do that all the time which are a kind of pity for the condition that he's in and there's something about – shouldn't you want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. If one loves somebody, shouldn't one react in a certain way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you are kind of like saying you ought to react that way or else you don't love him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Except that I realize that it is a totally idealized solution. I mean it is impossible to pay attention to somebody 24 hours a day, I mean totally be riveted in them, to be interested in nothing but what they have to say. And I don't expect myself to be that way anymore, it is just too much, but there must be a median between total attention and no attention at all which makes both parties happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean at every moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The vast majority of the moments.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you feel that what you would do if you were treated so too is what would amount to no attention at all? I mean if you could always have it your way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. Not at all. It would amount to a lot of attention sometimes, no attention sometimes, and a medium amount of attention the other times. And there would be just days when I kind of wish that I could go home and put some kind of indiscriminate stuff around my space and pasky (ph) around. To be a little of this, some of this, got to do that, get to the dishes when I feel like it, maybe watch some TV, and then go to bed. And I have to bother with him at all. But this upsets him very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait, what is this middle level of attention like if you don't mean that kind …</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The middle level of attention is kind of doing things, doing two different things with the time. Being involved in something other than each other yet still very much together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you want to be able to find a way of doing all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That is really easy to do when we're getting along very well. But when either one of us is insecure for some reason or whatever or not feeling very well it is totally impossible for us.</p>

<p>It just feels to me that that allows the alternative of I just, if we just both decide we don't want to do whatever we're doing we want to do something together, that is fine. We want to just talk, that's fine. However if we want to still do something apart, two separate things, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're not being together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want him to change his definition of what together means? Is that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that is it, yeah. But I can't force that on him. I guess what we're trying to do is force each other's definition on one another. I think we both are. He would like me to accept his definition that being together is not doing anything else at the same time. And I would like him to accept my definition of being together is a feeling, a state of mind, and not a physical thing. Sitting side by side and reading two separate papers is still being together. And I guess we get (inaudible) when our definitions clash. And we go through various little trips and games trying to put them on when we know we'll just take them out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm just wondering is if you both agree that the same amount of time must be spent being together, and the argument is over what counts as that time…</p>

<p>CLIENT: After being together a year and a half we've kind of adjusted to each other. I have kind of given more time and he's fine taking less in terms of – what time can we spend together. And there are just certain times, if you want to spend the evening at home you're going to spend the evening at home, there is no other way. I mean you can't go to somebody else's home and say you're spending the evening at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there are certain amounts of time that have to be spent together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just by definition…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just by definition the way you set up your life and how you relate to where you live. There are just certain evenings that we want to spend at home. Home in a very selfish way, in my house sitting and doing whatever, as opposed to—that we want to spend together or we want to go out.</p>

<p>So that the amount of time we spend together isn't always wrapped up with how much time we want to spend sitting at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say there is coincidence between sitting at home and being physically close to…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which is a happy point, which we take advantage of. But we fucked up in the middle somehow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where is the middle? Where the middle is where the sitting in the same room is not enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right yeah. Yeah. Somewhere between being, somewhere the coincidence of isn't it nice that we live in the same – either we set it up so we live in the same place so when we just don't want to do anything special we can still be together turns into – we live together, we have to be together. And I see that kind of a little sucker.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you expand on that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like coming home and I like sitting down and I like relaxing and I like being with Terry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now those are all one big thing or are those separate aspects of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those all fit together. Those are separate aspects of a very nice whole. Each part has value, and as a whole it still has value, greater value.</p>

<p>And I like thinking that I do this of my own volition this is what I'm comfortable with and this is what I like doing. And I like to think that this is what, that he does this of his own volitions. That he like coming home. That home is relaxed. He likes being with me, living with me. And I don't like feeling that I don't do this of my own volition, that this is what is demanded of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the…</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he demands my presence. I have to come home because he is there, because he wants me to be there. That it is my duty to be there, not because it is pleasant for me to be there, not because I want to be there, not because I'm most comfortable there and can do what I want there—rather because Murphy is there, he demands my presence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you mean and there isn't another (inaudible) to decide whether you want to do that or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Kind of like, well you are living with him and he's there so you'll have to go home, so you'll have to be with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like there is some course (ph) or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no freedom of action. There is an obligation, but it is not spontaneous. It is nothing from within myself. It is something from him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You haven't decided that you want to meet this obligation, you mean, it is almost ..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No when it is put on me I have no choice but to meet it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? I mean how does that go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I live there. I mean all of my things are there, it would be a real big hassle to go and get my things and go study somewhere else. Or I wouldn't be as comfortable going someplace else. I have a feeling that my home is my home and going someplace to someone else's house is their home and not mine. And that making the change would be a really big hassle, and that I love him a great deal and I want to make him happy.</p>

<p>And so when he demands my presence and he demands that I be home just to be with him, I try and go along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is the reason?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he needs me. And because he demands it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is something you don't like in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'd rather – I would be there anyway. If he didn't demand it, it would be much more pleasant for me. I would feel much better …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If he demands it then it doesn't seem to you like you have a choice over it, even if you would have done it anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Once he starts putting pressure on me I lose my sense of comfort and relaxation and self-determination of what I'm going to do with my evening. And I lose the sense of why I'm there, the real sense of why I'm there. I'm there because I'm comfortable and the reason I like being there.</p>

<p>And that is deep down inside the real reason I'm there, why I do spend my evenings at home. They are pleasant, they are nice. I like them. But when they are not pleasant they are not comfortable because he's making demands as to how I should spend my evening at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you lose that sense – so now you're saying you lose that sense of being there because you like it because there are times when you don't like it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. Whereas I think what is happening with him is he's feeling kind of trapped by being at home. Because he doesn't get out a lot. And so what he wants me to do, this is very interesting because I haven't looked at it this way – is he kind of wants me to provide excitement, something to get him out of just having been home all day. Where what I want to is just come home and I want to do the exact opposite process. I want to wind down and he wants me to wind up. And kind of wants me to be the excitement – the thing that makes home more than just home. And I want him just to be a part of home. Is that clear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We kind of clash like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say, I guess, that you need at that time when you plan to both come together after school are completely opposite because of what has happened to you before in your day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like days when we, like days when he goes out. Some days he goes out. We get home about the same time it's fine. Because we're both in exactly the same key. And where I've been kind of running around and doing things, and he's been running around he wants to sit down and unwind, and I want to sit down and unwind, and that is very easy.</p>

<p>But when we've spent our days very differently, oh. And this gets compounded when he's sick, back to the whole beginning, because he really has been sitting there all day and doing nothing, not even reading his – and just feeling sorry and miserable for himself. And he wants me to come home and tell him that he is okay and he's fine, and there is nothing wrong with him. And tell him that a number of times. And I find I want to come home and just sit a while and get myself together. And have a nice two-way relationship with him. When he's sick I feel as if it is all a one-way relationship as the demand are placed on me just to produce whatever he needs to get better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I ride it out, it's been going on for about a week and a half. Except I feel strange because he's been really, really good for my family. So he's been very, very careful not to put pressure on me because it is building up a lot of insecurities and it is kind of coming out now. Especially because he started job hunting. He started yesterday and he just kept on feeling more and more miserable with a cold, and he was getting very little response on this telephone calls and so he was getting really, really down. And he had promised that he would call them back today, and he woke up feeling really miserable. But he called them back and they want him to come down, so he got dressed up and went down.</p>

<p>So I'll see how he is when he gets back. But he is just totally freaked out about that. He is just so paranoid about everything. Totally paranoid that this cold is never going to go away – he said to me ‘I'm never going to be well'. And he is so amazing I just want to go bob him over the head.</p>

<p>If that is so I'm leaving, I'm not going to live with you like this – and that I don't love him, and that – we were supposed to go to New York this weekend to the wedding of a very old friend that I decided that we really can't afford for me to go. And this weekend is graduation weekend and I will make a mint (ph) at the restaurant. It is really a lot of money. It would be stupid of me to go to New York for somebody's wedding who I'll never know, and then run around New York seeing as many movies as I (inaudible) can.</p>

<p>I'd much rather sit home and work, make a lot of money, maybe paint the back porch and just relax and maybe work on papers and exams. But it's not going to turn out like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want him to leave. I'm tired of it I want to be away from him. As soon as he goes I'm moving around with somebody else. So the whole two and a half days he's gone I'm going to set this up. Incredible I'm going to screw somebody else, I'm going to get tickets and I'm go to the Stuttgart Ballet and see Carmen which he wants to see.</p>

<p>Let's see, what other preposterous things. Mostly that I want him to go away, that I can't wait ‘till he's gone, that I'm just going to tear loose as soon as he's out of sight. He's never going to get a job because he has a cold, he's never going to get a job. And it just goes on like this, and on and on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is it that you said that particularly brought about all that? I guess some of it that you just said is that it just goes on and on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, it just goes on and on. When there is just a little bit of it I can handle it. I can either pull him out it by taking the actual absurdity of his words and turning them against him. Last time he did crawl up to me and leaned against the wall and said, ‘Are you sleeping with me tonight?' I thought it was the most preposterous thing I ever heard, I said, ‘No. tonight is the night to take care of my back, I am sleeping on the dining room floor. It is a good hard floor.' and he burst out laughing. It was such a ridiculous thing to say.</p>

<p>Okay it turned out he had on the back of his mind that I might sleep on the couch so I wouldn't get his cold, but it hadn't even entered my mind.</p>

<p>When he is being particularly wormy and mousy and absurd, I can turn that absurdity around and make him see how silly it is. And there are other times like when he gets upset about not getting a job, all that I can do is to say, ‘Look you've got a very bad cold and you're just not thinking straight. And the more you let yourself get upset by this, the weaker you get and the more your cold wears you down and it just gets to be circular.'</p>

<p>‘Don't hassle it right now, now is not the time to hassle it. At 10 o'clock at night there is nothing you can do about getting cold except get over your cold.'</p>

<p>But after you've said that five or six times and my approach is obviously not getting through to him I start getting impatient and don't know what to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean impatient because your tactic isn't working? Yeah, and also impatient that he's clinging to something I tend to see as absurd. That he's letting himself fall into this. That he's not saying, ‘I'm sick and that is why I'm not getting a job'.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's not trying to get away from himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I become very impatient. I get kind of pissed because it looks to me that what he's doing is asking me for just total unqualified reinforcement which he can't give himself at the moment so he just turns to me and asks me again and again and again to just chilling all his doubts and make him feel better.</p>

<p>And I resent that. I think he should be able to take care of himself. I take care of myself 90 percent of the time. Sure there is times when I need reassurance, and I get it, and there are times when he needs reassurance and he gets it. There are also times when he gets impatient with me, and I get impatient with him. And I get tired of saying the same thing over and over again. Now he's all the time worried about a job—well maybe you will or maybe you won't.</p>

<p>It makes it very difficult for him because he feels very neglected and mistreated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what is the problem that you're seeing…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the problem is that he does say he feels mistreated. I don't like to think I'm mistreating him. I don't like to think that he's unhappy because I'm not being good enough to him. And the problem is that in some sense, yeah, there are times that I'm not being very good to him. On the other hand there are times when I'm being very, very good to him, too good to him sometimes, I think.</p>

<p>So when he says that, I get a bit uneasy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wonder if he's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you know what times that is when he is right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, and I get kind of uneasy. But at the same time I am not willing to just sit and hold his hand all day and help stop his tears, I'm not. And I have no guilt feelings about that. I'm just not going to do it. I'm not going to spend the next week sitting and holding Murphy's hand and blowing his nose. I'm just not.</p>

<p>And sometimes I feel that is what of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To simply take care of him – I mean not just to simply take care of him and really do what he wants, but on the other hand…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't totally ignore him. I mean he is sick, and he does feel lousy, and I do want to help him get better, and I love him a great deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that the other thing. The other hand what I was going to say was on the other hand you know that sometimes you are good to him, and sometimes his reactions aren't justified. So when he gives this reaction you feel uneasy, I guess you're saying. You refer to those times when you know that you hadn't done what's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then on the third hand it is like trying to find a way that you can do something for him …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes that is exactly what is troubling me. When I just… Last night he was sitting there and he went into this bout of coughing and sneezing and blowing his nose. And it sounded like he was going to throw up. Well I thought, ‘Are you okay?', and he said, ‘No I'm not alright, (inaudible). (laughter)</p>

<p>And I was really mad, like what was I supposed to do. Obviously I was asking was there anything I could do, I wasn't asking if he was okay, obviously he's miserable. But I mean, if I was going to have to sit there and take care of him, at least he should not get mad at me when I try and do stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Honestly at least he should be probably grateful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, or at least say just, ‘Can I have a glass or water'. Or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that is the funny thing because then it's like – oh yeah, she's not …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he gets mad ‘till I pay attention to him. And then when I do pay attention to him he gets mad at the way I'm doing it, because there is nothing I can do for his cold. There is zero, not anything I can do for his cold. He has been to the doctors, got medicine, by most intelligent suggestion yesterday was to call him and hear his (inaudible) which he did. That is all I can think of saying. Save more.</p>

<p>I'm convinced that what happened was his cold went to a certain point and the weather changed radically and everything just – all the mucus filled up in his head again. So the thing is strictly a head cold at the moment. And to me it is really grown out of the weather change. I have a feeling that it will dry up when it gets warmer, but he doesn't want to hear that right now, so I'm not telling him that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what happens is something like he wants you to pay attention to him. Pay attention to him in what sense? Then you get criticized for the way it's done and you don't think..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. One of the reasons I'm not so willing to sit around and be with him constantly is there is nothing I can do for him. There is zero I can do for him besides carry his Kleenex box. I can't blow his nose, I can't make his nose dry up…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can do nothing sufficient to curing his cold. Has he asked you to do that for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's asking for care. Nebulous care. Whatever Florence Nightingale does it would be okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I can't do anything. I mean it is very upsetting to have to sit there and listen to him feeling miserable, listening to his coughing and blowing his nose constantly, and sneezing all over the place. I mean it is impossible to stand it. It is impossible to hug him without getting sneezed or coughed at. He can't hold a phone conversation without his having to blow his nose into the phone. It is very difficult.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you simply don't really enjoy being around him…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I really don't. I wouldn't want (overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perceptually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I wouldn't mind if there was something I could do when I was sitting by his bedside – bathing his forehead. Or emptying his bed pan, or helping him barf into the toilet, anything. But just to be sitting there being attention and just a mother, combination nurse-mother-teddy bear object, I find that I am being treated as an object and I find it objectionable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now it sounds like you simply don't want to do what he wants you to do. Not so much for being criticized or anything else. It is simply that to sit there and listen to him sneeze and cough all the time is a thing that you do not want to do, period.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well that is the major part of the hassle I'm having. Because while on a strictly selfish level, no I don't really want to do that. And if he were a stranger I wouldn't do that. I mean if he were just somebody, if I sat down next to somebody in a bus who sneezed and coughed all over me I'd go to the other end of the bus. But he's not a stranger. He deserves better treatment than that. But I'm not sure exactly what I should be doing.</p>

<p>I don't want to, I don't want to abandon him. My selfish physical reaction to it are kind of peripheral because I think that there are emotional responses which I want to give him and which I'm having a very hard time finding what they should be in this situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by ‘should'? I mean is it what you could stand to do, or is it what he would really want, or is it for them to be genuine instead of…</p>

<p>CLIENT: A combination of all three. That they should be genuine and that they should be in some way soothing to him, yet not a great imposition on me. There should be something, there should be something that I can do to keep him company, to make him happier and that will in turn make me happier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think there is such a thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think that there should be something. If nothing else I'm going to buy a scrabble set. Like he looked at me, maybe if I played cards with him – I don't play cards. I might get a scrabble set today, that might help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the kind of thing that he might …</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so yeah. Because the issue right now is for me to sit there and entertain him. Talk, say something interesting, do something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it is all on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I'm just not – and it is very hard to sit and make conversation with somebody who is sick, who hasn't been outside, especially when my day has been singularly unexciting.</p>

<p>And so I start hedging and becoming uncomfortable. But if I could find something outside that we can both occupy ourselves with without either of us being put upon, because we both like to play scrabble a lot, that might be the answer. At least a partial solution. And make him feel he's not neglected, that I'm taking care of him that I do care for him and about him. I'm willing to go out of my way a little bit for him. But not by assuming that I would like to sit around and wait for his every move. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And does that kind of thing speak also to your fear of being imposed upon and really not wanting to be around him now. Do you think that if you had a kind of thing that you could do together instead of having to you always be talking, would that really …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That combination is really the problem, that combination of you always having to be talking and him sneezing and…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And this way, you know, it is a good compromise in that after a night playing scrabble I can now say, well I'm going to do such and such and go and do it without his feeling that I'm neglecting him or that I'm not being good enough for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you mean he'll take that, that will count.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That will count on his books. And then we can kind of find something else to do, I don't know what, but … And the incident (inaudible) cold. I'm just not very, I'm very much uninventive with myself in what to do when I have a cold. Just very (inaudible) to try to be inventive about what somebody else should do when they have a cold.</p>

<p>I've got, my solution is usually I sleep. My solution to everything is that I sleep. But he hasn't seen that side, just doesn't know how to come to that.</p>

<p>I'm convinced it will pass. But he's not but I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The cold is just one of the issues too. Are there any issues that come up with the cold?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The cold, mainly I'm convinced that the cold will pass. The more general issues kind of come and go and I'm convinced that they will more go than come when he gets a job. When he has more to do with himself. When I'm not the great emotional event of the day, my coming home, talking to him …</p>

<p>CLIENT: When he sees other people and have more feeling of (inaudible), at that point the hassles of how much attention we spend on one another and what we do together will be less of, or at least translated into something very different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he is very strong (inaudible) situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of the problem right now is that he feels that he has been supportive of me and that whenever I've needed him he has been there with advice, consolation, strength, and that right now he needs support and strength and somebody to help him stay together and that I haven't been (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I have mixed feelings. It is very hard for me to try and compare the two. Because lately I have been leaving reinforcements in very small segments. There will be one period, maybe half an hour where I need to sit down and talk or work something out and get reinforcement and that is the last time. Whereas Murphy just kind of tends to need it constantly throughout the day. Whenever something goes wrong, constant reinforcement. Also (inaudible) fantastic of keeping tally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing about somehow if you hadn't been paid attention to, then …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I wouldn't have that obligation to pay him back. It is a debt. He will remind me that since I did such and such, now you have to respond in kind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of a norm of reciprocity that that is supposed to be compelling you, maybe not compelling you, but you're especially bad if you don't live up to that. I guess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because (inaudible) and because it cheapens whatever (inaudible). …and I'm just not living up to everything that he is doing. I kind of want to say, ‘Well Charlie last year I held you together, and I held you together through the summer, and I held you together through 90 percent of the fall, so if we want to go play get her, in my opinion you are more in my debt than I am in yours'. And it just gets nasty and petty and stupid. It doesn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you needed to say that you don't like (overlapping)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no desire to be vindictive in person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you consider that a vindictive way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I can't see where that would in any way be constructive. How can you possibly challenge that sort of statement on anything but the most low level in terms of – well I think you're wrong, I think you're selfish. And I don't see any way to have any kind of intelligent rational conversation, and come to any sort of consensus about who owes who. How much in terms of reinforcement and love…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well wait. Do you mean that the issue that fact can't be resolved, or do you mean you don't want to be dealing at that level.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't see any way that that fact can be resolved. I also don't want to be dealing at that level at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then you've got a problem because that seems to be your reaction, where does that come in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That reaction comes from his reaction, which is, you're not being good enough to me. I've been giving you all the help and support you need because of your exams, pretty soon you're going to have to give some to me. It's like a 24 hours notice. (laughter) I'll go out and prepare myself right now.</p>

<p>I guess what happens is, wow this is really tricky, before I put out for him, I have to be doing this for my own mind, I have to be (inaudible). Like when I'm convinced that he is hassling and whatever it is, is really a problem and is really upsetting him, he need help – I'm there. There is no doubt about it. It just comes out of me, it pours out of me.</p>

<p>And what I think that he's being worried, or too dependent, or not handling his own problems, and is looking for me to just kind of be a mother figure, nothing. I just don't care, I kind of hold back, and put out little verbal feelers, and give very small answers, not much help. And so my reaction is to physically hold him so he can't look me in my face, and make kind of soothing noises.</p>

<p>But when I feel something is real, then I (inaudible). And the problem with that is we don't always tally as to what is an important problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you don't agree that (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That he feels he need more support than I feel he needs, and he gets less than he feels he should have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not less than you feel he should need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm unclear about it. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you do know, at least you know that when you're really convinced that something is wrong then you don't have a problem. But it sounds as if when you first started describing that it is also like once that is proven to you, or once that becomes a problem, but in the absence of compelling proof of that fact (inaudible) and he has to give compelling proof otherwise you will be non-committal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It is a halfway, very obviously foolish thing I'm going through. And I'm stuck with the question – who in fact am I to judge whether Murphy is in need or not. Like what are my criteria, and it seems to me my criteria, whatever they are, and I'm not sure must be very biased and not fair to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This goes off something which happened on Saturday which was we, my rap group were kind of doing a thing with one of his friends who is a mechanic. And he was talking about cars. And it was supposed to last from about 1 to about 3, and we were supposed to go… Murphy and I were supposed to go up to a party at (inaudible), which was from 3 to 4, so we'd totally be late.</p>

<p>And the thing lasted longer than I expected and we never actually got out to work on the car which (inaudible). And he said to me about ten of three that we should leave, and I asked the guy how much longer it will be, and he said it will be a while, and I said let's wait a little bit longer.</p>

<p>Then kind of got into it again, and he didn't say anything again, so I figured well we won't go. And then …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you thought a decision had been made.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right I thought. No I thought that if one of us didn't take any action it would kind of turn out that way and that would be alright. Except around 3:30 I started getting really upset that he was going to be mad. There were no signs from him, I mean he was being fine. He was listening, asking questions, and I was getting more and more agitated. And (inaudible) more and more people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That he would (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right without any prompting from him. Without any cause in this situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in the sense that you've given more back than you were anticipating and (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he wasn't fidgeting, he was paying attention and he wasn't trying to get me away and I was getting along perfectly fine, with no anger coming out of him at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then when you mean anticipation I guess you mean worrying that underneath he was angry, or that he was concealing …,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I am convinced that he was going to be mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. That he was going to be angry or also that he was concealing it along the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I was convinced that he was going to be angry and that he wasn't going to be able to cover it and I was going to be very embarrassed in front of these people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it was going to break out and…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so I said what should we do, and he said, ‘Nothing'. And I was convinced that this was kind of the fact he was covering up his anger because he was outside at that time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he was (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was making a terrible scene and getting furious with me, especially about (inaudible). And I became more and more agitated and I kind of projected more and more of what I expected him to do on his reactions, which were fine. There weren't any bad reactions. Until finally he did get upset, he did get nervous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Over what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Over my reaction I think. And he called and made some excuse about why he couldn't go. And I insisted that we go home and figure out what we were going to do. And I totally freaked out, total hysterics about how I was sorry that he wanted to be mad and how I was embarrassed about this thing that we just had in front of these people. And he made me realize that it was all in my head. It was all… and I realized that I was expecting him to act badly so I sat the situation in such a way that he'd do nothing but act badly. But he did not actually do anything there to embarrass me, but rather my reactions to him made it look like he had, or was going to do something to embarrass me. My obvious fear was the embarrassment, not the way he was treating me, but that I was frantic. And that is what created the scene in front of the people.</p>

<p>And so it was all in my head. I think there was just… he was fine until I started acting up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Clearly what you mean by it being all inside your head is that helps what I'm thinking (inaudible), is that in that situation, in this particular situation he was doing nothing that would lead to your thinking he is angry. But as to whether – I guess what I'm thinking is that the more critical thing in that in a way is thinking about – how come that is a worry for you? What made it? Because that just hasn't sprung up. What has happened so that that is what you would be concerned about so that you're concerned that he's going to blame you, so you try to anticipate his reactions and read, trying to read the visible signs. So I'm saying it's a different focus to what the issue is. I don't know what …</p>

<p>CLIENT: My issue is the whole thing is hassling me is that I have this problem with continually trying to second guess him and for the past two or three months it has been wrong, continually wrong. I continually expected him to make an ass of himself and he hasn't. And I feel very, very badly about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. It is not so much the anger that you are worried about anyway, it was that you were going to become embarrassed in front of people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it was more the anger, it was more the interaction. That we were going to have a very bad interaction or we would have a fight, or that he was going to be resentful, I was going to be resentful. There was going to be a whole lot of hassling and trauma that we would patch up. But it would be a big hassle.</p>

<p>And I've been expecting him, consistently I'm expecting him to react badly to situations. And I mean, 90 percent of the time he just doesn't, and I get into. This is like a hassle I've had for a long time. And not just with him, but with other people, like with my parents for a lot of times I'm just really apprehensive that I did something I didn't tell them and they would totally explode and they didn't.</p>

<p>But it's getting really bad with Murphy now because I'm always expecting him to act badly, and this is kind of projecting onto my friends. It's projecting out (inaudible). And it is very demoralizing for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean for that to be so apparent to your friends. (inaudible)</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is Leanne, and it's 2/20/12. Now you can just be normal. So where do you want to start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. There's really like a lot going on, (laughs) going on. So, I guess, I sort of I've been more aware of how I've been talking and writing and things. And I think I was like successful in some aspects like there was an e-mail, there's these e-mails that go back and forth between the house that are like, you know, if everyone could pay me $3.27 for toilet paper that'd be great. And like I really get annoyed by like $2 things or whatever, so I was like maybe if we could tally it like on the bulletin board and just pay each other at the end of the month that'd be great. And I said that like months ago, and so then I was a little bit irritated when this came so I was like, how do I respond to that without making it like sound angry, but also sort of stating that. And I sort of, I thought I did it really well, which I was excited about. I was like, oh I've noticed we send a lot of e-mails about, you know very small amounts. I was wondering if it would be ok with everyone if it, that's not like verbatim, but something like that.</p>

<p>[00:1:16] You know, if we did this (pause) or I would like it if we did this, does anyone have any feedback? Or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, how did it feel to word that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it was hard because at first I worded it really like passive aggressively (laughs). It's like I'm [super mad] (ph) about these e-mails guys, let's figure it out. And so, but then I was like, that's really horrible. (laughs) And so, I guess I sort of found the balance and it was ok. But, I do feel like I have to tweak certain words or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's a different way of talking for you so it's not going to come naturally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were your responses like? Or have you gotten responses yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, this was like last week.</p>

<p>[00:1:57] It was, they were fine with it, but people still want the e-mails. So, I guess nothing's really getting done, but it made me feel better to like just say it. So, it makes me ok with getting...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like one thing that's getting done is you know, there's probably less, if you are going to tally them and then just do a kind of final kind of payment of all the accumulated purchases at the end of the month, you might not feel as much response, the need to respond to each one individually, but people still get to say their piece. They get to be heard about the toilet paper. I do this. I do that. So it's not a surprise at the end of the month when someone says, you owe me 20 bucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, even if like nothing happened from it, it was weird because I felt like I wasn't, (pause) I don't know. Like I feel like little things that usually go bad for me (crosstalk) and like passive aggressive and then like it gets really bad and there's this huge fight or whatever. But I just like ok, I said my piece and if that's not going to happen then whatever. Like, I sort of like felt ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get heard at least. [00:2:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't realize that that was like a big deal. (pause) But I guess like in the past week it's been harder to like notice that I keep saying these things and like (pause) hearing what I actually sound like is hard because it's not like (pause), it's not what I thought I sounded like. And it's really sort of, I don't know (pause). That's not what I sound like in my head at all. (pause) And I didn't realize that's what I sounded like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's very jarring to hear yourself in that new way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also really frustrating too because I feel like a lot of the time like I'll say something and then, and then like I wish I could take it back, or like, I didn't mean to say it like that. And then, it sort of like snowballs or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were the differences between you, how you thought you sounded and what you're hearing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought I sounded respectful but assertive and I sound totally like I doubt myself. (pause) And that's not the case (laughs). Because I don't, but I sound like I really do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not how you really fell either. [00:4:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I realize that I speak differently like depending on what situation I'm in. So like at home I speak differently than like in the classroom, obviously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Home apartment or home family?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Home house, home, yeah ok. (pause) And so I know, I know, that like I speak differently like that, but I then I sort of like find myself wondering like well, like am I really a confident person or am I sort of just pretending like I am in my head? Because, you know, just things like what I was little I like to sing and I sang at a wedding or something one time and I was like six and some guy was like, "oh my gosh you sang so well, you missed like one note, but you sang so well and you have such a pretty voice." And so everything was like a compliment except that one note and of course...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You heard the one note.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, I just heard the...and I never, I didn't want to sing ever again and so I never sang until college. In college I was like, you know, if there's ever a time to challenge myself it's now, so (laughs). I started taking voice lessons. I sounded like crap obviously because I couldn't get over the fear and it was just like, I guess fear is like really (pause) it's a huge deal when you're singing. [00:5:07] And even now, I like audition for things and I don't get it because I sound like crap when I audition. (pause) But, it's weird because I don't think I'm a bad singer (pause), do you know what I mean? So, I have like improved a lot to where like I'm willing to sing in front of people now (laughs), but I can't like really sing in front of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't let go the way you need to though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that that sort of parallels, (pause) like in my language I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you know you, what you know you could do in your head is so different from how you perform. Whether it be talking in class or when you talk, you know, talking to the group at home or singing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ultimately I think that, you know, it matters what I say because it's not like people can, you know, look inside my head and be like oh, she really meant this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There may be some people in your life who know you well enough to kind of look past maybe the presentation, but a lot of time you're not going to get that opportunity.</p>

<p>[00:6:05] And maybe some of your housemates do know you (pause) and can kind of get, see underneath. Your mom might be able to do that, but you're not, there are probably a lot of your classmates that just hear what you say in class and that's what they see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I don't know, that's been sort of weird because then I also sort of act differently in front of people. And so I've always had like (pause) different personas I guess that I put on. And then so I, sometimes I don't even know which one is really me, like, so it's just like, I'm kind of really confused. (pause) But, yeah I guess that was one thing. But maybe it's part of the whole realizing what I sound like. (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it was kind of jarring, a bit disorienting. And you're paying more attention so you're hearing yourself more often and in different scenarios to be surprised by what you're hearing. It can be really unsettling. [00:07:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that, so like there's also this thing where (pause), this is like separate, but (laughs). Well, sort of, maybe not, I don't know. Where, for example, I will see, like I have trouble flirting for some reason, but like, not really, like I can't explain it. So, like if I see someone that I'm like, oh he's cute or whatever, I'll like try to make eye contact or whatever, or just smile, and like as soon as...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would this be like a totally random stranger or like a guy you kind of know from class?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Either or, both, sort of both. So, (pause) as soon as like someone starts looking back at me it's like, oh god, he's going to notice, sort of. But, like the point is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want him to notice you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't know what to do with the attention once you've got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And, and it's like, it's very much like a (pause), I don't know how explain it. It's like a negative, it's a very negative feeling.</p>

<p>[00:8:04] And like, for example, like, I don't know, watch like TV shows or whatever on this one someone was flirting with someone or telling her mom that she had a boyfriend or something. And I was like, I can't even imagine doing that, and even though my mom has asked me like, you know, "do you have a boyfriend, you shouldn't reject this side of your life" sort of thing. And so, even though it's like expected, it's still something I feel like, very viscerally, that's a negative thing even though I know that it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Negative how? What word would you use to describe that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (long pause) I don't know. (long pause) It's like wrong, but it's not. I don't know. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it would somehow be bad of you to have a boyfriend or to share that information?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess all of the above. I don't, I mean, it's not like, like I know different, but it feels, it feels, do you know what I mean, like? [00:9:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't have to be logical. That's ok. I'm interested in the feeling because that's what I think is so powerful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially since it changes my behavior even though I, I like intend...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's as if you're seeking something out, but you don't quite trust that it's an ok thing to have sought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it somehow, somehow your mom would think badly of you, even though she's asking and she's, she's insinuated that this would be a thing that she would sort of be interested in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well now she would.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not when you were, not that time they found that note in your diary?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or growing up, like there are multiple instances of like, you have to, and I didn't really understand until, maybe I still don't understand, but (pause). So, I don't know, I mean, maybe like a year ago my mom told me that she hasn't ever told anyone this and she told, and I was like, "I don't know what to do with this," (chuckles). She said that like, basically the reason that she married my dad was because she had gotten pregnant when she was, I don't know, 17 or 18. And so, part of like why my parent's marriage sucked is because my dad felt obligated to marry my mom. [00:10:06]</p>

<p>But also, my mom felt guilty for getting pregnant. So, I, I think it makes sense for her to not want that for me. So I understand, but she always pushed this like, I don't even know how to explain it. It was like Victorian Europe sort of like sensibility towards sex or relationships. And I so, and I feel like I still have that, but even though I don't, that's not how I think I want to be. That's not how I want to...But that's how I feel, if that makes any sense? And also, I guess like I sort of relate it back to my like college history with boys and it was just like so erratic and, I don't know, crazy. And that, I don't even know, like... [00:10:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you had any positive experiences with relationships or sexual intimacy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I know it's really like (chuckles)...I'm 25 and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't need to be judged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I don't know, I mean at the same time I've [felt] (ph), for example I had that really long, long relationship in college that lasted forever (pause) with the guy who has my name. And, (pause), I don't know, like it was like he brought the crazy out in me and I'm not crazy (chuckles), but I am sort of, I think I'm embarrassed not, like I don't care what other people think like, like I embarrassed myself that I like let these bad things happen. And I can't' really get over, like even though I know that I would never do, like never like sort of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you let it happen? How is your...</p>

<p>CLIEN: I feel like I was like pushed into like a relationship, well it wasn't really even a relationship. It was, (pause) like it really wasn't a relationship. He was like sleeping with me while he was sleeping with half the school too and I didn't know because I was a freshman and...[00:12:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would you have known?</p>

<p>Well, apparently everyone else knew, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He probably wasn't trying to hide it from everyone else as much as he was trying to hide it from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then you thought you were having a monogamous relationship with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, sort of, we never sort of like made it official, but that's what I thought because I'd just gotten out of high school and that was my like very sort of naïve perception of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you assumed if you were sleeping with someone that he was just sleeping with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seems like a kind of reasonable assumption. You were only sleeping with him, right?</p>

<p>And even, you know, like the first time we slept together I was like, I didn't really want to, but there's this thing that like I, this is really embarrassing also, is that like I freeze up and like don't, I can't even like talk about anything at all. I can't say like a word and so even if I like really don't want to do something I don't say anything about it. I don't know why. Because, like, in the real world I'm not like that.</p>

<p>[00:12:58] Especially not in my head (laughs). So, I feel, I feel like embarrassed with myself for letting that sort of stuff happen I guess. And for, I don't know, I just feel like that was really not, that was really weak of me or like not strong or I don't know, [something seems like] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you're kind of playing the victim here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, but I also sort of let it happen too. Even after I knew, I was like, oh well he's a in a frat. I mean it was totally naïve. There was so much stuff. I like don't remember half of it, thank god (laughs), but (pause) yeah, there was some really like...I was just thinking about it the other day, I was like I can't believe I did like I did that or I can't believe I didn't do that, or you know how could I have put up with that for so long?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound really disappointed in yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like a lot. And (long pause) I mean it is sort of good in a way because I got everything bad that could possibly happen (chuckles) out with one person and I got that out early in college so, fine. Like, I know better, but...[00:14:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that fortunate that you had to have such negative experiences that are not necessary? I mean, I wasn't there, but it's hard to hold you completely responsible because I imagine that if you're so frozen and so anxious about being intimate with somebody that you feel like you can't say no, I wonder what that looks like from his perspective. Did it look like you were someone who was relaxed and comfortable and interested in the experience? I doubt it. I doubt that there wasn't some sign that you were uncomfortable. If you feel inside, like you're so frozen you can't say no, then I would imagine that from the outside you would look at least somewhat uncomfortable. At which point I would expect a respectful partner to check in and say, "Is this ok with you?" There's a difference between, you know, being engaged with somebody and being able to sense that they are just as happy and excited and interested as you are and having a partner that seems unsure. You're supposed to be in tune enough with the person that you're about to have sex with before, before it happened to notice that and to care. You're not really supposed to want to have sex with someone that seems uncomfortable. [00:15:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I mean why are, partially, you know, well you're fully blaming yourself. And, yes maybe you didn't, maybe you weren't as assertive as you wanted to be able to be, to say no. He also was not being respectful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I mean, I'm not entirely blaming myself. I, I feel nothing but anger towards him for being like so horrible. But, in a way like I guess I feel like I can really only control my behavior, you know. And so, that's really what I have control over like, he could have been the worst person in the world, but like I could have just said, all right, see ya later. [00:16:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely. There's room for you to develop a skill here. Where, a skill you know you need because it's possible that you're going to, maybe, maybe you didn't get all of the bad things out of the way at once. Maybe you will meet up with some inconsiderate individuals in the future. And it would be nice to have the skill to assertively so out loud what is also going on in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That makes sense. But, I think that like with does (coughs), sorry, what that does for, when I think about the future, is like considering like my dad and like what happened in college, for me like my greatest fear ever is like if someone ever cheated on me I don't think I could forgive them. Maybe...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who says you need to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, I guess like you're supposed to try, right? You know (chuckles). [00:17:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: According to who? What book?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a personal choice. I don't think there's a mandate that you have to forgive; that you have to respond one way or the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know that I'm thinking really far ahead, like and, but it's crazy to think that far ahead but, (pause) maybe not. That's sort of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, I think it's, I think your fears, yes you are jumping ahead to what if scenarios that we have no idea if you're going to encounter in the future. Ok, but it's informing what's going on for you right now. So, I'm guessing if that fear of "I don't know what I'd be able to do" is impacting when you catch someone's eye and then all of a sudden that's terrifying instead of being a nice next step. [00:17:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that (pause), I don't know. I also just felt so bad that I was so invested in this horrible person that knew was like not, no, good for me. I, I knew that. I knew that he wasn't good for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think you were so invested?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made him so important?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we talked a lot and I shared a lot about myself with him, probably more than I have with anyone else. Which is also why I was so angry that he treated me so poorly, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You missed a lot of vulnerability with him. And what was it like when you shared that stuff with him? When you shared things with him that nobody else knew? What was his response like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) He would share stuff with me as well. I mean, I'm sure, I think he had his own like, a lot of baggage as well. (pause) I don't think that he ever thought that he was being a bad person, like really. But, sometimes it's just like I don't care if you think you're being a good person (chuckles), I'm telling you you're not being a good person. (pause) And, I don't know, we would always have these fights that would build up, and it was like exactly the pattern that I've been telling you about, where like I put up with a lot of things and like once a month there was like this explosive fight where like, you know...[00:19:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you fight about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (long pause) To be honest, I like recently reread some of the like e-mails like, because I was like, I filled up half of my Google e-mails, which is ridiculous. And, so I was making room and some of them I like didn't even want to read because I sounded really crazy. Like I was reading what I had written, I didn't care what he said. I was reading what I had written and it was so embarrassing so like, (pause) not (coughs) out of character. I'm like not the person I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was embarrassing about it? [00:19:58]</p>

<p>I don't know. I was just like (long pause), I don't know, I mean, I guess I just I wanted something from him that he could not and would not give.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're embarrassed that you wanted something? Your needs?</p>

<p>Well, I'm embarrassed that I like told him about it and then even when he said like, "no," then I was like, well, why not? Or, like, I don't know. And then I think what's most embarrassing for me is that I think that like crazy up and down thing really, like I think that I was so wholly invested in it that like it really threw me off for the next two years. And I was like really swimming at rock bottom and I had like a lot of one night stands and was just really like sort of the other way. And, you know, I drank a lot and did a lot of things. So it was just like really sort of rocky. And I think because of it I lost a lot of friends and so it was just like everything in my life fell apart because of this one part of if, so I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't like being so reliant on him. [00:21:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that. I hate it, like, because even like those people that like can't be apart for more than five minutes like, that's so annoying to me. And like I never want to be that person. I want to be a whole person (laughs) that happens to be in a relationship. You know what I mean? Like, (pause) and I want the other person to be a whole person as well because, I don't know, like it just doesn't seem healthy for me to like, I don't want to be that invested. Not that I don't want to be invested (laughs), I'm not saying that's not valuable, I just don't want to like fall apart if, if like we're not together anymore, you know? I don't know (pause). So, (chuckles)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting because you're, you're, in looking back at the e-mails and being reminded of (pause) what that experience was like and how much it affected you, it's that same sort of disappointment in yourself that it sounds like you felt when you recognized that your language that you express to other people is not the language that you want and that you hear in your head. It's noticing that you're not, you're not being how want to be. And in, in that college experience you weren't being how you wanted to be. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, I guess I think a lot about who I want to be. I do think a lot about that. I don't know if that's good or bad, but I think, I don't know, I think like, I don' t know that there's like a end goal to that, like I don't think I want there to be. But, just like, I don't know, if I don't think about it then who am I?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how we could balance kind of, this kind of learning skills that mirror more of how you want to present yourself, but at the same also being a little bit less stringent with what the criteria is that feels acceptable. Because a lot of what I hear is a very harsh judgment for not being or feeling these ways that you think you should. [00:23:08]</p>

<p>And maybe we could build in a little more flexibility around what you allow yourself to react with, emotionally. At the same time, that yeah, there's a...there's always room for self improvement, but we need not be so down on yourself in order to do that. I'd love to help you grow in ways that you want to, but I really don't want to jump on the bandwagon of saying, like, it was really bad that you did that or that or this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. But I think that, there's just like such an overwhelming sense of guilt for doing certain, for doing some of these things, especially like, I don't know, I think because I don't want to, I don't want be like (pause), like it sounds horrible but I don't want to be like my mom where like she feels like she has to stay with someone who she knows like doesn't love her back for 35 years. Even though she did it for the right reasons and like I... [00:24:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn't feel very fulfilling to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I like want to not do that. (pause) And I feel like I did. In college and even before I met him I knew I didn't want to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt like you replayed, you replayed some of your mom's pattern, which you're so terrified of doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even before that had happened I, I knew that I didn't want to do that and, and I did it. It was like, I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it, so like I ended up doing that (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really scary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I didn't like it at all. (pause) And so I think that after that, and even like some of my friendships that had blown up I sort of, I tend to look at friendships as like temporary as opposed to like something to keep growing which is like I know not, not a very useful way to look at friendship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think you look at them that way? What makes them temporary? [00:25:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) The pattern that I've experienced in the past, I don't know. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And why do you think that's not ok? Maybe it's ok that friendships are temporary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that it's a bad thing that they are, but, I know that like some people just grow apart like, that's fine too. But, I don't know, I don't want someone out there holding like this huge part of who I am (pause) if we no longer speak, or, do you know mean? Like, because it seems like, I don't know, hard to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that you said, "Holding a part, holding who you are"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knowing all of this stuff. Like it really bothers me that he knows all of this stuff about me. And he's like out there somewhere. And I don't know, like maybe he's telling people how crazy I am, which I was, it's fine, whatever. But, some of that stuff is really personal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's very personal. Feels risky to have someone know all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah (chuckles). I guess, I don't know, I don't like that. [00:26:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's that like in here, because I'm getting to know a lot of stuff about you too and I'm wondering how does that compare and what kind of feelings are reared...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that like, to be honest, the like confidentiality thing really relieves my fears. So, I'm not really worried about that (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's more, I'm wondering if from him it's more that he could be sharing that with other people...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or that he knows it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's definitely what it is, yeah. And I don't, because I don' t have any control over that, right? Because once something's out there I can't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, so here's the piece, it's the control piece, feeling out of control. Because that's the big difference. Having the confidentiality in here provides that safety net. You get control, that you can say whatever you want to say and not say whatever you want to say and I can't share with anybody.</p>

<p>[00:26:52] But you don't have that same level of control over him or another person who you might disclose information to or who gets to see a part of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I know that sometimes I like, I do share certain things, like I do. My friend Julia is really like a, I told her a lot about me. But, she's also told me a lot about herself. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how does that feel, with her?</p>

<p>I trust her, I don't know, I just trust her. (pause) Maybe because she trusts me? I, I just think that she's like actually like a mature person and even if, like I'm the kind of person that like even when I blew up with my friends that one time in the library, like even when I feel that angry I don't feel like it's my right to share people's like secrets or whatever that they've told me. And for me, like that confidentiality or like that sort of like, like I will always err of the side of not telling someone, like even if someone's like, like that other day Julia was crying I think because she, she was like PMS or something and she was upset that her shirt fit differently or something and one of the other roommates saw her crying and so later he was like, "is she ok?"</p>

<p>[00:28:05] And I said, I said, yeah she's fine because I knew like, there was like something else she was upset over. But, it was something really minor. It was just like she gets emotional sometimes. And I was like, yeah, she's fine. And even, as soon as I said that, I was like that's too much. Like even just saying stuff like that like, for me, is over sharing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt like you had betrayed her confidence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so that's something that's really important to me. (pause) And maybe it, and maybe it is a control thing. But, (pause) but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that sounds like wrapped up in feeling, feeling safe. Feeling, being about to trust somebody and you haven't had a ton of great examples of really trustworthy individuals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you certainly weren't able to trust your dad and your mom wasn't able to trust your dad. You certainly weren't able to trust this first boyfriend. [00:28:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or my mom (chuckles). It's like she never knew about it, it lasted like forever, two, three years or whatever, on and off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a big piece of your life not to share.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. But she doesn't know a lot of other things. Like she doesn't know about the police report I filed. She doesn't know about, she doesn't know a lot of things. (pause) Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you, what would you think her reaction would be if you shared some of those things you keep from her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that (long pause), well I would think that she would think I made a lot of mistakes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're worried that you'd be judged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think most of all I'm worried about her feeling sad. And I don't, and I don't feel like I need to tell her, you know. It's one of those things that I don't really want to tell her. But then again, I don't, even if I had a good relationship with her I don't know how I would tell her (laughs). Like there's just, even just trying to think of like the words I would use, like I don't know what I would say. Like, oh, I have a boyfriend, that's so weird (chuckles), I don't know. Because we've never had a really, like a conversation like that. It's really new and personal. (pause) [00:30:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it would be a big step from where you are in your relationship with her now and in your comfort with yourself to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A big part of, I think, why I feel because like my dad, his great, his like big argument is that it's his personal life and I don't have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you hate not knowing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate, well, mostly I hate that he doesn't consider me a part of his, his personal life (chuckles). If like, if your daughter's not your personal life like your mom...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then what is personal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then what is personal? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you want to feel like you can tell him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but then I know, I feel like I she'd ask so many questions and be like, "oh my God, are you sleeping with him," and then just like freak out. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you opened that door where does it go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So there's all this like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Loss of control. If you open the door than she can, then she may want access to things and you might, and not feeling comfortable in having to answer the questions. You might not be able to control what information you give her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. It's a control thing, it's...(laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's actually a big thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes sense that you would want to feel a lot of control because I think we've discovered, you know, in looking at your history with your parents, you know that lack of privacy that you felt all the time and the lack of clear boundaries. They didn't respect your boundaries. So, if you can really trust somebody else to respect your boundaries and have very clear boundaries in place then you don't need to take so much control because you can trust them not to try to step into things that you, you know, wouldn't want them to know. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>Because since you didn't have that, the control piece becomes really important because than you...the only thing controlling your privacy is whatever control you put on the information they get, what they see, you know, what you tell them. So, not being able to trust that there's going to be a boundary that you feel comfortable with, that your mom would respect a boundary (pause) then why wouldn't you want to have control over the information she gets and what, you know, what she sees about your life and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's weird because I think that partially she knows, I don't think she remembers ever saying this to me but, one time we were on the phone and she was like, "I feel like you only tell me the positive sides of your life." And I was like, that's really accurate mom. Like, I didn't say that, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would assume she's pretty perceptive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, she really is but I don't know that she knows that that's true. Like I think she was just sort of talking, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's probably gotten an inkling that she's, you know, she's missing something. She doesn't know what it is, but she...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I basically talk to her about school, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she knows it. I mean, she doesn't know what else there is in your life, but there's got to be something else. [00:33:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, so I don't know. I think, I think that that was one of the first places that I figured out that like what I think isn't what people see (laughs) because I talk with my mom about, you know, school and work and like the crazy sutures that come in and whatever. And, but I don't t-t-talk to her about like, oh like, maybe I want a family someday or something. You know, she doesn't know any of that and so, to for her it totally seems like I'm like totally focused on a career and that's the only thing I think about. But it's not. Like, I think about a lot of other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's so much else to you that she doesn't get to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know that, yeah, I don't that could (pause), just thinking about that's weird. (pause) But, yeah, that's sort of what I've been thinking about.</p>

<p>[00:34:06] And I don't know, like, maybe it's (pause) like it sucks that I haven't had, you know, good relationships in the past, but I know that like what, I think I know what to expect, like, what to like look for and it just seems like (pause).. Like, I feel like things are changing a little bit for me socially because in college I knew everyone in college. Like I ran for school president and stuff, like, I knew a lot of people, but I didn't really know a lot of people. You know what I mean? Like, I knew everyone's names.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had tons of acquaintances.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. But here, I don't, I don't really know anyone. Like, my roommate, Phil, walks through Divinity School and like literally knows everyone. And I'm like, I'm usually that person, it's so weird. And, but the people that I do know, like especially the people that I live with have become really my closest friends. I really know them, sort of. [00:35:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really know them, sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, I think I do. I don't think I know everything about them, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How well do they know you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think Julia knows me the best. (pause) But, I, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do they not know? (pause) Not in terms of necessarily just information, but what, what is there about Leanne that they don't get?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how to answer that (laughs). (pause) I don't know, but, I don't know what like an example of that would be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well think of, when you think of how Julia knows you, how is that different from what Phil knows?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well Julia sort of knows more about like, knows more about my history and so more about how I think about things. (pause) Phil, we have a running joke in the house that he can see into people's souls. (laughs) And so he, he figured out that like I'm really hard on myself, like, like immediately he figured it out. He was like, "yeah, you're really hard of yourself," and he tells me all the time. And that really freaks me out because that's like, I don't, I wasn't, I didn't want, you know, I don't like it when people know that. Or, or anything I don't want them to know, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't you want him to know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, I don't know, that's personal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yet, shouldn't your relationships with the people your closest with be personal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (long pause) Yeah, I guess (laughs). (pause) But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are some mixed emotions about actually having an intimate, even, even just talking, taking the sexual stuff out of it, just having an intimate friendship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, I think you're right. Thinking back I tell people what I want them to know and I think that, I think it weird's me out that Phil knows stuff that I don't want him to know ....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [00:37:14] that you haven't explicitly told him...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, exactly. He's just really perceptive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it, does it, does it damage your relationship with him for him to know that? To be able to sense that you're hard on yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and he's even told me that he's hard on himself as well. (pause) Yeah, I don't know that it's like horrible, it's just uncomfortable (chuckles). Like, if I had told him that would be different. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you didn't have control over whether he would know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He figured it out without you deciding it was ok for him to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's really weird, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think the control piece, it's tricky because in, in your ideal relationships you don't have to have that level of control, but what you have is a way to determine whether it's safe to let go of that control.</p>

<p>[00:38:13] And I think that's what you don't feel comfortable with yet. You don't have a comfort with gauging is this a safe person with whom I don't have to hold onto the reins so tightly? Or is this someone who's not safe and therefore I do want to be in control? Wanting control, in itself, is not a bad thing, but being able to determine when you need it and when it's ok to be a little bit more relaxed, and I don't think you trust yourself to figure that out and so you want control, maybe, over almost all your relationships.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, and I guess I can see how that's not really fair because Julia has shared a lot more about herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've shared more with her. It sounds like that's a place where you have, maybe, flirted with the idea of giving up some of that control, that you've shared more because she does seem like she's, she's trusting you and you're trusting her a little bit. [00:39:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're meeting more people with whom it's safe to trust that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, I, my friend from school who's married, my friend Leonard, I think I may have told you about him, he's also someone that I've told, proven (ph) to actually, he's also told me stuff, a lot of stuff. [00:39:28]</p>

<p>We pretty much know a lot about each other. (pause) But, even that sometimes, I'm like, oh I wish I hadn't told him or I wish he didn't know that about me or, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because something has happened because they knew?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. He's a great friend, I don't know why. You know, like when I move somewhere new like when I first moved here I was like, oh great, I can be whoever I want to be and people don't have to know anything unless I tell them (laughs) like. So, and, it's like starting over was like complete control over how people saw me, or something. [00:40:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely remember thinking that. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you want to be someone different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (long pause) I think I like the liberty of thinking that I could. And yeah, I think I'm insecure about a lot of things, like, you know, I don't think I'm smart enough or, that's actually a big one (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a pretty common one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Or, you know, I don't think I'm pretty or like, all these things that I don't, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want people to know that you, that you don't feel smart enough or feel pretty enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And I can just tell them what I want them to know and it was almost like great that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's pretend. [00:40:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know (laughs), I know, yeah. But even, that's partly why I keep my worlds so separate. Like, like my Charlottesville people, even like when I meet someone, like in class, or someone from Mexico with a heavy accent. Clearly like his first language is Spanish and so is mine, so it would be really easy to say hi to him in Spanish. But I think for some, for some reason I actually did, but usually if I meet someone in English, like even if their first language is Spanish I like can't, I like categorize people. And, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So even though you know he might prefer, or be much easier for him to speak in Spanish he's an English speaker to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I met him that way first. I did speak to him in Spanish for like a few minutes, but it was really, I felt really awkward about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did he respond?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He told me where he was from and it turned out to be the same city my uncle was from so, we talked about that. But, but yeah. I mean, I can see the same parallels between my Charlottesville. [00:41:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You try to keep everything separate so nobody, it's, it's, I mean it's...it separates you so much.</p>

<p>[00:42:00] Because trying to keep these different facets of yourself, I mean, you said earlier kind of trying to figure out which one was like really you...my, my guess is they're all, all these different sides of yourself that you're finding, they're all you because you don't present in just one way. People are really pretty complex and so, just trying to keep these separate worlds for yourself, you know your Spanish speaking world, your English speaking world, your Charlottesville world, and your Yale world and, you know, your kid self versus adult self. These are all, it's all the same person. Even if you have different names you go by in one place versus the other, you're the same person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, allowing there to be, within yourself, a little bit more fluidity, and then your relationships get a little more fluid, which can be wonderful and can be really scary. The wonderful pieces that you actually get to known and accepted for who you really are, all the different parts, and the scary piece is that you get to be known and that feels like a loss of control. [00:43:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Vulnerable, yeah. (pause) But I guess there's also, I mean it just feels like that's what I should be doing, but (laughs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The integrating (ph) piece should or the keeping separate, what feels like the should?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, like I should, I should try to be like confident in who I am or, because I think maybe that's like why, because I, I don't feel confident.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, yes, and the end goal is you will feel confident, but you can't just tell yourself that you're going to feel that way. That's, I think you have to learn to be confident in yourself, which is going to take some practice and accepting these pieces of yourself. So, I, I absolutely am totally on board with that being our goal, that you want to feel confident.</p>

<p>[00:44:00]It's not a goal for this week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you just can't say to yourself, "I'm going to be confident all of a sudden."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I see a tendency, you want to go out there a be confident today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think that, that's, I, I certainly don't think I come off as not confident, in certain way, maybe in school. (mumble) But I still know what I want, I guess, you know what I mean? Like, I still think I come off that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you do know what you want and feeling ok with that, the, it's often time it's the separation between what you think and how you fell. What you know to be true and how you feel doesn't always match up. And that's the piece that we're going to, if we can get the feeling to move into where your head is then you will actually feel and be confident, not just act it or know it inside, but not express it, or... (long pause) [00:44:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's yeah, that's a lot. (laughs) That's a lot to try to do, especially because I'm so controlling. That's interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that the goal for this week is to just do what you did last week. I mean, noticing how you're speaking because I think your language reinforces to yourself the feelings that are coming up with it as well as portraying stuff to the outside and noticing your language has been really illuminating for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really exhausting too, though. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm sure it is. And it's ok sometimes to take a break. You don't have to be fully conscious all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's ok to give yourself a break, have time when you're really paying attention to it and working on tweaking things to come out a different way, and times when you say, "I get a rest for now and just be," and not working on it all the time. That's ok. Why don't we stop there for today? And so, I think we'd scheduled for two weeks from today. Let's leave it at that for now, let you go home and think about what you want in terms of frequency and what would work in terms of payment and if you want to come in sooner than two weeks from today, call me or e-mail me and we'll schedule something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I want you to have the space where you can kind of go and think about it and not feel pressured one way or the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok, I did bring my copayments ahead because I got my loan or whatever (laughs). So, is that ok?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's fine. So why don't we, you were thinking of the 145 as the session fee? Ok, so let's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so, yeah. I may have done the math wrong, but yeah (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's go with that and if we change it we'll just amend it and put things to where they need to go. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. [00:46:56]</p>

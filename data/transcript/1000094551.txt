<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MICHELLE: So the homework's so timely for me today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Losing weight and abstaining from the eating addiction... it's bringing up all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and usually it does, but give me a sense of what it's bringing up for you.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: It brings up - oh I want more of it, you know. The feeling of like my pants being loose and feeling good about myself based on that. That - it brings that up because that's old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you say I want more of this, what is the "this" you're talking about? </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More weight loss, more good feelings, what is it that you're wanting more of?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I want more good feeling and more weight loss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay - (laughs.)</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I want both. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I want - yeah, I want to be the size that God intended me, and I want to be a size where it's comfortable in my own skin, and it hasn't been for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Those are great things to want though. I don't think there's anything wrong about feeling happy about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: But it also brings up my stuff like I have historically been very flirty, and it brings that stuff up too. I start to feel more confident about myself so it brings up people hitting on me and looking at me twice.  I have kind of gotten used to not having that.   I'm not complaining, I'm just saying it brings up the whole mess of feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Who just came on though?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: This is Jennifer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey, Jennifer.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Hey.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Hi, Jennifer.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Hi guys.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm assuming -</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Is everybody on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well I'm assuming Marge will be with us. I did not get a confirmation from her. But you know I don't get them from everybody. And when I talked to her last week, she'd said that there was a block on her phone and she was really, really sad about that and upset that she couldn't get on last week. So anyway, I'm assuming she'll be with us this week. Just, you know.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: I'm going to be in route to another meeting tonight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: I have another commitment that I had and so I'm probably going to do a lot of listening, but I'm driving. If it gets loud just tell me to mute.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You know how to mute, right? Number six.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Six, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Six, and then to bring yourself back in you just hit the six again.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Okay. I might have to get off about 20 'til in order to get to the other one on time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you want to check in a little bit about your workshop since we may not have you the whole time?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, I guess I can. I didn't want to interrupt Michelle.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: We're pretty done for that topic and I want to listen to some too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Michelle, you think you're done, but we're coming back to that one. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I want to be done. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I was afraid we might not get Jennifer for very long, so I wanted her to check in about the - what is it, a grief recovery workshop, is that right?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Hi, Jennifer. I want to thank you for your homework, because I have not been able to do mine this week. (Laughs.) And so I appreciate yours - it's helped me. </p>

<p>JENNIFER: Your welcome... but yeah, the grief recovery workshop was just awesome. (Laughs.) I don't know what else to say. I mean, I guess it's just - I feel like it's kind of a missing link to 12 steps. </p>

<p>You know, I got a lot of that working with you, Josephine, and you recognizing that element, you know. And I think so many people don't recognize that that's really what it is and don't know how to grieve, you know. And then we use a lot of other things to grieve with.</p>

<p>They took us through the whole process, and then the last day, is sort of a integration, so you really go through the whole process in a different way. And I was already feeling kind of I think sick - (laughs) at a cellular level, and then more stuff came out. I have more tears in my body than I ever thought I had.</p>

<p>But it just - I feel so light, you know. And I don't think it's a coincidence either that I gave up a lot of stuff, you know, liquids and stuff for Lent. And it's just been great without the impulsiveness. There's just no impulsiveness. And I think that helped because there's no disturbance or like, you know, comfort stuff that takes the edge off during this process so it's raw and really real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me interrupt you for a minute, Jennifer, and kind of frame it for the gals. I'm not sure how much they knew. </p>

<p>Jennifer took a grief recovery workshop run by the people who wrote the book, "Grief Recovery Handbook." And it's a 12 step-oriented book, quick reading. But she's going through it and for certification process with the potential of helping veterans grieve about their experiences.</p>

<p>CHAROLTTE: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and so because grief is also a recovery issue, and particularly an early stage of recovery issue, when we kind of let go of the addiction and drop into real life, we have some grief about all the years we gave to the addiction and the sadness about that. We have some grief about some of the damage we've done to our body through the addiction and we have to grieve that. So there's a lot of just kind of normal grief issues, and not to mention any personal stuff that goes on in our life. </p>

<p>And this workshop I had highly recommended for Jennifer. And Jennifer, you had left me a message after you had gone through it that you just really, really enjoyed it, and I was so delighted that you did because it seemed to be not only a matchup for you potentially career wise, but a matchup for you where you are in your own recovery.</p>

<p>JENNIER: Yeah, it was just a fit. The timing was just right. Like I had - I think I spent the last few months here grieving, so I was open to getting in to that grief stuff. And so it worked great.</p>

<p>And I think career wise too it's opened a lot of doors. You know, I've been kind of testing my heart blindly and I don't feel so blind anymore. I feel like I'm kind of in my dream instead of walking towards it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Aw, that's nice.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: So it was good. It just - the process worked. If anybody can get a copy of the book, the process works. And I even had a couple of situations come up during it, and I just wrote letters, you know, to those people because they suggested it. And it really felt free, and I don't feel like I have all this stuff in my head anymore.  I just feel - I feel free of a lot of stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm so glad. And it will probably take more than a week or so to really let it sink in and integrate and kind of bathe over you and move around and head to heart stuff. </p>

<p>JENNIFER: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I'm glad you put some words to it for us.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah. It' definitely came at the right time, too, because a lot of it too is probably emotions coming up from the Lent thing - like I said not having really anything to distract food or liquid wise and taking it to that next level is where I'm at with willingness. </p>

<p>And my grandfather's sick again, and my mom kind of keeps calling. She'll forget that she told me stuff, you know, about him being sick. And so I know she's grieving, and you know I'm leaving San Francisco and the closer I get to moving, the harder it's getting. </p>

<p>Like - and I have friends - one in particular - a really good friend that just totally blew up at me, and this was like the third or fourth time. And I just finally put it together that that's her way of pushing me away... so she doesn't have to greive. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>But at the same time,  I'm leaving and grieving, and I don't have time to kind of deal with her  drama, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it may be her way of grieving or avoiding grieving, you know, by saying to herself, "I didn't like her anyway, I don't need her anyway" because she's kind of heartbroken you're going, and so it's her defense to blow up at you.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, exactly. And so, I mean, I've called her and tried to talk, and she hasn't responded to me even though she said she wanted to, so I'm not going to make someone talk to me or push them to deal more directly with my leaving. </p>

<p>But yeah, so it came at the right time. And I did notice that I've been wanting to cry... like tonight at dinner I wanted to cry before I ate. I already had my meal planned... that helped because at the end of the meal, I really wanted more, or heard the addiction tell me I wanted more, but I knew what I wanted more of and it really wasn't a sandwich. So, it helped to have a plan with everything going on</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And so let me reiterate too, that for Lent - I mean abstinence is abstinence, but for Lent you decided to give up what I call entertainment drinks. Is that right? Like the cafï¿½ lattes, or chai lattes or -</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you gave up all drinks other than water?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, I gave up everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Apple juice or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Just everything but water. And I feel great. And you know, I've been doing - I've been really sick and I've been cold, I just do hot water with a lemon in it and it's very refreshing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Jennifer, when you had those intense emotions come up during the grieving workshop, didn't that bring up a lot of food desires or cravings?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: No, that was the beauty. Like I think the beauty was it showed me how far I've come, and that I just don't need it. I don't. You know, they suggest writing goodbye letters to, you know, whoever you're grieving with whether they're dead or present. And, you know, I put on my list my eating disorder. </p>

<p>I think that was the greatest gift out of it is that, you know, they have this saying, "that's old, I'm new, goodbye" when the old stuff comes out, just repeat that. And you know I've been doing that even with my food at meals that I've got. That's old. I'm new. Goodbye. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: That's good.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: It's just really helping, because it's not there like it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again, let me interrupt for a minute, Jennifer, and kind of frame it, because that's what we expect to happen is if we put ourselves in an emotional pain or crisis or turmoil, which she kind of deliberately did by going to the grief workshop... our history or historical inner selves get activated and then that kicks the addiction energy in... the addiction thinks it can  come to our rescue so to speak. </p>

<p>But from a recovery standpoint, what recovery is about is we do the deeper work and we let go of the yearning for the addiction by replacing the yearning for the addiction with yearning to be a woman we respect. Do you remember in the screening I talked about that?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When we drop in to do that kind of deeper work - and for most of us we kind of go in and out of the deeper work while we're putting that foundation of "no matter what" down. You know, I abstain no matter what. And we kind of gracefully move into some of the work and then we kind of retreat from it. But as long as we stay abstinent, what happens is as we move in and out of that deeper work, we break the yearning.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, that is so wonderful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: And even at my meals, I was eating out a lot, you know. But I kind of had a plan beforehand, and then even when we went to dinner the one night,at a Mexican restaurant, I didn't have a desire, even though I had ordered probably what I think what was too much just because I didn't realize what all it came with. I didn't feel like I had to stuff it, you know. I just - I took a moderate amount and I - it just was very clear to me that yeah, the yearning wasn't there. </p>

<p>You know, I knew there was a different way, and I've been living a different way. Now a different way is becoming more of who I am than - I don't need the addiction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But keep it - keep in mind, Charlotte, that Jennifer's got over a year of abstinence and, you know, working on her eating disorder recovery a little longer than that. And so I think that you know, because Charlotte you've been sober a long time, you know that when you go into emotional crisis you don't feel the yearning for the drugs and alcohol anymore.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: That's true. Yeah, that's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it can happen. You're just - you know, you're just at the beginning phase and it can happen.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: And I didn't - Charlotte one thing I didn't think I'd get out of this, I didn't go into this thinking that would happen, but that - you know, when you asked me that. </p>

<p>It's true. I was aware of that kind of like wow, I got through it and I didn't have a yearning... you know? But that came with time like Josephine said. </p>

<p>I think grieving, you know, the other stuff, and I just - I think it's just being honest with myself. Like when I get to that point where - I think Michelle and I were talking about the other day where we were talking about one of our meals or something. I said, or you could just be getting used to your body just kind of getting like ooh, that's not working for me anymore either. You know, kind of like when you get that next level of willingness, whatever it is, showing up I guess.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I definitely feel it coming in and out. But I would imagine with a really deep feelings like that, you know, that it would - putting myself in that place, you know, it would probably still set off - it would probably still set up yearnings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it might simply because you're at the beginning part. But you're not at the beginning part to where you don't grasp the concept, you know. You get it not only because of your sobriety, but because you have been abstinent a few months now. Have you been abstinent five months, four months?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: No, longer than that. I was just figuring it up. It's almost ten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, good deal. Good deal.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: June - June 12th of last year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, all right. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: At least that's what I counted my abstinent day as.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: It wasn't the kind of abstinence I have now.  I started the date when I quit bingeing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, that would be - you know, like Jennifer started before she got this abstinence too. So how long have you had this particular abstinence of the three meals a day reflecting abstinence from my eating addiction model?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I don't know, since I started working with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And that would be September-ish?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I don't know. I just always kept the same, you know, abstinence date.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's okay. That's okay.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: So yeah, whenever that was that I started working with you. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I think it was September, but it could have been the end of August. That would have been my guess because I think you said you had been working on it yourself a couple of months and that would make sense with the June. </p>

<p>So - but I've seen you drop into some real deep work, and then I've seen you kind of do the backup a little bit which is not uncommon.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah, what you said when you drop in and out it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I definitely experience different times where I have a freedom that I hadn't experienced before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and I do think when the addiction tries to kick in our yearning that at some point we go, "Oh yeah, that - I'm working my butt off to not do that. Why would I yearn for that?"</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah. You know doing this inner family work and finding ways to truly have compassion with myself, to soothe myself, to be a good mom to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: - or listen to myself instead of drowning it out, not stuffing it down has really helped. And I think the more that I learn to do that, you know, that I won't need that other coping mechanism as much or crave it as much, you know. </p>

<p>And I - it's just learning new - new tools, you know, and I'm just really aware at different times where I stop and say - stop and listen to myself and try to actually be nice to myself, you know, and you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you sure did a good job on the body image - the topic inventory work, the body image. </p>

<p>CHAROLOTTE: You know, those exercises, the topic inventory work, really help me. And I wrote them as affirmations last week. </p>

<p>And you know, I really realized as I went through the mental expressions, this is what I believe, even though I don't always act like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: You know, to get there... it's helping me so much to get past the "should," which I know is a huge part of the dieting mentality that I've had my whole life. That I should do that and somebody else is telling me that in order to be desirable and decent and, this is how I should eat, you know. I'm making a new shift, you know, a new mental shift.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it - did both you guys, Jennifer and Michelle, get a chance to read Charlotte's homework?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: I didn't - did you send it out this afternoon, Charlotte?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah, I did.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Okay, yeah. I didn't. I checked my e-mail before I went into court today, and like around I don't know, probably noontime, or 11, maybe around there. I haven't checked it since then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's certainly worth reading. I might - is it okay, Charlotte, if I go ahead and read a couple of them?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yes, you can. Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. She's got body image as the topic, and then the spiritual principle of respect. And her mental expressions say, "I recognize that the media and commercial culture presents an unrealistic sometimes unhealthy body ideal slash image and I consciously let go of their impossible standards."</p>

<p>The next one - isn't that wonderful? Very well put, the wording was beautiful.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: It helped me to think of that with the red carpet week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh boy, yeah. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Because I was, you know, even when I was a young kid, I'd spend hours just ogling, you know, models and the pictures and just dreaming of having that body. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: You know, in my first month in recovery, I got invited to go to a red carpet thing, to take military personnel up there. And they ended up giving me an escort, and I just remember standing there thinking every person with an eating addiction needs to come here because, oh my God, this is not the reality... thankfully I'd already agreed to kind of convince myself to stop buying magazines. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: But I just remember thinking okay, God, you knew exactly what you were doing bringing me here. Because I'd be like, that's not the truth. Those people aren't like that. They don't look the same on the carpet as they - (laughter.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you remember that Dove commercial recently where they show the model in the dressing room getting her hair and her makeup done and taking her picture, and then the airbrushing and the lengthening of her neck and face, making her eyes bigger and stuff. And then that's the one that goes on the magazine. </p>

<p>And so obviously, that's an even a more exaggerated version than what we see on the red carpet. But you know your words were so right on that that one any of us could copy and put on our refrigerator, you know, to remember that.</p>

<p>The next one I love. And the two younger gals, Charlotte, may not love it as much as you and me, but I love the next one. And it says, "I keep a realistic view of what a 59 year old woman's body looks like.  Isn't that great?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I think that we - I think I've talked about before that somehow most of us, and I don't mean just people with eating addictions, but most of us in our culture kind of over identify with what we look like between 25 and 45. </p>

<p>We don't over identify with what we look like at 5 or at 3 or at 12 or at 15, you know? But because we kind of look the same for quite a while, then we kind of over identify with that. And the truth is our body changes year to year to year in the first 20 years pretty remarkably. And from, you know, 45 to 55, you're going to notice some major changes. From 55 to 65, you're going to notice even more major change, you know. (Laughs.) From 65 to 75, even more, and even more from 75 to 85, 85 to - you know what I'm saying? </p>

<p>So it's only that one 20 year period, from 25 to 45, that we kind of look the same, and so we often over identify with it. And the goal is not to - you know, we don't want to over identify with a particular body at a particular age. So I loved what you wrote.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I feel like I'm easing into that. It's really helped me working with you with that - with Josephine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Good.</p>

<p>Okay, she's got another one here that says, "I understand and accept that my true self worth does not hinge on my outsides but on my insides."</p>

<p>JENNIFER: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and read them all, because they're just great.</p>

<p>"I don't judge or value my friends based on their looks. I treat myself with the same respect. When recognizing that a fit body is attractive and desirable, I realize that I am still deserving of pleasure and happiness even when my body is not as fit as I would like. When intimate with my husband, I tell myself that I am still desirable and feminine despite not having a perfect body."</p>

<p>That one's really, really great for those of us who are partnered or married. That's so great... my experience is that men are very realistic about women's bodies.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: That is so true. And I have - it's been such a joy to gradually realize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here are her physical expressions: "I take time to dress attractively even when I'm not feeling attractive."</p>

<p>Way to go, high five on that one, you know. Because I think sometimes we let our feelings determine everything. If we then change our action, sometimes our feelings follow the actions.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: It really - I have found that works with me. So many of these are new revelations, but you know when I'm down on myself, then I can dress you know sloppy or not care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: And when I put on something that I really like, I don't know. It feels like my posture changes, and I feel better about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely. I eat - is that Jennifer coming back?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Her next one says, "I eat healthily and exercise to have the fit and healthy body God means me to have today at 59."</p>

<p>Another one - just, you know, whatever number you want to put in that, you know, that's so realistic and so loving and so compassionate and, as the spiritual principle you picked, respectful.</p>

<p>"My mirror behavior is changing. Instead of scrutinizing my face and looking for flaws, I look at myself with compassion." </p>

<p>And then in parentheses you put, "A therapist once told me to look at my eyes if I couldn't find anything else I liked." </p>

<p>And I think it's such a good idea to communicate to our eyes. And if you communicate to your eyes, you really are communicating often times with the inner family, the kids inside, the young adults inside, the adolescents inside. So I think the looking into our won eyes is powerful and you wrote a really powerful statement. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Really, you know it's amazing to me how I can go to the mirror and I look at the things I hate, and that's all I look at. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: You know, I'll look at the sagging chin or I'll look at the bulging midriff, and I'll look at, you know, a certain line on my forehead that I like and sort of let that go and just look at the eyes. That helped me way back when that therapist told me that because I thought well, my eyes I've always liked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Last couple of ones.</p>

<p>"I stop looking at myself through storefront windows to see if my body looks okay. I focus instead on the interesting world around me." Right on.</p>

<p>"And when intimate with my husband, I focus on giving and receiving pleasure rather than how my body looks to him." (Laughs.)</p>

<p>So good. So wonderful job, Charlotte.</p>

<p>Can we come back to the - Michelle what you started off with, which brings up some - as the weights coming off, it's bringing up some old stuff, good stuff, bad stuff type thing.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And one of the things that you mentioned just before we kind of switched subjects was that it brings up a little bit of flirtiness in you.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: No, it was really helpful to read and hear Charlotte's homework. And I was muted for a lot of it, but I was mm-hmming and oh my gooding. </p>

<p>Yeah, it brings up that stuff. It really does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me help you maybe get another framework for flirting. In the past, one of my issues was brining seduction energy to my interaction with men. And I  - </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and I realized underlying that was my safety issue, you know, need for safety. And if I could predict men's behavior, then I felt safer. And so when I was seductive, they would behave like they might get lucky or they might get a date or they might whatever, and their behavior was more predictable and more pleasant. </p>

<p>And so when I realized it really was my need for safety - then I realized that I didn't have to be so mad or so ashamed of myself for doing that, but to just compassionately tell my little 12 year old inner self that's not going to give us what we really want in adult life. </p>

<p>And I realized at the same time how disrespectful that is of men. </p>

<p>So that said, then I wanted to bring a whole different energy to interaction with people. And I thought well, you know, how to flirt with babies and I don't bring any seduction energy to babies, so let's figure out how to bring that same charm and attention I give to babies to other humans.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there has to be a way to learn how to flirt, meaning be charming, be gracious, you know bring warmth and attention without it being seductive. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I really worked hard on being not only accountable to that but really very aware that you can bring that kind of flirty energy to babies, to women, to grandmas, to grandpas, you know teenagers. You can bring it to any - you know, employee, employer. You can bring it to anybody and all it is, is warmth and graciousness and the ability to give attention to people, because that's very flattering. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Right. I love that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it isn't that we have to get rid of flirting, we have to get rid of seduction. </p>

<p>And so again, that said, men who pick women out by their looks are usually stuck in an adolescent phase. So you don't want to shame them about it or be rude to them like, "Who do you think you are talking to me or coming on to me." You don't want to do that. You just smile and graciously exit. </p>

<p>And so sometimes you don't even respond, you just smile and move past them. If they're just stuck in their adolescence, God knows I was stuck there too of a while in my life so, I don't need to shame anybody for it.</p>

<p>So the male attention is often not personal to you. It's not personal to me. Does that make sense to you all?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, it's just like if the patients at work are sexualizing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: It's not about you; it's about their way of coping... of trying to feel safe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There you go. </p>

<p>And so if men start to show more interest in you - strangers - men, strangers and/or ones you don't know very well, you know this is about them. This is about them not knowing how to communicate or create the life that they want. So, just let it go. It doesn't have anything to do with anything.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, it's - I think the important piece is the part that you said before that. It's how to maintain the warmth, the graciousness and - what was the other word?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Attention, the attention focus.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Attention focus with that person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do little kids like? They like eye contact and feeling like they're the center of your attention, and that your faces lighten up as they talk or they play, whatever. You know? So we all like that. Little kids are just unguarded about that, but we all like it. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Right, and the whole seduction on my part or their reaction to it on their part... just like sex, looks and feels like intimacy, and it is a part of intimacy, it's not the same as intimacy... it doesn't equal intimacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it doesn't.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Just like Charlotte, the seduction and their response to it is not actually what I'm going for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. Once I realized that was not what I was going for, you know, the attention - being kind of stuck in an adolescent dynamic myself, I enjoyed the attention but what I was really going for was that underlying human need to figure out how to be safe in the world. And that's a God issue. That's a spiritual issue. And it isn't about finding a man or a car or a house to make me safe, it is about my spiritual growth that's going to keep me safe, my belief in a god, my concept of a god. </p>

<p>So I do want to invite you to find your flirty part... help that younger self understand what is really going on... Alos, I love your laugh. You all hear in Michelle's laughter in her voice how she lights up when she talks and she responds, she does that in person. She just lights up, and that's what we all like. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I mean, I've come a long way in this area for sure. But I've never been this far. So that's really helpful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: So it's very helpful, and thank you for saying those nice things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're welcome. I think we all experience it. You know, she has an ability to do it with her voice, probably not just her face or her eyes. </p>

<p>So Jennifer, you have a meeting you're going to be having to shove off to pretty quick here?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, somebody - they had asked me to speak at this, just out of the blue. It's funny. It's about - and I'll share that later sometime about the career. As soon as I made a decision that I was going to follow my heart, I've been asked to speak three times from random people. They're like, "You're a speaker?" </p>

<p>I was like, "No." but to myself that's a dream. So, I guess I could do that. Okay. (Laughter.) I don't even have a plan yet, but God does so this is my first one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, very cool. Very cool, Jennifer.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, very good. Yeah, but I'm hanging in there. I've just been feeling the tears and the grief and whatever surfaces, surfaces during the week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when is it - you're leaving the 7th of April to move to New York City permanently?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: No, the 14th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, the 14th. Yeah, in two weeks so -</p>

<p>JENNIFER: And we had a really long trial week this week, so it's just like, you know, the time I usually have during the day to get stuff done, we haven't. But it's coming together, and I just keep making my lists and I make my menu plan in the beginning of the day, which is helping. </p>

<p>And you know, it's - there's definitely a change there. It's just really cool, you know, the things that I ask God for, you know, to enlarge my faith and to deeper acceptance, that's what I wanted to go there with. I was just reminded that my God's always with me and he is everything. And it's not as overwhelming anymore to know that I'm loved like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very good. Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Amy, where are you going in two weeks?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: NYC I'm moving there permanently this time. I won't be coming back to San Francisco.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Oh, but you're in New York now, aren't you?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: No, I'm in San Francisco. So I -</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: You were in New York a couple of weeks ago, right?</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, just for five days to move into my condo and then -</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: - I'm going to be there permanently. So it's been kind of a back and forth thing since August, but then I'll be there permanently.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I understand.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: And it's somewhere I want to go, and I know it's the next chapter in my life and I'm excited. But I also am leaving some stuff here, and I didn't realize it until it got closer and closer. And I think I'm leaving a part of my life here, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, when I moved from area to area, not only do I write letters to that phase of my life and honor the Josephine that lived through those years in that place, I say - you know, when I've packed up and everything's in the moving van or whatever. I tell my kids or husband or family to wait while I go back in and say goodbye to the house and thank the house. And so it just seems like it brings honor and respect to different aspects. </p>

<p>So if you can do meditation where you talk to the Jennifer who, you know, hit near-bottom and lived through your early recovery in that location, and the courage that she exhibited, and honor her and thank her for getting you out of the bottom and into recovery. And maybe drive around some of the streets and, you know, drive around and say thank you and just really give yourself some ceremonial parts of honoring the phase that you are moving out of. </p>

<p>JENNIFER: I actually wanted to do that. I thought about - not in that sense, but that's a great idea. I was trying to figure out how I was going to do it. And so that's a great idea, because the last day I'll have all to myself and then I'm going to meet my really good friend for dinner that night, and then the next morning I fly out. So it'll be just really nice to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. To create a kind of ritual or some kind of acknowledgement for the closing of this phase... not that you won't be back or see everybody, because you will. And then to kind of have a ritualized celebration of the new environment you're moving into.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I always think those are such a honoring respectful way to acknowledge our life and the phases of our life.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Thank you, girls. I'm sorry I have to go right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Have a good meeting.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: Yeah, I'll e-mail this weekend. Because no matter where I go in the world, I know I can call you guys. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep.</p>

<p>JENNIFER: All right, well, you guys take care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Bye-bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, guys. </p>

<p>Charlotte, anything coming up in your life that you want to make sure that we talk about for the coming week?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Actually no. We're entertaining friends here for dinner on Saturday night but that won't be hard. The following week I'm going to a family wedding, which I may want to talk about next week. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I actually had a couple days this week where I kept having add-ons and with, I don't know, there were about three or four meals during the week. And I actually started writing everything down, you know, so that next time we meet, Josephine I could just go through what the food was exactly. Because I thought well, it's just really good to have this down in black and white. It was still within the area of a moderate meal but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A moderate meal? Yeah. Well, you know Charlotte, I don't know if it's terribly important to figure out the why right away. I think as we get a little distance from it, it's easier if there is a why to discover it. But the addiction will always want us to add on. There does not even need to be a why.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think the real question is, "why do I want to listen on certain days," because we will always be hearing that disease chatter. </p>

<p>So that said, let me tell you maybe a generic "why do I listen" that I've noticed around sweets or desserts. I've noticed that when sweet tasting foods are either an impulse add on or are deliberately, consistently being planned in our meals, often times the arena that I have people look at is. "what are you enduring or that you have to reward yourself for?"</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Oh  - 
	
MICHELLE: Fourteen hour days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fourteen hour days in Michelle's case.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, and the stress is all of a sudden, I've had it really easy for the last four months but now I'm getting a new supervisor and although I like her a lot, she kind of kicks in little patterns with me of wanting to please and overwork and take on a whole lot of responsibility. You know?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I'm with you there, sister.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: (Laughs.) She used to be a professional tennis player, and I can just see her as a really, really good coach. But my response to her is to just work my butt off. And then I don't take any breaks. </p>

<p>And today, I - last night I came home feeling so wrecked and went to bed by 8:30, and this morning woke up and felt so glad it was a new day. And I actually took out 15 minutes in the middle of the afternoon to go and do some yoga stretches -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, good for you. Good for you.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I feel so good. I thought, you know, I can easily spend 15 minutes doing something else. And, you know, like going for a latte or something else, and this felt so much more refreshing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To do the yoga?</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah, and I realized nobody's in that workout room at all in the middle of the afternoon. So I had complete privacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very nice. Well it sounds like you've got a very good awareness about your old pattern and about having a boss that you like and kind of respect triggering that old pattern. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Well that's what I mean about being... focusing in more, because I did ask myself, what is going on and why do I feel so bad. </p>

<p>And, you know, last night almost scared me because I came home just feeling so awful. And I just couldn't hardly put a smile together for Josh, you know. And I just said, I just feel lousy tonight and you'll just have to bear with me. I'm going to go to bed early and hope I wake up feeling better, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you did. You woke up and took your yoga break in the afternoon.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah, and I actually exercised this morning which felt so good. And I did one of these topic inventory exercises that I have started but I didn't send in to the group yet, was the spiritual principle of gratitude or appreciation, and the topic was my physical body.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: And I just amazed myself as I thought about it, I thought, "Oh, I'm so lucky to have this body and this health even working like this." And I just want to feel good. You know, I want that lightness of being -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: - it feels so much better. </p>

<p>Actually, I came to this stunning awareness this weekend. You know, I asked myself, if I could be skinny, you know, and thin and slender, and still, you know, binge and all the other effects were the same, would I care about abstinence? And I realized I would because I thought, well, if I still have the stomach aches and I still have the headaches and I still had a lousy heavy, bloated feeling even if I didn't look like it, you know, I just would hate that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's a very important thing you just said.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: I was shocked to realize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I think that's such a good thing to take in at a heart level is that if this had no impact on my weight, abstinence still offers me so much peace of mind, self respect and peace that I would want it anyway.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: That's what always comes up for me when I do the writing the day of my weigh days. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: That is what always comes out of my writing.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Really?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yes, every time. I'm like, you know what, ultimately when I do the writing - the last time I weighed I didn't do it and it really tripped me up. There's a reason why, Josephine, you tell me to do each piece of that. Because I planned my meals but I didn't write about it beforehand and I didn't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't write about what the scale - number on the scale would be?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: What the number on the scale was going to be -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you'd feel about it.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: - and then my feelings around it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And that's why whenever I do that, when I do that writing, after I've planned my meals and I'm going to deliberately weigh myself and I know I'm going to talk to you, then it sets me in this mode. And I go gosh, I'm just so grateful for all the gifts of my abstinence that the number doesn't matter. It really doesn't. I mean, I hope but the number is like one of the things, but it's not the thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There you go. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I mean, I'm on my period today and I don't have crippling cramps. My whole life I had crippling muscle cramps. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I mean, I'd be eating Advil today and I didn't - I haven't - I had maybe two Advil for cramps in my whole abstinence. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yes, really.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Wow, I always have bad cramps when I was menstruating, but that would be amazing that just eating well and abstinently has taken care of that.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I wouldn't even say that I've been eating well. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your nutrition is growing to a more average level. But you've been abstinent - is it going to be a year in May for you?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: June.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: June. Wow. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: The 6th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Wow. I know. You're coming up to a year. Oh my God.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to stop you from your thought, but let me go ahead and tell you that I'd like to get a token, you guys, and everybody can kind of send loving thoughts to the token when we get a little closer.  I'll alert you guys when I buy it and everybody can kind of pour love into the token while I have it here, and then I'll mail it to you on your birthday.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I'm up for that. I'm really up for it. I'm - I was thinking - I mean I was talking to my hairdresser again today. We talked a lot because there was nobody else in the shop because she came in early cause today's my birthday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's right. You're 42 today.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Oh, that's right, I forgot. Happy birthday.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: That's okay, because I was really celebrated today. Me - my husband and I are going to dinner after the call.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, very nice.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yes, very nice. I'm 42, four two.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Oh, that's right. This is a big birthday. That's wonderful.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, I've been freaking out all week and for a couple of weeks and stuff, and today it was like, I get it. It's okay, you know. It's better than okay. My life is pretty darned sweet today.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: It's just a number on the calendar and just a number on the scale.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yes, they're just numbers. They don't define my life for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: The quantity of love and support and love that I have in my life, huge. I mean, that is not measurable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: But if I were to measure - (laughs) - oh, you guys, I have a cool viewing thing that happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I'll make it short. My older siblings have a different father from my sister and I, the younger two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And so the older three had a - their father just passed away recently. And they got an inheritance from that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And there was some talk about a month ago, he passed away probably three months ago, and they've been doing all the stuff related to his estate.</p>

<p>My dad, by the way was involved in my sister and my life but my dad left us penniless because he was a gambling addict as well as an alcoholic, and their dad, who was not at all involved in their life, left them money and a house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And so my sisters and brothers split it up between them, but they gave my sister and I a portion of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my gosh, wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: (Crying) - and we had no reason to. And I just found out last night for sure that they are sending me a check.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that a loving family?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Oh, isn't that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: My brother was the first one to get sober in my family. And I was in therapy because he abused me when I was a kid, both physically and sexually. And when he got in recovery I confronted him with a letter with my therapist, you know. Well, I wrote the letter with my therapist and I confronted him on my own. And he has been making amends to me ever since.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: And so because he has begun making amends to me before I ever got sober, he was the one that 12-stepped me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And then my sister got sober just five months after I did. So there are three of us that are in recovery. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Three of the five, wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Three of the five, yeah.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: That is a great recovery story.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Isn't that cool?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's amazing.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And just last night a nurse at work told me about she and her sister and brother being in court for two and a half years and giving the attorneys $125,000 of the money...</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE: Yeah, you hear that a lot more.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: - because they're fighting over it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: So it's not that kind of money. It's not that much money, but it's substantial... I mean it's not life changing, but it -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the energy that it's given to you with is certainly life changing energy.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Absolutely</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To feel and receive that kind of love and validation and bond is awesome.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yes. Like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep, yep.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yep I felt really cool all day, and at work they got a cake. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Which I didn't partake in. I thanked them profusely and said, you know, I'll have mine tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And they got me flowers at work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Daisies that smell so sweet. And my coworker Bart, who's often very detached, he said "I had a birthday in December, and I didn't even get a card."</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, you need to put it on the calendar -" (laughs.) And what else could I say? Because I put it on the calendar that it was my birthday. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good for you, good for you.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And he goes, "And I think I was out of town."</p>

<p>And I said, "Yeah, you need to put it on the calendar and work that day." (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you also opened up the session by saying this is my last 14 hour split shift day. So did you give them a bottom line, give them a boundary?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Not yet. But - I mean I did in e-mail a couple of weeks - or week and a half ago, but then my boss went on vacation and she sent me back an e-mail saying, "Ooh, we really need the consistency of having the exercise every day and how about this?"</p>

<p>But it still includes going in for an hour on Tuesday mornings and doubling back that night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Until 9:45, and I have not sent the e-mail, but I've committed to myself. So I'm really giving myself permission to time it when it's okay, when it's not a knee-jerk reaction to respond to the e-mail.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, good. Good, good.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: But it's really scary still.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well just, you know, ask yourself, "where is God?" And I think you'll feel that strength reconnect to you.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. Well I definitely felt it today. I definitely felt my higher power.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I can sure hear it.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Between the attitude of being joyous about celebrating your birthday and starting a new decade of your life and having work so celebrate you and your husband so celebrate you and your family so celebrate you with such a thoughtful gift. Awesome.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: That's not even a birthday gift. It's not about my birthday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I know but it came -</p>

<p>MICHELLE: It's the timing of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it just came on your birthday, which is a nice thing.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yep, it's pretty cool. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you have any - we just have a couple minutes left. But do you have anything, Michelle, coming up in the week that you want to make sure you talk about?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Well, I would like to weigh but I guess I'll wait until Wednesday next. I did not want to plan mine for today because like as turned out, I got lunch time off and went to lunch with a friend, I would have been really bummed if I hadn't - if I had done that.</p>

<p>But last time I weighed, I really slipped up and didn't write about it, didn't talk to you that day, and the next day I compulsively weighed myself again. And it scared me. And I talked to Jennifer about it, I think, and I talked to my friend Sarah about it. But I - and then I put the scale away. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: And I said no mas.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really rough the past few days. It's sort of weird. I don't really talk very much about my pets, but I'm very much into my animals and there's a little guy he's Gio.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gio?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was just very sweet. And people think it's weird (inaudible at 00:00:34). Anyone who ever knew him like people don't understand why this turtle is interested in people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of turtle is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a red-eared slider, and I got him from a rescue. So he's just very interested in people. He's just very personable. He's into making eye contact. Most animals when they're like that it's because you feed them. He was just naturally very curious and is a very big sweetheart and - I don't know - it's hard to explain. [00:01:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long did you have him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just under nine years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not for turtles. Turtles don't really (inaudible at 00:01:25). I mean there are turtles moving around that Darwin took back with him on the Beagle that are living and are pets. So once you get past the hatchling stage, the first couple of years, it's really not something that they're so much in danger of except from people. So I'm just feeling extreme grief, and feeling like it's my fault, and I just don't know what to do. The empty tank is killing me. [00:02:08]</p>

<p>I do have a dog but the number one reason why I really like having animals like turtles and things like that is because they have a very long lifespan. I don't really make a bond with a creature I don't want to have these short lives because I know that I'm like this. And it happened really sudden and I tried really hard to save him. There wasn't anything we could do and it was just so devastating you know. He was just thrilled to have me around. Like I said before, I liked him better than I like most the people. Why because he was a good person, turtle. I really enjoyed him in my life just. It's just devastating without him. [00:03:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me more about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We got him originally - A friend of mine, Gio, who ran a turtle rescue in Ohio, gave him with his other siblings as eggs. The mom definitely (inaudible at 00:04:00). I don't really think something involving like a car or something like that. Although because of some reason they couldn't be wild released so they needed to be cared for but they also wanted to be able to if need be come talk to me for breeding purposes. I don't really totally understand. That was like 2002, 2003 and he was just so... The reason why I call him Gio is one because he's a Slider and Gio sounds fast. Also because they get that little mustache which makes them look very French; a silly thing like that. He was just so happy to see us all the time. Everybody who ever knew him... My mom would make names for all of them; the Sunshine Turtle, the Sunshine Boy, and it was one of those things where you're like oh you're you. You're great. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sort of about as close to a dog as you can get in a turtle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:05:06) a dog. Dogs do things that are wrong. That turtle never did a darn thing wrong. Not wrong but dogs poop on the floor. That turtle never pooped on the floor. Much better than that. The worse problem though is, like I said, it just breaks my heart because a species - The reason why they're in trouble is because they don't know any better. They're so curious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're not afraid of our species like people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they love people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's a dangerous taste to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In the United States when you hear of turtle soup it almost always not turtle its terrapin which is what he is. That's usually what the thing is. A few rescuers do go down to Chinatown and get them. It's usually by that point it's just too much heartbreak. I can't do that kind of stuff. There are better people than me who can handle the ups and downs of that kind of thing. I can't. I have a really good... I still have two other turtles but they're in a different set up. Diamondbacks are brackish, which is basically the area where the river meets the ocean, so they have this specific gravity of water that you have to use in terms of saltwater so he was in a separate tank. But he loved watching the big turtles. He was a happy, happy guy. [00:06:43]</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to decide if I was anthropomorphizing things but I've looked into reptile behavior and a couple of the things that he would display is actually happy being here. So he was just a special little guy. We went out of our way to make sure everything could be sort of automated so that we didn't have to worry about stuff. Like most people have these weird fish filters. He had a giant canister filter and the filter on the canister is also UV. So it goes the canister has all these different levels of bio and all those other stuff and then it goes through a very bright UV light to kill whatever came out of it that was good bacteria. And then you have to keep the temperature right and there were all these special bulbs you use. I mean it's quite a long term... I don't care. Once you get it working and everything's just right it's perfect. But we've been struggling to keep the temperature the right way and there's just so much going on and I just feel so bad because I found out recently that part of what could have contributed to his... I did not know that there were certain types of fish that have chemicals in it that can actually be harmful not because of pollution but there's a vitamin B1... [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the fish that he had in his tank?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We feed him. This turtle lived... Like the people at Whole Foods knew my turtles. I did not know that smelt has thiaminase, whatever, but it basically breaks down to B1 which can cause energy problems and all this other stuff. I didn't know that. And I thought I'd researched everything. I had no clue. For years I didn't know that. But he got regular food too. It's not like he had this all the time. And I just feel like if I had taken him to the emergency vet faster it might have been better but at the same time when I got there they seemed to not really know what they're doing at all. I would give an organ or a limb to have him back in my life. I love this... I mean I know it's so stupid but I love this turtle. Everybody I know loved this turtle. My husband loved this turtle. I mean people who don't even know me that well who have seen my turtle love this turtle. Most people don't think that of turtles as being that engaging. [00:09:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. More like oh sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that particular breed there are other things that they would do that were very sweet, that kind of stuff you know. We had it all set up that the lights would turn on at the right time and everything like that, but I remember a couple of times during daylight savings he'd get up on his rock, and he would look up at what we'd call the sun, he'd look at me, and he'd look up there and look at me like okay so why is the light not on. Oh my God how in the world could anything that has this small of a brain really understand any of this? [00:10:11]</p>

<p>Well it's really hard to explain to a terrapin what daylight savings time is and why the light isn't on yet. But I miss him really. I called the breeder that I got her from, the rescuer, and briefly talked to her. We haven't been able to get in touch with each other for a couple of years. And I think that the only reason why she responded to my e-mails is because I sounded pretty darned desperate. But just to tell her what was happening. I mean she expressed a lot of sympathy; nothing but sympathy. No one's made fun of me for being upset about my turtle, nobody. But at the same time I feel kind of weird saying this because it's like... my turtle. [00:11:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is what it is you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We don't really know. What happened is Friday night we noticed that there's something going on with his water in the tank so we took him out to... He also seemed kind of lethargic. We noticed that Friday night. We've got this whole system to change the water so he went and changed the water on him. And there were some other things that were going on and we decided that he just didn't seem quite right after we put him back in so we did something called dry docking which is when they're not feeling well, they may have an infection or something like that, you keep them out of the water so they don't drown and you keep them really, really warm. Turtles and other types of three chambered heart creatures don't have the ability to keep themselves warm. They get it from the sun and that's their immune system. [00:12:04]</p>

<p>So we were trying to keep him really, really warm. And we kept him warm overnight and when Dave came back pretty late at night I had e-mailed some people at some of the lists about what was going on. I talked to somebody who gave me some ideas about what was going on especially the B1 thing. And he was okay for the night. In the morning I saw him. He was weak but he was still looking up at us. He was okay. He was looking up at me, that kind of thing. We gave him a little test swim in the morning. He was still having trouble breathing a little bit. So you're supposed to pull him back out again to give him some more time and get heat next to him. I don't think we kept him warm enough. I don't know. We kept looking at him. I talked to him from time to time. I had the bucket that we were holding him in near me and then sometime around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. we noticed he wasn't moving anymore. And he was really lethargic so I basically called this animal hospital to make a plan like an emergency thing, and called them, and drove him, and all this stuff. [00:13:17]</p>

<p>And when we first handed him over they wanted us to fill out this registration stuff out. And the people said they do a Doppler way of testing of his heartbeats because we can't really listen through his shell. And they said that they had heard a little bit of a Doppler of his heart so they were going to put him on much higher heat. And I explained to them that he needed to be at least at 82 and this and that. And they're like oh yeah, don't worry, we're okay. And I asked them some questions and then we went through this really, really involved registration process where we ended up giving them multiple forms of payment so we could just be seen and all this stuff. As soon as we paid them they told us he was dead. [00:14:01]</p>

<p>And so I don't even know how supposedly in theory we could get some of our money back. I don't know. It's been too much of a complex. I'm eventually going to figure it out. I'm probably going to ask my mom to go handle this because as an attorney she can scare the bejesus out of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's not what you want to be thinking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It was money we didn't have. We knew when we were going down there like we dragged our bottle of change and things like that when we went out the door so we made sure we could pay for it. So they gave him back to us in a box and we just didn't feel like it was... I had heard and I had known that sea turtles they often don't actually have the kits detectible heartbeats until they're kept warm for a little bit. So we did that a little bit just in case if we can get some sort of - if you squeezed his flippers if you get some sort of pain response or something like that from cold stone. I mean they didn't do anything at all and they took like $500.00 of our money. [00:15:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then they just handed him back to me in a box less than a minute later. Watched while they get the box but less than a minute later they told us they couldn't do anything for him. And not that it was about the money. I'm like can we get him shops, can we get him (inaudible at 00:15:33), can we do this. I know about this kind of stuff. I've researched these things over the years to take care of him. And they were just like no, no you have to let go. He's gone. And so I had to keep him warm for a while just to see. It didn't turn out okay, but the point is it was... I'm sure this place is really great for cats and dogs. It actually looks like a real emergency room and everything. Boy I wish that when we called they told us to go somewhere else because they had nobody on staff who did any of the exotics much less a herpetologist. It was just setting me up for more heartbreak. [00:16:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you thought you'd have him most of the rest of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I already had a lot of anxiety about not taking care of him properly. I mean tremendous amounts of like I haven't been hypervigilant in terms of making sure everything's just right. I had friends who made fun of me. They said that when we have kids I'll be one of those people that wakes up the baby to make sure the baby's still alive because sometimes... When they're too still I'm going to tap on the shell until they move because it freaks me out. And then it just happened. So it sort of just reinforces this terrible anxiety based hypervigilance feeling in me. [00:17:12]</p>

<p>I let it go. I was using the Internet. He was right next to me in a bucket and I don't even know when he passed or if anything because I feel like I should've been starring at him the entire time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like there was anything you could do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I have no idea what I could do. But I made a list that night of the things I need to do to change my life to make sure I can do something so I don't ever go through this again. And one of them is that I'm just going to procure the appropriate things I might need in the event that something like this happens. It is very difficult to get a vet to give this to you in advance, but I think that my husband's going to talk to the vet at his work to see if we can get a hold of some of this stuff because we already have hypodermic needles at my house. [00:18:05]</p>

<p>Baytril is a type of antibiotic that you can inject. In fact most vets will send you home and try and teach you how to inject them yourself because of the fact that you have to give them shots pretty regularly. And then give him some B1. I'm going to basically put together this emergency... I already had other types of stuff, not all in one place, but one of my big goals is in putting an emergency kit in the event that something happens to be able to take those so I don't have to rely on some vet somewhere. Where I was in Cincinnati I had a lot of resources (inaudible at 00:18:44) reptiles. So I was just really aghast that we lived this close to where they actually natively lived and they still didn't have a clue on how to care for them. I lived in Cincinnati and they knew. Of course, I was part of the society there so I knew the guy that was the zookeeper for the Komodo dragons. So I need to make sure - I have a bunch of things I need to do so I can feel better about the situation. And one of them is I need to put together a kit of everything I need in the event that something happens. [00:19:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An emergency?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And really like I said if I just called up a vet and said hey I need some Baytril and this, and that and they would just look at me like I'm nuts. I'm not putting together a bunch of prescription meds for you to have around the house. But I think that Dave said that one of the vets that he works with will understand that this is what we need especially after something's happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That'll make you feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it would make me feel more comfortable. It won't make me feel better. I'm never going to feel better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I'm sorry. I didn't mean that you'd feel better about what had happened but safer about the future. [00:20:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have been intending... We just haven't been able to find a good reptile based vet around here but I had basically been getting well animal check-ups for everybody; dog and turtles the other two. The other two are of a hardier species that are so invasive that they're considered to be actually an animal nuisance. So disturbingly enough they will probably be fine and they'll probably walk around after the Earth is gone. But I still need to take care of my (inaudible at 00:20:30) so it's not like it's the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How awful have you been feelings? From what I see you look pretty devastated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not functioning normally. Crying a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure I'm not crying when I'm sleeping. I'm trying not to cry when I'm at work which has usually been okay. I'm trying to distract myself. I just feel like crap. But a lot. I feel bad doing anything to distract myself right now because I feel like well distracting myself is what has happened. But at the same time if I don't then if I've even remotely alone with my thoughts even I if I just read... [00:21:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:29).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's only been a few days I know but I feel bad that I haven't taken pictures in a couple years too. That's part of my goal. I have this whole list of things that I need to do so I can feel okay about myself and this is one of them. I (inaudible at 00:21:59) with me so I can see them and that kind of stuff. I call them my pets. I don't know. I'm just going through so much grief. And the worst part is it's really hard because there's so many other extra things related to what is happening that it's making it even worse like I still have a thankful of water with lights on, and a filter running, and all this stuff. For a while there I had all this stuff that still needed to be sanitized with bleach. [00:22:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to be the one to do it? Can Dave help you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He can do it too. He's been helping. He's upset. He's really upset too. Everybody is. Hell my dad cried. Well I knew that he read to the turtles, but I didn't know how much he read to them. I am just... It's really hard. We gave him a good send off on Sunday. [00:23:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We went out to the ocean and we buried him at sea. We figured the ocean towards that area and that would be fine. We put a little letter in and put it in the box. I know it sounds so immature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not really. It sounds like you're sad and you're trying to find (inaudible at 00:24:04) how much he means to you and how important he was in your life. [00:24:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know it's funny because I haven't really gone through the whole denial, bargaining, states of grief like most people in my life when they've died but I've gone through this with my turtle. I thought he might live. I was sitting here making bargains with God about what I would and wouldn't do for the rest of my life and I'm so dumb like one of those damn stubborn people that if he pulled through I would totally follow through on it. Yet I'm never going to do it again. I'd never do it again or I would so something. I feel... [00:25:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it makes you feel so helpless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To think what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You couldn't do anything to save him. For you that's incredibly hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All he ever did was rely on me and he always loved me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were helpless but it wasn't for not loving him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's tissues if you want in the box. [00:26:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God. I'm trying really hard to focus because I don't want to be like now that I've lost this turtle I'm neglecting every other animal in my life. I'm really not coming out and talking to them. I have my goals. I have six goals I have with them to tell all the living animals both people and human that I care about every day that I love them so I call my mom and dad. I tell my husband. I tell my dog. I go over to the dogs and I tell them I love them. They're actually pretty engaged with people too but it's not the same thing. I mean it's a very different behavior set. I love them to death but they're much more interested in the television sometimes than me. I just... Why can't I focus on what I have instead of just... [00:27:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because this happened Saturday. I mean you'll get there but this grieving takes a while. It'll occupy you for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's hard because I have never been one of those like... This is actually a philosophical break between my mother and I. We are very different in this. When pet's die she almost always makes sure that she has another pet lined up. I don't. We've agreed to disagree on this concept. She claims that it's because the other dog is grieving and that's why she's doing it not for her, but I don't believe it. She only has two dogs. It's not like she's the crazy dog lady or anything; actually two dogs and one turtle long story. But I don't do that. I mean I really don't. I had a cat that died because it was hit by a car and it took me... I never got another cat again actually, but that was like 1997, and the next time. I mean we got turtles in... It had to be '95 or '96. We got turtles in 2000. [00:29:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Isis and Athena?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Isis and Athena yeah Goddess themed animals. Yeah. Athena is beautiful but tough that's why she's Athena. Isis is extremely smart but extremely crabby much like... Yeah I know themes. So we got them but I didn't get my dog Merlin until 2004.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Merlin the little dachshund that comes in sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I know the dog. I just don't know the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually it came from the breeder. The name's from some Sci-Fi thing because she does massive breeds. She names all of the puppies after book characters in whatever book she's reading when the dog has litters. Normally people name the dog again but I thought it was amusing. Merlin sounded interesting so I kept her name. [00:30:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. No, I didn't recognize it from Shakespeare.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think it's some sort of like bodice ripper equivalent of Sci-Fi. At one point I looked it up. It was interesting but not interesting enough to buy the book. But since she has so many animals that over the years that's how she names them over the years which kind of makes sense. But we got Merlin which actually she had the same birthday as my husband which is kind of strange. The only reason why I remember it is she just had her birthday on Thursday. Since she's ten Dave and I have been thinking about the fact how much we're not going to be prepared for her to pass on and she's a really great dog. And to have Gio die was actually a big shock because we did not expect that. We expected Merlin... Although she acts like she's much younger, blah, blah, blah, it's because we take care of her. [00:31:44]</p>

<p>We have actually had discussions about the idea of banking her cells and this and that. That way if they can clone animals we could — not like real conversations about that but enough that it was an amusing discussion about the fact that by the time you find out a dog's awesome enough you want to clone them usually their cell supply is such that they wouldn't make for very good viable things. But we had talked about it. The people at her doggy daycare talk about cloning her. I think they got that from us. I don't know. But I just didn't expect it. Like I said, I've known all my life that I do really poorly when animals pass. I've never been very good about it. I just like them too much. [00:32:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it sounds like you're very, very attached.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I had a turtle growing up, Plato. My parents had philosopher as a theme. They had Adorno, a dog too, and Augustine . Oh God a whole bunch of them. But Plato, when he passed they buried him behind the garage and to this day... I mean he passed when I was like eight. And if there are kids back behind that garage I get very upset. I'm like I do not want anyone wandering back in the potential animal graveyard - there's only one animal as far as I know - animal graveyard back there at all. Mom's like oh just leave the kids alone. I'm like I don't who these kids are. They're not respecting me. I'm telling them to go away. They're laughing. And she's like they're just kids. Leave them alone. I'm like no I don't want them stepping on my turtle. That was 30 years ago. [00:33:46]</p>

<p>I don't know. I just feel very weird about this but I've always... I mean the biggest reason why I don't have a lot of animals is because I can't take care and I could get too attached. But I do really, really like them. I mean whenever I go to the pet store I go and visit some of them. I talk to them and things like that enough people think I'm... I'm just so embarrassed about saying this. Okay, my dog goes to dog daycare over at PetSmart near (inaudible at 00:34:21). I wouldn't normally take her there but she loves it. The people there are amazing people and one of them's actually in school and she's working her way through being a vet. So if you ever have an animal that you need to take to be boarded there, they're awesome. Anyway... [00:34:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I gave you the name of the physical therapy place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. The referral thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I've just been so wrapped in everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no, I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So whenever I drop her off to go to daycare on the way back out I always go stop by the reptile section there. And the people work there not only do they know my dog like people that don't even work in the daycare know my dog but they also know me as the girl who comes and talks to the tortoises. There is a Russian tortoise there and I always talk to the Russian tortoise in Russian. They're not laughing at me. They think it's the sweetest thing in the world that I come over and I don't even pronounce things right but I talk to the tortoise in Russian. They think it's hilarious but in a sweet way that I come and talk to the animals there. [00:35:26]</p>

<p>When I was part of the Cincinnati herpetological society I loved going to the behind the scenes things and going and meeting all the animals and finding out baby snakes before they unbound they love to cuddle with people. Your hands are warm and this and that. You know I would probably never own a real snake one because I want people to come visit me and I have too many friends. Second of all it's too much. I don't feed live animals. The feeder fish was enough for the turtles but I didn't want to. But I loved crocodiles as a kid. I wore Izod shirts all the time not because I wanted to be cool and have designer things but because I loved crocodiles and it had crocodiles on the shirts. I still wear them now because of my love of alligators, and crocodiles, and things like that. So I'll never own one but I get a kick out of going to the zoos and talking to them. I love dinosaurs and I guess these things are like modern day dinosaurs and that's how I got used to it. [00:36:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you one of those kids you like dinosaurs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God you have no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. I was really into dinosaurs. Still am a little bit. More than a little bit but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was your knowledge at four or five like encyclopedic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. On top of it tell people most of the major dinosaurs that you see when you go visit other museums are actually casts of the originals ones that are physically actually in the Carter Union Museum in Cincinnati; the largest amount of dinosaurs in the world. [00:37:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No kidding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I used to do a lot of stuff with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And whenever I'm in London and I'm at the dinosaur exhibit I point out to people that that is actually a cast of the one in Cincinnati. And then I explain to them that I've actually gone and kept records of whenever I go to see diplodocus or when I go see this or that that I see the same cast of the same - like seeing the same dinosaur in different towns. When I'm in Germany why am I going to visit the same dinosaur? I don't know. The ones in D.C. are different actually but that's just sort of a weird thing. But most of the dinosaurs they use the same cast. I love that kind of stuff. I always have. And I used to do a lot with the Carnegie Museum because of that. So yeah I really like dinosaurs too. That's probably where the whole thing came from as a kid having grown up in an area that a lot of shale, a lot of... [00:38:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah. The good thing about my parents being out in the middle of nowhere briefly - that period of time that's actually during the 70's shale oil natural gas thing. So my dad took me all the time out onto sites and I would see stuff. So I probably knew the word Precambrian before I knew the word lavatory meant for kids as a bathroom or something or what a gymnasium was. I made up all kinds of words. Like people always say things like oh this is (inaudible at 00:39:01). I had made up this phrase paleorific. I loved dinosaurs. Still do. It's harder to get clothes and things with dinosaurs on them in full size things but yeah I do still like them. That's probably where my reptile thing came from. I don't know. [00:39:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah where it started.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm okay with snakes and iguanas but not like that much. It's mostly things that are from that era that somehow have - like tortoises, sea turtles, alligators. These are the types of animals that really have changed very little since that period of time; like very, very little. So I mean I was really into that. I don't think I ever had a really budding career it in for lots of reasons. One of which is that I don't really like to get especially dirty and you spend a lot of time digging. [00:40:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But amongst that kind of stuff but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Different than a museum?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I would go on a dig once but it was like one of those things like the nice sunny day that you see a dig for every one of those it's miserable pounding rain like nothing's working kind of thing. I was that pain in the ass person who hated "Jurassic Park" because they didn't get anything right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God no. Not even remotely but that's okay. It is what it is. Crichton, that's how he made his money. He actually knew when he was doing things wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. He knew when he was twisting the truth but he was one of those people that never believed in letting the truth get in the way of a good story. Velociraptors the concept of them being able to open doors is impossible because everything that we do we turn to the right because we have a right handed dominant society. Velociraptors are mirrored images and so they actually can only turn left so they couldn't actually ever open up a door. It would never work. So that's the whole premise that they could maybe open up doors wouldn't work. In short he knew that because that just seems like his thing. But yeah, so I just don't know. [00:41:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was for the story then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean if we had doorknobs that opened in the other direction sure it would be able to. But it's something that's been deeply personal to me you know. I love my animals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess for almost your whole life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I don't have siblings so it's not like I... Like I said all my life it didn't matter if they didn't live near me or lived with me. It was okay because I could go visit them. That was my friend. It's like oh yeah my friends don't live at my house either so I go visit this. So it was perfectly okay. I do like other normal animals like beavers, and giraffes, and stuff too. It's just we're on the topic of turtles. I don't want you to think that there's this girl who likes all these weird animals, but I just like that. I just don't know what to do. [00:43:06]</p>

<p>The one thing that's really getting back to the whole get new pet kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect there's not a whole lot to do. I know that's not your favorite mode of thing. And by all means do whatever you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're giving a wake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, see, you're laughing. It's okay to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're going to have food that he likes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm laughing because I saying I don't know if there's anything to do and you're like we are doing else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We are having a wake for him eventually with some of our favorite foods. Well they like human foods too like they like lobster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things that will help you say goodbye sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I just don't like this kind of feeling. I really don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it you don't like about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of it's being really vulnerable but part of it's the fact I never got the chance to say goodbye; truly say goodbye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm turning this off for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll see you in a couple days?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. [00:44:42]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client Grogan Interview 15, Client Grogan Interview 15</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible 00:00:12) trip today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where did you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We took (inaudible 00:00:22). I'd never heard of it. It's a war, war museum (inaudible 00:28:30), but yeah 500 (inaudible 00:00:35). I was so exhausted I dialed the number here at 4:05 to tell you I wasn't going to come. And then I thought oh hell, I don't want to go tomorrow either so . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's sort of like . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laugh)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you kind of bushed right now and not wanting to be here. And the only reason you're here is because it would have been worse to have come tomorrow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not worse, but I just, I just, I thought I'd just like to not think that I'd have to do anything and so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, well you know I had like, I thought, I thought that I was making myself tired. More tired than I was. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. [00:01:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was projecting ahead to the drive you know. So I kind of, of course I was falling asleep at the wheel in the end so (inaudible 00:01:27). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:01:30).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How many kids?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my room and another room and the other teacher didn't go. She was sick. So there was a sub, so it was really wonderful. No. they were pretty good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How many?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fifty-one kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fifty-one kids and you and someone who didn't know what she was doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, it was a man that subs in the school a lot so he knew some of the kids, but whew, it's really amazing how tired you get taking kids on a trip. (Inaudible 00:02:13) taking the train here. I really needed to. And then I thought, I thought the (inaudible) it was (inaudible) it was just a normal (inaudible), and I thought I don't care. He ought to be lucky I'm coming right? I don't care if I'm late . . . he's lucky I'm coming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's (inaudible 00:02:38)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I was laughing at myself for thinking it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like I don't know, was I being a martyr? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No it sort of sounds like you feel like you're doing me a favor or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he's getting more out of this than I am. [00:03:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think that. Naw, I'm just cranky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I'm hearing that, but I'm trying to explain what the, what that's about. I mean you ought to be glad I'm here at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose. I suppose I probably would have been happier if (inaudible 00:03:35) coming here and going home. But that's, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible 00:03:49) that I can put my finger on something about sort of feeling two ways about coming here or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean two ways?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe in only one way like, by not really wanting, (inaudible 00:04:07) one hand, not wanting to come. Like it's a hassle and I ought to be glad that you come at all, it's enough of a hassle. I don't just mean the driving it's some kind of inside thing that's a hassle too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you mean all the time or just today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe. I don't know about any other time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was going to say it wasn't true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good. And the other side is like wanting to come, and I presume you must have because we're here. [00:04:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did want to come. Uh, I'm just being cranky I guess. I didn't want to, I was angry at myself for getting so tired. Because I didn't do anything to get so tired except walk you know, but I mean really . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I do want to be angry at myself. I wanted to be angry maybe at you, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or take it out on me or something. [00:05:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like uh, what was I going to say? Like, well it's really not important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (inaudible 00:05:27).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it really is. Plus, I took . . . my doctor gave me three kinds of diet pills to try, and I took the weakest kind today. You know, there were just no effects at all. I mean I'm not up at all and I haven't been. I mean I don't think so anyway. I thought that would help because I knew I was going to be kind of tired. I didn't know I was going to be this tired. So now I'll stop . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe (inaudible 00:06:16) lay down? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Naw, I'll just stop complaining now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That'll make it better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like yourself when you do that huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Complain?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. uh, not about things that you can't change or don't matter or something. You know I think that I want to say the things at least once. [00:06:53]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to say it I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: Instead of just keeping it inside, I'd rather say it because then I can say, "Oh well." I guess (inaudible 00:07:09) that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I'm hearing you. I may not, what I think what you're saying is that you don't really like to keep it inside of you. Like you'd rather like get it out and say it. And then like by saying it, like maybe dismiss it or something rather than sort of walking around thinking I'm cranky, I'm tired, I'm this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, uh huh, but I felt I was just going on and on and on about it. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Going on and on more than it's worth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That works. Let's see. Oh, I had a real fight with James yesterday, and it was really wonderful. [00:08:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it wasn't wonderful to have a fight. But it's probably the first successful fight that I've ever had with anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. Because I wasn't really angry . . . I think he was a little angry. I was, I could have been angry, but I wasn't irrational or anything like that. And he stayed around and finished the fight which has never happened to me before. And I don't know what to say about it except that it was nice. And I don't know. It was kind of important to me, but I . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing, the thing I'm trying to get a feel for is what happened that was good? What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, it was just, it was some kind of stupid fight like he told me he was going to sleep on my side of the bed because it was more comfortable. And what made me angry was that he told me that instead of asking me that. [00:09:30]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And so then we had a fight about the bed which . . . and then about my apartment and the beds in my apartment. And things like that. And . . . but anyway I was trying to listen to him and say what I thought he was really feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he, then when the fight was all over . . . he was kidding, half kidding, and he said he was still angry at me. And I asked him why? And he said one, because I was rational and he was being irrational. And two, because we had been asleep before this and the phone rang and I went back to sleep after the phone rang and he couldn't. And he was angry at me for those two reasons which . . . I mean, that's . . . I understand that. It sounds crazy you know that people get mad at things like that right? And anyway it was nice to hear somebody else say something like that. [00:10:52]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what I'm hearing isn't so much about the fight now, what I'm hearing is that it was nice to have him like be honest or something. Is that . . . ? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, he's honest, but he . . . a lot of times won't . . . I don't know. I guess won't fight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:11:27).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, it was . . . no, but it was the fight because I didn't feel horribly rejected or put down or I wasn't too afraid to say what I wanted to say. That's what I mean. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you were able to kind of stand up for what you felt. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not be cowed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that felt good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what felt good. That ending thing was just another thing that was, I thought was amusing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's also like he was human or . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:12:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but the main thing was that . . . that I've never had that happen to me. And I can't tell if that was me or if that was him. It was probably a combination. I mean if that was because . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in some way you were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it partly was, but I don't know if I could have done that with someone else. But anyway, it was, it was very different and it was a new experience. It really was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was new and I guess it made you feel a little stronger or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More solid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it sounds like from how you speak you usually kind of give quarter and back down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh I wasn't afraid that he was going to get angry at me and throw me out. I really wasn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you felt secure when you argued with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that feeling secure allowed you to state your piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, uh huh. And I wanted to talk to you about why I always think about dying because I think that's really strange. I think uh, not necessarily me. I wonder if it's like a wish, you know? You know you read things. I don't know. A lot of times uh . . . oh . . . like . . . what was I going to say? Like when someone is going away. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:14:05).</p>

<p>CLIENT: When someone is going away. Could be anywhere really, I think something like what if they died and I'll never see them again? Or something like that. I think things like that a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I think them about myself, but more often I think them about other people. And I think things . . . and when I say them, you know, people, they either laugh or they are horrified . . . one of the two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't say them a lot. But I really think things like that a lot, and I don't . . .it's probably something to do with you know, like, I don't know if I want them . . . like if I think they're going to what? Leave me and dying is something beyond their or my control, and so that makes it's easier. I don't know or what? Does that make any sense? [00:15:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like, let me see, you mean like they're not . . . You mean like they're going to leave you anyway, and it's better like they should die because that way it isn't because of you or because of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, I mean I'm not thinking of them, I'm afraid of them dying when I'm thinking this, but I just wonder if that's why I think that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's, maybe it's that you wish they'd die.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just wish they'd die?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm wrong?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no, no, no, no. You wish they, I guess I must not be understanding, but I thought you were thinking about look, I have a, I wonder if I . . . when I think about their dying when they go away because like I know the relationship is going to end. I know they're really going to go away and better they should die then go away. Because if they die, that's a random act of something or other rather than having them go, really leave me because then it's because I'm terrible and they wish to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, yeah, that's what I was saying, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you don't, it's like you're not aware of like wishing that. All you know is that when people go like you really start thinking about what happens if I never see them again? What happens if they die? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it just triggers it off in you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, and I'm trying to think it's just with like . . . it's not only just with boyfriends it could be with a lot of people, really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could understand it more if it were just with boyfriends I guess. [00:16:56]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because other people I don't, I'm not aware of being afraid of them leaving me. You know like girlfriends? I don't know if I (inaudible 00:17:09) girlfriends or parents or friends or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so . . . but that's not such a big issue with other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. It's so (inaudible 00:17:28). I don't know what to say about that except I was thinking about it the other day. And it just bothers me that I think about it so much. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm. Like what's wrong with me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's wrong with what? Me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like what's wrong with me that I'm obsessed by . . . or not obsessed it's too strong a word, but like it always enters my mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I can remember thinking that forever. Or you know, and I used to think it. And I would tell myself when I was a kid, if I thought about it then it would never happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But why I do that now because I don't know if I think that or not. [00:18:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm. Then it had a purpose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of a weird thing to think about. But I know I did when I was a kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why does that seem so strange?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To think about people dying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, it's not so strange to think about people dying because I mean it can happen. I just think I do it a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're, you know, somebody that's sort of bizarre, and you're kind of horrified. That's too strong a word, but something . . . appalled. But I guess I don't really understand that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it makes me sad when I do it. See I'm making myself sad by doing it. When I was younger oh, I used to . . . sometimes. Yeah I used to sometimes lie in bed, and who was I thinking this about? I think my grandparents, my mother's parents. And I would go through something about them dying, maybe their funeral, something. And I would lie in bed and I would cry. I would just do this a lot. I think a lot. It seems like a lot to me because I remember it strongly. [00:20:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm. Sounds like the feeling that people who meant something to you were going to be snatched away from you and like a grief with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes but see that never happened to me. Nobody ever died. (Laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where did it come from? (Laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laugh) Yeah. Well just . . . a couple of years ago. Nobody ever died.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if like, if that had happened, and you would have felt decimated then it would make some kind of sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's no cause that you . . . no incident. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>(Sounds of machine)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:21:48).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did I do? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:21:51). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean you printed off (inaudible 00:21:56).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have some (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see I don't know if that's an important thing to me or not. I don't know how much that affects my life? [00:22:23]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 00:22:28).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laugh).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the way you say that it makes it sounds like it has to be . . . you have to really be running amok over that or something to justify having said it like it has to be because of numerous discretions or malfunctions or something right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah I guess. I don't think it is. I don't know, uh . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay and therefore it's not worth talking about if you don't know. [00:23:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I know that like I'm afraid of people leaving me, but I just . . . maybe I (inaudible 00:23:20) . . . hm. When I was a kid we moved a lot. And I was always glad that we moved because I always wanted to leave the people instead of having them leave me. I remember that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But . . . I'm still kind of like that except that uh, when I (inaudible 00:24:15) over like with men, I always, almost always let the men leave me kind of. I guess. I say that but I don't know how to say that. (Inaudible 00:24:30) are kind of (inaudible 00:24:31), I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible 00:24:36).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like? Sometimes you think a relationship is not going well okay? And I would know it, but I wouldn't be able to know it definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like (inaudible 00:24:55).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Am I narcissistic? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm. Does it seem like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you really want men to hurt you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe or expect it or . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels right that they do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah . . . that kind of right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like you expect it, that's how it happens. [00:25:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Yeah. Now if that has something to do with just men? I don't know. I'm confused. I . . . Like with being (inaudible 00:27:04) with men. (Inaudible) I don't now if it's directly . . . I guess with men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean you're hurting yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like every (inaudible 00:27:24) in yourself, being yourself is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um. I feeling fruitless . . . I mean . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't get you anywhere does it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doesn't get me anywhere talking about it because I . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. [00:27:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I always reach the point in talking about something when I don't know what else to say about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it really does sound like (inaudible) you feel sort of like you're . . . like up against a wall or something. Like you've exhausted everything you know about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, even if I haven't said it, I've . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thought it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, it always made me feel foolish before, uh . . . kind of frustrated. [00:28:47]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Frustrated with men you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Frustrated with men and uh, a whole host of things. Because like I said last time I feel like I'm doing that good. </p>

<p>(Silence 00:29:35 to 00:31:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I don't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. [00:31:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you have this whole block of time. And like now you carve it up, and it just sort of lays there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know . . . sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like time . . . it's a clich�, like time really hangs heavy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no, not time hangs heavy. Um, I can't tell what things . . . I knew when things, I'd find out what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you can't sort of get a handle for how much help this is because you kind of forget what's new and what's old.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe it's really not any help at all or maybe it's pretty much of a help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh, sometimes I think it's a big help. [00:32:33]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sometimes I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you're kind of medium eager to come and sometimes you are, "What the hell am I doing behind this steering wheel bucking this traffic?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. No, I'm usually anxious. Once I get in the car, I'm anxious to come here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I'm searching for something . . . um, and I'm afraid I'm not going to find it. And I'm real afraid of that. [00:33:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like the fear is more palatable than the searching.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how to search I think maybe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what you're doing doesn't seem right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't seem enough . . . nothing doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More should happen in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know how to do it. I feel like if nothing happens in here, there's no base for me. [00:34:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like this is almost a real, seems like a real test for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel um, no, I don't, and I feel like sometimes when I'm here I think, "Well, (inaudible 00:35:07). There isn't anything else there."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I think that there is, but I don't know what to do about it. [00: 35:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess what you mean is something like sometimes you think there is but you're not sure what the dimensions of it is going to be. It's like you don't know what to call it? Or what is, yeah, I may be solid through all that other stuff but what is that? What do I . . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's it I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it also sounds like you were saying before that like there's something special about making it in here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think it's um, I don't know. Most of the time I think that I'm confused about myself, and I think I haven't been able to find out about myself, myself. I feel that I need help to do that, and if I can't do it with help . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's your last best hope.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you blow this one, you're really lost. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh see that's exactly how I feel . . . makes me not (inaudible 00:36:52).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's very frightening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes it is.</p>

<p>(Silence 00:36:56 to 00:37:31) </p>

<p>CLIENT: There aren't any rules with it and if I flounder . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you feel (inaudible 00:37:39).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I don't know but I'm wondering if you're (inaudible 00:37:49). I'd like to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I think that and then sometimes I think that's wrong. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wish I could give you something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See I think that (inaudible 00:38:12), I guess, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just (inaudible 00:38:43) or not, and I've decided that oh well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I meant that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>(Horn honking)</p>

<p>(Silence 00:38:55 to 00:39:46) </p>

<p>CLIENT: See, I don't know. I am really confused this time. I don't know. And I don't know how to find out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like on the one hand, on the one hand you're very, very like desperate or pressed to kind of set some solidity to you or I'm not sure what that is exactly, but whatever that is. You, on the other hand, you wonder whether it's really true at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I just don't (inaudible 00:40:32). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it's, that is the thing you know. Some people seem to know about these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you said that before makes it sound like one aspect of that is sometimes it feels like you're a whole bunch of different people (inaudible 00:41:12). I don't know what that is. (Inaudible 00:41:20) people or feelings or ways of being? What? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel so ambivalent a lot of the time. And it's very possible it's just that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, okay let me try. I think I got a handle on it. Like one way to flip something like do I am I a kind of person who loves or hates, whatever that is and like the flip is well maybe I'm the kind of person who is ambivalent. Is that? No. (Inaudible 00:42:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, yeah, sometimes, okay, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I'm, what I'm trying to get a hold of is you know it sounds like you kind of reach to kind of get a hold of yourself and (inaudible 00:42:26) slips through your fingers </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like what is that? What do you? What are you trying to . . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Like what is really me? What's really real about me? When you strip, when you strip away . . . I don't know what, how I act or when you strip something away it's like what is real underneath that? [00:43:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe everything is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe those layers are all real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um. Something about understanding yourself I think. Like . . . (inaudible)</p>

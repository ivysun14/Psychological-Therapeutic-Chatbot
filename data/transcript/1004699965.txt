<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just wondering if you could do a payment for this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We had talked about doing a series of $50 payments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. (long pause) </p>

<p>[01:12.6]</p>

<p>I'm hoping to go to a model soon where you can just login and do this online so we don't have to—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, sweet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- take time here. Yeah, my billing service is working on that. [It's not far along], but you probably know more about how it is with software development than me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just spent several hours [on it.]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that can mean a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Anything from "We're about to do it" to "We just thought of it." (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. They have some features of the system that are in place already, but I'm hoping they'll get the rest of it soon so that (inaudible). </p>

<p>[02:01.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cool. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They already have it where you can do scheduling that way and stuff, but I don't do that. They have it for like medical doctors as well (inaudible at 02:19.3). </p>

<p>CLIENT: One of my friends is working with a company that is making digital medical records. They do business with some various people, but the interesting one is that older doctors were like "Well, if I get someone's file and it's three inches thick, that tells me something." You know, for instance—- or even just being like "Okay, it's really thick in this portion." So they're trying to introduce ways to give that size feedback.</p>

<p>[03:03.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the company?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually can never remember. It's in nearby. It has one of those vague, could be anything—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the software I started using [a couple months ago] (inaudible at 03:19.2). </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So yesterday at the end of the day, I had this sort of—- it was a [big blow]. So I stay logged into my Gmail account all day at work and G-chat with my friends and whatever. And I got a message from Josie's most-recent ex, which I did not expect at all.</p>

<p>[04:06.1]</p>

<p>And their e-mail was "I would like to talk to you about our mutual ex, if that's something that you feel comfortable doing" or whatever. The most immediate feeling I had was just like the record scratch noise. Like I just sort of sat there and stared at my computer for a while and just felt like both really scared and nervous and just not knowing what the fuck was going on. (pause) I didn't know they had broken up. But everyone that Josie has been involved with since me, they've all pretty much tried to be socially friendly at various points.</p>

<p>[05:05.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me. And I've always politely been like "No, I don't want to do that." (pause) I'm also vaguely aware that she has more than once used our relationship as like, I don't know, a sign of how anti-racist she is and her enlightenment or whatever. Which makes me really angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 05:41.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe a year ago, a year-and-a-half ago—- the different BDSM scenes in the US and in other countries have a regional affiliation. </p>

<p>[06:02.4]</p>

<p>So like San Francisco Bay Area kinky people are much more—- like East Coast, New York, etc. people don't drink or do drugs at parties pretty much ever. It's very sober. And there are ways in which it is kind of old-fashioned here. The kink scene is kind of old-fashioned. That's just kind of how it is. Also this kind of like a little—- I don't want to say circuit, but there's—- because it's kind of close. Big East Coast cities are kind of one blob, you could say. There are other ones, but that's like the big one. </p>

<p>[06:55.9]</p>

<p>Which is also part of why I basically—- unless I leave this coast—- it's like the East Coast has places where Josie might go, just because we all get invited to parties there and we all know each other. So San Francisco people are much more likely to casually drink or use casual drugs during things. Also because of laws being less tight, they often have burlesque and strippers at kink events in ways that people don't on the East Coast, mostly because of prostitution laws and other concerns. So there's just these differences. San Francisco people are all like crunchy, they're all kind of like [country hippies] and not as much—- also, East Coast people are like "Well, we're just more intelligent and intellectual." They're just fucking swingers, sort of like that, but whatever.</p>

<p>[08:00.8]</p>

<p>At any rate—- also there's a shit-ton of kinky, queer (inaudible at 08:05.4) in the Bay Area. Like bucket loads. So someone started talking about this idea of consent culture, like really encouraging and creating an environment in which explicit sexual consent is important and also an environment in which someone trying to guilt-trip you or other things is explicitly discouraged. [It comes more out of sex bondage/sex radical communities] but they're also kinky. One woman, Brandy, who actually had also dated Josie for a while at one point—- this again. Small world. It kills me.</p>

<p>[09:04.2]</p>

<p>She moved to San Francisco and she wrote this really—- she does porn now and it's like she wrote this piece about all the ways in which she has had kind of non-consensual sex or BDSM happened to her and why, and how this was a problem, and the problem she felt is that nothing ever really happens to perpetrators. Like maybe the best you could get is that they won't be invited to one of 20 parties in the area. And going to the police is not really feasible for a lot of reasons, including that a lot of times BDSM is illegal, we can't consent, like (inaudible) says you can't consent to be struck.</p>

<p>[10:03.0]</p>

<p>And also it really rapidly turns into "Oh, so are you a prostitute?" It's like "Hey, no." (inaudible at 10:08.0) before sexual assault. So that happened, and people are talking about anti-harassment policies. I was kind of like checking it out and stuff, and then it spread over here and people were talking about it. There was a lot of push-back and negative feelings. Basically a lot of straight white guys who were like "But what if I was flirting with someone and then she decided that I was harassing her?" Like, it's just like—- I don't care. And also saying "Well, you should just go to the police" even though—- which everyone knows.</p>

<p>[11:05.1]</p>

<p>So then we're talking and this woman Kris (sp?)—- various people were offering themselves up to be a resource. Or if you were at an event and felt uncomfortable, you could talk to this person and they could help you out. Kris (sp?) volunteered herself as someone who knows a lot about domestic violence and [domestic partner] violence, especially with gays and lesbians. She works for (inaudible at 11:35.6) and she's like "I'm the person if you have any problems, just come to me." (pause) That was really upsetting. I got really upset and really angry because what I wanted to say was like "Yeah. P.S., your girlfriend is an abuser, just so you know."</p>

<p>[12:05.9]</p>

<p>So that was awful. And I felt like—- I don't know. Kind of like second-guessing myself, like maybe it wasn't abusive. Except that it was. (pause) Here were all these people being very dismissive. All these guys being very dismissive of situations that were in some ways similar to mine. It was really upsetting as well. It also reinforced like this is why I haven't talked about it a lot. (pause) So I stopped participating in discussions about it because—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You did?]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of because of everything, and also I didn't think I could handle Kris (sp?) setting herself up as this really great advocate, considering that she's dating Josie.</p>

<p>[13:07.0]</p>

<p>Like there's just no way to talk about that. Especially at one point, I think I said "Well, it's really difficult if your abuser is in the community. Like they're right there." And Kris (sp?) was like "Oh no, I could totally help you out with that." [Like you did what you could do]. (pause) It just felt really awful. It just—- (pause) I mean, it's a subject that I care a lot about. (pause) I just kind of felt like a little bit paranoid. Like all of the sort of negative things I worry about talking about my relationship with Josie, like this was like a laundry list of them.</p>

<p>[14:07.8]</p>

<p>Like wow, these guys are being jerks and this is happening. I thought about should I say anything to Kris (sp?) a lot. I decided that I didn't want to. (pause) In part because I didn't think she'd believe me at all, and you know, she wouldn't believe me. I felt all it would do it sort of kick up "Julie (ph) is being difficult or gossiping or whatever." (pause) And the other thing which I think about is like well, I don't know that she's acted that way with anyone else.</p>

<p>[15:14.3]</p>

<p>Like could it just be me? It might not. I don't think it's just me, but, you know. (pause) So—- (pause) I mean, I've been kind of flopping between feeling really numb about that e-mail—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it Kris (sp?)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, about Kris (sp?) e-mailing me. Also—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned it was a previous girlfriend, I just didn't know—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, Kris (sp?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, Josie is socially friends with her former therapist whose name is also Kris (sp?). I know. Which is a separate disaster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Josie is socially friends with her own former therapist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whose name is Kris (sp?).</p>

<p>[16:04.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughter) Yeah. I didn't think that was appropriate at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that usually is a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 16:21.3) (pause) And I know that she [had me going back and forth], like this is something I feel like was really inappropriate, but I don't think there's anything I can do with that information. I was thinking it was Josie's former therapist, but it was Kris (sp?), Josie's ex-girlfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[17:03.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mostly feel like I'm in shock. Like I don't—- I just—- I pretty much never expected. Like the person she was dating, when we were together, I expected her to try to talk to me, and she kind of has, in a kind of vague way. But I never expected any of her further people she was dating or sleeping with to talk to me, like to try to like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You wouldn't necessarily expect your former partner's partners who were couples after you to sort of look you up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like they've all tried to socialize with me at like kink events or other events where there are lots of people, where that might make sense, but—- </p>

<p>[18:05.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it's a connection that you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I just never expected—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. This is a little more [awkward].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One of the things that I've sort of struggled with and second-guessed myself on is, you know, should I have been more vocal about Josie. Like if she was abusive to another partner, I would feel really shitty and wish that I had been able to say something, that I had said something like "Hey, your girlfriend is a horrible person." Also knowing that that wouldn't really go anywhere. (pause)</p>

<p>[19:05.0]</p>

<p>After Josie and I broke up, one of my friends said that she had wanted to tell me that I should break up with Josie, and she felt guilty that she hadn't. And she sort of point-blank asked me if that would have—- and I was like "No, it really wouldn't have." Like not really. (pause) So sometimes I think about, like in the back of my head, like is there someone else who is in a similar situation that if I said something, like maybe they wouldn't. Not that that really makes sense, but—- (pause) </p>

<p>[20:00.6]</p>

<p>But I also felt very strongly that I wasn't going to initiate contact. I didn't want to initiate contact. Sort of. Like, I don't know. Part of me had wanted one of them to talk to me directly, say something directly, but the idea is also really terrifying. So this is the situation that I didn't think was going to happen. Like I could sort of see it having happened like with Kat or with other people a while ago, but right now this is not what I expected would happen. (pause) And I guess I've kind of—- I feel like I've somewhat come to terms with the idea that I am not able to magically save someone else who Josie was abusive towards.</p>

<p>[21:14.1]</p>

<p>Like I can't do that. And that an opportunity for that—- like it's just not going to happen like that. Like it's not like someone is going to walk up to me and say "Oh, I was just wondering what do you think of Josie as a girlfriend? I'd like to start dating her." That's not going to happen, and whatever fantasy I have of like swooping in and having Josie punished for crappy behavior is not going to happen. So getting this e-mail from Kris (sp?) just, I don't know. I felt like this is something that isn't happening. Like how could you be e-mailing me? That's not what's happening, like that's not—- I don't know. </p>

<p>[22:04.8]</p>

<p>It just felt very, and still feels (pause) intrusive. (pause) And I don't know what I want to do. (pause) I mean, I don't have to actually say anything to her, but I'd rather actually make that decision than not. (long pause)</p>

<p>[24:30.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes me think of how difficult it is to talk about things related to Josie. I imagine because these are some of the things that you feel the most vulnerable and sensitive about, and also like other people won't believe or take seriously. (pause)</p>

<p>[25:50.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's just—- (pause) I mean, thinking about it is really scary. (pause) Thinking how people might react is—- (pause) I mean, part of what's frustrating or difficult or whatever is that I know how people react to—- I'm depressingly aware of how people tend to react to accusations of abuse, especially between women (inaudible) than Josie.</p>

<p>[26:57.9]</p>

<p>And she has her well-trafficked public—- you know, has PTSD, was molested, etc. (pause) And part of it that is really scary and makes me nervous is (inaudible at 27:25.9) some chunk of people are going to be assholes about it. But I don't know necessarily which ones. So it's really scary to (pause) find out which of my friends is judging me negatively. (pause)</p>

<p>[28:01.2]</p>

<p>Who do I want to—- because I know at that point, I don't ever want to talk to them again. If someone is going to (pause) react poorly, I won't have a great recovery from that. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the relationship is a stake as well as (inaudible at 28:44.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) </p>

<p>[29:16.3]</p>

<p>I mean, I think also (pause) like a lot of (inaudible at 29:32.7) I guess is around trust or trustworthiness, and (pause) it's really painful to think that a friend would think I'm a liar and that I'm making this up. (pause) And also, you know, talking about what happened in ways that aren't elliptical that are more direct does end with "So, who do you believe? Me or her?" </p>

<p>[30:20.5]</p>

<p>Like "Who do you believe, and who are you going to stay friends with?" (pause) I don't feel like—- [this is probably a phrase]—- but I don't feel like I would necessarily win that. Not that it's a competition, but, you know. (long pause)</p>

<p>[31:26.7]</p>

<p>It also makes it harder to deal with—- (pause) Like all of this has made me feel estranged from big chunks of the kink community. In part because, you know, we spend a lot of time in this community talking about BDSM versus abuse, consent, etc. And so the narrative the kink community presents to the public is that there's this bright shining line and everyone—- you just know. It's very obvious, and it's immediately dealt with. (pause)</p>

<p>[32:32.1]</p>

<p>And, you know, that's the propaganda narrative. Like it's not remotely anyone's real narrative. (pause) I know [Kris (sp?)] and I were talking about how in LGBT rights, they do a lot of things where as a political movement, we've kind of all decided that we're just going to say this. Like "I was born gay. It's not changeable. It's nothing to do with anything else." And in reality, sometimes people might feel like they have more choice or they chose to be gay. Or someone might say "Actually, yes, being sexually molested did affect my sexuality."</p>

<p>[33:30.4]</p>

<p>And there are all these things we're not supposed to tell in public. (pause) And that's also what this feels like. (pause) And it's like I feel like I'm the kink community's dirty laundry. Like "I really prefer if you just not talk about that, ever." (pause) And in a way, I would certainly enjoy never talking about my relationship with Josie again. That would be nice. (pause) Except not talking about it ever again would just be, you know, wholesale denial. (pause)</p>

<p>[34:41.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's something that's a big part of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I was feeling kind of strongly yesterday that, I mean, it was such a physical reaction. Like I felt really nauseous for hours. I didn't want to eat dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After getting Kris's (sp?) e-mail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After getting Kris's (sp?) e-mail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I got it right at the end of the day. [And I'm just not feeling good about it]. And I felt like—- I don't know. I just felt like it was really unfair that many years later it's still this fucking upsetting.</p>

<p>[35:44.3]</p>

<p>And I feel like I want that to be done. Like I don't want to, you know, have to deal with Josie again or have to deal with whatever exes want to talk about her and their relationship. I want it to be not upsetting anymore. Like right now, that's what I would like. (pause) And while it's certainly less upsetting than it has been in the past—- (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand why you want to go from never wanting to talk about it again to not wanting [it to be upsetting anymore] without the really awful part in the middle.</p>

<p>[36:49.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I would like the emotional work in here to just do itself. That would be great. (pause) And I also—- it still frustrates me how much I still blame myself and think that I should have done this, I could have done that, and still want to make excuses for her. I was talking to my friend on the phone, and it just was really hard to not (pause) I guess go into all the reasons why. "You have to understand this and that and this." (pause) </p>

<p>[38:03.0]</p>

<p>And whenever I do that, I feel like so frustrated and so mad at myself. But it's also hard not to. But then I sort of feel like I'm saying these things and I'm also going "What the fuck?" like 30 seconds later or thinking (inaudible at 38:33.2). I regret it later, but I still say it. I still think a lot of it. (long pause)</p>

<p>[39:19.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's often overwhelming to think about the way it really was. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I mean, it's also very hard for me to think (pause) about the bigger, [brighter pictures of those too], like this one thing, this one thing, and this one thing. And being able to [see that it was just this one time]. And it's really hard to sort of sit and just think about—- to put all those pieces together and think about it. (long pause)</p>

<p>[42:41.8]</p>

<p>And another thing that comes up for me is (pause) like I basically—- I mean, it's part of why I don't feel better about this. Why does it still bother me? There's part of me that's like well, that happened several years ago. You know, by now should it still matter? (pause) Part of that is also a couple of my friends sort of saying "It was a while ago, you see a therapist, why aren't you over it yet?" (pause) Which is also—- </p>

<p>[43:55.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Time doesn't really matter]. (inaudible at 44:02.8) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 44:13.2) (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, for me one of the—- (pause) one of the difficult conversations that Ashby (ph) and I have periodically is—- so her parents treated her getting molested really crazily. She basically got grounded. She didn't want to tell them what happened, and they overheard her on the phone talking to someone.</p>

<p>[44:55.2]</p>

<p>So they kind of acted like, you know, she snuck out to go drinking or something. She wasn't allowed to talk on the phone privately. She wasn't allowed to do all these things, [like she had a curfew], and she felt very punished for it. (pause) And what Ashby (ph) says a lot is that it happened so long ago that it doesn't matter. And she got really mad at her mother who said recently something like—- I think her mother said something like "That was the worst thing that happened to you." And Ashby (ph) got really angry and said "It's not the worst thing that has happened to me. Blah blah blah. It was a long time ago. It was a long time ago."</p>

<p>[45:50.2]</p>

<p>And whenever she says that about herself, I'm like "I think it's still affecting you." (pause) But yesterday she was saying that back to me, like "It's been over five years. Why would you want to talk to this person? It doesn't even matter anymore." (pause) Which was really not helpful. I mean, it mostly made me think that I understand that you don't want your trauma to matter anymore, except that it does. She's also trying group therapy and she did her first session yesterday and was super cranky and resistant in talking.</p>

<p>[46:51.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now. (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you (inaudible)? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll just (inaudible). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can try [code]#. I mean, that's what it used to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll give it a try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry [I could not find out.]</p>

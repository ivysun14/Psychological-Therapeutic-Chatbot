<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (5-minute silence)  When I came in today I was, uhm, lay down here, I just thought there was nothing on my mind.  Or I had that feeling I sometimes get of, there'll be nothing to say today.  And then, (Sigh) I don't know whether I was thinking it because generally the weekend was a very pleasant one, or whether it was because there was nothing that I was aware was on my mind.  But then, I did think anyway that the weekend was pleasant.</p>

<p>And, and then I thought of last night, when we went to bed.  And how, I don't know whether I started to get a stomachache before or not, but as soon as MSCZ indicated he wanted to make love to me, I got this, well I don't kn—, violent would be too strong a word.  But a very uncomfortable pain in my stomach.  And it didn't go aw—, and then, it was one of those things where I didn't want to say no and I didn't want to say yes.  And it was, well it was obvious I couldn't make up my mind, and he wasn't too sure what to do.  And we ended up finally having intercourse.  And as soon as we were having it, I was alright; my stomachache went away.</p>

<p>And then after I thought that, I started thinking about the only thing that I've been aware of as being on my mind today.  But it hasn't been on it enough to, I don't know, make me just want to sit and think about it.  And that was just simply, now that reports are in, I realize today that there are a lot of things that I should start planning carefully, connected with teaching reading.  Because I've really planned only up until this point.  But I didn't really feel like planning it today, so I, I, kind of came home with the feeling that I wasn't that clear on where to go next or exactly what to do.  And yet I know if I just sit down and think about the different groups that I have for reading, I wouldn't be unclear.  But yet I, I still sort of don't have confidence that I know.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Something else just came to my mind that, I knew it bothered me at the time, but I didn't recall thinking about it today at all, anyway.  We went to see the newest James Bond movie last night.  And at some point, he was falling in love with a girl.  And in all the old ones he never did.  So I said something about it to MSCZ and he said, "Oh in this one, he marries her."  And I said, "Well how could that be, because it's just not in character?"  He said "Well, she gets killed."  And from that point on, I was very upset during the movie.  And somehow it really bothered me that they would be married and care about each other, and then she'd be killed.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I couldn't understand this, either.  That I mean often in that type of movie, even though I know what it is, when they get scenes of tension where's he's almost going to be caught, or will he escape and that kind of thing, I'll always feel the tension.  And I imagine most people do, I don't know.  But I always wonder if I feel it more than most.  But last night I was shaking, and I couldn't stop shaking.  (Pause, Stomach growls)</p>

<p>I don't know why, it must be connected.  But now I think of talking about the dream I had when I was here Friday.  And how the two men that I remembered in the dream made me think of my father and my brother.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of, actually it came out that in the movie there was a sequence, too, of near the end she was captured and uhm, she had to fight literally, a man, to live, to survive.  And then when she was rescued she ended up marrying James Bond.  And then she was killed right after.  But I was thinking of it more in terms, she fought and then got what she wanted and then lost it, in the sense that she, she wanted to live at that point.  Before she'd been unhappy, and then she lost her life and lost this man she loved, because she died.</p>

<p>And then I was just wondering, well, during the movie when it was upsetting me, I knew he'd live.  And, I don't know which was upsetting me.  To think that she would in effect, lose something she wanted, or that he would.  But I think, but whatever it is, it's connected with losing something that you just get, and you want.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I did think of this next, although I thought of it more in terms of expecting you to then lead me to think some—, or to see something.  Uh, but the next thing I thought was, I suppose that would be comparable to my wanting a penis and then thinking I had one, in whatever deception I'd go through.  And then, losing it.  But I don't have any idea why I, it was more the words I use that make me think that.  But I can't think of how I think I get one and then immediately lose it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Last week you were talking, you mentioned a number of instances of women getting babies and then losing them.  I think that's what you must be wanting and thinking of losing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause)  It's funny, I have 2 reactions to that.  One is, I don't understand why I would think of losing a baby if I got one.  Or think of it in that strong way.  And the other thing I think of is the way I will fluctuate anyway, about thinking about being c—, becoming pregnant and having a child.  Because sometimes, I just feel overwhelmed with wanti—, wanting it, and other times I don't at all.  Or at least I think I don't.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well then I was just thinking about the things that I think when I think I don't want to have a child.  And that usually involves being afraid of what will become of me if I'm, well I think of it in terms of tied down at home.  (Sigh) Or just last night I was thinking of it, just because MSCZ had suddenly decided he wanted to see the movie and there was nothing I had to do at home.  And so I didn't mind, and it was just very pleasant to suddenly decide to do something and be able to go out and do it.  (Sniff, Pause) But we almost never do, or, or at least never do to the point where we weren't sort of considering doing it before, anyway.  So I don't know why I put so much weight on it last night.  That suddenly we decided to do something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then sometimes I'll worry about just how we can afford to, well first, have me stop working, and second, having a child.  And I, I don't know, I think part of that comes because I've never w—, had to work hard at being really economical and I, I don't have any confidence that I can be.  And then the other thing is that I won't be earning anything and I'm used to using my salary for all my needs, including household needs.  So to have me earning nothing, and then to have to get everything from MSCZ, which he's not used to giving to me, I just, I don't know, I don't see how we can.  Except with me being really careful.  And then that frightens me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know whether these feelings (stomach growls) have anything to do with thinking I might, that I want a child and then losing it.  But I don't really understand why I feel that way, except that I might feel that way about anything I want.  (Pause)</p>

<p>The next thing I think and I don't, I don't know, I mean I must react this way sometimes, maybe a lot.  But what I was just thinking is it's almost as if I don't think that I should want things, or that if I do want them, I don't know, it's almost not a self-discipline.  But, well, I don't know exactly what it is, but it's almost as if I don't think people should get what they want that much, and that there shouldn't just be sort of a deep enjoyment of getting what you want.  I, I don't really know how to put this into words.  But (Silence) I guess what I meant was more, I'm afraid to want something like wanting a baby.  Because by wanting it, it means, it will mean I can't have it.  Because if I think about it, it's the times when I'm most aware of having to wait to become pregnant that I will let myself think most how I'd like to become pregnant.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And again, I don't know whether I'm making this assumption or connection because of the fact that I've read, I don't know just, I don't know where I've read it.  But that the girl's relationship with her father is so important to how she'll see things later.  But I just keep thinking that this feeling about wanting things and thinking I can't have it, is connected with wanting something from him and the fact that because of what he is, I knew I couldn't have it.  And maybe it was wanting a sexual kind of relationship with him which, no matter what he was, I couldn't have it.  And then also, wanting some kind of warm affection from him that a father could give, which he couldn't.  And it's almost as if from that, I drew this generalization that no matter what I want, I can't have.  If I really want it.</p>

<p>Because I'd wanted, to some extent, success at school.  But in a way I didn't, or maybe I told myself I didn't, because then I got it.  Or at least I always had the feeling well, it's only second best to what I really wanted.  (Sigh, Pause) I just had the feeling then, too, that if I could let myself know what I really wanted, no matter what it was, I wouldn't have to be afraid of when I won't be working, and being home.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, after I stopped talking the next question I had was, it's fine to see how I really would be alright if I knew what I wanted, but how do I know what I want?  And I sort of had a vision of, well sometimes it's this way over vacations, but it would be worse when I weren't working at all.  And of just being home, sort of on the one hand, wondering what it is I want, and on the other hand, feeling sort of a panic that I'm not doing something.  And just sort of feeling I've got to do something.  And then, kind of going through my mind the things that I know are acceptable for women to do.  And, or I don't even kn—, if that's the criterion, I don't know how I have my little list of things.  But, and then the next thing I knew I was thinking about school.  Almost as if that were too uncomfortable to think of.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's not even a matter of when I think of feeling that way, thinking, I wonder what it is I want, as not believing there's anything I really want.  But yet, I should be doing something.  It's almost that way.  And the things that I'm aware at those times I do want, are always things that I think are wrong, because they're sort of like running away.  I might know I would like to sit and read a book, but then I'll think well, that's just because I'm afraid of anything else.  And or else I'll think it's lazy, or I don't know, I should be doing something else, and I'm not.  All those things.</p>

<p>In fact, that was the dilemma I found myself puzzling over the other night when we went out to dinner, and there were 3 other couples, the host and hostess, and then, 2 other couples, MSCZ and I.  And all the women are not working.  I know that the hostess sort of works, really part-time.  I mean, I think she just does things for a little while one place, then she leaves, or it was just a very temporary thing.  And then she gets tired of not working and then she'll do something else.  But, and I could sort of understand her position, because that's the way I imagine I might be if I didn't have children and weren't working.  And then there was another girl who does freelance artwork.  And then, it was a girl who has two children.  And she talked a lot about different books she'd been reading, and things like that.</p>

<p>And on one hand, I didn't think there was anything about it.  In fact, it sounded very attractive to me.  But on the other hand, I kept sort of, I don't know whether I was wondering how she justifies her reading, or how I would if I were her, or what.  But there was something that bothered me about the fact that she does do all that reading.  Almost as if that weren't part of what she should be doing.  And then wondering to myself well, why couldn't that be a big part of what she wants to do?  (Silence)</p>

<p>And also, it just makes me think of on different days of vacations when I have read, and I've had a book that I've enjoyed, so that I didn't want to put it down.  And if MSCZ asked me afterwards, "What did you do today?", I'll say "Oh, I just read," as if I feel guilty and that really what I'm saying is that I did nothing.  (Sniff) And whenever I start talking about my feeling about reading, even though my parents were always after us to be reading and so forth, what I think of is my mother getting upset because well, I don't know, she probably did it with all of us.  But with me, I'm thinking of now that I wasn't out playing or doing something else.  Why was I reading, sitting around reading?  (Stomach growls, Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose the reason I can't put this all in perspective is that I did use reading as an escape.  So I don't, I guess I just don't understand how it can fit in, so it isn't an escape.  And yet, you can still have time to do it.  Because I'll either read almost as an escape, or else I'll almost punish myself by, I might have something I read on the subway, but then I won't let myself look at it when I'm home.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, then I think of tonight.  And I don't know what motivated me to do what I did, really.  But uhm, when I was at the subway station near home, I was walking to go to, I was at one end of the train or, or this platform, and I wanted to get to the other, because that's where the exit is at PXM.  And just as I started to walk I met somebody that lives in the building we used to live in, who was just going to work.  And he's a very nice person, I like him.  But yet I didn't want to have to sit and talk with him the whole way.</p>

<p>And I don't know whether it was because it's very hard to hear and understand him, he's PPIN.  And uhm, he speaks BRO, but it's, you have to be able to follow it really carefully.  And once before, I met him when I was coming here and I found it very hard (Sniff) talking with him on the subway.  And I didn't know whether that was it, or whether it was because he says the same things.  And so I didn't want, I just didn't feel like it, then.  Or whether it was because I knew this was the time I allow myself to read.  And so I wanted to read.</p>

<p>But in any case, whatever it was, I was going one direction and he was in the other and he said, why, I have to go to this end of the train.  I don't know why he said it, but he said it first.  And I just said well, I have to be at the other end.  And then we stood and talked for a few minutes, but when the train came in, he went to one end and I went to the other, which he acc—, fully accepted, I mean he didn't, he just assumed I would.  But I didn't have to say I was going to the other end.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I thi—, there was, when I, when I think of it, what I think too, is the fact that he uh, I don't know what his education is, but he used to sell shoes at WBN.  And then he wanted to set up his own shoe business.  And he has, he seems to have pretty good taste.  I've seen some of the things.  But he's had trouble setting up his own business.  And, or at least, selling shoes to different stores.  And WBN changed hands, or, the shoe department did, and he had had an outlet there, which he lost.</p>

<p>And he ended up taking a job setting type at night.  And his wife works during the day, and they have a child that he takes care of during the day.  And then his wife's home at night.  And it's just a very depressing existence to me.  And I know he's very unhappy with it, and he always ta—, that's all he talks about.  But yet, looking at him, he did—, he hadn't shaved, and he was t—, it, it's the element of he doesn't know what he wants.  And he keeps talking about he might go back to PPI.</p>

<p>And there was something about that, too, I just didn't feel I could, I don't know, it was almost, stand facing this indecision of his.  Probably because I don't know, maybe I feel so close to that kind of a thing myself, or (Sniff) I'm afraid th—,  I mean, I would be very unhappy living the way he does right now.  And I don't know whether he's as unhappy as I would be, but it was just making me think of that so much when I saw him tonight too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Cough) Well, our time's up.</p>

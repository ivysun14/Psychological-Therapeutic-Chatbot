<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> I saw you [DATE], your mood was even, you had some low days, two low days, troubled sleep, you have both initial and middle insomnia meaning it’s hard to get to sleep, it’s hard to stay asleep where it’s fitful, your energy was very low, you weren’t exercising, your self esteem was good, you’re not suicidal, getting along nicely with your husband, but kind of flat and need to push yourself, you thought there was still some juice that you needed and we thought that it might be related to your sleep problems so we decided to first get you some good solid sleep and then hope that lifts your mood, correct?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And so I gave you like a million things you could try.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did anything work?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You’re not going to believe this. Okay, so I tried the Restoril.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, which sometimes worked. I had to take two.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, I told you do whatever you want.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Figure it out, make your own cocktail.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Two of the 30s?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It made me drowsy but not asleep long enough.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Two of the 30s?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well that’s industrial strength sleep disorder. 60 of Restoril didn’t knock you out?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No and how about, let me tell you the next night. I did 60 of Restoril and a half an Ambien.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I fell asleep and woke up, I fell asleep at eleven and I woke up at one-thirty with no reason to wake up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There were no babies crying.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Plus a half of a 10, so 5 mg of Ativan, I mean Ambien.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Ambien, right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I started on the Trazo-</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But no bad side effects? No groggy, nothing? Your brain just requires a sledgehammer.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It sounds like, uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. The effects of the stuff would put me to sleep for about a week. All right, so Restoril 60 plus Ambien 5 and each of them seems to work somewhat just not enough.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And sometimes maybe not.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well the time -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I tried the Trazodone too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, what dose?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, first 50 and then to 100. There was something in it that I read that maybe, is this the one that helps with headaches too?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not usually.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I don’t know why -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No that might have been Topamax or Depakote. So Trazodone didn’t touch you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It didn’t do anything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So 75, no help. Okay, what else?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that’s all, I stopped then because I was coming in so I figured they wouldn’t give me the Sonata prescription either.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because you had already gotten the other sleep medicine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The Restoril, right. So, um, so what do you suggest, the Depakote or [INAUDIBLE]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let’s talk about how you’re doing. Most nights, how long does it take to fall asleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, I can take the stuff and be awake for 2 hours.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s amazing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not easy to impress me.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I back it up until I know the kids will be asleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I take it an hour before the kids will be asleep so that maybe I can get to sleep by like a normal time like nine, ten o’clock.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you time it wrong, you might be taking care of kids while falling asleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right. I can usually tell, like the baby’s usually down and the [AGE] year olds go up and -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so it’s still hard to get to sleep. Once you do get to sleep with all this stuff.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You then only get a couple of solid hours and then you’re up.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then are you up and down the rest of the night?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. Up and down the rest of the night. I’m not getting back to sleep. You know what I’ll do, I’ll crack a little piece of Ambien and try but also the kids the last month have been on and off sick so that doesn’t help.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What’s your mood been like?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, flat definitely flat. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sad?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, no, yesterday I was cranky and sad. It had been like a week of two hours of sleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. And you still think that it’s the sleep that’s driving the mood.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you cry?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No but I was close yesterday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What happened?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Just and extra night of too little sleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you were running low.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean can you imagine, I mean really, I tell people, they don’t believe me, I’m like I’m not kidding if I tell you I get three hours of sleep a night at the most.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your appetite?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Fine, not great.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Low.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’ve lost some weight. First I thought I was gaining weight from the, uh, from the, which I have right here, Cymbalta.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I thought I was gaining weight and all of the sudden I dropped probably seven pounds in the last two weeks. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you dieting?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your self-esteem?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You don’t feel like you’re no good?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, a little bored but not no good.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is your mood at its worst in the morning? Well if you don’t answer right away it means it’s not dramatic. There’s no dramatic worsening in the morning.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you ever feel that life’s not worth living?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. I could [INAUDIBLE] with you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you able to concentrate on things?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You just spin your wheels. You just can’t get traction.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And that feels like it’s sleep related also?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, I walk to one room thinking I needed something and then forget when I get there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Any side effects from the sleep meds?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> None that I can -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Amnesia? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I would say that my memory is not the best but that could be sleep too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That could be sleep deprivation. What do you do that gives you pleasure?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Very little. Friday night dinner out without the kids.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you getting along with your husband?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So things are back in a better place, mostly because the other kids are -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Somebody else is dealing with her borderline issues, although not many psychiatrists take Medicaid we’re coming to find out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Medicaid, no one takes Medicaid.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s very difficult to find someone to take Medicare which is for disabled -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Older people, right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Older but also disabled people that are covered under Medicare but, you know, they pay far less, Medicaid pays virtually nothing, you know, for psychiatry, like $10, they pay nothing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So I don’t know anyone that takes Medicaid, and psychiatry is expensive.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why don’t you get on Medicare? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s a good question. We have a lawyer doing all of this.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She’s pretty disabled.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She’s not just poor, she’s disabled. She’s legitimately Medicare and then she could - you know, they only pay 50% on Medicare but still you get a decent, you get better doctors and better care. The best thing about Medicaid is it pays for all the meds.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Which is very good. So usually when they have both it works much better. I mean it’s a total hassle to get someone on to Medicare.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We have a lawyer.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s still a hassle.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean it’s hard to -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Doctor’s notes and -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well the doctor has to write up the case in a very, you know, negative, very disabled way but it sounds like she truly is disabled.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So no one’s getting over on anyone. She’s truly, she happens to have a father with means so it gets her by but she’s truly disabled, she can’t function so it sounds like it’s really legitimate that she try to get Medicare.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Medicare.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then she’d get better treatment. It would pay for some of the rehab that she has to go through. Has she been? Is she in now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, the program that I started to get her in, she missed the second appointment, the first appointment, you know, the intake went fine, they set her up with a psychiatrist and she blew off the appointment so they said, sorry we have other patients.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Was she using when she blew it off?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. She just denies using anything other than I know she drinks.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So why did she blow off the appointment?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, she was stuck in [INAUDIBLE] or something like that, or it’s cold out or you name the reason.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s also another good reason to pay a psychiatrist. Often people when they’re paying more for a treatment, they value it more.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right but she doesn’t have any money. That’s exactly right. I mean if we could say, by the way, we’re cutting down your allowance to pay for half, then - well, I mean I told him he’s got to start cutting back her money now because that’s what our guy out of [DEIDENTIFIED] said, like take away certain things that are not going to be significant. Take, you know, maybe the computer away for a week if she doesn’t go to an appointment, you know, try and take away the benefits. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What I would suggest, your plate is so full without dealing with her.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, not deal.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you don’t need this.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We get her once a weekend and that’s it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that’s it. You know, if she’s going to be spoiled by her dad or whatever, I mean as long as there’s enough money for you and the family, stay away.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, this is not good for your mental health. They’ll be a time when we get you tightened up, then you’ll be able to be totally involved, now it’s -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have to back off, you’re right because it makes me pissed at him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and you know substance users are impossible. They’re impossible and that’s not talking about her personality and other problems.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But it’s going to drive you nuts.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you’re not, you’re not ready. Okay, so your mood disorder has been much worse in the past.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I think we can both agree that the Cymbalta is probably keeping your head above water.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> On mood and if we could just get you sleeping soundly, the flatness and the other little stuff will go away.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now there’s a big big gun we could use eventually that we won’t use unless we have to. You know, at some point, did you ever consider getting a sleep work up?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, just about three weeks, right after I was here, I started thinking, I wonder if I should do that because this, you know, this Restoril and my pharmacist said this is like pretty strong stuff.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not, it’s just Valium. It’s the Valium class of medicine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, okay. She was like, it’s not working -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But, you know, they look at it that way because we don’t use it as much anymore but did you ever hear of a Mickey Finn like in the old movies where they, the woman would put some stuff -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it’s Chlorohydrate. Actually really good strong stuff for sleep but I hate prescribing it to families when there are little kids there.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because it’s me that’s in charge so -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well no it’s not even that, it’s that if they get in - all these other things wouldn’t kill them if they took it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If they took it the Chlorohydrate would.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I was meaning that I can wake up on the first -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right you’re a mother, mothers are that way, yet we’ll slide you with whatever, you’ll get up.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But I worry about the chance. Can you lock away your medicine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I have it up in a bag in my closet but -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How big are the kids?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I actually have a safe in the bedroom.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh you do.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, twin [AGE] year olds and a [AGE] year old. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The [AGE] year old is not getting it.And the [AGE] year olds, they’re curious, they poke around?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They poke around. They poke around.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, maybe we won’t go there yet. You know, we’ve got to give you a sledgehammer. We’ve got to knock you out. Now if the Restoril works some, it’s really safe medicine, we could just keep increasing the dose until we, there’s no great reason to use it with Ambien.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The fact that you used the Ambien just means you need more Restoril.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because they probably work on the same types of receptors in your brain.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So there’s no shame in just increasing the dose.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because you said 30 to 90 and I didn’t remember it was 30 to 90 so I only did two.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is there any chance you could be revving up at night. Do you find that you lay there and your thoughts are racing very fast and -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I would say that it never shuts off. You know, like I’m just kind of thinking, not totally racing, I just can lay there and never fall asleep. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you talk too much?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don’t think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You don’t talk past the point?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Has your mood been oddly irritable or even high sometimes, at night? Get into kind of a mood state where, you know, short tempered?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, it’s the same.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re the same. You’re not especially anxious at night?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get headaches?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How bad?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was diagnosed with migraines back in college. I went to, who knows, it was an ear, nose, and throat guy. I thought I had a sinus headache and he said based on my symptoms it’s my [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have auras before your headaches? Do you know what an aura is?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. I think it’s also from sleep because I wake up with them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do they wake you up from sleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. And actually I was taking Fioricet which worked pretty good but I know it’s got like some kind of narcotic.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, you don’t want to stop it fast. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I don’t have anymore of that so Excedrin works great but I’ve had two ulcers so I take one Excedrin, it will help but I could also end up with a major stomach problem.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s dangerous. When did you stop the Fioricet?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My doctor stopped, didn’t want to give it to me, probably about two months ago because he said how many headaches do you get and I said, I mean, three times a week.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B>  Were you taking it at night?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, hm-umm, no, I would say always in the morning and I think I would only need one a day so when he got, I didn’t know that there was any narcotic effect to it, I thought it was just, you know, caffeine and what’s in all the other things so he said I’m reluctant to give you a prescription for it because it’s got narcotic, maybe Ultracet or something, I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You had the sleep problem before all this, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, I had the sleep problem.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’ve always had the sleep problem. Because some people, not even thinking about it, stopping Fioricet, you can get a rebound sleep problem. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was taking, you know, if I had one bottle it could last for a long time or I’d have a bad month and, you know, I mean like I wasn’t taking it that much.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The reason I’m asking about headaches is, you’re right, a couple of these medicines are used for headaches and they work really nicely. Headaches are funny, especially migraines but all kinds of headaches, they’re like, it’s a neurologic process that is dysregulated in some way and almost like seizures are also and it turns out that if you use an antiseizure medicine, an anticonvulsant, it also prevents headaches.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh that’s one of these, right? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> One of those, right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The Gabitril.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Correct and also there’s Topamax also. There are a few that are now indicated for headaches because something about tamping down neurologic processes, that’s what these meds do, all of them, they just like, it’s like if the brain is kindling, you know that kindling wood when you’re building a fire, it easily propagates discharge, anticonvulsants just tamp it down a little bit.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I wonder if that’s the mechanism we should go for now. We definitely - and the Restoril does it too. That class of medicine does it too but these medicines do it much much better. Anticonvulsants do it much better. I think we should have a number of guns now for the sleep. First we increase the Restoril.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Forget the Ambien for now. I mean use it like escape the way you do now, you just haven’t taken enough, you can use it for escape but if you use the Ambien it means we failed on the first medicine and so it means we have to increase the dose.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Increase the Restoril. I’d like you to have some Chlorohydrate. I’ll write all this down. I’d like you to have some Chlorohydrate. It’s a big big gun and don’t dare let the kids near it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll put it in the safe.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, put it in the safe but there’s a night, especially if the kids aren’t around, if you get a weekend with your husband or something and you just want to really make sure you get a good night’s sleep, that’s your rocket fuel. I mean that’s the stuff that will, you know, knock you out. There is actually even higher level stuff. That’s why I mentioned the sleep study. There’s a medicine. You know that GHB. Did you ever hear of GHB, it’s the date rape drug.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it’s available from one pharmacy in the whole country. It’s highly, highly regulated. I’d rather not write for it. It’s a total hassle but for some people with these odd sleep disorders, it gives them restful sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, really restful sleep. It works specifically on getting you good restful sleep. It’s indicated for cataplexy, you know, people with narcolepsy have these drop attacks, it’s an odd indication but I’ve used it and it does work for people who we just can’t get them into restful sleep. Now it’s a total hassle because people, this is the one where you won’t wake up for the kids.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You walk into things. I had one lady, she came in with black eyes, you know, not good, really end of the line but at least it’s out there for you if all else fails there’s this medicine that will truly knock you out. Normally I wouldn’t give it without a sleep study and I wonder now about, you’ve always had sleep problems your whole life?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Since [DEIDENTIFIED] school and my father died which was a year apart, ‘92/’93.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But your sleep problems are really not in sync with your mood problems. I mean they cause your mood problems now but many people with depression -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have no depression.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No depression and a real sleeping disorder.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The babies - and his daughter got pregnant and had a baby a month later. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does he sleep well, you husband?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He could fall asleep here while we’re talking. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He’s never awake looking at your sleep? That’s never ever happened?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Never because if the kids wake up I have to deal with them and he can’t [INAUDIBLE]. He’s [AGE], [AGE] almost. He’s got to run a - he runs a big [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So no one observes you sleeping?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hm-umm. I would say I don’t move around a lot, I can tell you that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, you don’t have restless legs?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hm-umm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You don’t feel internal agitation? It’s all up here?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All the agitation is all spinning. But the Restoril should slow that down.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Even if you’re not falling asleep, it should slow down.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, all of, exactly, I don’t feel like I’m spinning as much as I am just waiting for it to happen and it’s not happening.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. You can’t obsess on sleeping. People with sleep disorders - the worst is wanting to sleep so badly.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Watching the clock.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, no, you’ve got to read a book. I mean there are some sleep hygienes, have you ever done sleep hygiene.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you’re supposed to stay out of the bedroom during the day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] all that stuff. So you really shouldn’t be in bed waiting to sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You should drag yourself to bed when you’re about to go to sleep. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Should I try any of the Depakote or Gabitril.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well we will, that’s next on the list.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I never tried it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is it more pleasant for you, the Restoril, or just calming down that revved-up raciness?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Even if you’re not sleeping, it’s more comfortable to be calmed down.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And we can even do more of that and maybe that will calm you so much that you’ll get into a deep sleep. The sleep studies would look for things like sleep apnea. Have you ever heard of sleep apnea?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don’t have that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sure?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t make any noise, I don’t move and I make no noise.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does anyone in your family have sleep disorders?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, no, not that I’ve heard.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No one. Everyone else sleeps fine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Even my sister with the autistic son, go figure.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You don’t have any hormonal problems we need to worry about.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I mean I did fertility with the kids but all my hormones and everything were fine when I was tested so -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have sweats at home?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Occasionally. [NAME OTHER] said with the Cymbalta she had that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it’s a side effect.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t had it in a while.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I hope this isn’t about hormonal-related sweats. Nothing seems obvious. It sounds - and that’s how it is when someone has a primary sleep disorder. You really do have a primary, meaning not caused by anything else but existing in and of itself. You have a sleep disorder.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You just, you know, your brain doesn’t shut down easily or well and it runs with mood disorders but parallel it’s not yolked to it the way it is with most people -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> More than ten years I had no problems.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Mood wise but [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Then the sleep disorder, right. And actually the hope is that the mood disorder is a result from the sleep disorder and once we get your sleep disorder doing well, your moods will get into better control too. One other way I sometimes go after this is by juicing up the daytimes, giving you lots of energy during the day so that you’re burnt out by night and can fall asleep. I don’t think that’s going to work with you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I started drinking a little Coke in the afternoon after I talked to you, you’re like maybe you need a little like something in your [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does it help?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, oh yeah, I’m very sensitive to caffeine so but I won’t drink it fast.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, did we talk about Provigil once also?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hm-umm. It doesn’t sound familiar.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’d rather not go there yet but if we have to we’ll give you a stimulant during the day even though we know you’re tired because you’re not sleeping, we know that, we’re not mixing that but if we can give you so much energy that you’re dead tired by the end of the day maybe that would do it, maybe, are you exercising?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I have three babies. Exercise, I don’t leave my house.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well you’re running around with the kids.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, I think we just have to do it the way we talked about it. So item one, I’m going to give you more room. Because Restoril is in and out, it’s really not something that’s with you all day long. You should not have daytime amnesia or daytime cognitive problems.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, I didn’t find that at all when I get up, I don’t find [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. And even more importantly, when we put you high on these types of medicines we worry very much about taking you off, if you lose the prescription, if you miss a dose, anything like that, that shouldn’t matter much because you’re on and off it every day, you’re not chronically on it where you’re dependent or have tolerance. The problem that will happen though, if it works, let’s say 90 or 120 or even more, if it works, if you don’t take it you definitely will not sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You understand that, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Almost making you dependent on it to sleep but let’s worry about that after we get you sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, let’s hope we have the luxury to worry about that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, so first is Restoril and I’ll say 60 to, you have them in 30s right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Take five of them would be the most, okay? So between 60 and 150 and let’s hope that that’s all that it takes. Just increasing and, you know, maybe your liver, you have an odd liver that really is good at chewing it up.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you just need more to get the effect.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Can you imagine waking up two hours later wide awake.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It blows me away.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I don’t know.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But the liver [INAUDIBLE], crazy person.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, your brain is your brain and it, you know, it’s good in a lot of ways too right? It makes you charming, you’ve got a little bit of -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I made a smart [DEIDENTIFIED] once. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m sure. So, whatever, you’re stuck with the sleep disorder. Number two, and you know you can use, I’ll write plus minus on the Ambien and with the plus minus I’ll let you do 10 to 20. Number three, if those don’t work, and I’ll say you can do it in addition, although it would be nice to try it clean -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Would be Chlorohydrate and it will be 500 mg up to 1500 mg. Start with 500 then work your way up. And four, and I think we should just start it, is get an anticonvulsant on board at night. They are very mild. There are virtually no side effects and they just tamp things down.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s one of those.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so we’ll do the Depakote.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, I think I have some of that at home.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Depakote and anywhere from 250 to 1000 mg and I think this should be on board in addition to anything else you do.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And so if you want to settle down at a stable dose, it would be let’s say 500 mg and that will slow down the racing, it will just tamp the system down a little bit. Things we’re going to think about, we’re going to consider, and you can look it up on line and learn a little bit about it is GHB, just look it up, and a sleep study.Now a sleep study, even though it’s mostly for people with sleep apnea -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My husband did an actual -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did he?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He’s got sleep apnea.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you’ve seen him sleep where he wakes up and can’t catch his breath?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He was a few - an hour less than having the surgery.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He did it two years ago.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well they do, they put the pulse oximeter on and look at the oxygenation and look at the whole thing but they also, the nice thing for us is they look at EEG, they look at brain waves at the different stages of sleep. You should also learn about sleep. I mean you’ve got this so in your free moments.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well you know I’ve read about it because of the kids. I’ve read about it like when they wake up in the night it’s a cycle of -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, exactly and so there are different stages of sleep and I think that you’re really missing out on the restorative sleep, the stuff that makes you feel refreshed and gives you good energy and juice the next day. You’re not getting that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right because I’m not getting, if I wake up I’m not getting back to sleep too.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not getting it so we have to find a way to get you into that and if we can’t figure this out, a sleep study is probably the next place to go and also those docs they do sleep all day every day and so they can think about it. I mean they end up giving the same drug, you know, they’re probably not even as aggressive as what we’re doing but at least it would be someone else thinking about it, looking at the stage, specifically which stages of sleep you’re getting.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Do they give you anything to try and get to sleep?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, not at all.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Then I’ll be do do do do -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that’s right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But that’s okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But we want data, we want to document. Did you ever try Remeron? Those guys like Remeron. I’ll put it down on the things we can consider. It’s another antidepressant that’s a bit sedating but the - I mean and I would want their input before putting you on this super duper date rape drug because, you know -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> For the obvious reasons.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Let me see. So I’ll write you a very big prescription for Restoril, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Now what will they do as far as [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well the nice thing about Restoril is it’s generic, you know, they usually don’t give us a problem with generics even with I give it because it’s very light.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s different than sleep medicine really so they shouldn’t -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No Restoril is, oh you mean if your insurance would count it as a sleep medicine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I don’t know. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I don’t care. I would pay for the stuff but will the pharmacy give me trouble because -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, no if you pay for it, it’s only about -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, no one cares about - I mean that’s between me and the government essentially.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If it’s beyond accepted. I mean, you know, you’re already beyond standard -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> When I brought in the Restoril, the Ambien, the Sonata, she wouldn’t fill them. She said -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, then let her call me. I can put you on everything at once, it’s none of her business. She’s a good pharmacist to be concerned but let her call me and I’ll tell her I’m aware of what you’re taking. The bigger issue, I mean the insurance issue, insurance companies have decided that this is a way that they can -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Control.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah control, you know, we don’t want you to go on two things for sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Even though it’s not legitimate, because we put people on two things for depression all the time, they don’t give us </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m looking up - single daily dose should not exceed 2 g.All right, so I’ll write, you’re taking four a day but don’t take - so, I’ll write the maximum dose but - I hope we’ll be able to knock you out with it. Now you can try this right away because it is so much stronger than all the others and, you know, maybe it will be our magic.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you won’t even need the Restoril. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> This is a different class medicine than the Restoril. The Restoril is Valium type medicine so it really contains anxiety, the nighttime anxiety that a lot of people have, so I think you’ll probably want Restoril anyway but you may not need it. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My husband let me, he’s like, I don’t want you taking this. He just thinks it’s Ambien. I don’t want you taking these medications. I’m like, you know, because you can sleep. It’s very easy for someone to say -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Does he know that you don’t sleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he knows. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He should be saying I want you taking more medicine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I don’t like that you’re taking all these drugs, it’s no good for your liver and your kidneys and blah, blah, blah. I’m like, yeah, he missed two nights of sleep with the kids, just went they were sick or whatever and he was miserable complaining all day and I said that’s how my life is.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um, you’re not having any more kids, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I got my tubes tied.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. That’s the best intervention. Because they’re going to get older, they’ll be, you know, things will, you know -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. Already the boys are sleeping through the night, thank the Lord and the baby wakes up maybe once by midnight which is all right. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so your pharmacist will probably call me about the Chlorohydrate and if not that will probably call me about this Restoril. You’re running out of Restoril?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I just had her mail, uh, mail me one so I have one.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So now that we’re increasing the dose -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’ll write, did it come in 60s? Let’s see. They come in - 30s is the biggest, all right. So I’ll write that you’re taking, should I write for five a day, let me write for four just so they don’t go nuts. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There’s the sleepers and the non-sleepers and the sleepers don’t understand. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well I’m a sleeper but I, you know -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Does your wife sleep?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah we sleep fine. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it’s funny I find most women don’t sleep well. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah my husband’s friend’s wives, they all say they have sleep problems.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Hormonal. My wife is certainly very easy to wake up but she gets right back to sleep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, I think the female hormones make women probably more superficial sleepers.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, with age menopause hormones.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m looking forward to them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s gonna be -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What do you do for that? The same kind of juggling of -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What usually works is just giving them replacement, giving them some estrogen, even though it’s a bit controversial now, it’s become clear that in the time right around menopause it’s fine to take hormones.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really medically it’s fine. So, a lot of women were really suffering horribly when, you know, a couple of years ago everyone said no more hormones.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, one of my friends had uterine cancer, she took the hormones.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She got uterine cancer and it spread. She just died in October, five years - six years later. It went to her lungs and esophagus.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> From hormones?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s what she thinks but you know what happened, she was bleeding and waited, you know, four months to call her doctor. So it had spread when they did the -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It was spreading, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it had already hit a lymph node. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You have Depakote?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, let me see, I have to look at my little list. I have some samples that you gave me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really. Usually I don’t have samples. All right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It could be Gabitril. I don’t remember, though.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s probably Gabitril. Let me write for the Depakote. Depakote is the one I want you just on, just stay on it. I’ll write for 500 mg, just take one or two at night but pick one.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> One and then -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Try one and then if you want, you’ll feel almost, this will last round the clock too, it will be just a more stabilizing feeling.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If you want more of that you can take a second.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But as a base I want at least one on board. Some people get a little bit of nausea. Most people don’t, maybe 10 or 15% of people do. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So let’s hope you don’t and you take it right at night before going to sleep or hopeful sleep. All right, so the prescriptions, Restoril, Chlorohydrate, and Depakote. Okay. Do you need more Ambien or -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think, you know what, I need a new one of Ambien because the one you gave me was dated [DATE] and I had a refill from a prior one so they wouldn’t -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Do you have Ambien at home now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Let’s not give it to you. Let’s hope that you’ll be off it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Let’s hold it. This should be enough to get you off and then, you know, Ambien, some people have that eating at night from Ambien and you don’t get that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know what I get, I definitely lose sight of memories, you know, like you can do things dumb -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well all of these things will do that to your memory, especially for the time after you take it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not longer term.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> When are they at their peak, like usually an hour to an hour and a half?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You can guess when it hits.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Walk into things. All right, so severe disabling insomnia, try Chlorohydrate. Again be careful where you keep the Chlorohydrate, it’s lethal.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, and literally in a safe.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Chlorohydrate, high dose. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We have a safe in the bedroom that’s mounted to a big closet. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> If there’s any problem at all, please give me a call, okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. I’ll have the pharmacist call if she gives me any -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well tell her I would like her to call me just to preempt it because she’s going to think about it and feel odd about it. Let her call me.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’ll explain what we’re doing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you so much.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, take care. See you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> See you soon.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, about two months. You can come sooner but, you know -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> To get an idea of what’s working.</P>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had an odd slip. I don't know if it goes anywhere, but I went to bed last night, and I said I should be out for a 7:45 appointment. And I woke up at 6:00. (pause) And I had forgotten about it, I guess, that I needed to wake up at 6:00. Went back to bed. Jennie (ph) was just getting up shortly afterwards, and she asked me when I wanted to be woken up. I said 7:30. I'm not quite sure what to think. [00:1:00]</p>

<p>(pause) And things have been moving on the New York end quite a bit. And I guess that's why, right now, I'm kind of feeling less acute distress. I'd imagine, I'm no more productive; I'm not (pause). Same thing going into work, and nothing. (pause) Not even kind of able to sort of assess what needs to be done. It's like I can't even open the envelope. (sigh) Which is characteristic of all of this. (pause) [00:2:37]</p>

<p>I guess one conclusion I might draw is that the distress is kind of phenomenal; the real feeling of pain and anguish, at some level, is an add-on. (pause) Or at least, they complement each other, but they're not causally related. Somehow not being able to open the envelope is a problem in its own right. At least at this stage. (pause) [00:2:25]</p>

<p>You know, one of the things I'm trying to figure out is how to avoid having a lie on my resume that's under –I could finesse it so that it's over a year, but there were a lot of them that would just last for about a year. We'll see if that can be pulled off at this stage. I'll try. I haven't, unusually, maybe uniquely, I really haven't burned any bridges. I haven't said "X." But at the same time, you know (pause). [00:4:07]</p>

<p>And it's interesting, I guess. You know, I'm doing my best, given the last few months, to do it in an orderly fashion, and the way that I would have hoped that I would do it previously. But you know, so I guess I'm reflecting on all of the other (pause) the other episodes. (pause) So slightly better transition. (pause) Slightly better transition. (sigh) [00:5:07]</p>

<p>(pause) At least there's no—you know, at least I'm not leaving first and then kind of a panic, trying to set up an alternative gig.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another phrase that occurred to me was leaving first, asking questions later. Leaving first, asking questions later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, we've been asking questions all along, I guess. (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 5:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was worrying about that too. [00:6:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 6:01] Anticipating that one I'm sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think what came immediately to mind was our conversation about dropping things in your lap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I forgot what I was going to talk about. It's not optimal to have five days in between Friday and Wednesday, I think. In theory, not to carry over makes it a little harder. (pause) What did we talk about on Friday? (pause) I remember not long ago, at some point (pause). [00:7:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 7:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. One thing that comes to mind is I feel very... (pause) cautious is probably too much of an understatement. (pause) Jaded, maybe. About my facility (PH) with or love for or tendency to grasp for explanatory narrative frameworks. So when you ask me what comes to mind, oftentimes what I'll reach for is something that would lead in that direction. And I have a countervailing impulse just to shut up and look for something else. But I guess I discover that—it's kind of hard to talk about it, actually. (laughs) I think you're trying to avoid—in this setting, anyway, I think you're trying to avoid any explanation at all. [00:9:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we can go with explanatory [speaker interrupted].</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. I'm just. In the mind, [speaker interrupted].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, absolutely, that was good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. Especially explanation that involve my family. That always seems like a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I guess ultimately, kind of what I'm trying to explain, maybe something firmer to hold onto, is why I don't feel a tangible sense of what I ought to be doing, or what I would like to be doing, or what I need or would be, you know, assumed even, to be doing when I go into work. I just don't have a tangible sense of it. I'm sure it's there. But to the extent that I do have a tangible sense of it, I'm almost unable to kind of run after it. You know, that's kind of what I would like to know. I think that ultimately, everything else would fall into place if I had that. I don't really know how to think about it. (pause) [00:10:16]</p>

<p>I mean, I guess one possibility is just that I've left, that I don't see the kind of incentive structure that normally pertains to the process of producing things in the world. That's not a very flattering model, I guess. I would prefer another one. (chuckles) But I think that's the issue at hand, I guess. Or at least in the most immediate sense, maybe you know, on a clinical level there are other things that when I talk about, but from my perspective at least, that's kind of what I would like to focus on. [00:11:02] (sigh) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause). I imagine there's something similar between the distance you feel from your work at work, and I think some mostly unconscious like feeling of distance or like not quite maintaining a connection with what we've been talking about here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good point. That's true. That's clearly the case. Or at least we hope. (laughs) (pause) OK, so we'll run with that. Let's run with that. (pause) No, I think that's really true. And I'm grasping for it not only because it sounds plausible to me and has a kind of truthful ring, but also because it is more appealing than the idea that I've just made some calculation that my interests lie elsewhere. (pause) [00:12:50]</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean I guess I feel judgmental, at some level, when I can't call this—call what I'm to do to mind. Yeah, one thing that doesn't seem parallel, although it might be, is that... (pause) the judgment, at work, the judgment is really displaced onto the people around me. You know, the constant barrage of sort of—how to describe it, cognitive noise about—a voice by anybody who passes by, about what I ought to be doing and why am I not doing it. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas in this case, in this case, for reasons that are probably interesting and significant, although maybe the outcome is a little bit similar, parallel, to the extent that there's judgment, I feel completely responsible for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like how at work, it turns out that everybody walking by is thinking something critical about how you're not getting things done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whereas here, it's much more you who's [speaker interrupted].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel—you know, I don't feel a sense of—maybe this is just because in here at least, ultimately I will pay, my insurance is paying me, at the very least (laughing) to be not judgmental. I don't know, I don't want to devalue our rapport, because at some level, it's structurally different. So that probably makes a big difference. [00:15:09] </p>

<p>And I guess the other important and quite salient thing is that you know, every time I walk in (laughing) we talk about this stuff, and I'm kind of able to, on a moment to moment basis, get a debrief. And once I get a debrief from the people around me, I'm fine. I don't feel that sense of judgment, externally anyway, which is the really painful thing.</p>

<p>When I'm judging myself, it's bad and probably counterproductive, but the sense of just kind of anguish isn't there. It's the anguish that's under directed, and I think the anguish comes about because for whatever reason, usually social one way or another (laughs), there's a lag in my anxiety, that there's a correlation between what I'm judging and what other people are judging, and my ability to sort of debrief them on that. [00:16:14]</p>

<p>(pause) And I guess on the other hand, I don't ask you—I mean, you know, it's not like I need to, to get the lay of the land on this, particularly often. That would be very neurotic. Apparently (PH) quite neurotic. (laughs) (pause) [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am... (pause) I wonder if it's at all to do with time being arranged differently? Like maybe you do kind of, in the background, struggle a little more with that when you're not here, but when you're actually here and we're talking, it's much easier. I guess what I'm thinking of is your comment about feeling the five-day gap and what happened this morning. By contrast, you're feeling much easier in this way when you're here. [00:18:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I imagine this is part of the (pause)—you don't really serve very much as an interject in the way that everybody around me at work seems to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, whatever the character of our rapport, we seem to have dispensed with that. Typically, Jennie (PH) doesn't either. You know, in other words, there's something about the way that I form relationships with people that, for a very few people in my life, allows me to dispense with that. [00:19:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean by interject? I mean, I have something in mind with that word, but it's [speaker interrupted].</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess—OK, so a kind of avatar of whatever I'm feeling in a given situation, in a given interaction. In other words, when I'm feeling some emotion, some anxiety, some sense, that I allow them to mouth (PH) it. And this is a thought that comes to mind; I don't know how much credence to give it, but I have failed partly I guess, vaguely, for cash flow reasons. But even when my cash flow was fine, I didn't fill my glasses prescription. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>And what it means is that, you know, my ability to recognize faces is significantly impaired. And the thought has come to me at the time that one of the implications of not being able to see very well at a distance is that it's easier for people to serve as this kind of generic, just, person who—the better to serve this function, in my own kind of psychodrama. I mean, that's, that's a (pause), that's not a very nice thought. That's not a very flattering hypothesis. But there's some truth to it.</p>

<p>I mean, I do have this tendency to do this. And I think it's certainly a very prominent—you know, when I would review my day yesterday or Friday or whatever, it's certainly very prominent in my experience. You know, just this sense of judgment coming from everybody that passes by. (pause) [00:21:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are their judgments?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you know, "you're not working," or "you're engaging in all these time-wasting behaviors," "you're not productive," or like "what are you here for anyway?" Or you know, like—I don't know (pause); "you're disheveled," or "why are you here anyway?" All kinds of [inaudible 22:00], so that's (pause). [00:22:03]</p>

<p>Again, I mean I think those are kind of phenomenal in the sense that (pause) you know, the (pause) the inability to kind of open the envelope. It seems separate from them in some sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this (pause)...You know, one image that comes to my mind is of like a child playing with puppets. [00:23:05] </p>

<p>CLIENT: (brief laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you—go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, finish the thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I wonder if you feel alienated and disconnected. That this is part of how you animate the people around you at work. Like, you still don't feel in it with them. And you feel so alienated from where you work and what you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I don't know about the puppets, but I'm not quite sure. Tell me your thought about my relationship between those [speaker interrupted]. [00:24:02] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I saw this like—you know, you're a kid in a playroom and you've got these lifeless things in front of you, these things that aren't animated and that you—they're objects, you feel kind of alienated from them. So you bring them to life to have somebody to interact with, or to play with. I mean, it's not a very fun game you're playing with them, that way, but.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha. Definitely alienated. There's no question about that. I might as well be working completely by myself in a Starbucks or something, for all of the interaction that I engage in over the course of a day. And that's very troubling to me, because fundamentally I'm actually a very social person. I mean, I really—I don't know, I think; you can do your own evaluation, but my sense is that I'm genuinely engaged and enjoy being with people, and I'm really as skilled at kind of promoting those kinds of relationships as anybody else. But there's no question whatsoever that I'm very alienated. [00:25:37]</p>

<p>And the truth is, you know, that (pause)—I mean, I've been alienated since even before this thing with Phil, you know, in some sense. Ultimately, if you think back to the summer, the talk that I was supposed to give on our program, where I just couldn't focus on it. It was a symptom of alienation. You know, I didn't feel a part of it; I didn't feel as if it was real; I felt there was a kind of unreality about the role that I was supposed to play, that made—it was probably clearly implicated at some level in what I did with it, which was very little. So there I was, in a room full of people, in front of a room full of people, and you know, at some level I didn't have much to say. And it didn't go very well at all. I couldn't see myself with them, like I didn't see a future for myself with them. (pause) [00:27:00]</p>

<p>And that was well before I found myself—that was kind of the first symptom of my feeling unable to work, I guess, at some level. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's the same alienation you feel from your work—you know, from the envelope in front of you that you can't open. (pause) And I think at times, from me and from this process when you're not here, especially.[00:28:06] </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Well (pause). Maybe. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or other (PH) things we said, or that might be it together. Maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm not going to have perfect recall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I have very good recall. Excellent recall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. I don't think this is about the quality of your memory or your capacities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. (pause) Maybe. That would be convenient, if it were the same. (pause) I mean, I guess the difference is that I genuinely feel alienated from work for reasons that I don't totally understand, but I suspect probably has to do with my sense of injury over this whole business over the spring. I'm guessing. I'm assuming. You know, compounded by— [00:29:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The stuff with Phil.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the stuff with Phil, the stuff with the appointment, etc., etc. And here, I don't feel a sense—I mean, if anything I've injured you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well— (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I'm going to make it right, you know, but quite a bit later than we had initially said.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well I was going to say (pause); I think you forget, you've had times here you felt quite injured.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Injured. Like affronted by you. Yeah, I get annoyed when you're late sometimes, but I can't remember feeling injured in that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess I'm thinking of times where (pause) you don't put it in terms of my being ill-intentioned or anything, but at moments when you're in a lot of distress and feel like you haven't gotten—I remember even in the last couple of months, you sort of haven't felt you've gotten anything from this. You've worked hard, you've done your part, you've come in. You've been on time, you've paid, if late. You worked. And you know, you're no better off at that moment than you ever were. And you don't remember our—yeah. [00:31:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, you're right. You're right. I have nursed a sense of injury at moments. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess I'm also struck that that's something that in this moment, you forget.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean, you know (pause). In the hypothetical model, in this other setting, is that the feeling of alienation is—it sort of coincides with the sense of injury. If it were to persist long after the injury, or sense of injury, had dissipated, then that would be something else again. I would have a more difficult time understanding a feeling of alienation that lasted long after I no longer felt injured, or I had resolved my sense of injury, or we had buried the hatchet or what have you. [00:32:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's plausible to me, I just have a more difficult time understanding that. It doesn't sound like something I would be incapable of doing. (laughs) [inaudible 32:34], certainly. [inaudible 32:35] But I don't see it. I have a hard time seeing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, those aren't the lines along which I'm thinking either, so much as (pause) In terms of the way the alienation actually functions protectively. Like, the queen break functions to sort of distance you from the pain of the injury. We have to stop. [00:33:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have to stop. OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll have more on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. We will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. </p>

<p>[Collating sound, sound of someone sitting down]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is hot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:00:13]</p>

<p>[Sound of door shutting out noise]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for not cranking the heat. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] It is warmer today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, man. Whew [exhales], how's it going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I'm exhausted...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...In a good way, though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I've got 24 hours left on Kickstarter...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And we only need about 400 bucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm, wow! </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Without your—recording (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I [didn't ask for a miracle] (ph). That's just—I mean, my mom put in the thousand. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's—I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...A thousand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's it, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not 2500. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm, wooowww! [00:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm really fucking psyched. Yeah. Um, yeah, so I think that's why, like, today—well, also because I've—yesterday, we practiced for hours, and, like, I just—I feel tired, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I think, now, I'm kind of starting to decompress. You know, like to just enjoy the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Exhale. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has been a stressful month. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Fuck me. Fuck. This is not—I'm not doing this again. I mean, maybe I'll do it again. I mean, I guess it would be easier next time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Once you become known more, then, of course, it is easier to raise money. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah, I'm just, like, wow. Um, and it was really sweet. Like, my friend Mike, who got married—like, some people raise their pledge. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. He did, or you mean...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I got—after practice la—what's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean people from the... </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he and his wife, yeah. They... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He—oh... [00:02:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They texted me. They're on their honeymoon, and they texted me. We were—it was perfect, too; we had just finished practice and were at my friends'. My friend the guitar player's brother has a bar, so a nice little, cozy little bar, so it is—we go there, usually after practice, it is so close. And so he texted me while we were all in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was just very sweet, yeah. So that's cool. And then two friends of mine, without me saying anything, they had called me, and they're like, "Dude, just let me know, and I'll just—I'll..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."I can take care of the rest, and just, you know, we'll figure it out."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clucks] Aww...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, very nice. Yeah, yeah, so it is cool. I'm psyched. [Sighs] Yeah, [sighs with relief]—[pauses] Um, [pauses] yeah, it is like, "Wow." That's like, "OK, now we have to do it, like now." [Chuckles] [00:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it is going to be awesome to have it actually out, and I get to hold it in my hands. And, you know, I'm really psyched. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So... [pauses] But, yeah, I think between all that and then, like—I just—I haven't been—I really haven't been staying home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's been stuff going on all the time, I feel like. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think my immune system's a little—and people've been—I can already—people are already, like, sneezing and wheezing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: A few of my friends were really sick last week, so I'm just—I think I'm just going to relax and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Sleep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't been sleeping at home. Where have you been sleeping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I mean it is like—no, I've been sleeping at home, but, like, I've been out—like, I haven't had like a night where I just go home at like five or six... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:03:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I just kind of get all comfy and crank up the Netflix, and just chill and zone out, and—yeah, so I need to [inaudible at 00:04:09].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's naptime. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, 'cause I've—at home, I've been hopping on Twitter, and fucking Facebook, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Just thinking. You know, staying up 24—but 48 hours making videos. You know, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... [Sniffles] [Pauses for 20 seconds] [Sounds of yawning and stretching]—oh, man. [Pauses for 16 seconds] [00:05:00]</p>

<p>We had a good practice last night, too. At first, I thought we sounded rusty. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I realized we were just like kind of just—we were—I think we're all so comfortable now, we're gelling more and more and more, that we're just letting loose more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I was singing much more. The drummer was, like, saying, "Dude, you're really kind of projecting a lot more." And I was, like, "I mean, you have a great voice, but you're—it is like you're kind of losing yourself more in vocals and just—you know."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, everybody was trying—like, it was kind of a little messy but in a good way. You know? It was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a nice pull (ph). And we all noticed it, which was great, so it was cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] So that—that was good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes a little more freedom to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, especially like, you know, for example, Stu, the guitar player—he is so good, but he is definitely a little bit like, you know... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:05:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and now I notice he, like, moves around more; he's just having fun. Like, he'll do what he normally does, but then he'll add a little—he'll try something and just—yeah, we're just having fun with it. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, that feels good. [Sniffles] [Yawns] Excuse me. Jesus. Um, I do have an issue, though, with this chick in—that girl from the wedding or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah, almost 18 year-old. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's not almost 18; she's almost 17. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought she had said she was almost 18, but thank God I found out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um—[pauses] yeah, I don't know what—I don't know what's happening. Like, I don't [chuckles]—I feel good—like, things are so, like, weird right now. I'm like, "All right, everything is great."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:06:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, [knock on something] (ph). Um, and I'm like, "Who is this with? How did this happen? What does this girl want from me?" You know? And she's, like, totally—she's not being—you know, she did start sending a couple of kind of dirty texts, kind of, but she's just very nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, she's very sweet, and she's [pauses]—you know, but I'm like, "What did—the fuck? What? I don't—I -"—you know, I mean, I'm not—clearly, I'm not a prude. I mean, if someone is of legal age, then whatever, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, [pauses]—yeah, so...[pauses] [shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The part of you that says, "What the fuck?" Well, you're trying to understand what's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just like, "What's going on?" Like, because—because it is—I mean, I'm sorry, it is hot. I mean, she's a beautiful girl, and she's very, like, mature for—she's very smart and mature, and, you know—and clearly knows things. She's not some, like, little innocent whatever. [00:08:01]</p>

<p>But it is just like every—like, I've got a shitload of dates all of the sudden with pretty, cool chicks. And—oh, last night, I did an amazing, like, one-hour date before band practice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was awesome, like totally cool chick, really smart, very pretty. Like, I'm kind of like [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like everything is going on all cylinders, which has never happened in my life. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it just kind of—and I'm not getting carried away with it; I just—I have these moments when I'm like, "Wow, what the f —?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Some hot chick at—fucking at a wedding, like is suddenly chasing me. Like, I didn't—I did nothing, and I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Ahh, weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: See? I'm just trying to make sense of why. Like, what—what about you? What is happening right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I've moved down the why 'cause now I get—I mean, now I get it. I'm like, "No, because I'm—I am -"—in not a shitty, not an arrogant way, but I think, now, I genuinely understand that, yeah, I'm like a pretty interesting dude. [00:09:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think I—I don't—I've never given myself any real credit for that. I've given myself fake credit for it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But now, like, "Yeah, we're pretty fucking awesome." Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, no better or worse than some other people, but, yeah, I could see—I see it now more. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, the other people do, too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and other people do, too, now because—maybe because I'm generally seeing it. But, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is coming from a more, um—a more real place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I'm overwhelmed by? It sounds so shitty. I'm overwhelmed by kind of like the power that I didn't know I had. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think that is what is happening. It is like, oh, I've wanted to write. All my life, I wanted to be a poet and writer, but, well, yeah, some I did. You know? I wanted to make—get a record deal, but I already did that, and now I'm doing another one, and now I just—I don't need a record label; I just raised $4,000-whatever in 30 fucking days. Videos? Yeah—no, I just set up and made two fucking awesome videos that people love... [00:10:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That they don't know that I made. They think they're some—whatever—artsy, professional thing. And just—you know, now—women—like, now I'm seeing it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That it is not what I thought it was; it is actually—even with Samantha, I had the power. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't know I had the power because I was an idiot and I thought I was a weakling. "Well, why do they like me? I'm ugly and -"—and I'm not saying I don't—I mean, I—it is tempered. I'm not—but now I just see myself the way I think someone in my position might see themselves, which is, "Wow [slaps hands in lap], this is kind of cool. Man, chicks seem to like me, and..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not saying they should or they whatever, but now I'm kind of starting to see that, "Wow, yeah, I guess I had -"—there's something. [00:11:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: At the wedding, there was another chick that was—it was in a wedding party, which was kind of drunk and shit. She was, like, feeling me up and shit towards the end of the night, and people were noticing, and I was like, just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She was coming over and, like, kind of—whatever—touching me and shit, and I don't know what that is, but now I'm starting to just take ownership of it, like, OK, somehow I exude something, and it is—I'm not in some weak position where I feel like some 13 year-old, and why does this girl like me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, "Oh, that's so nice that you like my songs. Wow." You know, it is like, yeah, I'm kind of good, not better than a lot of other bands, but there is room for me in the world of good bands. You know? [Pauses] So—and I'm still grateful. Like, I—I'm grateful for all of the whatever I get, but now I just—I think it is just, now, I'm seeing that, "Wow, I guess I've made this stuff; it is not just dropping out of the sky." [00:12:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that's what's maybe—I'm a little bit like—like, I feel like, after all these years, it is as if I'm cashing in a little bit...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...on genuine—all the hard work I've done, somehow, has—so it is a little—it is both exciting, a little bit—makes me a little nervous, you know. Um, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also think some of it is anxiety-provoking. It is still not quite understanding the transformation, that, like, there's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...There are some things I think we have yet to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Discover about what—what's been going on and that route.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know? I think one of the things you're describing—you used to talk about yourself as being quite powerful... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, [slaps hands on lap] yeah. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...With—so it is not that your conscious experience was that, "Oh, I'm weak and feeble. I can't get any women." Right? Your experience was quite the contrary, of being—you know, you used to say, "I'd walk into a bar, get whoever I want. She's mine."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I'm sleeping with all these women." Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not—that's not an image of someone who doesn't have power. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but it was like an overcompensating—it was—that was grandiosity (ph). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like this overcompensating...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And something you actually maybe even were good at as a defense was being powerful to her, whoever "her" is."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? Taking control, taking the power over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet it came from a place of compensating for something deep inside...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Which felt very powerless. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like you're describing now—like, there is actually a feeling of, like, "I went out and did what I needed to do. I'm meeting the goal. I did that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "That really happened."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ..."With, you know, Kickstarter or..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is really a need, going up to that woman in a bar...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Who is bringing a self (ph), and who this person is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, also, that it is not—and also, again, like it is like, if we didn't reach the goal, then it wouldn't be like, "Oh, it is because I'm shitty. I'm a bad person."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "And nothing is ever -"—or with a date—like, now, if I'm on a date, I'm like, "Yeah, [slaps hands in lap] like, I'll never see this girl again. It kind of doesn't [chuckles] matter." I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It does and it doesn't. Like, I've—now, I'm in this place where it is like, I guess, where a lot of people are, who are a little more [chuckles] balanced...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which is that there is some automatic bracing of yourself, of like, "All right, this chick's really awesome, but, you know, let's see what happens and..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is not one or the other, one way or the other. You know, like, "Oh, it is not going to work out," or, "Wow, this is the girl of my dreams," or whatever; it is like, "That was awesome. What an awesome little date." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, "Cool, let's do it again and see what happens." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that's what I mean by, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:14:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know. [Pauses for five seconds] [Sniffles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also—sorry—and, also, the other thing is, it is making—it makes—I think what happens is it is more like, more and more and more, I know what I want. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, now, I 'm not settling, but now it is a different kind of not—it is not like I'm not settling because I want some Sam—like some perfect Samantha. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, now I'm not settling because I just want someone awesome, in a real way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I want real things that are really awesome, not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to just write a novel because I want everyone to know I wrote a novel; I just want to write a novel. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I—the same with music. You know, yes, I want people to finally hear—more people, but [pauses] now it is the reverse—I want them to hear only after I've grown into these songs. And I'm doing them anyway, and I'm going to keep doing them anyway, and it'd be nice if people heard them. I need to be on the cover of Rolling Stone, or compare myself to—I mean, that's always in the back of your mind, but now it is a much more grounded... [00:16:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, everyone has that. You know? But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Now it is not some kind of weird childhood, weird fantasy thing, or something. I don't know. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is not that the only reason for doing something is the idealized, perfect...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...End goal on it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is more room to do things for other reasons, because you enjoy it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're good at it... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And enjoy doing something you're good at. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think maybe the same for dating, too. It is that, now, I just embrace the fact that I just enjoy dating. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I like chicks, and I'm not doing anything wrong, so there isn't this strong of, like, "Well"—I don't know what—in the past, I was investing so much into everything, with these interpersonal things. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, it is just like, "Look, I've got shit to do."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "If you want to have a drink, let's have a drink, have a nice time, and then..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:16:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm not—I'm not so wrapped up in what that person thinks or what—"Are they texting me back? Why aren't they texting me back immediately?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but—yeah, it is just a much more grounded, [pauses] being comfortable in your own skin kind of—yeah. [Pauses] But, yeah, so I don't know. I just—I feel this—this chick from the wedding, like [pauses]—like, should I not even be—like, I don't want to get in—dude, I get scared; I have such a fear now of, like, the law with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not going to get in trouble, am I, with—because we're texting or something? You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I'm—am I—I'm horrified that any law-related [chuckles] activity...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, like—you know? I don't know. [00:17:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, law is the concrete fear. I wonder if one of the things you're asking implicitly in this is, should there—like, what if this comes out everywhere? Where is the limit? You know, what—should there be a "no" to some scenarios of, um, [pauses] where it doesn't make sense to [pauses] get that pleasure? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I already kind of pulled back, and we—you know, I mean, the things she keeps—she's texting me all day... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And things—it is not—I mean, the—the vast majority of the texts are just texts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like—you know, "Oh, shit, I've got to go to work," and, "Hey, what is going on," or—I don't know, whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and now I've been very—like, when she starts saying some—the thing is, it is not even dirty; it is pretty—like, "I wish you were here." You know, it is very sweet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's dirty? [00:19:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] No, I'm saying those—those are sweet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so you—most of them...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, some of the more romantic stuff are—aren't very sweet; they're just like, you know, "I wish you were here..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or, you know, "I wish I was there," like, you know, "just hanging out with you." It is very sweet, then. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the few that have been dirty, I—I mean, I'm not a mom; I'm a man. It is hard to, you know—but now I've been like, you know, [pauses]—I don't know. I'm, like [slaps hands in lap] "Look, you know..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."Your birthday's in [chuckles] February." I'm like, "I don't want—you know, I don't want any trouble. Like, let's just -"—[chuckles] [slaps hands in lap] You know? I mean, not that it is perfect once she turns 17—whatever—which is whatever the legal age is. It is weird; I'd never done research on this, by the way, so I've never... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it 17?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've never been into, like, younger ch...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't even want a 20 year-old or 21. But I was like—I'm curious. So, yeah, in her state, 17 is the age. [00:20:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And in here, it is 16, which I didn't know. That's the age of consent. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:20:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it was 18. But—and then there were these weird things. Like, but it is different if they're a virgin. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know this shit? There is something about, like, if they're not a virgin, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's [with the integrative law] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right? Like, what the fuck? Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, anyway, so I was like, "Look, your birthday is in February. Haha." [Chuckles] I was like—I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I—I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is unclear [that your time out of this] (ph) what you—so [forget the offers] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I don't even actually want. What—what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It'd be fun. I mean, why do I want things, dates? It is just fun. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's a cool chick. It'd be a blast. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just fun, like just playful? That's it? [00:20:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—sh—I don't know. She's really cool. I mean, she's cool. You know, she's, like, very smart and [pauses] she seems very nice. Like, from what I saw her interacting with people, she's very kind of [pauses] respectful and very nice, and—I don't know—she seems like a good person. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very pretty, whatever. I don't know. But, yeah, I mean, I have no idea. Like, it is all—it is all nonsense anyway. I mean, what—you know. But [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I guess, even indulging in the fun of texting, I just feel kind of like, "Oh, this is -"—I don't know. I just don't want any fucking trouble. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What stopped you from saying, "No," and just cutting it off than something...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because most of the texts aren't bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nothing [pauses]—she's nice. Like, if nothing else, we can be friends. You know what I mean? Like, it is not—you know, she's really into music. She's like kind of an artistic person. She's very smart. She—you know, like I... [00:22:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you like her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, as a person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like her as a person, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that's, you know—and, also, she's being very genuine. It is very sweet. You know? Like, she's very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, it is just very sweet. It is like we have this odd—suddenly, we have this odd, natural...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Text conversation friendship. I don't know. It is like really weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Text. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Text. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I mean, it—it is a very limited exposure to each other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like, even at the wedding, our little exchanges were...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean, maybe that's why I didn't interact with her much at the wedding. I sensed—like, I'm good at—like, I'm generally pretty good at that, and I kind of know if a girl—I've always been good at that, but, lately, I'm much more, I think, because I just feel just so much better about myself and more aware. [00:23:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I knew that, if I spent time with her to talk, like, she's—you know, I could tell we had some kind of nice chemistry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, she was laughing at everything I said and kind of—if someone was acting—like, she was looking at me to make eye contact. Let's say, if someone was acting drunk and stupid...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, and I was like [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So that's why I kind of didn't overly interact with her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, in person, you did hold back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, fuck yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah—yeah. No, and even now, I don't care if she sends me naked pictures or whatever, I—like, that just not—is not—the actual contact is just not going to happen. You know, that's—you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure these things happen all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, in some ways, maybe it is not a big deal, but I just—that's the last thing I need. And, I mean, I don't fucking need that. [00:24:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have dates that are...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why, if there's nothing to it at all, then? Do you know what I mean? What...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You have so many other people...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because, like I said, the general exchange is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Just two friends enjoying talking to each other. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. But you know it is more than that. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but nothing's going to happen. Nothing's going to happen. Know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [Pauses] I—I get...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. Someone should just tell me what to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I totally hear you. No, I hear you saying that's—you know where it would end; you know what it is now, but it sounds like it is in—there's this gray area. But why...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a gray area. It is—in a couple of months, she's going to be 17, and, then, who knows?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then it would be OK, with you even, if she were 17. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't know. It is—like I said, once things are legal, I don't—the fuck? Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's [basically part—what] (ph) I was asking. Like you're....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, once—once it is—nothing is breaking the law, I don't know. [00:25:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I mean, who's to say? Right? Like, pe—people that are 70, and they marry 20 year-olds and whatever the fu—I mean, yeah. Um, I—that—if I was some frumpy [pauses] guy with, like, three kids, in my khaki pants and my beeper, and—that—there's something creepy about that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no doubt there's something creepy about that. But I think, when you're someone who is very youthful and very—like, age, to me, is very fluid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've dated people who are older than me. You know, Meredith was 24. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I—it is just about connecting to somebody. You know? As long as they're both—it is consensual and legal, and all that shit, you know. But, otherwise, no, I'd never—fuck that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: One, it is just wrong, but, two, I just have a very healthy [chuckles] fear of just any—anything illegal. Forget that, like anything. Like, now, when I have, like, even two drinks...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You should see the way I drive. Like, it is [pauses]—I'm, like—what's it called?—like, hyper-vigilant. Like, I'm very [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you sound like you're aware that you actually are being cautious. I mean, you're asking...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I cau—yeah, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ..."Someone, tell me what to do," but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have—yeah, I'm like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You sound like you're telling yourself [not to fool around] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...There's maybe only one time now, like—and I can't help it. Like, she sent me one or two texts in particular, and, you know, I was just like, "Damn it," like it just kind of—but I can't help it. You know, turn—it is a turn-on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I didn't really go that far with it. Maybe...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, and I just kind of just—a lot of "hahas" and a lot of winks, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And a lot of, like, "Well, you know, February -"—you know, "One [pauses]—one of these days down the road"—I don't know. Just say shit and just kind of try to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Divert it. [00:26:58] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know—yeah, I don't know. Um, yeah—but, yeah, no, I don't—and I don't instigate any—I mean, unless it is something just sweet. Like, she said, "Oh, I wish I were down there." I'm like, "Yeah, that would be fun if we were to hang out" or whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But I don't take...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, totally! Yeah, you know, she's cool. Like, whatever, you know, because I'm not taking it seriously one way or the other. It is not like I'm going to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you could say "no," then, if you were hanging out, and she started to...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, right now? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, fuck that. Well, right now, I don't want to hang out, and that's....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's what I mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the thing is I just say that shit just—you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I just play—play friendly. "Yeah, sure, it'd be fun if you were here -"—oh, yeah. And even if she was, fuuuck no, absolutely not, absolutely not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Again, I—I don't know. Maybe I'm being—I'm sure this shit happens all the time, but—I don't know, I just—I'm [pauses]—I'm not scared of a lot of things, but there's something ab—I think I have a very healthy fear [chuckles] of... [00:28:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Legal shit. You know, I just feel like that's the last thing people need. You know? We all have—life is a lot as it is—right?—and who the fuck—you know, who needs that? It is like going skydiving. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I'll watch you do it, but [pauses] I—I do enough things in my life that are risk-taking and fucking putting myself out there, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't need to jump out of a fucking [chuckles] plane. It is like, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So [clucks]</p>

<p>[Silence for eight seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your walking off the line—instead of being what you're—you're sounding not like you're totally risk-averse. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone in that department would not be continuing to text at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're sounding like you're walking the line between being aware of risks but also taking some minor risks, not major. [00:29:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And—and that feels comfortable enough, but there's some—to some degree, there is something bothering you, still, about it because you bring it up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, 'cause I'm scared. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't—like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's going to happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we haven't talked about, like, the cops thing. Like, I'm—that shit traumatized me. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't know. I'm scared that, like, someone is monitoring my texts, and they're going to think that I'm trying to, like, rape some kid. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I get scared of shit. You know? I'm so traumatized by, like, cops showing up at my house, and it is like that really fucked with me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—so I don't know. I just—I just have these, like, dark fantasies. Like, when it comes to the law, I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is like Kafka—basically, it is Kafka-esque. I use Kafka-esque ideas that, now, I feel like, what the fuck, I can just be randomly arrested; or that they're monitoring shit, and not in some paranoid way, but I know it is not realistic. But... [00:30:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't know. It just scares me. You know? Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is interesting because, the way you're talking about, it sounds like the only problem with it is the—that there's a law against it. </p>

<p>[Silence for five seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sound of opening mouth but not yet speaking] [pauses] Well, what do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words, if there weren't a law, there would be no problem. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Nah, I mean, I still wouldn't now. Someone that age? No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I mean. So...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It is a—regardless of what the law is....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm not even...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...If there is some other reason...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Into people—like I said, like, you know, early twenties, even, is—is boring. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm not into that. I usually like, you know, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, the reason the law is there—it is there for—it is not just a random...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right—right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...They're trying to protect—it is for protection. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, of course. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it sounds like if, all the sudden, you learned the law were 16, would that—would it disappear—the qualms about it? [00:31:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, I wouldn't feel as guilty, but I still wouldn't do anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nah, absolutely not. It is just not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is just—it is a fun thing. You know, if it is consent—if it is legal and consensual, that's fun. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, there's something about—I mean, people have to be over 17, at least. I mean, there's got to be some semblance of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...At least be in college. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I mean, come on, that's—yeah. Um, [pauses] so I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's in you, too. It is not just the fear of the law coming in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, I mean, that's over—overbearing just because I'm so fucking traumatized by that, you know. Um, but, no, part of it, too, is, yeah, I just [pauses]—I—I—I know that nothing would ever happen...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So I guess it bothers me that I'm just enjoying—you know, it is—it feels good to have someone so genuinely all about you. You know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And as young?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're afraid of your age sometimes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's probably something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Particularly important about someone who's 17...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Actually 17. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, that someone like that would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, is not finding you an old fart or whatever...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You know, it is—you know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now, I think what...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or else she is, and that—that's something about her, that she's dating...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, right. Who knows? Yeah, who knows? Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, we don't know what it means to her, too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of the things that I think can happen psychologically when there's the other in your—the culture, in—you know, the Assyrian culture and your sense of being an outsider here; the "other" on the outside, who has everything, and we don't—is that it can end up feeling like the location of the reasons to do things and not to do things, the rules are in that "other." They tell you what's right, what's wrong, what's the best way to be, what's the most beautiful way to be, what's ugly... [00:33:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And it can be harder, I think, to kind of have that inside yourself. I mean, that's what I'm struggling...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [The client] (ph), yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...The easiest way right now, for you to say why not to do it is 'cause—well, 'cause of the law. But that disowns a little bit your own conflict about, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Forget the law for a second. What do you actually...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Feel yourself about what you want to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. No, that's true. Yeah, it is true. It is that—it is that not just immigrant but traumatized immigrant. And, "OK, just tell me what to do and..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. "And if you say it is OK, I'll do it; if you say it is not OK, then I'll know not to do it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is almost like this Pavlovian something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't get to have your own...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Sort of consciousness or the conscience about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Right and wrong. [00:34:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah. </p>

<p>[Silence for 16 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not saying that the answer is "don't," either. I don't—I think you're still sorting out what...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Please do. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No—well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: As—I want to feel less [pauses]—but, yeah, see, again, when I think of it, what scare—I don't know why. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Becomes a bit emotional] I—I must have seriously been traumatized—that's where my mind goes. My mind goes to, like, you know, "What if she tells someone?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? But then I'm like, "But tell someone what? What's there—what the fuck am I -"—you know, a couple of—we're texting? And it is not even—I'm not, like, saying lascivious—sending pictures or whatever the fuck, or I—we're just—most of it is very sweet and friendly, and "haha" this and whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "Fuck this," "fuck that," "these people"—that—you know, it is just texting like I would with anybody. You know? [00:35:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is just, once in a while, she's [slaps hands in lap]—she does say something kind of, you know, dirty. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And—so that—yeah, I just [sighs in exasperation] [slaps hands in lap]—ahhh... [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is like attached with actually happening, or, [slaps hand] "What if people somehow find out what I'm fantasizing about?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, kind of. Yeah, or they're at—yeah. Or even, for her, I feel like I'm [pauses]—which, you know, a lot—I don't know. [Pauses] And I get the sense that she [pauses] is some—there's something mature about her, that she's very kind of—that she seems kind of like she knows what she's doing somehow, and she's like—she's not some weird, like—either obsessive or—you know what I'm talking about? Like, she's just—she's into me. She's texting me, but there's no other, you know, thing. [00:36:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She seems pretty healthy, for sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She'd probably keep it contained and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...She probably wouldn't be doing it if she were thinking she was going to get caught or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is all kind of—but, to me, that is neither here nor there; it is about how I [chuckles]—you know, she could do whatever the fuck she wants; I've got to think about what I'm doing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't—[clucks] yeah, that's what it is starting like, yes. But after yes—'cause yesterday was the first kind of dirty...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I was—and it was just like, "Oh, goddammit." Because, at first, I mean, you know, I can't help it. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is—you know, I mean, it is a—a young woman is, like, so into you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They had a bar, I got a drink and went, "What the fuck?" You know, it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But as soon as that—I was—now, I've been kind of—if she says anything, I've been just kind of dist—just saying something distant or kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Something. I—that's—I think that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:37:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it mean if I told you not to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would—it would be helpful? How? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'd feel like, "Wow, like, if someone—like, if someone like her is saying that you definitely just cut all communication..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Then that's exactly what I would do. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hmm. Someone like me, meaning who? Like, who?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Someone—someone that I respect their opinions, if they're smart, they know what the story is, they—you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I feel like—I mean, every—this—I mean, this has never happened. I mean, I think this hap—like I said, this happens a lot...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But because I've never been interested, that's never—I [don't know what] (ph)—twice, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and I'm like, "Whoa, that's weird." Like, I feel like there's kind of a gray area, and... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:37:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I know I'm not a douchebag. I'm not, like, some fucking, eh, pervert or something. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like—and, um, it is not like she's some crack addict or some—or, like, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is like there's a gray area there, you know, but—but—but. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It reminds me of, like, the places in your childhood where maybe you didn't have just kind of basic guidance. You know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very. Right, exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Like, "Can someone tell me if this is OK to do or not?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know? And you have some sense of some things yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels hard to sort of look ahead (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can't—in this case, I'm, like, kind of lost, you know. I don't know what—yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, like, I—I go back and forth. In some ways, I feel like I'm being very naïve. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like, "Dude, if this was some other dude, they'd be all about this"...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because they'd probably be like, "What the fuck? We're texting." And we live ten hours apart. I'm not going there; she's not coming here. I'm not sending her pictures; I don't want any pictures from her. [00:39:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, just some dirty texts here and there. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure that's how that would go down. You know? But, yeah, just—I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I can't [pauses]—so I think I'm being, slash, naïve, slash, I have a conscience. I just—you know, I like her as a person, and I don't want [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that sound weird?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I mean, I hear you trying to figure out what—where to locate yourself on that spectrum. You—you're totally aware there would be some people who would absolutely engage that... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And not think twice about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then some people would absolutely cut it off right at the beginning. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So who are you, and what feels comfortable to you in there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or is there an in-between? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Does it have to be a one or the other? You know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea! [Chuckles] I have no fucking idea. [00:40:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You've got to tell me. You're killing me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [Pauses for five seconds] Where is in-between go? </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps hands in lap] It is like a friendship. You know? But it is like a flirty friendship. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. That you get what out of, this...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, it is—it is nice—right?—to be able to have a nice connection with someone who thinks of you, and you think....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it is just nice, you know. And down the road, I mean, who knows? I don't know, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't really think of it that far ahead, kind of. You know? Hey, I'm just trying to deal with what's happening right now. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess—I think the question is so that's the upside—it is nice; it is flirty; you feel good. You can have that in a lot of other places. Why take it on in a place that is filled with anxiety and risk? [00:41:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. Yeah, that's true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It—like, is that back to there's some deficit that's getting filled by her in particular, in some way that it is too hard to, say, let that one go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is probably—I think this is probably what you're saying—it is like it is—and, again, I'm sure this is why a lot of people would engage in...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's something amazing about a beautiful, you know, 17 year-old, cool chick who is all about you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? There is just—you know, that's just all there is to it. You know? And, on top of that, it isn't just some kind of sordid, sexual thing; it is like, "Wow, there's actually a really nice person," so it is not some kind of nefarious, weird shit. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So then you start to think, "Well, you know, that—the -"—I don't know. But, yeah—but I almost don't even like talking about it; it makes me feel weird. [Clears throat] [00:42:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's so important, though. I think she symbolizes something very important to you, an un...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... [inaudible at 00:42:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is basically like me being that age and finally being—you know, some really cool chick being into me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, and me not being some shy person who doesn't understand that some girl likes him, you know, whatever. I don't know. But, yeah—no, there's a lot of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like getting to relive your youth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, there's this little bubble where...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You get to almost be 17 with her...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And feel so differently about yourself now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That feels good... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And isn't quite the same as someone who is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Your contemporary. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is also sad. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Big time. [Pauses] Yeah, big time. Not sad; it is almost pathetic, yeah, because it is like, "Yeah, what the fuck?" I mean, I go out on these dates with these amazing women. [00:43:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is, you know—it doesn't matter whether she's got—like, an adult or she's—I mean, that's ridiculous. I mean, that's, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, again, is why I'm saying, like, that—I don't care if she lived next door; like, that's—I'm not one of those kinds of, like—[slaps hands in lap] what was that movie? [Pauses] American...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Beauty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Beauty, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's—that movie was a nightmare to me. Like, I don't get that. I don't want anything to do with anything like that. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I'm—and I know the willpower I—I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I love smoking; I don't smoke. I'd love to drink more; I don't drink more. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it is that weird gray area of, like, well, if someone's not around, and you already wouldn't do anything anyway, and if it is mostly innocent and just nice, you know—but even that, I agree; it is like, yeah. It is like, wow, I'm just [slaps hands in lap]—that's how fucked up my childhood was... [00:44:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That this is [chuckles] making me feel nice, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, [that's why you want to] (ph)—just sounds sad. I—sort of regardless of whether it was an action or in just in fantasy...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...To let go of her in the fantasy is—is letting go of the wish to be 17 again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is really sad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that's part of what you're talking about, that there's something that's mourning (ph), that's more complicated than just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But that's why, like I said, after yesterday—I mean, I was already kind of not really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But af—after yesterday, I was—yeah, and I'm just much more...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, just kind of [pauses]... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is sad. I mean that... </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps hands in lap] [00:45:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a—there's a lot sad in that, so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it is a problem. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I mean, I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is kind of a bummer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is—yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is like, "Shit. Remember when I was 17, and...?" [Slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or the feeling about, like, a love that might—could have been...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But maybe can't?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [Slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anyway—Monday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sweet. [Pauses] Wait, Monday, at what time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Three-fifteen. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday at 3:15—OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, 3:10—3:10. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday at 3:10. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do Monday, 3:10. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Friday, 3:15. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: See you. [00:45:36]</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll check that (sound of paper rustling). [Just trying to find] (ph) the train schedule is. [Have to wait] (ph) so long for trains.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For Clifford.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Only run like every 20 minutes at this hour.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I usually miss that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What train is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "A" Train. But if I can't come in at this time, is it okay also?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After seven?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not that time exactly, but I'll be getting here by that train. I'll be catching it in two weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We can make that work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like Michigan a lot, because I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm curious what you thought, or what made sense or didn't make sense, or what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it made fine sense between the sessions.  I think it's a little unrealistic that they re-create the relationship between ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You and I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... two people in office can somehow duplicate or replicate or imitate every other (inaudible at 0:01:13.0) out there is not possible (crosstalk) won't get away; lucky if you can imitate one or two or three.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right. It's an imperfect approximation at times, but you're right. It's not. It's obviously not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it's cute. The landmark work I did, I wasn't present at that particular group or thing. A woman who led one of my groups told a story of a different group she had led where she was late, or something like that, and someone got very upset with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she apologized, whatever, and she (inaudible at 0:01:48.2) wouldn't let go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And (inaudible at 0:01:50.9) it was exactly like a therapist at that point. It was like this is no longer about me and my coming late. It's more about how you (inaudible at 0:01:58.4) terminology (ph), how you'd be in the world, how you'd be and you are when someone does something that upsets you. And she was there, the group gave her a standing ovation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She should have stayed cool, and she did. What was happening was, she was - she came late. She did something wrong and this guy got all p.o.'d at her, and it came down how he gets p.o.'d probably with other people in his life when they don't understand whatever it is. He knew exactly the kind of therapy (inaudible at 0:02:27.5) the situation that was described in the article.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But (inaudible at 0:02:31.3) of the idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something that you don't think that's operating in here yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's starting to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you say more? Like within the last two sessions, that's when I'm thinking it's starting to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you actually have the other sessions to think about why it didn't happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wanted to ask you, I've come across quite differently the last session or two, so you've seen sparks of the second way of being earlier. Specifically, by nature I'm kind of outgoing and even aggressive, talking straight, you know, criticizing people straight up and telling them when, you know, I think you're wrong about something. It's just "You're wrong about something."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I talked to you in the last session or two in a way that I almost never talk to people in the real world. (0:03:30.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though by nature I don't mind talking that way at all, but I'm much more aggressive or assertive here than often I let myself be out there. Because you've told me that you can take it and you can handle it (chuckling) and I'm allowed to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, I mean, there's no promises; but, I mean, part of any - you answer the - probably similar questions I do, and we have to see what's going to happen, too, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You answer similar questions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do a questionnaire, too. You've remarked on the questionnaires here that you filled out - how to provoke thinking about us and you - "Do I feel safe?" You know, all those questions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what we're learning about, right? Whether ... (pause). So what's the second way of being that you just ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's more passive, much more concerned about how the other person is going to feel, and being extra special careful, you know, because [you also] (ph) that way of being also down in here. And as a kid, much more (inaudible at 0:04:46.8) someone in mind, kind of forceful about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think somewhere (inaudible at 0:04:50.8) elementary school progressed, I turned arrogant and may have [come away] (ph) that I started losing friends and acting a certain way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Losing friends, you think, because of your arrogance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, specifically, I wrote about this (inaudible at 0:05:03.4) before I started here. Somewhere around third grade I started becoming very arrogant and by fifth grade I was, just had to win in every game in sports - in recess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you wanted to win.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I became really obnoxious about it. And by seventh grade the kids didn't want to play with me anymore. They made excuses not to include me in their games at recess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You recognize that now, or do you think you sensed it then - that kind of, those reasons why kids didn't want to play with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Am I insensitive? It would have been helpful if I had a social worker at that time, just to help me to talk [about what] (ph) was going on. It would have saved me a lot of grief. And sure enough, to put two and two together, really, and realize how, you know - what's the word - obnoxious I was probably coming across. [0:05:57.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you think it's changed over time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I told you it's, you know, I recognize that stomping over people to get your way to win is not going to get you friends and will probably have you excluded sooner or later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But you described being aggressive or, you know, criticizing people pretty harshly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I've always been critical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both parents are like that. I'm like that. No question about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well, then, part of what you filled out, what I remember, is there's things about the way you are that you want to change or that you want to think differently about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, but which parts?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you will ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt very much like a victim in much of my adult life, particularly when it comes to jobs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you felt like a victim, but you also felt, it sounds like, and correct me, like an aggressor, too, in other ways - being very critical, or being perfectionistic, or wanting things done right, or your way, and letting people know. But it's not like that. [0:07:08.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if you're a priest in a church, you don't tell people in a rough way (inaudible at 0:07:15.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... way you possibly can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if somebody decides to take it wrong and get offended or angry ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, and that came out in here when you talked about not hurting each other's feelings and saying things in the nicest way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We can. Yeah, that's definitely a part of life, and you know ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's definitely a part of life, but we want to see how it affects our life. How it affects all of the things - all of the issues.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's obvious that if someone who has the power, or the authority, to fire you, you're going to talk differently than someone who is, you know, an underling, and you're 20 years older than them, etc. [0:08:00.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's funny, when you said that I was thinking that you have the power to fire me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, not in the same way, I understand, but ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your livelihood is not dependent on my keeping you or firing you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but the feelings and the communication and the issue about ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I was wondering about that. How would I - how would I be as a person who had the authority and the power to fire others? To cut other people's hours in half so that they make half the money they were making before working for my organization. (Crosstalk) ... in my life. How would I be then? What if I had what I called good reasons to do that to another person?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As a minimum, I suspect I would try to, you know, break the news gently. At a minimum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was wondering what happens when you're trying to break the news gently and it doesn't always go so smoothly. Like in here - I mean it's the easiest example to use, I think - breaking the news that you wanted to end therapy. [0:09:11.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Keep talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it seemed difficult. It seemed ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me - to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I thought part of our discussion ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:09:31.0) it is difficult for me to (inaudible), but yeah, you know, I'm (inaudible) with firing somebody. It would be very difficult for me to do that, I suspect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also easier to, it's easier to be a victim than the bad guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can be the good guy rather than the bad guy if you have to be a part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it's always more pleasurable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not fun and love, but (inaudible at 0:09:56.1) you can take (crosstalk) victim of having to feel guilty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One of the top karate experts in the world, I went back to him. He said when he was a kid, 17, being beaten up on the streets, he learned how to fight back and knows how to win. And he had to learn how to do new emotions, how to feel when you win or when you beat the other guy up. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Interesting. I kind of feel like I'd like to experience it once, you know? If I could feel good on the receiving end much more than the giving end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to choose.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like the opportunity to be on the giving end and then choose how to do it and when to do it and when not to do it. [0:10:35.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I kind of think I'd like to try that. But I know it's probably very difficult to fire someone (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that might be a problem then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you might be in a position ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was in a position (inaudible at 0:10:48.7) fire somebody, but I was certainly in a position to come close to being [engaged in] (ph) some very serious [trouble over] (ph) someone who was working, you know, the same job that I was working, not doing the job properly at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I kept covering for him. I took over parts - big parts - of the job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kept covering for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I took over ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come you were doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was doing community service, religious community service.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was going on that you wanted to protect him or cover for him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I had two choices, really, the way I saw it. One is to tell people in the community this person who you've been relying on to fulfill a certain function, a religious function in the community, for a number of years now, clearly has not been doing it right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This has led to violations of Christian law. [0:11:44.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so you'll really get him into some trouble.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, [whatever] (ph). Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay that's one option.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and when this guy has, you know, a large family and no money in the bank, all that kind of stuff, and also complicating (inaudible at 0:11:56.7) long time (inaudible) new guy on the block. But still, I could have spoken up and said, "I'm a new guy here, but I want to tell you what I discovered about this guy you have here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really cause some serious trouble for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Could cause some serious trouble for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's the other option?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The alternative is to do what I do is to say (inaudible at 0:12:09.7); and they gave him, I agree, they gave him a very hard job to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was not fair to give all that work to one guy, and they dumped it on him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I agree, and I could see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what was the second ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: By this time, I'll tell him do half the job for you, and I'll take responsibility to make sure it's being done right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are what you thought were your only two options. [0:12:28.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tried talking to him about doing your job better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and then you do a follow-up on him to check up on his work also, and see ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you really ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: This was for four years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... focused on how bad the situation would be if he got into trouble, and you didn't want that to happen to him. You really just didn't want him to be ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought I spoke to (inaudible) a priest. I said, "I'll get this guy fired (inaudible at 0:13:03.6)"and this guy said, "That's not your problem. If he's not doing a good job in this regard, then it doesn't matter if he's going to lose part of his income or (inaudible at 0:13:14.1) even more than part of his income."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:13:16.4) told him, "Don't do that job anymore. We'll get others to do it, and you do the rest of your job; everything seems to be fine."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what if you didn't cover for him but also didn't make trouble for him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The religious functions of Christian buildings (inaudible at 0:13:31.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you would (crosstalk) it would affect you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... if you didn't ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... step in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though (inaudible at 0:13:42.4) yes, it affected ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would affect you, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like my quality of life as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You were in a bind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I would feel very angry at him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were very angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Blazing. He wasn't doing his job properly, even after I did all that work for him. I cut his job in half and he still wasn't giving it his all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you tried to tell him he's got to step up, and he didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, many times. Now, looking back, it was his personality I couldn't (inaudible at 0:14:12.9). At one point he said (inaudible). I was taught to pay respect, you know, and he had more respect than other people in the community.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you, it sounds like you didn't really respect him because he was lazy and he wasn't pulling his weight, and he wasn't doing what ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I would talk to him [frequently] (ph), you know, and what he said to me was how he gave me a lot of respect, probably more than I deserve. He could (inaudible) that much, but he still didn't change his thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I'm talking about what you were doing, what was going on for you. You weren't, you were feeling one thing and torn up about it in a way, but doing something else. [0:14:43.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) was to say, "Okay, you're not - you can't do this job anymore. You're not doing it right."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now some guy has to find someone else who can do the job. It will be a major expense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But isn't that what ended up happening anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He stayed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After the four years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: After I left the community?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He went back to his old way of doing things. He was now fully responsible. All of the community was on top of this except for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [0:15:13.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Including the priest who'd been there 30 years and was involved with this issue for five years before I got there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) this guy also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You wouldn't (inaudible at 0:15:25.7) many things were not done nicely or properly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was like, okay, he seems quiet. We'll dump it all on him. He had no idea what kind of job that was entailed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How to do the job properly, how much work was involved, they didn't (inaudible at 0:15:36.2) care, don't bother checking up on it to see if he was doing it right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You care, though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I spent my first few months in town checking it over in meticulous detail (inaudible at 0:15:48.8) couple of miles of walking and checking lots of things that (inaudible). Wires and poles and things that ought to be connected and not connected - a list that (inaudible). That was very, very tedious, laborious work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Snow and rain, fixing things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if we can come back to (sigh) what you thought about what we discussed about the therapy and that stuff I gave you. You seemed like you got it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the critical time was like (inaudible at 0:16:32.3) not good English sentences here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at the same time, I was reading and I liked it. Only got the two page, and it calculated (ph) very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [0:16:44.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was anything there that was new to me? I don't think so. It was expressed, you know (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, nicely. Did you sense the kind of, the difficulty or the subtlety of expressing it clearly? Like how am I going to get from here to here is something you've asked me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm (crosstalk) I come away after reading that, you know, just as - feeling exactly the way I did before about how, you know, this whole enterprise is [pretty full of] (ph) very hit or miss. Second, very much of a spectrum of potential, you know, growth or not. I mean, infinite spectrum there from zero to (inaudible at 0:17:23.7) quite a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The last therapist I discussed this issue with (inaudible) is like us. He said, "Yeah, well, I had this patient once." He said to me, "One session with me changed his life. I have this other patient I'm seeing for" (I don't remember how many years it was).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "She hasn't moved at all."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So if you hear any more stories like that, (crosstalk) people going to a therapist for years and nothing happens like, okay, who has the time and money to see a therapist with this kind of, no promise of any kind of return and, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's - okay, I think that's where sort of you come down, where you want to see some results. And there was you, that's a metaphoric, you know, I had eight or nine sessions and I'm not really noticing anything. [0:18:08.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (Inaudible) got a ton of letters from Dan, my therapist five years ago, telling me to read. Yeah, there was more of a (inaudible) quality, it was like, you know, recommended four days, four sessions a week, for a couple years. I'm like, "If I come once a week to you," I said to the therapist, "are we going to get somewhere?" He said, "Yeah, we can get somewhere," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm like, "Okay. Your book says four times a week. We're meeting once a week. How is this going to happen, exactly?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it shouldn't, it didn't happen. And again, I'm not blaming him or anything, you know. (Inaudible at 0:18:39.4) as poor a client or as poor a patient as he was a therapist, whatever. And that's my fault this is ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, could I have - actually, that's something that came out last time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Blocking therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Blocking therapy, or feeling like you're not going to be able to respond, or know what your emotions were, was one of the things, and that seemed very troubling to you. My impression.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, it's a different kind of enterprise. It's not ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But to be successful is important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to not be successful is to, well, I don't want to feel that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yet we're in the midst of that, and you're in the midst of that, too, maybe, when you think about things you do out there. Wanting to feel ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and not wanting to feel ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... unsuccessful. So I mean, in a way, when we think about that, there is something, there is a relationship to how this pattern relates.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I agree with you. I did not think of that, and I agree with you. I agree with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking about how I mentioned that I do want respect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you get from respect [strike that] (ph) how do you get to respect from being successful or not successful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ummm,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want me to respect you? Does that (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... to respect me. I mean, I want to feel that I enjoy some of my life. That is, someone knows of me and what I'm doing and has respect towards me (inaudible at 0:20:26.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want that a lot. You want to be appreciated and well regarded.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And (inaudible) I'm not saying it's a (inaudible), but it's not, it's not ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's normal. I want that, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, okay. You know, it's nice to be saintly and have the (inaudible) that [you and God] (ph) (inaudible at 0:20:48.5) out there as far as respect goes. And you know, that is a common ideal, but you know, I'm very, very far from that ideal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's also what's involved when we want that and what do we do to get it, and what are we neglecting or not recognizing. So, I just think - how would it be for you if therapy is not going to make sense or it's going to be hard, or you're going to feel like, maybe like a failure, like you're not getting it. How might you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, no one wants to feel that they spun their wheels.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Spun their wheels?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No one wants to feel that they labored and didn't accomplish something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So - okay. So if you took, if you did the labor and you don't get anything back, that would feel pretty bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wouldn't be horrible, I mean, but if you spent time ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So did that make the risk to do that less worthwhile? [0:21:56.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to do something that I feel has decent odds of success.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm feeling like you really want clarity. Like you really want to be clear, you want to be certain, you want to know. You want things to be fixed, and if they're not going to be fixed now, you want to know how that's going to happen. You want it to be outlined to you and you can then assess it and see if you think it's going to work. So I'm almost sensing that if it's unclear how it's going to work, or it's uncertain, or it's vague or ambiguous, or it's a process that we can't define ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Look, I'm here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I'm here and going to go along to the right here. I'm not being charged $150 to come here. Okay. I'm making use of my time on the train to mark papers or do some learning, whatever. (Crosstalk) That's a terrible (ph) investment of time, either, I feel, and I (inaudible) could just go along here, but you know, I could be doing something (inaudible) a try here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:23:06.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really feel (inaudible) discussing this right now. How I feel about therapy being successful, and (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just trying to think about what's - like when I'm hearing you say that, like it's no big deal, like you can use the time to come here, you're not wasting it. It's not costing a lot of money, so it's not a big financial burden. You're willing to go along for the ride. It just makes me feel like ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Loud sigh) Sorry. That's what I'm trying to tell you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, you said you're sure if you gave me two weeks, you were sure you could help me. Okay, great. I don't, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you had tried to convey to me, I think, that, you know, you can't make promises without a clearly defined path to go on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know. I just feel like I'm not - I feel like I'm not that valuable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I recognize that. You're Joe's professor here (chuckling). I don't know what to tell you. It's not like telling me we can point towards the end of a day or even a month or potentially a few months and say, "Look what I've accomplished."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, but, you know, there's part of you and there's part of me ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:24:52.3) you have a drawing, a painting at the end of your efforts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't know what you have, (inaudible) to find.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but that's not really what I was saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just don't - I don't feel that valuable, and it's not that serious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you keep me serious. I blow off on a tangent about (inaudible at 0:25:20.2) bring me back to our discussion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I may not ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have never had in my life any ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... quote, unquote, "successful" experience with therapy in the sense that (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is like this is a major - so I feel then, it's going to be a challenge (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should put you on the spot and all that, I'm sorry about that, but most times you - my experience, and I'm not faulting the therapy. I'm sure it's deeply ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm not faulting you. I'm, you know, this is a ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So we're trying something, and that's all I can get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I guess part of me wants to hear it - hear the lack of confidence in this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Not that you ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not wasting all my time, Crispin. It's not a lot of money; and I could, you know, get some work done while they get here and go home. It doesn't sound very hopeful that something will happen here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You'll just have to appreciate the things we've not discussed yet so (inaudible at 0:26:25.3), I guess, from 11th grade (inaudible) my dad (ph) the last 15 minutes and do nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) part of me was particularly (inaudible), you know, it started right around 11th grade. The idea of using time well and not wasting it is very much part of my philosophy, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that goes on in the train and in here. I thought that you wanted to make the most of our time together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:26:52.0) you'd tell me how to do that (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, see, that's where I feel like we get in some trouble, at least from my perspective. Because you say, "Oh, I want to remind you to not be this blank slate, to be active, to do something, to do anything to help me." Yet I also find sometimes when I try to do it - I'm not saying I'm doing it well or the most effective way - but it still is a lot of resistance I feel. Sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Example?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to talk about our relationship anymore. It's just (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I said I didn't want to discuss ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look, I don't want to go around like this talking about our relationship anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) the fact that I'm here. (Inaudible) all we've discussed (inaudible). I don't have more to say; I didn't think you had anything new, either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well,</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's go on against the (inaudible). Let's try to head towards accomplishment and achievement and success.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. See, that's ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:27:53.7) in landmark also. We spent tons of time discussing landmark. You're tying up your friends with that kind of stuff, you know? I hated it - wasting my time for. You can cut two hours off the job, off the snow (ph) and get twelve hours (inaudible) ten hours and cut all that other stuff out of here. Of course. They built the schedule that way, you know what I mean? But I hated that part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought that was taking us away from what we're here for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You have a certain series of conversations between the leader and various people in the group, and it led to good results for people, and you're - you got off that track. You're discussing (inaudible at 0:28:28.3) of your friends. That's not going to get us where we want to go, you know. And [in some ways] (ph) it got us where you had to go, but it took a lot longer and I resented that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you resent here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do I resent here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that (crosstalk) around our conversation (crosstalk). Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Move on and start growing and being successful and (inaudible) over here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Let's fix this and get it done. That simple. [0:29:00.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if you're discussing something that (inaudible). Like even now, when (inaudible) time discussing, the fact that I'm here seems like a waste of time. The parts that I recognize are not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But [about] (ph) 15 minutes I felt more like (inaudible at 0:29:27.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like there's a kind of a - there's two sides. That you want to be able to tell me the truth, but you also want me to like you. You want me to feel good about my job, you want me to like you, you want to tell me things and there's other things going on that you would like to be able to tell me, too, and they sometimes come out. You're able to do that. And if I react like I did, or if it hurt or not valuable here because, kind of not a lot of confidence in this, I hope this is going to help you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's very precise, what you just said. That I didn't want to be telling the truth, also I (inaudible at 0:30:09.3) that is definitely a major part of how I operate in all my relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm thinking that that's operative in a lot of the issues then, too. I felt kind of a hopelessness quality that this is not going to work out. I'm not going to be able to help you. And you're going to stick it out, you're going to give it a shot, and we can, you know, but.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:30:44.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, depression was one of the issues, the classic symptoms. It's really related to people not feeling hopeful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was being a victim. (Inaudible at 0:31:02.9) asked for in school or church (crosstalk). Yeah, you get renewed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's something in ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just (inaudible) in the first place.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... in getting closer to the things you don't say, or the things you want to say that you don't feel like you can, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:31:22.7) Where? Here or out there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both. I mean, here and out there. I mean, like you said at the beginning, here we can - it's not like out there, and you can say things and we can see, you know? And you said "Oh, Crispin," you said, "you can take it." But even when you give it, you - I feel like you pull back. You want to lighten it up a little bit if it gets, if you think you might have hurt me or said something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sigh) I've been pretty tough on you this last day or two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now you're telling me that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm thinking we got a long way to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We got a long way to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you're telling me ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't even think we've scratched the surface, to be honest with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On how tough I can be with you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, okay, whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I mean, does that resonate at all for you? Am I ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: What? That I haven't screamed at you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Am I feeling that (inaudible) (crosstalk) screaming. But, I mean, really, like letting out the anger or the ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... or the ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fine. What you're telling me that this was, the stuff I've conveyed to you is, you know, I don't know what word to use, somewhat hurtful, whatever, or offensive, maybe. You know, that I just lack confidence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I - it's not offensive to me at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to take my big guns now and see how you feel. I'm going to (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know if you're going to do that yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want me to? Nothing yet has come up to make me angry at you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "You want me to?" almost suggests that you could, and then you say nothing has come up yet, so (crosstalk) analyze just that. You almost seem a little nervous now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there's one thing I've enjoyed with you is your use of four-letter words.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. [0:33:20.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I let you have them (inaudible) cut it out already.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I'm trying to respect that because I feel that's important to respect.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. Now, you can really try something just to experiment. Do it again, on purpose, get me real angry, and if you have interesting [scene] (ph), how I'd be in the world when people do something that bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know that it's that hard for you to be angry about things that are that clear-cut.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. What if it's hard for me? [0:33:49.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if somebody's cursing. I mean, it's very ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Convenient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... it's too easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right? But to say that you think somebody's not smart and they're not able to help you or to say that this is, I don't feel ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I learned something. I don't feel - I don't think I'm smart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no. I'm saying something to use as an example. For example, right? Those are harder things to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Harder than other ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want you cursing at it; I'm offended by that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Am I off base on this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think you're off base. Wasn't hard for me to protest when something is very offensive to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But the other stuff is more difficult. To hurt my feelings or to say, "Listen, Crispin, it's not working for me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I said that? What do you mean? It's not difficult to say? Yeah, it's not difficult to say because (inaudible) other person that. Again, it's, you know, it's how I would feel if someone told me, "What you are trying to do for me, this is not working, I don't think it's successful, [I'd like for you] (ph)." I would personally be very hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yet it comes back to when we watched the tape. You were interested in watching the tape last time, right? And it seemed like when we watched it, I also wanted to talk about that because it seems I couldn't quite read what was going on for you. Something seemed aversive or intolerable, or you didn't want to as much after we started it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Frustrating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't even tell (inaudible at 0:35:23.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there was something about seeing yourself and seeing - I was curious about what went on because we didn't really. And then after that, after we turned the tape off and you went back and sat there, it felt emotional here, like "I feel like I'm going to fail therapy and I'm not going to be successful trying to figure out what I'm thinking or feeling." It was feeling. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can't figure myself out. I can't figure out do you ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can't figure yourself out ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... how (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (stammering) and myself, anyone else out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You'll find yourself a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot, yeah (laughing). So if we can't figure ourselves out, if I can't figure myself out and you're this guy that's going to meet me for X number of hours, and he's going to figure things out ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what do you think about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seemed like a bit of a long shot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It did? I'm thinking you might want to even be more direct and to get rid of the bed (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, look, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm asking. [0:36:37.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Look, I'm telling you what I felt, what I read about Georgia sits here, right? And these people are able to read people's eyes; in fact, they'll look a certain way, and you're unable to notice twitches, which would mean nothing to me, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, there's a lot to you. I feel the few times - and I may end up pointing more out to you as I feel we're able to do that - but even from just the exchange we had last time and pointing it out, it was such a, I don't know, it was a hopeless feeling you had, like "I'm not going to, I can't."</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:37:13.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like "I'm not. That's - I can't do that. I don't know what you're talking about." What I'm feeling then when my eyes looked at it. It just was completely mysterious to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it made you feel unsuccessful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's not a good feeling for you, and it wouldn't be a good feeling for me, either. So that's going to operate in here because you're going to want to feel successful in here. Maybe part of the work will have us end up being successful, and how are we going to deal with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't want to feel (inaudible at 0:37:50.5) we're talking. Like, go here and go (inaudible) own fault. Come on, man. Whatever. It's, it feels very idealistic. There's no purpose to anything; there's no goals that are more worthwhile than others. It's just a duty to go with the flow, you know, a la Lion King, King Matata, whatever that line is, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look, I really want to understand what you're saying, this. I really want to understand what you're saying right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you say, or when you say - you kind of said it again now - I thought you implied it, kind of what the goal might be, that you go with the flow and not need answers or reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What made you think that's what I was saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you said that you're not getting it and not being successful and (crosstalk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, being able to tolerate it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So the goal there is to be able to tolerate things happening however they might happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. You're feeling in a way you really don't want to feel, maybe, and what you do to avoid that feeling. So when we talk about and you think about the explanation of therapy and bringing unconscious feelings and unconscious thoughts into awareness, right? That feeling of, that you're a failure here, you use this for failing therapy and you will joke about it. There's a reason you're going to joke about it, because you don't want to feel that feeling. You don't want to feel like a failure. You want to feel great, you want to feel respected, you want to feel powerful. So there's things in there. There's things underneath. [0:39:37.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Therefore ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did you make that face?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't - therefore what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Therefore, I'm just wondering if you're going to think this is [a nihilistic] (ph) again, but understanding that, the best case scenario will help you figure yourself out a little bit more. Maybe not all the way; you were telling me you worked hard on trying to figure yourself out. Not very successful or successful to a degree, or whatever, it's been a challenge. Right? Is that a fair assessment of what you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so. I feel I know myself pretty well. I feel that the (inaudible at 0:40:34.8) not successful is people will think I'm not working (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll have to change certain things (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't know either. And then how - just like we started on this conversation just now - if you don't know, how am I going to help you? Right? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The answer is your objective of other parties. You're not blinded by my ego.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you think it could work. Because two minutes ago you said, "If I can't figure it out, (crosstalk) how's some ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) about seven minutes ago, what I said was the pessimistic side, and my (inaudible) know me so well in a short time. On the other hand, you can see something in another person that you can't in yourself. That's definitely ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe we can figure something out together, though. Maybe it's not so, you know, maybe it won't seem conclusive in this session or the next session, and maybe it's not the end that won't seem conclusive, but maybe we're going to know something that you didn't know. Maybe we're both going to know something about - I'll know something, too, about myself. Ideally, though, it would be you knowing something more about yourself and about how you feel that you're not aware of right now, and that maybe you're getting to become more aware. [0:42:03.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I don't feel we're saying anything new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want new? New stuff. I feel like, when you say something like that, because we have to actually stop; but I feel like, when you say something like that, it's - I feel sort of set up. I also feel like we don't actually need new things to use, new things here, for us to figure out what's already going on, and even the hopelessness that you feel. Not just at home and at your jobs, and your feeling like a victim, that you think it's not going to help you. That's a bad feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Twice today you made some connection between being here and being out there. I don't remember what they are. Could we spend more time discussing that (inaudible at 0:43:23.8) goal, run it back to discussing that in therapy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would be happier right at this moment if I had those two things in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't even call them to mind now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. We'll discuss them next time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you remember what they are?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll review the tape.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fair enough. (Inaudible) leave the tape on (chuckles), but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Let's just - I definitely am sensitive to that and I recognize the importance of that. But our tests are not just that, either. Making those connections and seeing those patterns is important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought that was a (inaudible) point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's important. There's other things that are important, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, did you start to say that you would start pointing things out to me? That stuff about noticing people's eyes and stuff like that. Did you start to say that you would be able to point out stuff like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just even like we did on the video where I pointed out to you and then pointed out what happened in here. Just very briefly, the way you look sad or make a face, look away. You think about the sequence of things when you say something, what you say next. Okay. [0:45:06.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll have to give you a check today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have any money in my wallet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Till next time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Even if you took credit cards here, it would be safe (ph).</p>

<p><b>12 sessions</b></p>

<p><b>First session (first 30 minutes)</b></p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b><i> So what brings you here today?  Tell me a little about yourself and what is going on.</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> I just relocated my family here for my graduate program. It's been a big adjustment, you know coming from the DC area, with 2 kids, and my wife.....it has just been a really big adjustment, and my routine is so disrupted, I mean I don't go to work now, I go to classes, or my whatever it is that day.  I just thought it would help to talk to someone.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>You mentioned change in your routine was something that you had to sort of get used to.  You mentioned that you don't have to get up and have the same work routine everyday. What have been some other things that have been maybe difficult to adjust to here?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> That's a good question.  It's the way and not necessarily how they work but the way they make them work.  You know, we come from the part of the country where it is hustle and bustle, you have to make things move, things don't wait for you.  You know, it's exactly like that, time is money, that's the way it goes.  Here it's more slow, you know, it's a different way of doing things.  We live in an apartment complex now and we've brought up several issues to be taken care of and we get "Oh, that's fine, it's on a work order" but it's not taken care of.  At least not to our liking.  You know and I don't know if that's the cultural aspect but it takes some getting used to how things work. Umm the  kindness, the overall kindness, I'm not used to everyone being so kind, you know genuinely kind.  We came here and we didn't know anybody.  We made some pretty good contacts, you know, trying to relocate and buy things.  We went to buy appliances and the sales lady, you know, she was asking for delivery stuff and asked our address and she was like "Oh, that's where I live, what do you want to know about the area?" You know, she was really above and beyond her need at that point.  You know, she didn't have to tell us about all the things in the neighborhood and things like that.  You know she didn't really have to do that.  She could have made her sale and go on to the next customer.  But, you know, she told us about where to go to get things done.  You know even here with faculty and I mean, I've never had that same thing.  Faculty it's the same thing, you know, they seem to put my immediate needs, you know, how I'm doing, how my wife and kids are doing, how are we getting adjusted. It sounds genuine, it really does, but it's just hard to get used to.  Because where I'm from it's not like that, it's get out of my way I've got to get to work.  I can't be late, I've got this to do.  That's the way things were for us.  It's something to get used to still.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What do you imagine Portland will be to your family? Near future and further along the road?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> I don't know.  I've been kind of thinking that we want to have a place to call home and maybe this is it. Maybe this is the place that we can call home and live the lifestyle that we have kind of fantasized about.  You know, I guess that is kind of a long term kind of thing. You know, it's kind of hard because we were so close to the amazing things in DC, you know we could've just jumped on the metro and been downtown in half an hour or we could've driven in the same amount of time.  Thinking about that it is going to be hard to replace the feeling&mdash;and not like we did that on a regular basis&mdash;but the feeling that we could do it, if and when we had the time to do it.  It's a good feeling to have.  The same thing with the beach, we could drive to the beach, not as often and we would have liked to but it just felt good to know that we could do that.  I just hope that we can find those same feelings here. You know, that's what I really want, to have those same feelings here.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>You mentioned earlier that you feel the people at your program here are very supportive and you've encountered some people in the community who were very kind and very helpful.  Where do you see your support structure right now, overall and where do you see it in the next few months?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Right now I can easily say that we're relying on each other right now, my wife and I are relying on each other.  My wife and I rely on each other.  Anything that we need to get done we do it together.  You know, we support each other, one will go buy some things, one will try to tackle a task to get it done.  You know,it's very hard because of course my family is not around.  We relied on our respective in-laws for childcare and that's not an option.  So you know, right now our support is one another and if we need to reach out then maybe we can, but right now I don't think we are looking at that.  We just want to make sure that we get ourselves grounded.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>How has that maybe affected your relationship with your wife and family, you know, not having that outside network that you did in DC?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Umm you know it's pretty funny before because of my work schedule, my work times, we didn't really see each other as much as we would've liked to and now we do see each other often, you know.  I think it has brought us that much closer together. You know, we can help each other out, I mean this morning we went for a walk in the park and that was something we would've have never been able to do before this move.  We just wouldn't have been able to do it and I think it's brought us closer on a different level.  Umm you know emotionally and I like it.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>So it sounds like some changes in your relationship with you wife.</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Yeah, but good, I guess.  Yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What sort of things do you see happening over the next few months, or what are you doing over the next few months to help you, and your family, transition?  If you a "to do" list, what would be on that "to do" list for you family?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Right now I think we are preoccupied with selling our home, our financial status isn't as great as we would like it to be, you know, we're not working.  So we are going through what money we do have, which isn't a lot.  So the to do list would encompass a way to bring in some money.  I don't know how given the demands that we have right now. You know, my demands for here and for school, the practicum, things like that.  I don't know how we're going to be able to do that. But I think that is part of my to do list right now, to try and find a way to bring in some money. Even if it's a part-time job at Wal-mart or something, I don't care.  I kind of look forward to not working again in the field full-time, you know, get a little break, a little brain vacation.  So, and pretty much getting our place settled up. We have boxes and we don't know where our stuff is, you know, we have a list, but to try and find some things. Not too many to dos right now.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>So it sounds like you have an idea of a plan. </i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Yeah, I think so.  I just don't want depression to creep back or interfere with this time in my family's life.  That would really wreck the plan.  My family needs me now, I need to be a dad, a husband....</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>So am I hearing that there is some depression in your past and you have some anxiety about how this might affect your new life?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>Therapist:</b> <i>What have been some of your ways you have coped with depression in the past?</i></p>

<p><b>Client:</b> Well, I saw a therapist a couple of years ago, who thought I should go to a psychiatrist, you know, not because it was so bad, but just the, you know, meds.  I decided not to go to him and just saw the therapist.  I just didn't want to go down that road, you know?  My therapist helped, though.  I put it in perspective and I found ways to cope with it.  It was just good to think about how to cope with all the crap that goes on when there's stress and kids...</p>

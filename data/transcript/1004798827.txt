<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: My sample size is one—thing yesterday. I don't know what to talk about. There are so many things. We could talk about why I feel pressure to pick the right thing. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My instinct is to just make a big list.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that doesn't feel very deep or perspective.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never really know where things are going to go. So, what comes to mind if that's what you inclination is? [00:00:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so the categories are-mood instability, apathy about lab, fear and overwhelment in lab. Sort of turbulence with Jeremy and his own stresses and our conflicting stress relief tendencies and—yeah, sort of a general feeling of, of wanting to like leave and take a really big break. [00:02:06]</p>

<p>And I guess, I feel like alienated, like I don't recognize some of these things as being central to myself. Like the apathy and the fear and like wanting to leave. [00:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know those things don't feel right to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I could see how maybe they could be part of me, but I just don't know as well (inaudible at 00:03:16) has those parts as well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me maybe you are trying to think your way through the-in part to cope and maybe a little bit to avoid how unsettled and upset you are. [00:04:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure what else to do. Though I will say that when I go home today—I feel like I don't want to be thinking a lot and I want to like paint pots and go to meditation and cook and like watch Sex and the City and not go to lab tomorrow, which I'm not going to do. I'm not going to go to lab tomorrow. [00:05:25]</p>

<p>We're going to Virginia tomorrow, which is lovely, but also a little bit, it's a, it's a transition, so it, it feels a little jarring. But I sort of, I feel sort of desperate for it too. So, that's all to say that my instinct here is to be really thinking, but I don't, but I think I would enjoy that for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>A lot like hugs and kisses and warmth, and that's one of the conflicts with Jeremy and it's like and when Jeremy is stressed out, he withdraws and he's very—he still is an excellent listener and will sort of provide that, the, the physical comfort and warmth that he has to be directly asked. So, I have to stand there like this, which I did twice yesterday. [00:07:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, a gesture like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, whereas he can also be the most affectionate person I know. So, it's been rough at home seeking the things that feel most comfortable to me. When actually, the thing that is comfortable is when I don't have to seek them and they're just there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could imagine that way things feel let go, like fear. Like you're a long way from home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah we're building a home, but it's, it feels kind of a little far off, but not like uncentered, but like it's going to take a while. Feels like it's, it's far out—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Far off in time. [00:08:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Far off, far off in time. So, sometimes I feel like throwing in the towel. Not with Jeremy, but with the like home building part. Like I have a great home and this one's a really nice home to visit, but I, where I imagine that it will be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not always, but you (inaudible at 00:08:54)....you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Though there's plenty of harmony. It's not a, it's not an unpleasant place. It's more, it's just, not as, I'm not as settled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or taken care of in the ways that are most familiar I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that would be really nice about now and again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can imagine that other things are going well. I know you had talked about how things are kind of crummy. I guess you really miss it. [00:09:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and Jeremy doesn't respond so well to that. There's this been this feeling throughout the time that we've known each other that I can be a, like a little girl. And that there are some little girl parts of me that are pretty big parts of me and maybe that's endearing and nice and youthful and positive, but it's also, I think it's also sort of like makes Jeremy irritated. </p>

<p>I know it does. He, he's shared that before. So, there is this like thing on top of it which is like wanting to grow in to, you know, sort of being a composed equanimous adult. [00:11:14]</p>

<p>?: Equanimous?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Equanimous, equanimous adult for the sake of like being who Jeremy might want me to be, but you know, it's sometimes it's in direct conflict with how I actually am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very difficult in your life with things at once.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does it seem like a lot of (inaudible at 00:11:54) things at once? </p>

<p>? Does it seem like a lot of (inaudible) to you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I'm not asking because I don't want to, to kind of dodge the question that I often do or would. I'm asking because we're talking about how it seems to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I don't admit—[00:12:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I could, I could find a bunch that would make me think yeah, it seems like a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, I think more the point is that it really feels like a lot to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything that I am trying to do—feels like I should be there. So, I'm not really giving myself the credit of, of like being on all of these, growing up journeys, and I'm sort of feeling frustrated that—that things are really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. Like it shouldn't be. Life shouldn't be so stressful. Or you shouldn't be having troubles with some of the things you are or you shouldn't want any kind of reassurance and understanding at most. [00:13:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or I should just be able to take it all in stride. Like, the way that I have in the past. One thing about lab is that it's sort of this superstar lab. Like there is really a rising star and she really wants to be a star. She's like very concerned with being, presenting herself well, having everybody in her lab speak well and present well and she goes for these projects that are so high profile and high risk and I don't think I really wanted that as part of my PhD.</p>

<p>And I don't even know that I wanted to come to this university. I think right now I'm regretting being in such a competitive A type place with such a narrow—like career and landscape. [00:14:50]</p>

<p>At least like let's accept it or what's done and I'm not regretting being in Kelly's lab because it's fascinating. I'm doing a way cooler project than most graduate students I know. But, I don't know that I'm emotionally or scientifically up to the task.</p>

<p>And I'm, I'm very afraid that one day it's, that's, that's just going to become clear to the both of us and there's going to be this great disappointment on her part and not like that much disappointment on my part. So, it's like yeah, I care a little bit enough about this to show up and to do a good job, but I don't care enough to—I don't know, bring work home all the time. [00:16:04]</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm just, I'm also not, like I don't have the mental space to really be like exploring and thinking a lot about new ideas and making opportunities for myself and I feel pretty frustrated that I don't have that mental state because that feel's, like, the right thing to be doing right now.</p>

<p>Because like that's what Thomas does and that's what Kelly does and I enjoyed doing it, that when I truly have the like creative space. So, part like because like all of that and then I'm also frustrated that I feel like I need to be doing that.</p>

<p>Like, okay, I don't really like a lot of it right now, so that's that. Why am I trying to change it or make it better?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: May I propose you're not really loving it like the lab work. [00:17:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like being on this like high, high profile journey.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, like I shouldn't really be. I feel like why am I beating myself up about it? Oh, if I have the mental room or like if I learn more emotionally invested or positive. Clearly I'm emotionally invested because it's making me so upset, but like all this, so it's like I think they're cause, all the resistance is causing some suffering too instead of just like saying this is what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like—is what's in conflict your concern about disappointing Kelly on one side and your lack of passion for, for a real high powered (inaudible at 00:18:50) with research?. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a conflict for sure. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe the things like you were puzzling over why you care so much that you're not more (inaudible at 00:19:07) about all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and that's another conflict.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When in fact you know you don't really care passionately about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess I'm wondering if you're caring so much about it because what matters isn't the lab work per se, but Kelly's disappointment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sure. That does matter more at times. And then at other times that like glimmer of potential is pretty tempting. So, it's almost like I think the highs might be high enough for me, but I don't know that I'm like willing to, to, to suffer the lows. So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be cool to have a few major papers when you graduate. [00:20:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, so that's weird because like, that would be cool, but I also know the work that's involved in that and, and, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:38) cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now it doesn't feel—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that cool, but also the (sighs) the things aren't like so pure like selling your story and being sort of on the front line of competitiveness and I don't know taking things really seriously. That's the part that doesn't seem so cool. So that, I don't know. I can see myself getting—I can see myself getting somewhere that is a good mental point because I've been able to do it before.</p>

<p>I just, it's not coming to me right now. So, on top of the, everything else, the fact that the, the balance isn't coming to me is overwhelming. [00:21:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And of all the like—I guess what is occurring to me is like if you're in a class and it's a really hard class and you're like I just don't care enough to work hard enough to get the A. But, I am here, and I'm signed up for the class and you know okay, I'll like go for like the A- or the B+ or something. So that, you know, I get something out of it and I can get a decent job, but it's not worth it to me to, you know, to stay up until 3am a bunch of times to—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —to get an A. Kind of like not that it's not clear in this case where the sort of a perfect compromise is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's an awkward thing to ask like your PI. Like I can't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:22:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just have to figure it out on my own. I like how much am I willing to tolerate?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like this is a real difference between the two of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean she cares about the A+.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she's not like this heart, like this slave drive, like she's a very—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —reasonable person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God. So, it just, it, it does sound like what's at least for now feeling like a pretty final difference between you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She doesn't like anyone to publish the mediocrity when there is a lot of potential. She's very good at being like that's kind of a lame story. We can publish it. Blah. Someplace. But when there's potential, which there is with my project, mostly because there exists no data, so the whole thing is potential right now. [00:23:48]</p>

<p>Then there's like this huge, like momentum, and it's like (making fast paced sounds at) like 20 ideas a day. You know, it's from collaborators, like I got asked to give a talk in April yesterday. Like based on fictional data. So, all of that momentum feels just like sort of misplaced. There is a fundamental difference where am I just like I just want to do my work. Leave me alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does the sense of being kind of cast as like a, you know, pre-research one university faculty member, did that feel as kind of preemptive and likely misrepresentative as the data? Like, do those things feel similarly tied?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't, I don't have that goal. You're saying does it feel—I see. [00:26:07] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the story about the experiment and the story about you, are the stories about the experiment and are you feeling similarly hollow and yet there's a lot fuss and fervor about them at the lab?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know that it, it's so like well-formed as, you know, tenure track faculty at a research one university. Yeah, but there is like this underlying assumption that I want to be great at science. But like I want to be super great at science.</p>

<p>I think Kelly's pretty respectful to people's own decisions ultimately in whatever they choose to do. Like, I'm pretty, I feel pretty good about leaving her lab and feeling confident about whatever I want to do and having her blessings. </p>

<p>But yeah, while I'm under her wing, yeah, I'm sort of facilitating her goal. Which, it's not, it's not really like there's this imposition that this should be my goal too. It's more just like there's not really a, that's not really a consideration—or, or it's a big assumption that that's my goal. And it should be. If I were in her place, that would be my assumption too. Because like why else? Most people are here to do super things. [00:28:04]</p>

<p>(Silence from [00:28:04] through [00:29:50)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm wondering if what—he doesn't want emotionally immediate, but it kind of tends to, sort of makes you feel so great about yourself. His, your sort of wanting to—a little but to you don't have to push yourself. You don't have to do more. You don't have to do new grand things, but just like do what you're comfortable with and be taken care of. And sort of feel more at home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that is what I want. I guess my next question is so what? [00:31:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess I'm not asking a—you're a little uneasy with wanting those things. And hopefully more in your eyes maybe a little bit in mine. You know, you'll, you're concerned you'll seem sort of too young, too needy, not where you should be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Not driven enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not far enough along.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Too imposing-I'm also like, too much of a downer. Am I pretty positive influence and presence in this place is very, spend my time. Why are you smiling?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it doesn't feel natural to not be like at the front end of the optimism spectrum. Which I, I could still be there and have misgivings. I guess. Well, but I'm not. I don't feel like my naturally optimistic self. [00:33:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That means you're—not going to be the same presence for other people, or a drag or... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I don't really let it in other people so I try and imagine that I just don't love it in myself, but if it's there and it doesn't feel like myself. It doesn't. I don't know. That's not things that, that's not all that's there. There's also like who is this person? It just doesn't sound, sounds like a more cynical person than I am. It's more alienation than like just like, like negativity. Though I don't cry. [00:35:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think it's you also—you don't even like her at the moment. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Who? Because I thought I'd remember that. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I don't know. Forget it. Never mind. (laughter) It must have been somebody else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought you might have been talking about Kelly for a second.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't really like her. The other self-thing, but I'm willing to like let her be and do her thing. Not really trying to fight it. It just feels bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? [00:36:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't feel as, as the best and she stepped right in and said it's stable because it's not that like, like you can be like—very shaky and like very reactionary and impressionable and sort of driven or carried away by the wings of whatever you're going through. But—there can be a confidence, that like you'll return to those starting points or some predictable places which is what I mean by robust and I don't feel robust.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for now. We can talk more on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>


<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what happened with your text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It got lost in the-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so. I had (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Texts are not as reliable as email, which isn't as reliable as a phone call. Yes (inaudible) feel so stupid and yesterday was kindergarten open house and then they scheduled a family breakfast this morning and I remember the teacher saying something like because (inaudible) people won't be able to make the open house, they have breakfast. I don't know it's just so stupid to have two events, you know, 12 hours apart. So and I totally forgot about both of them so a couple days ago. I don't think my phone, as much as I did with my old phone I don't open ITunes, so I've got to get into the habit of opening ITunes. I listen to more podcast I would probably (inaudible). There should be some quick sync; they should have a quick sync.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's some kind of wireless thing for your (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might be. But I don't have, it won't do it with Outlook because Outlook is not a MAC device.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet there is some kind of (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I have one syncs reminders, which is kind of okay. I just don't use reminders as much as I used to, so another miserable week. I just got to be able to work. I mean I, I guess, technically I have some work to do but I really don't have any work to do that's going to pay me any money, at least not any time soon. I preferred Tracy's daughter to the mortgage guy and that probably will close next month, so they got one closing next month. And then a guy (inaudible) is on Face Book looking for a realtor in (inaudible). I said, "I don't know if you know but I'm real estate attorney, I gave him Claire's contact number, which still doesn't guarantee me getting hired or anything like that, she's got some business out of it. He mailed me to thank me. He wants to have lunch to catch up. So and I realize how hard it is to come up with lunch places, because a lot of places are closed for lunch, especially the places I like to eat, I picked the B.B.'s Grill, you ever been there? [00:03:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A good place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: E&G actually seems, like we had a really positive meeting yesterday, which was kind of unusual. Like we may (inaudible) taken the turn. I don't know what exactly about the meeting gave me that impression; I mean, number one a lot of people were there; the caterer at the last minute said she's not bringing food because she hasn't been paid, which is now the second time she's done that. The CPA told her that she will go and pickup food (inaudible) give me the timeline from the group. So it's like (inaudible) and it's their only chance to eat lunch so she would stop by to pickup (inaudible) anyways. So she ended up buying lunch and, of course, the caterer didn't show up to the meeting; and it's just, there's something going on there. Our secretary treasurer he is a banker, I really don't trust him. It's just something about him, he's unreliable. And Jodie, he's pissed her off in some sort of way that she's—but even with that there's just something about meeting that made me think that people were—had a couple of visitors and the type of people who were there were committed. [00:05:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the guys I had been worried about he does sales training, I don't know if you ever heard of (inaudible) sales training. It's one of the national sales force type training and their franchises and he has a franchise. And just sort of (inaudible) and he stood up and teared up about it (inaudible) who at the age of 52 he was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer and so he didn't do his 60 second (inaudible) presentation. And at the end of the meeting, he was going on about what a group it was and how—I think that, when there's someone I think is going to drop out but so excited about the group, I don't know, may that was (inaudible). I had to rush off to Ian's open house, which was, I wouldn't say a waste of time; but he's improving, his behavior's improving. [00:07:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, I don't know if he's doing anything specific because I see her argue with him. I think the more you ignore him—she kind of feeds into it a little bit, and I think it's better just to ignore him because he's going to find something wrong with everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it's also things just settling down somewhat, I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course, you know, he had more time getting used to having a little sister to like the arrangement with you and Jess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes that's probably part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He really latched onto this one kid who went to (inaudible), Jeff, who—not that I should be judging kids, but he's kind of a so wet noodle of a kid. The teacher was saying they've kind of been playing less and less together. But the concern I have is that Ian isn't making friends and that was the big thing about going to the neighborhood school is that you would have friends there. You know soccer's going to be starting up in a couple of months so that will change things a little bit; but, I don't know, he wants to run everything. So I think, you know, people have a hard time getting along with him because he wants to be the police chief, he wants to be the fire chief, he runs the game you know. I'm trying to figure out where he gets that from, and Jess's brother is very opinionated and dominates conversations and very loud. And even Jess can dominate a conversation. [00:09:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may have mentioned that once or twice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think he gets that from her side of the family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it possibly is also being like that may be there in the family and it could be also be that things have been so out of his control, I mean all the stuff that's happened (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he's been like... he's always kind of been like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has he, oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the other kids play along so. But I look at his class and it's just not a lot of kids that I would look at and have really the same interest that he does. It's probably—I think there's a kid in one of the other classes that he gets along with because they play cops and robbers together. But I'm somewhat out of touch with what he does at school (pause) and at home. I'm just kind of realizing it's like Lucille will do something and I'm like, "Oh yes, she's been doing that," and I'm like just seeing it for the first time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's just every little thing. She's talking more. She has been standing up more. She's been, every little thing she does that, you know. It's not like they're major things, but I'm not seeing her progress on a daily basis, where they are. But she kind of likes everybody, but she definitely—like when I call her, she comes over. She wants to be picked up and she'll hug my leg and so I think she realizes that I'm someone important to the equation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I sure she does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I told you but much like everything Jess has found problems with the daycare that they watch TV and don't let the kids move around that much during the day. I thought most kids spend most of their time in those little (inaudible) when their mom's are cleaning the house.</p>

<p>I'm trying; I've got to figure out. I've got to pay our health insurance at the end of the month. [00:12:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you aren't getting as much time as you want with the kids or as much time as you should have with them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely feel that way. I think there was a time where it's like I didn't want really the responsibility and then I helped out Jess for a bunch of times and now it's like I haven't seen them in a day or two I try and do something. Every Thursday I take Ian to school, which Jess kind of always forgets. Even, like I told her, what we do Wednesday. I don't know I get included on everything so I do kind of know what's going on (inaudible). But it was weird. After the open house, (inaudible) wanted me to come over. And I think, really, he just wanted to ride in my car to play video games on the phone; because when I got there, he just wanted to watch TV, and we really didn't play together at all. So I left, you know I was walking home and I was think how I could live where I was living for a long time, if I could afford it. (Inaudible). It's just every time I pull into that parking space now, I just think about it like 500 bucks just going. There was a time where I was always losing $500 here or there. I was close (inaudible) payments. And now it's like I've got no gas in the car. I've got very little money to buy food with. I have no food in the house, except for a jar of peanut butter and some condiments. And there's money in the business account, but I want to make sure there's money there to pay the health insurance. So I've got to run those numbers and see what Jess's going to be giving me at the end of the month. You know I've got a couple of titles I'll probably get at the end of the month. I don't see any income coming in. It's like you can't—and I have to be able to tell your kid at some point that, "I'll make up for it later in the summer I need your help." You know I just can't bring myself—I mentioned it several times, this is most of the time I don't have business. And all of a sudden she's backed off on me giving money and really trying to—but I'm going to see someone today to review her estate plan, which is probably fine, I don't know, I don't know if they have to change it or not. Maybe that'll be something. [00:16:07]</p>

<p>After here I'm going to our tax attorney, he's going to do our taxes. (Inaudible) us to some sort of payment plan. Once again, it's like, I don't know where this money is going to come from for the payment plan. Jess was even complaining that she's not getting enough time to fill the hours that she doesn't think she can afford the house. So the big problem with our modifications is that we haven't paid $30,000, which their lump right on top of it; so if they lower the interest rate, the payments are not going to go down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there're new programs coming down the road, they haven't started yet; they won't for a few months, this one that reduces the principle by $20,000. I just wish there was, I don't know—maybe Claire will be busy and send me business this year like she did two years ago. If that happens, with the business I get from Harry, my new mortgage guy, I would have a decent year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you have lunch with Claire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you have lunch with Claire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am having lunch with Claire; remember we talked about that... B.B.'s Grill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that was with Claire. I thought that was with the person who wanted the realtor in (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. She emailed me thanking me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about he, (inaudible) the guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No Claire emailed thanking me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. [00:18:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she wants to have lunch and catch up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. I see where I got confused. She thanked you for referring that guy. I thought you meant he thanked you because you had given her name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's at her new shop, so I don't know what kind of difference that's going to make for her. I guess she'll talk about it. I'm just so—there's very little prospects for me, maybe there is but I'm just not seeing it but I just don't. I don't know. I don't understand why my business is so slow and why I can't get new business, why I, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible) I mean if I think about where you're at this year compared to last year, (pause) you know there was the way Claire was doing in the middle of stuff with you and Jess and things were much more kind of going up and down for you last year at this time. I mean when that start being much more settled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know and you sort of coming across as more together than last year. Maybe that will make a difference in her sending you business.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Right now, at least in the beginning of the year because I had referred her for some business that she—she had like one really big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Jess had had dinner with her a couple of times but the first time Jess says—trying to get Jess to get some information and talk to me she said Jess—she said that Claire was very slow. But I don't know the mortgage is coming out of (inaudible) to makeup to more than just one. And I've got one sort of in the pipeline with them but I should have asked Harry about it but I don't know if it's dead or whether it's just taking a while to close. I just closed one on Monday that I've already paid myself (inaudible) today and thousand and one, I dropped my fees and 395, just 200 bucks from, 250 bucks from what I do for Harrys company, 350 bucks for what I'd normally like to charge. Fucking stupid it is like the loan officers, they're forced now to make 2%, they can't mess with your commission. So the fucking loan officer made six grand on the deal, I'm making 600. I don't know what I can do to get into some other type of business. I've tried with the estate planning and it just hasn't taken off. I'm very bad at getting the work done. It's like I'm almost 40, what am I supposed to do. I'm not in any position to reeducate myself or spend money on referral services or do any kind of advertising, fucking website has been a huge bust and (inaudible) money, I'm like a month or two behind with them, which I don't know if that's why they're not— I'm supposed to get two extra pages that I want to put Jess in there and I just can't remember to fucking email the guy. He had asked me yesterday if I had called the vet and I said, "No I haven't had any time." And she's like it only takes a minute. I'm just like. I've said to her before how things, I can't explain why I don't want to do them, but I can't do them you know. It's just one of those things. Part of it is because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was going to give you the money. [00:24:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's going to want to see the dog. The dog's not limping because it was cut in the pad. He wasn't limping initially. But, yes, I mean I'm a month behind on rent and (inaudible) accounts about to explode go negative. I don't have business to cover that up, just—I don't have, if I take money out of the business account, which is money I really can't take out. I have no food, money for food or for gas. I mean my on empty. I don't have enough money on a credit card to put gas in my car. Just like anything in an All State commercial, it's a commercial that's on all the time. When the guy with the deep voice is talking about the woman is on the Ramen every night for dinner, budget, whatever. I feel like that's what I should be eating, you know, it's like I shouldn't be spending money on anything, I should be eating Ramen noodles for dinner. I did have Ramen noodles for dinner the other night. I was at CVS on (inaudible), they're like a buck (inaudible) I bought two of them but I ate both of them in one night. So it's like I don't know. I'm not even buying food and I'm still not losing weight or anything like that. So nothing seems to be going in a positive direction. (Pause)</p>

<p>When my dad comes to town he'll probably give me a couple hundred dollars in cash. It sure is funny. There was a time when I was like had a stash of cash that I was just putting away thinking I'd never need it. I needed it because I didn't have the work. But I can't figure out—plus I've had, I just had enough closings. These are all (inaudible) and I'm making like $800 on them. On purchases, I'll make $1,500 to $2,500. (Pause) [00:28:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you (inaudible) the mediation (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean. She spent almost $600 with the fee for the class, which is 50% of what it cost. And she feels inexperienced with it so she doesn't feel like she can even take on clients, but you've got to get clients. So she's got the connections with the divorce attorney. The woman next to us in Plymouth, who does the mediation, who charges more money would send her to Jess because Jess would take less money. I don't know I mean she's picking up (inaudible) almost every day at 2:30 because she doesn't like the lady in afterschool and (inaudible) it like they're stuck in a problem with everything, and she can't figure out why she doesn't have enough money because I can't put her kid in afterschool and just suck it up.</p>

<p>I mean now that I've got kind of an open schedule, I could start picking him up but its vacation week next week, but put him in the fucking afterschool program. He was in the afterschool program. He was sick and he was crying and they just told him to stop crying and he had like 102 fever, so she doesn't want to put him back in the program. It's just like, I'm not saying she creates these problems, but she finds problems with everything. It's like she's never satisfied. She's never like, "Oh this is great. This is working out fine." You never get that. (Pause) [00:31:29]</p>

<p>I got a guy who owes me 127 bucks for a tax payoff ticket and I can't get him to pay me. If I call him it's no big deal but I need the 127 bucks you know. (Pause)</p>

<p>My car is driving me nuts. Everytime I hear that fucking squeal, it just. I don't know how I'm going to get ahead, I just don't know how. And something worst is going to happen to the car and it's going to cost me more money. It's not like—I've a ticket for having failed inspection, which is things keep piling up. (Inaudible) wants to save all the money for the fucking mortgage because, she like, "Oh, you know. If we get foreclosed on I'll have somewhere else to go." (inaudible) $11,000 (inaudible) nowhere else to go. (Pause). The condo is going on the market today and there's a guy who wants to buy it. As soon as that goes through, I'm giving a fucking 1500 bucks, which I haven't gotten this month yet. The tenants haven't paid. And once that 1500 bucks goes away I don't know how I'm going to afford my place. I don't know where I'm going to come up with security deposit and first month's rent and fee for the realtor or whatever, I don't know. [00:34:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is just awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like, with the mediation it like if there was something I wanted to do and to train myself, you still got to get the business. And it's like I'm doing all my networking and I still haven't connected with this guy from the community bank, which—the guy who referred him to me told him he's slow on the uptake and so it's like, you know it's like I'm just (inaudible) wasting my time. Everybody likes you, treats you great, but then they're not going to send you any business because they've already got someone to send business to. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to think about these litigation cases I have that I'm just, I don't know the answers to certain things and I don't know who the ask to get the answers from. It's just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (inaudible) to know where the hell to start. (Pause) [00:38:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know where the money is going to come from to pay the rent for the office the beginning of March. (Pause) I have to talk to my dad, you know, fuck the mortgage, I've got to worry about me. I tried to borrow money just for some cushion. (Pause)</p>

<p>You know there are people out there that are struggling but none of the people I know are struggling. None of my friends are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody is going through something like you are? [00:41:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish there was some appreciation from Jess because I don't even think she knows how bad things are for me. If I were to sit down and try to tell her, it'd be, "Oh things are bad for you, what about me?" I mean she's getting 2600 bucks a month from these tenants, I don't see a penny of that, nothing. I just don't know what to do. (Pause) I spend more money on medication than anything else. (Pause) Seems like every week there is some or one of my prescriptions are running out. I have to go fill it... 15 here, 30 there, 60 there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Look like when you don't have any groceries (inaudible) buy and prepare foods.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cameron, we're going to need to stop for now. [00:43:48]</p>

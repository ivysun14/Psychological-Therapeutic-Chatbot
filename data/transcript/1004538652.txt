<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where do we start today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I have the busiest day ever today (sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's saying a lot for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cuz you feel like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...most of your days are crazy busy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I have an interview today at 2...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. I'm like so excited and nervous for it. Um, I mean having (inaudible at 00:00:24) Friday and they asked me if I could come in today, and it's on the, on the marathon route at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckles). So, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Give it lots of time to get there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I have to pick up, um, Lily, the girl I nanny for, right when I leave here. Bring her to a play date. We're going to hang out there. I'm going to leave her there while she naps. I'll go to my interview and then come back and get her, and then her bring her back to where she lives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where...where's your interview?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's in the city. It's a retail center.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so (sighs)...I'm, I'm just fine. I'm not worried about the interview. I'm worried about getting there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Getting there, yes. Because having lived in the area for a while—um, not any more, but I used to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it's complicated on a busy day because you can't always cross the street.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So give yourself—I know you have a busy day...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but I would plan to give yourself as much time as possible because it may be that like you can't get off at the stop you want to get off on or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it will be right across the street but you need to walk down to it in order to cross...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God (nervous laugh), yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...or something crazy like that, yeah, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's at 2.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although by 2 a lot of the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...a lot of the...some of it is over already.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, it's interesting that they would schedule it for you on a Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I said. You know I wasn't even thinking about that and then you know she was like are you available at all on Monday? And I was like well, yeah, ya know I can do nap time and, um, and then she said well, it is a busy day, ya know, and I was like okay. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hopefully they'll be understanding if you're a little late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (whispers:) Oh my God. Like, so, what I'm gonna do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Different circumstances.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I'm going to get off at the, um, symphony stop and just walk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:02:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's not that far.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's not too far.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then like I know one street that's closed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so if I can...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, then you're coming from above, so it should be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And walking, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...a good plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and I know that that cross street's open so I can just...and the building's on the left side so I'll just cross there and then just walk all the way down on that side of the street.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very good. That's good, you've already thought...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (nervous laughter) Oh yeah. I just don't know how much time to leave, and I've lost sleep over this and because normally I could leave like 45 minutes, ya know. Rather than 2 hours (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you need to be...especially because you've thought about like getting off sort of on top of it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...instead of trying to cross under it. I think, ya know, it'll be...you've done a lot of the logistics already in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (sniffs). I'm like not nearly prepared as I should be, but at this point I just gotta go with it (nervous laugh), so (sniffs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Delayed butterflies.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (nervous laugh). Um, and this weekend Kyle and I went to um, a comedy club and it was so fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's something...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was absolutely hilarious. Um, and besides that I just did homework the whole weekend because, um, after this weekend actually I'm done! Excited. So this is my last week of like class and next week is exams. Um, which I only have two, so, it should be the easiest (inaudible at 00:04:19), yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sighs) I know. Um, oh, I'm like so nervous for this (nervous laugh) interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the position?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it's, um, it's a junior position, um, so a lot of...it's for their private sale company, um, so it's a lot of computer work and I just hope that...ya know they said that you might be quizzed on Excel and I know a lot to know about Excel but there's so much I don't know, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know if I know the right things (nervous laughter), and um, so (sighs). Just gotta get through it (nervous laughter) and (inaudible at 00:05:12), ya know. Um, so (pause) I just hope it goes well because they...you know she said that they're interviewing. They have other candidates and ya know it's tough competition and so...I don't know. It'll be fine. (nervous laugh) I just gotta keep telling myself that. (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're excited about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a good...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (nervous laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it's a good thing to have come across.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't...I just don't know as much as like the design and retail industry as I'm sure, ya know, these other candidates do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you thinking more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, .I...I have...zero (nervous laugh) and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They may spot it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Um, so. And I just, I mean I wanted to, ya know, do more research in design and merchandising this weekend but I have had absolutely no time with my homework.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:06:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did some but just not even close to the amount that I should have, so I'm gonna read after I pick up Lily and we get to the house we can find some computer. I don't know. (sighs) So you just feel like you want 2 o'clock to be here now, ya know (nervous laugh). So, I don't know. Hopefully it goes well, but (sighs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of the most important things in an interview is being excited, being confident about yourself...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...um, and what you know is not as important...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for some positions as your willingness to learn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, ya know, them feeling like you're a good fit for the company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, ya know. Being personable. Which you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, ya know, expressing that you are, ya know, willing to learn and put in time to learn what you need to learn for the position cuz it is a, ya know, you said it's a junior position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they're expecting probably some on-the-job training.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And getting you familiar with what you need to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And hopefully you can get a little time to...for you to feel comfortable, ya know, and so maybe read over some stuff sometime today, whether it be on the commute to or during the play date.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, I think I need to. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may allow you to feel more confident, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got this far. [00:07:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's not...I know it happened so fast. This is, um, the woman who works for the a magazine who just, she happened to be having, um...ya know she was going to pass on my resume and that person passed on my resume to this company, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The power of communication.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, um, and then she said that she had lunch with this other woman on Wednesday and then Friday we talked and now Monday (nervous laugh) we're having an interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it happened so fast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, as they're looking to secure the position right away, um, but I couldn't start till June anyway, which makes me a little nervous, but, um...is that my phone? Um, so (sighs)...I'm sorry (pause). Oh, okay. Just the mother of the...she's away so, um, (sighs)...yeah. That's that (nervous laugh). Sorry. I mean...so next week hopefully I'll know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ya know, if I don't get this job then, ya know, that's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? Then I have to keep applying and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be nice to have some (inaudible at 00:09:44)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is the first one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. Um, so, (pause) um, so what else? Yeah, everything's been pretty good. Um, I'm trying to think what I have to do this weekend but I spent Saturday from 9 to 7 in the library.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's hopefully the last one I'll ever have to do (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, for undergrad, but um (pause) and, oh the weekends just fly by, ya know (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like your concentration is back to normal? [00:10:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To be able to do a long day like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do, but then there's like (inaudible at 00:10:49) around like senioritis and I'm like ehh! Ya know, it's done. Ya know (inaudible at 00:10:53). (nervous laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to know what is coming for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's a long day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is but I had like friends from class there and ya know we had like study groups and we went to lunch and so it wasn't like we were just like (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. You can't possibly...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...be 100 percent focused for 10 hours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. So, um, but I got a lot of work done myself, like it's a lot more to get there in the next two weeks, but I'm used to it at this point (nervous laughter). Last semester as senior, yeah. Um, (sighs) (pause) and...yeah (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's your anxiety at night? [00:11:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), much better than it was. Like much, much better because at first I couldn't even get out of bed at night, like it...but, um, I haven't...I still turn every light on when I (nervous laugh) get up but, um, and...but my roommates are just like, like they leave the door unlocked all night long, ya know. We live in the city and not in the best area, ya know. And they just have no...so I'll get up at 3 in the morning and the people upstairs will be having a party and our door's wide open. Like, ya know, and (pause) like have some common sense, ya know. So, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something that would have bothered you before or it always has? [00:12:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it always has, yeah. Um, just because I mean two houses down from us they got...they were robbed the first day they moved in because ya know they were five college students and no one was paying attention and, um, so...and they just don't like...they'll leave for all day long and not lock the door. Like, what? Um, so, but other than...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that sort of thing's been...you've been aware of that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...not being the smartest choice...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...even before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have to say I have to get up in the middle of the night and check to make sure the door's locked, but...I don't know. That's sort of, ya know, but, um, like even if I know it's locked, that I locked it at night, I still have to get up and check it at like 3 or 2 or 3. Like if I get up to go to the bathroom. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever sleep through the night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never. Not once. I'm up at least like four times a night, but they're quick. Um (pause) but...I mean if I am sick and I have like NyQuil (chuckles) then I will. Um, but that's always been the case. Um (pause) and (pause) uh (yawns) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel when you wake up? [00:14:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I'm tired (nervous laugh). Uh, I don't know. Sometimes I just...well I usually get up to go to the bathroom and then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Four times a night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...well no, not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not typical...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, and then I don't know. Sometimes I just wake up. My boyfriend snores like a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...fricking train (nervous laugh) so, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's probably part of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's part of it. Um, yeah just...I mean it's not like I'm...and then when I wake up ya know I go to the bathroom or lock or check the door and then I come back and I fall right to sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not like I'm up for a large portion of the night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and...oh, my roommates. I cannot wait to never live with them ever again. They...so we, Kyle and I and some of our friends, went to the comedy show on Saturday and we come back—I was late and didn't get home until like 1, um, and ya know expecting to go to bed and my roommates had decided to throw a party in our house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, so (sighs) whatever. Ya know it was sort of dying down anyway and so we go to bed. In the morning we wake up. I got up at like 7 and there is someone asleep in the living room, a man lying in the hallway in front of our door that I had to step over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I go to the kitchen and ya know put on coffee. Come back, step over him again, and close the door. I tell Kyle and he's like that's weird, so ya know we don't think about it. I get up, get our coffee, come back ya know 20 minutes later and as I closed the door I must have woken him up but we...I wasn't paying attention to him, ya know (nervous laughter), so he...we fall back asleep and he gets...he comes into our room. Yeah. And I don't know if he was like on drugs or I don't know, but he wakes Kyle up first and he was like what are you doing in here? I thought we were getting robbed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm...that's scary. [00:16:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so the kid's like "yo." Like totally messed up. So, and ya know my boyfriend's like "you have two seconds to get out of here." So the kid did and he like...started like sitting down on our bed. So my boyfriend like shoves him across the room. The kids goes flying, but he like stands up. This is all like 7 o'clock in the morning, so my boyfriend's like really, like he's really, ya know, strong and whatever. But, um...and this kid was pretty big. I've never seen him, ya know, be so aggressive, but he...the kid was wearing a sweatshirt and he took his sweatshirt and put it over his head and held him like this and dragged him out our front door (chuckles). Well, ya know, okay well, this is a good event for Sunday at 7:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, not that, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's scary to have...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...such personal space violated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so you know not that I condone that sort of behavior. Like there's obvi...there's other ways that that could have been handled but you know it just...that happened like so quickly he like went from ya know feeling like where ya know...this is not an okay situation to three seconds later the kid is being dragged out, ya know, by his hood. And I was like oh, good to have you around. (nervous laugh) You know, I'm glad this is how you...you know because I was like uhh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do we do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh). So, um, I don't know. Good way to start off the day (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and quite an alarming way to start the day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So...and the worst part ya know obviously Kyle was, ya know, mad that this kid just came into our room, so he asked, ya know, our other roommates, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who was he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...who was he. No one knew. So he was probably brought by someone else. He's someone else's friend, so ya know, so that's why I just hate...you know I understand ya know college kids and they have their parties, but just do it at someone's else's house. Because people are so disrespectful and our house is absolutely trashed and (sighs)...I don't know. That's why I just cannot wait to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm, yeah. You're ready to be done with the lifestyle...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...of complete strangers in your house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I... who likes stra...ya know...especially ones who are clearly. This kid was not in his right...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...mind, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, to fall asleep in somebody's hallway...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...ya know. These are not things that every college kid does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are plenty of kids who go through college without falling asleep in a stranger's hallway in front of their bedroom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think everyone (nervous laugh). Yeah it was so...it just was weird. So, um, yeah and no one had any idea who he was. And you know he never...then I was like oh my God he's gonna come back. He's gonna have a gun and so that's where my mind (nervous laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a pretty extreme.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (nervous laugh) I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would absolutely agree that it's not the safest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the safest situation to have, ya know, unknown people in your house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not all of them carry guns.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (nervous laugh) So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes sense to know who your party guests are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ya know, it's alright to lock your...to feel like you should have your door locked at night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know, I don't think these are like outrageous...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are not outrageous expectations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so...I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the same time it doesn't do you any good to imagine that he's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, gonna come back (nervous laugh). I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A mean-spirited, dangerous person. He may very well stumbled his way home and sleep it off and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just don't wanta...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...be more reasonable the next day. [00:20:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, ahh, I just hate being any part of, ya know...like I enjoy a party just like any, ya know, but I like it at someone else's house, ya know (laughs) because (pause) uhh!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to come home to a home...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that feels secure and clean and safe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Whispers:) Only a few more months. (pause) Yeah, I'm just so busy Monday through Friday that when I have like the weekend off, the last thing I want is like (pause)...I like to do nothing on the weekend. I want to read a book.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know I want to watch TV. I want to, ya know...I don't want to wake up in the morning and have people sleeping in the hallway, ya know (nervous laugh)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and not be able, ya know, to sit on my couch because someone puked on it, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ohh! So, I don't know. And none of them work or, ya know, have anything either. So, but Kyle is always saying that, ya know. they live here too and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Which is true but how does he mesh with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you have such different expectations for what your lifestyle is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and I wonder where he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He...I mean he agrees. Ya know he does not want to have, ya know, parties at our house. One, because now that we're all over the age of 21, if we were to be caught by the police having people underage you know drinking at our house, ya know you can be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Held responsible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...yeah, for providing alcohol to minors and they can absolutely screw you if they want to, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um...and one of our roommates does hang out with ya know freshman and sophomores who are 18, 19, ya know. So, um, so I just...that's one...that's his main concern, but, um...and I think but, um, but he also wants to be cool, ya know, with the guys...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and so...I mean he'll never say anything unless...he was not happy on Saturday though when we had no idea, ya know. And then obviously he was not happy in the morning.</p>

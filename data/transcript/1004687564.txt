<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[Door closes]</p>

<p>[Sound of rustling and settling in, being seated]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Inhales] Oh, what <i>isn't</i> on my mind? [Pauses] Um, I'll say: I hate my friends; I fear that I have burned bridges with all of my friendships; rape culture is still infuriating; I hate my sisters. Uh, what else has been going on in the last two weeks? Gary is infuriating. Uh, our Management can't find their ass with both hands and a flashlight. Uh, [chuckles] I don't even know where to start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [sighs] [pauses for five seconds] yikes. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Faintly chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, whatever you like — I mean, feel free to roll.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're furious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Sighs] [pauses] Also, you have heard the news about Akin and his comments about "legitimate rape" and the Julian Assange mess, and [pauses] the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clucks] I don't know a lot about the Assange mess, just a little. Um, the Akin comments — sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the most recent is some [sighs] liberal bigwig commentator — I forget who said that, um, "It is not rape because she consented to it the first time they had sex," and, "You don't have to ask every time you penetrate her." [Clucks] Yeah. [Sighs] [00:02:00]</p>

<p>[Pauses for six seconds] Yeah, so I made some angry posts on Facebook about that, to which a bunch of people were like, "Well, what do <i>you</i> know about rape?" So I was like, "Uh, apart from being a woman and living in a culture filled with rape, I <i>was</i> raped," um, which was the first time I've disclosed that in public, uh, to which I got a whole slew of people saying, "No, you weren't," just like flat-out not believing me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, um, that — that was not [clucks]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was making your point right there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, including both my sisters. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Sighs] So there's that. My family was in town for the weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Exhales]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were infuriating. Um, [pauses] with the usual racist remarks. This time, for some reason, [shifts in seat] - I don't know why I get baited into talking politics with them... [00:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I know it never goes well, but I <i>did</i>. And so we were talking about the — the games that are being played in Ohio with election hours being extended for predominantly Republican counties, and being shortened for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Predominantly Democratic counties, um, because the Elections Commission is 50 percent Republican and 50 percent Democrat, and they set the hours for each county, county-by-county, and the Secretary of State gets to cast the tie-breaking vote.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is fucked up. [Slaps surface] My parents basically said, "Well, why can't you just leave work to vote?" It is like, "Not everyone is allowed to." Like, there's no law that says your employer has to let you leave work to go vote, and they can fire you for absenteeism. So — [pauses] and so my parents said, "Well, if you don't have a good enough job that you can leave work to vote, then you don't deserve to vote." [Shifts in seat a bit] And there were the usual horrible anti-Semitic comments from my father — um, comments about Michelle Obama having a donkey butt. [00:04:06]</p>

<p>Uh, [chuckles] [pauses] at one point — I don't know how this came up, but my — my dad mentioned to Dave that, when I was a child, one of my nicknames that my classmates called me was [inaudible], and that this really upset me. And my sister and my mom were both like, "We never heard of that!" I was like, "Of course you heard that, because I came home crying <i>every day</i> for a <i>whole year</i>." And they were like, "But that's <i>hilarious</i>!" And then they called me [inaudible] for the next hour.</p>

<p>[Shifts in seat] [pauses] [sighs] [sound of something being put down and popping] I don't know. I'm just [sighs] [pauses] feeling really embattled right [voice shakes] now, and that's not pleasant. [00:05:05]</p>

<p>And [pauses] I've been trying to reach out to friends and kind of realizing how very antisocial I was this past year because I was just so beat down by school. And, um, [pauses] — yeah, of the people I know and tried to make plans with, most of them just didn't even respond to my e-mails.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, one person said, "You know, I'm busy this week. How about next week?" [Pauses] So I'm just [sighs] feeling super demoralized and kind of gotten to a spiral of blaming myself for the reason — for my friends not being available because, you know, they've decided they hate me and they're avoiding me because I was a bad friend all spring, and was moody and depressed, and unavailable, and flaky, and — I mean, it is true that I was moody and depressed, and would bail on events with very little warning, and was not reliable, but [sighs] [pauses] [inhales] — I don't know. I feel like they - my maximizing that to, "Now everyone hates you, and you have no friends" is a little bit distorted thinking. [00:06:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] yeah. I finally got in to see Dr. Morgan, to talk about meds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've seen him three times now, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...He thinks I shouldn't be on any medication at all, which I am finding a little bit scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, it seems to be working out. I mean, I'm not having more problems with work than I was having while I was still on the Celexa. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm — I'm not, uh, trying to question his judgment; I'm just wondering what was — that's not something often heard from psychiatrists. [00:07:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was he — what was his thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [sighs]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it is not any you were going to want to reduce, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Uh, yeah, what was his thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, his thinking was that, because I wasn't having physical symptoms anymore, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Sleeplessness or appetite issues...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, and that, you know, because I have all of these situational changes, that maybe the — not being in grad school or just being in a different environment...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, would be enough to kind of shake the — the brain patterns loose, and then I wouldn't need it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, I still have Ativan to take as needed, which was reassuring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have, like, nine, but I can rely (ph) on that if I need to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure, [pauses four seconds] especially in the week your parents have been in town [inaudible at 08:04] (ph) [00:08:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] [faintly] Yeah. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 21 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So [pauses for seven seconds] it sounds to me like you're kind of short-circuited by rage at this point?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like there's <i>so</i> much that you're <i>so</i> angry about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You're kind of somewhat shut down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And, I mean, the things I talked about are the major things, but there is just, like, all this other stuff that I'm getting angrier about than I would under normal circumstances. Like, [pauses] on Monday, my company e-mailed us with this stupid policy that we <i>have</i> to take free vacation days by the end of September, and I'm saving my vacation days for this stupid trip in May. [00:09:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Well, it was horribly upsetting, and I got nothing done with Gary Monday because of this and a cycle of anger, and anxiety over that. And [pauses for five seconds] yeah, but a personal trainer I've been working with, um, quit. He turned in his resignation at the gym that I belong to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, he said we would take private personal training clients; he just didn't want to be associated with this gym anymore. And his price is — he's actually charging a lot less, like $50 an hour less than The gym was charging their — the same service that, uh — you know, I prepaid at The gym for 10 weeks' worth of sessions and, of course, he's quitting, and The gym is refusing to refund me for the six weeks or however... [00:10:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have lots. They said I have to use it with one of their other staff trainers, but I don't <i>like</i> any of their other staff trainers. I've interviewed almost all of — not all of them but probably three-quarters of them, and most of them are of the, you know, "You need to have a feminine shape. Don't lift heavy because you'll get big muscles and look like a man," blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit school of thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, you know, I don't want to spend money for that crap, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Inhales] So, yeah, I've got [chuckles] nothing but anger right now. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is pretty [chuckles] terrible. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I would imagine it feels pretty miserable most of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also that you feel pretty out of control, not of, like, your behavior but, uh, [pauses] like there's nothing you can do about it, really. [00:11:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It is not need to coming along] (ph) to piss you off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 49 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:12:00]</p>

<p>[Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I'm just — I'm thinking about it. Um, [pauses for 25 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, um, [pauses 44 seconds] —</p>

<p>[00:13:00]</p>

<p>Right - I mean, I remember last time [pauses for five seconds] I think we were talking about something pretty closely related to do with, [pauses] um, [pauses] kind of your vulnerability around all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, [pauses for 11 seconds] and [pauses for 15 seconds] —</p>

<p>[00:14:00]</p>

<p>I guess one question that I'm [something drops] struggling with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Which is going to sound stupid, so let me explain myself. [Chuckles] Or maybe it is just stupid, but I'll still try to explain myself. Is — so, like, for example with your family...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Um, [pauses] I could've even predicted, let alone you, that they would have made any number of comments...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or tried to, you know, however they baited you into talking politics.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] I don't mean by that it is still surprising you'd be upset. God knows I'm not trying to justify the way they were acting or treating you... [00:15:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [Fidgets] [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ....But it isn't new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] And [pauses] yet there's a kind of [pauses] — I think like a fresh quality to your, like, indignation and anger about it. And I'm not trying to call you irrational; I'm just trying to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Figure out the reasons that could happen. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, like, [pauses] one that occurs to me [pauses] is — I'm going to [turn it out] (ph), which is an example of something. Maybe you wanted to be different even if you know better...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...'Cause they're the only family you've got. [00:16:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, [pauses] uh [pauses] and it is no point in giving up on the only family you've gotten, either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there's, you know, like hope for them on one hand and a "how could you say that?" feeling on the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for 25 seconds] — [00:17:00]</p>

<p>Uh, [pauses] another thing could be [pauses for eight seconds] — and this is like something I'm going go on about you again; I've been on it before — I don't think you're just angry; I think you're also terribly hurt. I mean, in each instance, even with the trainer, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You know, a lot of them like — this — a lot of insulting of you going on. I — like, which you react in part to really, really mad....</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...But I think which also really hurts. There's sort of this related... [00:18:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure I would say "hurt" as it is unfair, like a sense of being treated unjustly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially this bullshit with vacation at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because I didn't want to go on this stupid, fucking trip in the first place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a trip with your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Exhales] Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — I told you about that. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you told me about, like, how they've been sort of proposing it every year...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you didn't believe, when you told them the one week you couldn't go, and, of course, it is the week they booked it, and it looks like it is going to happen and....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, they've paid for the tickets now, and how can I...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It is — yeah] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses for five seconds] It is just not fucking fair that I tried to be [pauses] a reasonable human being, and [slaps surface] expected my parents to understand that I was trying to be a reasonable human being when I said, "You know, on these dates, I have a trip planned. I <i>could</i> cancel it if I <i>absolutely</i> had to, but I've already planned the trip and booked the hotel, so try to pick another week." [00:19:11]</p>

<p>Like, in <i>my</i> universe, any reasonable person would say, "OK, let's not book over that week," but, no, they booked over it, and they were like, "Well, you said you could cancel it and it was no big deal." It is like, "No, I said I could cancel it if I absolutely had to and there was no other way."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I had asked you beforehand what they were going to do...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should have been able to predict that one, but....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Becomes emotional] [Intonates] But, like, when reasonable people offer to make concessions!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're entirely right! I don't disagree with that [chuckles] at all. And I'm not — I don't actually think this is like, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Intonates] I mean, it is like....!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Expecting (ph) something you didn't want to predict, is what I suspect because... [00:20:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Yeah. [Intonates] I mean, [it is like if someone] (ph) comes to your house for dinner, and they offer to do dishes, you're not supposed to let them actually do dishes! Right? Like... [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Struggling for words]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] [sighs] It is one of those things that polite people say, and it is just pro forma, and no one actually thinks they mean it. [Slaps surface] [Sighs] [Pauses] So now, not only am I stuck going on this trip that I didn't even want to go on, even if it were optimally scheduled - but it is not; it is scheduled over an event I wanted to go to, and now I am going to have to take unpaid vacation to go on it because my work is fucking [me over] (ph) with this bullshit. "We need to get vacation days off our books," blah, blah, and accounting bullshit, blah. [Sighs] [00:21:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for nine seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [pauses] how does it make a difference if you don't go on the trip?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My parents will feel wounded and insulted, and tell me I don't love them and that I'm a horrible daughter, and don't I want to spend time with my family. There will be a guilt trip for weeks or potentially months leading up to and then after the trip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [pauses] — uh, I'm not bringing this up to try to push you not to go but just to sort of explore some of this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that that much worse than what would happen anyway?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Briefly exhales] No. [Pauses] Well, it is not, but if I go, at least I'll have the moral high ground of being able to say, "Well, I did the dutiful thing. I did the <i>right</i> thing, so..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It <i>does</i> seem like that's a part of this...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles in exasperation]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Is the moral high ground part. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Whispers] Yeahhh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] it doesn't sound that satisfying. Not — you know, it is not fair. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you're right. It is awfully cold comfort.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, [pauses for 12 seconds] um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 15 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it <i>does</i> make you feel badly, say, for it to have that, in that it differentiates you from them. [00:23:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That, like, when the shit's really flying around in the family, it can be hard to know who the hell did what to whom...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ....You know, when the volume goes up and all that. Maybe it <i>is</i> like a — you know, something you can kind of clingy onto.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if it doesn't make you feel good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't make you feel like very much distinct from them, and part of the real world and how people really do things that [seem to hit] (ph) on a good day or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[Silence for 23 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:24:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Mine and Dave's current plan...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...This is so ridiculous — is to do our absolute best to get pregnant in the next two month because most airlines won't let you fly internationally in the third trimester, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is kind of ridiculous, but [pauses] [inhales]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, good luck with that for many reasons.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] It is m — probably the only excuse [slaps surface] my parents would actually accept for us bailing on the trip at this point. [Sighs]</p>

<p>[00:25:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 1 minute 16 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat a few times]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [pauses five seconds] then again, it does seem like you hold onto those sort of wish to be in your good regard and hope that, by doing the right things, you can be, and that that will really make a difference in how they treat you?</p>

<p>[Silence for 14 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, if I'm honest with myself, they won't treat me any better even if I did everything perfectly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has never worked before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It hasn't [chuckles] worked for my sister.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:26:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she managed to, uh, play the good daughter a lot longer and a lot better than I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She had zero strife with them when she was in high school — none at all. It was freakish, beyond freakish. [Pauses] And then they shit all over her, too, so — [pauses]</p>

<p>No, I don't [pauses] — I don't understand why it is so important to me to do right by them, [pauses] because it is not making me happy, and they're not happy, and I don't know if there is anything I could possibly do that <i>would</i> make them happy. [Sighs] [00:28:00]</p>

<p>[Pauses for ten seconds] I don't know. Maybe it is some kind of misplaced pride that, you know, well, you've just been a horrible human being that I can be with a good person and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Be dutiful. I don't know. It doesn't make much sense, does it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I actually believe these things sort of <i>do</i> tend to make sense. They don't necessarily work, but, I mean, maybe that really does make a difference. Maybe you're really worried you're actually like them or that they're right about something they've said about you, and so anything that helps to, you know, um, make you feel different....</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Slaps surface] [Faintly] Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Such as acting morally really <i>matters</i>. [00:29:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes, I wish that they'd make the decision to cut me out of their lives so that I don't have to make that call.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, if they did, I'm sure it would hurt but I think, in the long run, I would be better off without them in my life., and that's — that's awfully depressing to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd be better off without my parents in my life, but it is true. Like, they...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Pauses] It takes <i>days</i> to recover any kind of sense of self-worth or anything after I see them, um — after Christmas break last year, I was just so beaten down by them that I didn't even get out of bed for three days after I got home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:30:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was — it was [whispers] really, really bad [exhales], and it is just....</p>

<p>[Shifts in seat] [Exhales]</p>

<p>[00:31:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 1 minute 14 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 14 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, in spite of all of the rage at my parents' visit and all of that crap that's going on, [pauses] I still think my quality of life is demonstrably better than it was six months ago or a year ago. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good deal. [00:31:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, last night, a friend sent me a message on Twitter saying, you know, "By the way, I'm doing an open mike out of a bar in your neighborhood" or "kind of near your neighborhood. Do you want to come over?" And, you know, <i>even</i> as little as three or four months ago, you know, once I got home and changed out of my work clothes... [slaps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...<i>No-thing</i> would have gotten me out of the house because the thought of putting on clothes was just too exhausting, much less going somewhere, even somewhere that's a ten-minute walk away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I mean, I was like, "Sure! I'll come listen to you play," and put my pants back on and went out and had a great time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I was really glad I went. I mean, [pauses] I've started making plans with people two or three weeks out in the future, and have a reasonable confidence that I'll actually go, which is not something I could <i>ever</i> have done. [00:32:58]</p>

<p>Like [pauses] for the last three years, I have just avoided making plans because I would bail on people at the last minute or, you know, not even tell people that I wasn't going and just not go because I couldn't get out of bed, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, going to a matinee...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, the theater in the Square at three in the afternoon — I'd start dreading it as soon as I'd wake up at ten, and drag my feet about getting dressed and getting showered. And then it would be 3:30, and I'd be, like, "Shit, I haven't showered yet, and the play is already setting. Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed," and it was just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] It was <i>awful</i> living like that, and that's not happening anymore. It is — it is <i>amazing</i>.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>[Silence for 30 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it is huge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Faintly] Yep. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 28 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dr. Morgan mentioned the last time I saw him was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, you know, I'd mentioned the — you know, I hear my dad's voice in my head a lot, telling me that I'm stupid and I'm worthless, and trying to learn how to identify that and put it aside so that it doesn't interfere with my life. [00:35:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he told me I should definitely bring that up with you to — as something to be aware of. So I don't know — I'm sure...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 35:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm sure we have talked about it [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, uh, he — he seemed very adamant that, uh, I tell you he thinks it is very important that we work on, like, um — like actual conscious ways for me to deal with that when it comes up in the moment. [Shifts in seat] Well, I don't know. He called it an "interject?" I think I'm remembering that word correctly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, "interject" — yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>[Sound of air conditioner begins]</p>

<p>[Silence for ten seconds]</p>

<p>[00:36:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He also gave me a laundry list of other things I need to do. You know, actually get a primary care physician. He gave me a list of labs he wants the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...General practitioner to do and — yeah. Yuck (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>[Silence for nine seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you like him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Exhales] I'm willing to work with him. I'll put it that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, uh — um, [pauses] — uh, would you mind elaborating [chuckles]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, let me also say — so I...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I would not want to see him for weekly therapy. I don't think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The rapport was good enough for that. [00:37:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, for check-ins every two months and keeping meds and all of that, that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, OK. Were there things that really bothered you about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] He's very paternalistic in a, "You should do this because it is good for you" kind of way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I react really badly to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and also just got off on the wrong foot when he was taking my history at our first appointment, and he asked about trauma and, um — and I mentioned some of the stuff with my parents and, um, I talked about the rape that happened when I was in college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was like, "Well, did you report it to the police?" I was like, "Have you had no training about sexual assault?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm surprised he asked that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles in exasperation]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I told him several (ph) didn't know because I didn't think the police would believe me, and I didn't want to — I just didn't have the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you had just been raped. [00:38:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um, by someone I was dating, who's also a member of my church. So, like, it was just — like, "No, I didn't go to the police!" "Well, you should go to the police now. It is not too late. There is no statute of limitations on rape."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No! I don't want to do that because I'm not going to put myself through the nightmare that is police reporting of sexual assault [shifts in seat]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Over something that happened a decade ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Becomes emotional] [intonates] And especially because I kept dating the guy? Like, there's — there's no possible way going to the police [slaps surface] could <i>possibly</i> go well in <i>any</i> universe. But [exhales] yeah, now I don't. [Sighs] On the other hand, he certainly seemed like a competent physician and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that clinician — I've secured (ph) one other patient with him a few years ago...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And, um, you know, like, I've heard a few pretty decent reports, but, uh, you know... [00:39:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, yet I know [inaudible 39:07] probably should have [checked in with him once or twice] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 18 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other views (ph) about assault, I think, are mostly due to his age. He's older, as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think people of his generation are much more about the, you know, "Well, of <i>course</i>, you go to the police because the police are good and honorable, and that's what you do" than the people of my generation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>[Silence for 12 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:40:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, so this thing about, uh, trying to get pregnant in the next few months...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeahhh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, apart from the vacation. I don't — I don't know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what you've thought about it, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, we've <i>been</i> trying to get pregnant for, like, years now. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, in part, this vacation is, you know, a great kick in the butt to actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Get on the phone with fertility specialists and get tests done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With all of that jazz and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you not, um — I guess [at least I am — I don't know if you've talked about it] (ph) — like have you — did you not start that process?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I know it is like a whole thing. [00:40:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean — so there's my general antipathy towards the medical profession and lack of trust in doctors, which is, one, I don't have a GP or a gynecologist that I go to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then there is also this whole added layer of what if there is something wrong with my body and I can't get pregnant, and that's just immensely scary, so I just — I haven't been able to force myself to make an appointment for that first consultation yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, like a [drive-by] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Silence for 15 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you thought much about if you couldn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] I think, at that point, we'd adopt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:42:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My stomach is hurting even thinking about this right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 'Cause it makes you so anxious?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't mean that in a figure-of-speech kind of way. My stomach is actually physically...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, I — I take it as...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Hurting right now. [Exhales]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...As a somatic thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um, [pauses] to drop it since you just had a [cough and you were turning bright red] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ehhh, [somewhat emotional] I don't know.</p>

<p>[Silence for six seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, are you — is it anxiety or dread, or [pauses] something else? [00:43:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I — don't know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, those are some fine-grained distinctions and, really, all I feel is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your stomach hurting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [Pauses for five seconds] [It is a long cycle] (ph). Yeah, that makes sense. [Chuckles] Like, I mean, yeah. Um, I guess it has been terribly hard to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, uh, [pauses for 13 seconds] Well, why don't we stop for now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Four-thirty tomorrow?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. [Rises from seat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Door opens and closes]</p>

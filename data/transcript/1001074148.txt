<P>THE SWISH PATTERN 2 - STEVE & CONNIRAE ANDREAS</P>
<P>______________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: The Swish Pattern is an amazingly rapid and powerful new submodality method developed by Richard Bandler. Since the pattern has already been described in a fair amount of detail in the book <I>Using Your Brain for a Change</I>, we don’t spend much time on this tape discussing the pattern itself. If you’d like an outline you can find that in the book. In this session, I’m demonstrating gathering information and designing a Swish in the auditory system. This piece is taken from the second day of a weekend workshop on the Swish pattern in September 1985. Since this is a teaching seminar, I took quite a bit longer to do this than I would if I were working with this woman as a private client. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Is there a response that you have, that you don’t like? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Is that what this is? In a particular context or set of contexts.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, great. So now were all going to play, “Stealing Her Behavior,” find out how she’s broken, right? Well enough so that we can all do it inside our own heads. That’s going to be our goal. So, is this something that we can talk about the content on?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, it’s OK.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so something with your daughter, right?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, how she pushes my buttons. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Especially my oldest one. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so how is it that you get your buttons pushed? What do you have to do inside your head, to get your buttons pushed? How is this possible? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Got any ideas?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Well, a good place to start on this is to find out <I>when</I> it happens. Because that can help you zero in and target what you want. So <I>when</I> does it happen? Give me an example.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Checking all over.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Maybe she’s fixed. [Laughter] You <I>say</I> you can do this.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I know. (To Bob, in the group.) What’s the example you just used last night? That was a perfect one. The one we talked about with Megan and Jahan. There’s so many, and I’m blanked.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, take a moment to just go inside yourself.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: OK. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: You may even want to shut your eyes a moment. And if one comes up that you don’t want to talk about the content, we can go ahead with that, too. So just take a moment. You may want to start--you’ve got one already? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: No. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Sometimes what helps is to begin with the emotional response you get that you don’t like, and use that as a memory search. So you use that feeling and you kind of notice as you open your eyes what situation are you in when you have that response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: OK, when she, ah--I respond when she gets this attitude, a physical attitude to her body. The way she adjusts her body, and she just, like that. [Bobbie moves her face and upper body forward in a “defiant” posture.]</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: She looks in certain--?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: She looks a certain posture and she gets real, on her position, immobile and just really negative face, like--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK good, demonstrate it for us here. [Laughter]</P>
<P>BOBBIE: She’s like that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: You’re able to do it already, get your body. OK.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: And she does that, and its just like, I’ll be trying to talk with her, and she’ll just, you know--or reason with her, and she won’t want to have anything of it. She’s just, you know, I’m going to be this way, I’m going to be bummed out, and I’m going to piss you off. And at one point, it’s like I stop talking and go Ahhh!--just ready to kill her.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: This is beginning to make some sense, already.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: You’ve gone through this even with your own [kids] probably.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: They’re not old enough yet, to be really annoying. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: To really push your buttons. Yeah, she’s really good. She knows exactly the combinations. How to go past the “beyond” button.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so we have a general idea. But we don’t really know what you do inside your head yet. We know when to do it, what we might see on the outside, but I bet it’s possible for you to look at somebody out here [in the group] having that physical posture, and not have that response; is that true?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So if someone out there were to sit with that posture, would you do the same thing or not?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: No. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: That doesn’t get your buttons. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: No.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So one good way to understand and get someone to notice what they’re doing inside their brain is by contrast. You find an example of when they <I>do</I> it, and then you find a very close example of when they <I>don’t</I> do it.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I don’t <I>like</I> that same posture, but it doesn’t--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: But it doesn’t push your buttons.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I think it’s being “on position,” which is exactly what <I>I</I> do a lot.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, this is theory, this is theory and that’s not what we need to know. What we <I>do</I> need to know is when she sees her daughter in that posture like that, what does she do to that picture, or voice, or feeling or what--what does she do on the inside, that makes her have an emotional response that she doesn’t like? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I don’t get my own way.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK and that’s the theory too. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: And, what do I do? </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: But what do you do inside your head? Because you could probably see a sculpture of that, for example, and it wouldn’t get to you, right?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I wouldn’t like it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It may not be the one you want to <I>buy</I> and place in your living room.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s like I wouldn’t want to go next to someone and sit next to someone in that posture, but I wouldn’t walk out either.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So that’s fine. That’s fine. That’s enough of a contrast for us--to assist us in helping her notice the difference. So if you <I>compare</I>, what do you do in your head when you see the statue that’s different than what you do when you see your daughter? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: They’re not talking. I mean it’s personal with her.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so what if Bob does this, and he talks? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Obviously, that doesn’t work. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now, is the voice tone different?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, she has a--I think it’s, it might be the voice tone. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It could be. Maybe, maybe not. Let me give you--another thing that sometimes helps people to zero in on this information is to give a few examples of the kind of thing that were talking about here. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: This is a hard one, because I haven’t been able to figure it out myself. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: No one has though. It’s hard for everyone. This is not the kind of thing we ordinarily do. And that’s what makes it so interesting. It’s a total new world in there when you discover, “Well, that’s how I get my buttons pushed.” Or “That’s how I get angry, that’s how I get something else.” So let me give you an example--for all of you. One person that I was working with recently was talking about being intimidated. I’m not sure if that was her exact word, but that seemed to be the response she was going into. And particularly when there are a lot of other people around, and when they looked at her, that’s when she would really get most intimidated, when they looked at her. Now it turned out what she was doing on the inside is she wasn’t just seeing someone looking at her. </P>
<P>She was--I had her imagine someone’s head turning toward her. And what she would see, is the closer they turned toward her, the bigger their eyes got, until their eyes were extremely huge, staring at her. Now that’s enough to intimidate someone a little bit. That ought to work pretty well for most people. Think about if you did that inside any time someone turned and looked at you. All of the sudden their eyes become three-foot saucers, staring at you. For most people that would work really well. So that’s the kind of thing that people do on the inside to build these responses. Once you understand, you find out in detail like that, it makes perfect sense. Hey, that’s a good way to get intimidated, that ought to work. </P>
<P>Another example is someone who got angry and didn’t want to. This would happen when he’s driving --among other times. He’d be driving down the road. He’d see somebody doing something that he didn’t like, driving-wise. They might be doing something slightly illegal or annoying in some way. Then what he would do is he would make a picture in his mind of his truck which was very important to him, in an accident with this other car or vehicle crashed in to it. And he would zero in on the dent. And then he would get furious at their driving behavior. So does that make sense? Would that work? Some of these things even if they don’t quite work for you, you could see that they could. They could work for someone. It’s in enough detail; “Yeah, that could work. That could be a good way to get angry.” </P>
<P>So it’s never just the stimulus. It’s what someone does with it. It’s not just the car; it’s that zooming in on it that gets him angry. So usually there’s something like this that <I>changes</I> and creates more of a response the more someone does it. So it’s these eyes getting bigger. People do swish themselves in the same way that you were learning to swish each other yesterday. And this kind of gradual shift is <I>great</I> for building an intense response. So does that give you some idea of the kind of thing were searching for?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, I think I zoom in. When it’s all overall, it’s OK somehow. When it’s her whole thing in context, I seem to be able to stay pragmatic and talk.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: (You can) have your resources and be a reasonable adult human being. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah. Exactly. When you said zoom in, I kind of think I zoom in on her face. Or Jamaica is my little girl. And I lose my temper; it goes right on to their face and their voice. Because both of them have these horrid sounding voices, like kids do, like adults do, they go Waaaaah and it sounds awful. And Maica is this little high-pitched obnoxious. But Zara has this voice that drives me crazy. It’s like I just see her face and hear the voice, and when the picture gets that small [Bobbie’s brings her hands together, fingertips touching.] then it’s like I lose it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK now, were starting to get more details here. However, since she’s mentioning one of the submodalities that I just mentioned, mainly zeroing in, I’m going to test harder than if she mentioned a new one. If she brings one up I haven’t mentioned it’s more reliable than if she brings one up that I have already mentioned. So, and it may be that that’s exactly the one and I hit on it. But I’m just going to be more <I>careful</I>. OK, so we’ll do a lot of testing, and we’ll do some exploring, and have her try some other things out too, just to find out if she can get the response any other way. So if you make this image of your daughter now—</P>
<P>BOBBIE: when I’m losing my temper? </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: The way she looks when you-- If you look at it now, and don’t zoom in for a moment. [Bobbie goes into her anger.] Zoom out! [Laughter]</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Too late. [Laughter]</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It’s definitely zooming out. That really works well. But what I want you to do is take the voice off and find out if just zooming in alone will do it.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: OK.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: We’ll want to test one thing at a time. Just zoom in on the picture. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I don’t like it, but it doesn’t freak me out. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, now zoom out again. Just the picture. Does that make you feel better?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah. More relaxed. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so you test both ways. Make it go this way; make it go this way. If you’ve got the right one, or one of the right ones, it should test out both ways. I’m going to start to write some of these things down. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s amazing to discover exactly what you’re doing. You think of all the years you could have changed it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so in the visual system there’s zoom, or zoom-in, or focus-in, however you want to talk about that. And that gets some response. Although she’s indicating now that when she takes the auditory off it’s not as strong.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Not nearly.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Not nearly as strong. So let’s check for anything else you could do in the visual system that may get this response, just to test this thoroughly.You see her face like that, or body movement. Try out a few things. Make the picture bigger.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I don’t like that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Does it get the response that you call “pushing your buttons”?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Close. It’s not as serious.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It looks different, see? It looks different nonverbally. She’s doing a different thing. So this doesn’t look like what she ordinarily sees.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It doesn’t feel good. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, she doesn’t like it, but it’s not the same response. Does that fit with your observations? You have to be real careful when you do this kind of behavior stealing about what response you are going for. And what I’m trying to find out is not if she has some other intense response when she does these other weird things, but what will produce the button pushing. OK, so try making it brighter. Go for some of the standards. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It doesn’t do anything. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: That doesn’t do anything, and I agree with her by watching her. Not much response to that. Now, what I want you to do is try out noticing the difference now between that and when you imagine someone else in that posture. Like Bob, or anyone else in that posture. And just notice if any other differences appear to you. Is one of them clearer or fuzzier than the other? Is one of them closer, or further away?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: He’s clearer, she’s a lot less clear, she’s dimmer in that body position.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: She’s dimmer?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: They’re both the same distance. She’s not—I mean she’s there, but its not a clear picture.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, make it a little dimmer and find out if that does anything to your response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s more relaxing. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, make it brighter. That didn’t do anything before already, so that’s not going to do it. Umm, check for other differences. Are they both in color?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: No. He’s in color; she’s in black and white. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, turn her into color and find out if it’s the same.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, I don’t like it. I don’t like when she’s in color.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Its different, a different response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It makes me feel like I’m starting to get irritated. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, that might make it even worse. I don’t get the sense that that’s the way she ordinarily drives this thing. Is that--</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, that’s right. What you said.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. She probably keeps it in black in white to keep it from being too awful.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, it controls it. Black and white is just kind of muted over there. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, OK. So so far visually zooming in gets the strongest impact. Let’s shift to auditory now. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: That’s not good.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: That’s right. That’s where the real winners are I think. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I’m like--ready to jump off the chair.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: When you hear that.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, I don’t even have to get a clear hearing.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So now we just find out what you have to do to that sound to make you ready to jump off the chair.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: High pitches.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So if the pitch goes up?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So lower the pitch. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: That’s much better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so that has a big impact, right? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It doesn’t feel great but it’s much better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Pitch. So when the pitch goes higher, her response gets more intense. Pitch higher; all right, now is there anything else that you do with that voice, to get the response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Her face with it—just her face.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: That helps?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: That intensifies it if I bring her face in to it. Because that’s what I see.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: How do you bring her face into it? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s just like, there. [Bobbie gestures with both hands, fingertips touching, about six inches from her face.]</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Just the head? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, it’s just the head, just like this. [Bobbie gestures with her hands again.] Yeah it’s just her face, just like the front.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now, does anything happen to that face?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah she has a horrible expression on her face.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And do you do anything with that picture? Do you zero in on that, even though its a small one? Do you zero in on that?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It just becomes her face and her voice. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so we’re back to that visual. Go back to the voice, I want to push that a little bit farther, and find out if there are any other possibilities. So I’m going to have her try out some standard ones. Just to test, and give her an idea of the range of possibilities that there are, to make sure we haven’t “overlistened” something, so to speak. Now, so you listen to the voice; try making it louder. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I don’t want to. [Laughter]</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: That works real well, doesn’t it? Now, does that push your buttons in the same way, or get a different response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s the same; it makes it even worse. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. So volume--that works really well.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: She has a high volume when she doesn’t usually anyway. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It’s a “high” volume. That indicates to me that the pitch and loudness are here in that experience. We didn’t talk a lot about this yesterday, but some of these things are linked inside our heads, and different ones are linked for different people. For some people when you make a picture brighter, it gets bigger at the same time automatically. And it’s--what I’d like you to check on is, when you make it louder does it also go higher? Try that out and just notice.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Nothing this time.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Try it out and make it higher and see if it gets louder or not.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so the linking goes in that way. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Higher, then louder.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: The pitch works better for carrying the other one. OK. When you find certain ones that will carry the others, those are the ones to use. So you may get several of them that will get a response. And then some of them are what I refer to as “carriers.” You do that and you get the whole thing. And then you get a really full response. </P>
<P>MAN: Is that the same as the ones that are “driving”?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. “carriers,” “drivers,” we use both of those words. That’s one you could do and it gets the whole ball of wax. Everything comes along with it. And that makes it--that means that you can drive the whole response really quickly with one or two variables, rather than doing it piece by piece. “OK, now do this one, and add this one, and add this one in, and there’s a lot of work for her to do consciously, and the timing may be off, and so on. But if you can find some of these carriers or drivers you can get the response [Connirae snaps her fingers] right there when you want it. OK. So pitch works really well. Volume is carried by pitch. Let’s try a few others. What about distance? Take the voice and move it in closer.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: No, I don’t like that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Is it the same, or different. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s the same. Well, it would be hard to reply to her, but it feels awful.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now move it farther away. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: That’s much better. She’s on the horizon, I can’t hear her. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now which do you think works better so far at getting your buttons pushed really well. Does pitch work better?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, I agree; it works better.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Pitch and the volume. When all three are there, it’s like--face.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And then move it in close. So one, two and three would be the ranking [pitch, volume, closeness]. Closer. She acts a little different when she moves it closer, so I’m not quite convinced it’s the same response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It feels quite uncomfortable when she’s close, but I don’t want to respond so much. She’s about where you are right now physically, and that’s like--the most irritating.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Did you guys see that? When she does it closer, she does a different nonverbal shift than when she does those other ones. So I watch for nonverbal shifts, and I also ask her, “Is this the <I>same</I> response? Is this the same way you got your buttons pushed?” What other things might we try auditorily? Volume? Distance? Pitch? Those are some of the key ones. Tempo can be an important one too; so try that one. Speed up the tempo, just to give you guys an idea of some of the range too.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I’m not, not a lot.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Slow it down.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s better.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So, this one isn’t really a driver for this response.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s--her voice is argumentative. When I grew up, my parents argued. I went to sleep every night with my parents screaming. And I think it’s the—it’s the high-pitched and argumentative and its more rapid, its like—and I feel terrible.[Laugher] Yeah, it’s like when she becomes like all that, it’s a whole carry-over from then. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, now are you talking about when you speed it up that happens?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: When it’s it’s not--it’s not real rapid, but it’s the tone and tempo when people argue which is like, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so in other words what she’s saying is that it’s a <I>digital</I> shift. It’s a particular category of tempo that she recognizes as argumentative. This is not the analog or continuous one that were interested in. We want to get a continuous one, something that changes, that she can change to make it worse. And that’s what were going to make use of. Does that make sense? Is that clear? OK, great, it is to you.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: And you just made me think of why I never could change it when I was a child. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I can think of a lot of reasons why you couldn’t change it as a child. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I never could say anything. I couldn’t say, “Please don’t argue.” I had no control. It’s like I lose control, and I always wanted to go in and just do something. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Do something. And that’s the content, which you may need to listen to some of, but it’s not going to help you get your method figured out. Does that make sense?</P>
<P>MAN 2: When you talk about a digital shift. Are you talking about an instantaneous shift? </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I mean it’s categorical--the way she responds to it is in a categorical way. She hears that and her brain goes, “Oh, that’s this category.” It’s not that she makes it faster and that infuriates her more the faster it gets; it’s a particular tempo and particular cadence.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: And pitch.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: And pitch and so on. But the pitch she can use to make it worse. So that’s an analog or continuous one.</P>
<P>MAN 2: So you wouldn’t do anything with it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I’m not going to do anything with the tempo. That’s like the way I code my pleasant memories in orange. It’s a little more like that, than something you want to use for this method as an analog. OK. Now we’ve got some really good drivers here in auditory. Let’s check in the kinesthetic system to be very thorough about this. Do you do anything kinesthetically here besides feeling your buttons pushed? It’s really unlikely. I would never do this with a client. I would never push it in to the kinesthetic system, given I have had no leads from her in that area, and it’s not that someone’s touching her. She has a kinesthetic response, but I have no indication that there are any kinesthetic cues or triggers. Does that make sense? OK, good. OK, so now we know we take a voice at a certain tempo and so on. We raise it up in pitch and it gets louder in volume, and at the same time that we zero in on a face with a particular look, that’s something that gets her angry, or pushes her buttons, or makes her want to do something, right? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Right.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so to test it again, we can have her try it one more time. We’ve already done that, I don’t think we need to do that again. To really test it, to push it further in the testing we can have her try it with somebody else. So let’s not have you do this with Bob, but make up another person who’s not here. Can you do that? Put them in that kind of a posture, with that kind of a voice tempo. Have the pitch get higher and louder as you zero in on their face.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yes, That’s awful.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So we can use that mechanism to get her to have the same response in another context. Does that make sense as a test?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, good. Now, when I do those things, I don’t quite have the same response that she does. But in this case, I can--this is possible; this makes sense. And it’s detailed enough; It’s specific and step-by-step enough that I can walk her through it. So I have all the information I need for stealing her behavior. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: [joking] You can have it. [Laughter] I don’t want it.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So the next step now is to think about, This is the particular response someone has. Where might this be useful? What is the response you have, by the way when she, when your buttons get pushed, what--you get furious? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I start screaming back at her, you know; and I used to lose it really bad and now I lose it, but then I have—because I changed myself. There are certain things that I just go, “Go to your room!” Yeah, I’ll grab her sometimes--not hardly <I>ever</I> anymore do I grab, because I’m frightened of that. I grabbed her a couple of times really hard, and that really scared me.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So where is this useful? And think in terms of structure, not the content she’s using it on. It’s never going to be useful in that same content because she’s complaining about it, so obviously it’s not useful in that content area. </P>
<P>MAN 3: It could be useful to get a room open. [Laughter. That morning the hotel meeting room was locked.] </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: There you go; that’s right. I used something similar this morning. Right. Very rapid, outraged response. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It could be used when you’re frightened and you just wanted to be just very authoritative and strong, to get a response from another person. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: To be able to mobilize a response very rapidly.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, survival-oriented. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: There are certain things, if you have to sit back and make a ponderous decision, you know, it’s too late in certain kinds of life-or-death situations. You have to mobilize yourself instantly. So for mobilization, it’d be really good. Feel free to think far afield on this. This is to loosen up your thinking a little bit, it’s not necessarily that you’re going to take this particular way and use it yourself, or anything like that, but having this frame of, “Where could you use this? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, really. To wake up. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, really. Get you going fast in the morning. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Better than coffee.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now you’re thinking. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, if you could do it without the negativity, you’d be out of bed and flying. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, and in fact the general way of getting a rapid change in state is exactly what we’re going to use later, to change your state in another direction. So it’s very useful that way. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It would be good in the sense that, when I’m like that I’m real strong. It would be good if you needed strength instantly. That runs my adrenaline so quickly by running it right off three or four times--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So if you needed to lift a car off of an accident victim? </P>
<P>WOMAN 2: I can think like that and I’m sure I could lift a car off--.</P>
<P>MAN 3: At the start of the race. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: At the start of the race? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, that would mobilize real well.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So, now what were going to do in order to make it interesting for you guys is we’re just going to do the Swish auditorily--limit it to that and find out if that works, just in and of itself. Simply auditorily without messing with the face stuff. If that doesn’t work we’ll add in the face later. OK? [To Bobbie] You’ll play with anything? Nothing to lose; lot to gain. The general principle of the Swish is you start off with the intense cues, and a mild or low intensity desired-state image and then switch them in some way and the way you switch them can be varied, depending upon what you feel like doing, or what their brain likes to do. So, if we do that auditorily, what are the high intensity cues going to be? High pitch, and loud. Yeah, that’s going to be it. So now, what we need to do is rather than get a desired state <I>image</I> for the her that she would be, we’re going to get a desired state <I>voice</I>. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: I just get an image for that and I think, “How can I do that?”</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, so, no, no. You’ll listen for the desired state voice. I want you to listen, and you’ll hear most of this in--not in the content, but in the <I>quality</I> of the voice itself. The you you would be if you had lots of choices in this situation. </P>
<P>WOMAN 3: Is the voice coming from the daughter?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: No. </P>
<P>WOMAN 3: Her voice? </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yes. <I>Her</I> voice. [Bobbie listens internally.] It’s the voice of the her she would be if she did not have this difficulty. [To Bobbie] Right? You can hear that one? That looks like a good one right? Listen to it a little bit more. And it doesn’t even matter if she hears specific words, because the <I>quality</I> of the voice is what represents for her, the her that she would be, if this was fine--she has lots of choices to handle this. Who knows? She sitting here won’t know. Again, the Bobbie sitting here doesn’t have to have any idea what those choices are. But she can tell from the sound quality of her voice, the her that she would be, <I>that</I> Bobbie, that <I>that</I> one has the choices. Yeah? And listen again and just notice if you want to make any little adaptations to make it more appealing to you. [Bobbie pauses, listening to her internal voice.] Yeah, you like that one, don’t you? That looks good enough to me.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: A lot like this. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, great. Now, I want to do a little testing with this voice and make sure we use submodalities in the best way. So make this voice higher pitched and find out if that makes it better or not. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: My voice</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: The [voice of the] you that you would be. Raise and lower the pitch to find out what that does to your response. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Doesn’t much alter it--it’s nice.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It’s the same, whether it’s high or low. OK, now make it a little bit louder vs. softer.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It feels a little tight when it’s loud, and--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: What about if it gets softer?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: A little more relaxing.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, so the softer the better on this one. OK, now see that’s a reversal of the other direction. Let’s play with a few more. So louder--I better write some of these things down.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s going to be great to get rid of this. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Desired voice; louder makes it less intense; your attraction to it gets less intense when it gets louder?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Oh, my attraction.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: You’re attraction to it, that’s what we’re checking for. If it gets a little bit louder, not too much but a little bit. You can compare that with making the volume get really soft. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It’s much nicer when it’s softer.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, is it more attractive to you?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Well, it feels good. [Laughter]</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, softer increases attraction. Now, make it closer.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: From normal to soft is the most attractive. Normal to high is the least. It’s a span. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. So now move it in closer to you—</P>
<P>BOBBIE: How did you know it was so far away? </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: —and find out if this makes it more attractive. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Hmmn. It’s confusing. It feels good, but there’s something about it that’s also not so wonderful.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: When it moves in closer? Move it farther away, and find out what happens. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Its nicer.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, this is interesting. She’s going in reverse. OK, farther is more attractive? Is it more attractive also? Does it draw you more? That’s really the response we’re always checking for. Does it <I>draw</I> you more? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: What draws me most is if it would be someone like where you are—or maybe where Jim is—just a normal body distance away. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: A normal distance.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: A normal body distance away is the most attractive, though it feels nicer farther away. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, got it, so it’s most attractive.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: It feels best at just a normal speaking distance. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: So midway. A mid-range distance. So volume, and then pitch. Lets test pitch again. Listen to it get higher and lower.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: High, no. . . . It’s the same with pitch, I like it best in the middle. Lower feels nicer but I’m not attracted to it. Higher doesn’t feel good at all. The mid I’m most attracted to but lower feels nicer.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. This feels better but the mid is most attractive. Now lets try it coming from one point vs. coming from all around you. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: OK. . . . It’s nice; it feels good coming all around. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Is it more attractive that way? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, it’s a very encompassing feeling. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, now that’s the best so far—as far as getting a good response. OK, all around. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Feels like I have more choices with it like that.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. OK that’s more attractive. Now, what else could we test auditorily? Anything come to mind? </P>
<P>MALE VOICE: Speed.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Speed, tempo. Good. Let’s change tempo. Faster and slower. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Middle to high.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I knew it was going to be mid-range. [Laughter]</P>
<P>BOBBIE: And that’s the opposite. The high feels the nicest but the middle feels most attractive. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: High feels the nicest. OK.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Actually, <I>sliding</I> is what feels good. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: What? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: That doesn’t make any sense. The actual sliding from mid to high. What felt so neat was the rmmmmm.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Now, let me go back to test something about the-- I don’t know if we tested this one with the problem stimuli. Take your daughters voice. Hear that at one point compared to all around you. Is the sound coming from one point, one location? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: The bad sound, the sound that pushes my buttons. I don’t want to do it. [Laughter] </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, you can see already how this will work. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: One point, OK. One point, less intense, all around is real bad. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Real bad. OK. And the reason I’m going back to test that is it’s going to be easiest, and I’m going to be more certain of getting good results if I have a submodality or two submodalities that work the same way for the cue, the problem cue, and the desired state representation. And those others work opposite for one than the other. Not quite opposite, usually the desired state one is in a mid-range. So there’d be a number of ways we could construct one, but using this is probably going to be a good idea since this one works the same way for both the cues and the desired state representation of sound. Does that make sense? </P>
<P>Good. OK, So now we have to figure out how do we get her to represent the cues and go from that to the desired state representation of sound in a way that’s easy for her brain to do and makes that wired-in connection go just like that. Now, probably the way to have her start, I’m going to add in these other two also, will be to have that voice--her daughters voice--don’t do it yet, but get an idea of it. So hear her daughter’s voice all around her and high and loud. So, maximum intensity there.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: The worst.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: The pits, but this is only going to be for a split second. Because as soon as you’ve got that, then what were going to do is have this voice shrink down to one point, till it goes down to nothing, basically, at the same time that the new voice, expands. Does that make sense? So you’ll start off with the daughter’s voice in the unpleasant pitch and loud—yeah, the worst one, the worst voice all around—and then the desired state, the Bobbie that she would be if she didn’t have this difficulty, that voice is going to start off from just one teeny, teeny little point in space. And as the daughter’s voice goes down to nothing, this voice is going to expand simultaneously and go around her. OK, and this voice, the attractive one, is going to go around her and it’s going to be at the mid-distance that’s most attractive, and it’s going to be at the mid-pitch and volume, I think all those other things are in the mid-range. OK? So go ahead and do that and then clear your ears.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, right.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Clear your stereo out, and do it again. Start with maximum intensity. OK? Now. What?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: [Bobbie smiles broadly.] That works real well. [Laughter] </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: [Joking] She certainly went through a subtle shift there. OK, so wait a second. Do it again, this time even faster. [Bobbie smiles] Good, and wipe your ears, now do it five more times. Each time let it happen faster and faster and faster. But do clear your auditory channels each time. . . .</P>
<P>BOBBIE: [Smiling broadly] It’s the other one.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: I can see that. It’s hard to get it back now. Try. Try harder so you can finish your five. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: It just left. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Great. And the other one came in, right? </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, now think of the worst thing, the worst context, and the worst thing that could happen in the future, that might have triggered your buttons in the past. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: That situation in any of them. I’m in a terrible mood and I’m not handling life normal to begin with. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: All right, so put yourself into one of those. We’ll find out if that’s generalized to that context when she’s in a bad state. Excellent. Excellent choice. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: And do the Swish, or just do her voice?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: First just test, first just test and find out if you get your buttons pushed.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: [Smiling broadly, shaking her head.] No. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, you’re brain already made that jump.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I can’t even force it. It’s like I just--</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah, yeah, that’s great. And that’s how it goes when you really have it wired in; that new response is just as compelling and as automatic and as irresistible as the old one used to be. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: That’s amazing.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK. Thank you.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Thank you. </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yeah. Oh, now try to get it back with the picture. Try to get it back visually.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: The picture of her-- </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: --of her face, try zooming in on her face and find out if you can get it back.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: [Bobbie smiles] No. For a second, and then the other feeling. She just turned angelic. Thank God! [Laughter] </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: OK, great.</P>
<P>WOMAN 3: Can you use the image and the voice?</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Yes, you certainly can, and I wanted to do just with one system to find out if we could get it with just one system. If that didn’t work, then I would have her add that in as she did the sound, to put the two together. But usually when you find the key system, and you get the key submodalities, it gets everything else. The other systems are taken care of automatically.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: I also just want to say that’s a really good feeling, what you did, when you’re tailoring it. All of that and more than any of the things we did yesterday. They were just-- </P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Did it seem more appropriate for you somehow?</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Just more, real complete. Like when I smiled, it wasn’t like I was just smiling. It was like my body was--it was like <I>all</I> of me.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Felt more congruent. </P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah, it was a real congruent feeling, whereas yesterday when I did it, it was nice and I sure got a smile, but there was still some—</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Not quite complete.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: Yeah.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Something unfinished. Great. So what you might do this afternoon, if your group gets a chance, is to go over that one that you did yesterday with the jaw, and find out if you can find what the key submodality is, because there may be another one there, to tailor it for you.</P>
<P>BOBBIE: OK.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: Two weeks after this session, Bobbie reported a tremendous shift in her response to her daughter. I spoke with her again recently, about six months after the session, and she said her response is 100 percent different now, in situations where her daughter’s voice tone used to drive her up a wall. She’s really pleased that she can now respond calmly and with choices instead of losing control and getting really angry. She also noticed that there is another visual cue. That sometimes her daughter can look a certain way, without even saying anything, and Bobbie still responded in the old way. Even in this situation though, Bobbie said her response is better. That she would lose control first, but then stop, and realize she had other choices and do something with her daughter to work things out. This is a good example of what to check for. If you do a Swish, and it’s effective in some context, but not in others, usually it means that you have effectively swished one set of cues, but there’s another set too. </P>
<P>A student of ours did a Swish with a smoker, and she used reaching for a pack cigarettes as the cue. This man—after the Swish—stopped smoking completely, except in situations where he could get a cigarette from someone else. When he could ask someone else for a cigarette, he never needed to reach out for that pack, so those cues never came up to send his brain in a new direction. With Bobbie, I had swished from auditory cues, but I hadn’t Swished from visual ones. In situations like this, you simply need to do another Swish using the new cues you have discovered. There are lots of fine points to making the Swish work effectively, and in what to check for if your first Swish doesn’t completely work. For example, sometimes you need to do a lot to help the client develop a desired self-image or desired self-voice that really has all the qualities that are needed in the problem situation.</P>

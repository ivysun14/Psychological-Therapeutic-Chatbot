<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client 0518-014, session no. 6, January 21, 1971. You look really good. You look good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a class till 11:30. And it was a really nice class, too. I listened to Wagner. And I don't know if I like Wagner that much, but I really liked how I could listen to it. And then I went to (inaudible) chapel. And I just sat there. I knew exactly when it was time to come. Didn't ask anybody. And as I was there, there were people preparing. I don't know what it's for. Every day they just have, maybe they have like little affairs. They had put out a thing on the altar, then lit the altar candles, and then a little table right across with these things on it. And they set up all these things on the altar, all these beautifully decorated things, and everything was really splendid. The light was coming in through the windows, and it was really nice. And (inaudible) a man just suddenly asked me if I was meditating. And I thought for a minute and said yes. (inaudible) Which was really nice.</p>

<p>I also felt very collected. Felt in this funny way very inside myself, but in a good way. Like lots of times my energy and stuff is going out so much that I feel kind of this hollow thing on the inside. Like too much of me is being in relation to everything that's going on, and there's not enough of me that's inside. And I just really feel like there's a whole lot inside. Then I walked outside and it was warm, the sky was blue, and it was real nice. And I knew exactly. I just sat there and I didn't think about time, but all of a sudden I knew I would leave just then and I came right here. It was just time. It felt good. How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. (inaudible) All right. [0:02:21.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It also helped because I didn't go back to my parents' last night. I went to my friend Cathy's for dinner. And we painted. I haven't done that in a long time. I haven't been able to. Ever since I saw you, things are growing (inaudible). Like after I saw you I just felt good, and I went to Cathy's. And right away.... For a while I just really felt terrible. It just seems like everything got better. Like all of a sudden I feel like everything's not quite so horrible. I don't really know what had happened. I guess because I didn't go home last night. I really had a good time with Cathy. And I thought up an idea for my window. So there was some kind of creative (inaudible), so all of a sudden - I mean, I don't think there's any big major change. I just think something was getting better for a little bit, just to keep my head above...you know? Keep truckin', Stacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keep what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Keep truckin'. I don't know. I'm a little bit scared to get excited, though. I mean, to feel too good. Because it might not be. It might only be - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might just be a momentary up and not the beginning of a real up. Yeah, I noticed it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyway, so it feels better. And I didn't dream last night - oh, I did, but I don't remember what it was. And I (inaudible) get stoned last night and it wasn't, and I didn't feel crazy. And I got stoned last night and I just got relaxed, instead of getting tripped out on things in a negative, kind of too far out way. You have this funny look on your face. Where were you just then? [0:04:55.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking about this. I just never made the association (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You didn't like it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You didn't like it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was stoned last night. And it made me all sort of sleepy and out of it, instead of talking to the person I was with. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have this funny thing that it just exaggerates where you are. And sometimes I hate it, just because I don't want to admit where I am. And sometimes I say no, it's the grass that's making me feel crazy, it's not really me. But I know that's just not true. It just magnifies everything, makes it a whole much more intense. It's really funny, people are really these self-preservatory organisms. Like if you get too down, something will happen to make you up again, because nobody can exist being in deep for very long. So there's something that relieves it for a while. And it's interesting how that goes. I wonder what it'd be like to hear my own tape? (inaudible at 0:05:24.1) I wonder if that would be really weird. Have you ever heard yourself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I'd want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you know, in the same way that people aren't altogether sure they want to know who they really are. Like I was reciting, when I was really little, Sir Walter Scott, something or other. And I did it on tape and listened to it back. I remember being really upset just by my voice. Like I didn't like my voice, and it wasn't the way that I heard it in my ears. And I was really upset that other people heard it that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, not the way you were (inaudible). [0:07:30.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, there's one other good thing that I haven't told you. I might as well tell you good things while I'm feeling good. I'm taking swimming, and I really love it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (sneezes) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just had this really strong, weird flash just now. Something strange. (inaudible) really stupid. I had this flash that you were allergic to me. I mean, it wasn't heavy, it was just like, I wonder why she's sneezing (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I guess with me you feel pretty good, but not like you can count on it or something. Is that right? [0:09:58.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I also - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (blows nose)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was thinking about this thing yesterday. Because I stayed at my (inaudible) house last night. And she invited me, she said, "Listen, why don't you come back tomorrow, too?" And then today she goes, "Why don't you come back tonight?" (inaudible) "Okay." And I said something about Cathy's boyfriend who's gone for a couple days. I said I'd probably stay over there for a day or two, "I just wanted to take the burden off of you" or something. And she looked at me and she said, "That isn't even worth responding to." And then she's like, "Why did you say that?" And I realized that in this funny way I can be really sure of somebody but I'm never completely sure of them. Like there's always something in me that's doubting that they really care about me. </p>

<p>And I know that's this thing that's totally related to my father. Because I go through cycles of hating him. And that's usually because I think he's phony and a bunch of other things, but basically because I don't think he really loves me. And it's this crazy thing, because of all the people I know, my parents have been really amazingly good. And they're fine people, and they obviously really care about me. But somehow I always - I don't doubt my mother. I don't doubt her at all. But I really doubt whether my father ever cares. And it seems like in this funny way I'm setting up tests a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For him or - ? [0:12:13.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't really do that so much. I guess I'm just always doubting it. I used to set up tests, but then I realized that setting up tests was just setting him up to fail them. And I'd just be able to pat myself on the back and say, "Oh, he really doesn't love me." And it happens with anybody that I care (inaudible). Like my mother and Emma, I don't doubt at all. I just know that they really care. But I don't know if there's anybody else I've ever been close to that I don't go through this doubting thing in my head. And I thought about it yesterday. And it just seems like it ends up being this basic insecurity thing. And then I thought about it and thought about it. And I know that in relation to my father, whenever I feel like he doesn't love me....</p>

<p>My mother said this last time. I was really going into a heavy "I hate him," and I couldn't stand - you know, he's real kissy and touchy, and always, as soon as he walks in, he demands you to kiss him. That's sort of this thing I've done. And I get literally repulsed by him. I can't touch him, I can't. And he's super-aware of it. And so we go through this big thing where he wants me to kiss him and I don't. And finally I exploded last time. It was a couple of weeks ago, and I was just going through, not a really big thing but just a little negative. "Listen, I don't want to have to kiss you when I don't want to kiss you. When I don't feel it, why do you want it?" And it upset him, but he understood it. </p>

<p>And when I was going through a really negative thing about it, I talked to my mom. And I said something about how I didn't think that he really loved me and I burst into tears as soon as I said it. And she turned around and she said, "Isn't it more that you're not sure if you really love him?" And that made sense to me, too. Because I take away my love from him and I figure because I'm doing it to him he can do it to me. And also just (inaudible) really makes me furious how he wants this physical thing to be just a ritual with no meaning behind it. Like I can be mad at him or literally furious at him, and he'll still want me to kiss him when he comes in from work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because there's something repulsive about -  [0:15:01.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Literally repulsive. My stomach turning over. You know, "Get away." It's really funny, we have a real physical, touchy, lovey, kissy-face family. So in some ways that's made physical contact really easy. I feel really easily able to hug people and stuff like that. But it's really funny, because I have this really strong thing of not being able to do that to relatives and friends of theirs that I don't like. I literally get this totally nauseous feeling completely in my body, and I can't. But that makes it - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like not wanting to give yourself to someone you don't like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Completely. That's exactly what it is. And it's also just not being able to. And I'm kind of glad I have that reaction in some ways, because at least it means that my head's connected. (inaudible) doubts about people a lot. If my head couldn't be tender to them, then it just really hurt and made me feel nauseous if my hands (inaudible) pretend (inaudible) my body. And then I was (inaudible) people, and then (inaudible) got real split. I'd literally feel that my body (inaudible). [0:17:42.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a very preserving reaction. Like it keeps you from being split. It keeps you straight, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Except that I get a little bit upset by it because it's just such a fierce reaction. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know, your father is just being sort of nice and touchy and not.... He certainly isn't worthy of all that repulsion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes he is worthy of it. Sometimes he's really repulsive. And sometimes I really hate him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is he hateful? Never mind, you were going to say something. [0:19:01.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was. But that was a good question, too. I don't know which one to get into. Well, he's hateful (inaudible). That was a good question. (inaudible) I guess lots of times he embodies lots of things about me that I don't like. And I assume he gave them to me, all these key things. Like with certain ways of being with people. I guess it's like he's very hammish in looking for approval. And he's not an insecure person at all in a basic way, but somehow he gets into this. He used to be an actor, and there's this hammish way he is. So I translate in my own way, but I also always make sure that everybody around really likes me, and get really up tight if they don't. And I used to think that he was really fun and that I was really fun. And I just don't feel that way at this point in my life. So I used to hate him for that. </p>

<p>What I was going to say, just before that.... It seems like everything stems from this not being secure in myself. And that's how come I ask him for too much. And that's how come I have to make sure that everybody likes me. And that's how come I'm timid sometimes. And that's how come I'm too loud other times. And that's - a lot of times I'm always apologizing for myself. </p>

<p>Somebody wrote me this letter, this guy John. Who's not John, my old - John who's here, who's a friend, of sorts. He's a friend. I'm real honest with him, but I don't think he's really honest with himself. But he wrote me this letter about how I was always apologizing for myself and I would say something in this tone, maybe (inaudible), say something in this tone. And the tone would also imply that I wanted to also let it out a little bit and look around to make sure that nobody minded it. If they did, I'd whisk it back in. And he's right. I really know that I do that. And it seems like (inaudible). [0:22:54.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're awfully aware of being icky.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're awfully aware of being icky.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) I guess (inaudible) and just feeling good about myself. </p>

<p>It's really funny, I have two names. Did I tell you about that? Stacy Jen? My name is Stacy Jen. And everybody in New York always called me Stacy - not everyone, 'most everybody in New York always called me Stacy - because my parents did and that's my official name. Jen's my middle name. But I really wanted to be called Jen. And there were two girls here, Marjory and Jackie, who are now gone, who were two of my closest friends first year, who were both from the country and from Colorado, and really neat girls. And they always called me Jen because I introduced myself to them as Jen. And the first year it became (inaudible) thing, like everybody knows - it was a joke for a while, but then it didn't become so much of a joke sometimes. Sometimes I was Jen and sometimes I was Stacy. And my close friends started to recognize the difference between the two, and they'd be able to call me by one or the other. [0:24:55.1]</p>

<p>And then when I went out to Texas, I became Jen. And I went out with Marjory, who was this girl who (inaudible) called me Jen. And I started identifying these two different parts (inaudible), my name is Stacy and Jen. And then in the summer they became pretty - they were really different. Stacy was the person who was in New York. And even physical, like I'm always fatter when I'm here. There's a certain way of being. And Jen's different, and much more in the South West, and thinner, and I'm usually moving. When I'm here I'm settled, going to school. And Jen is always hitchhiking and going different places and not quite ever sure where she's going to be. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of lighter and more exciting and - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I really liked Jen. And in the summer I was Stacy Jen. They were really close together. I really liked myself in the summer. For part of the time - I was in the hospital for the first month, for part of the month. Nothing was wrong with me, but I was on intravenous feeding and I had six doctors and - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So much attention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, it was strange. Nothing was wrong with me, but I didn't know that. It was all in my head. But I didn't know that, and none of the doctors did. And it was strange, because I chose to do it in Texas, where there'd be no one to visit me. I had a really nice doctor, who had a crush on me. That was nice. Got a little bit more complicated when he wanted to sleep with me. But it was nice. We had a crush on each other. It was this funny thing of having attention but also doing it alone because there was nobody around that I really knew. None of my family was there to visit me. So a lot of it, all the days, would be alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's getting the kind of sense of yourself you get when you spend lots of time alone. [0:27:08.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And after I did that, then I was really (inaudible). The rest of the time, I felt really good about myself. It's funny that my body completely reacts to wherever my head is. Like I didn't even know I was as upset as I was until after I got out, in retrospect, I realized there was nothing wrong with my stomach, nothing at all. And it was just I was upset about John. Because I was living in our old room in his old house. And I was in his room and I was sleeping in the bed and stuff, and he wasn't there. And I couldn't do that. That was silly of me to try to do. What was I going to ask you? Oh, yeah. And so nobody on the south west even knows my name is Stacy. (inaudible) I came back here and I got a letter from this girl that I'd once met in Texas to Jen Beard. And I can remember just being very surprised when I got it, because I'd just been feeling so Stacy-ish. Just not even a grain of Jen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And Stacy is...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, Stacy's okay, but she's heavy. And she's the one who's really insecure. She's the one who's really dependent on people, and worried. And Jen's just a whole bunch less concerned about stuff like that. (inaudible) But until I get Stacy like Jen.... I mean, it's okay when I'm Jen, and I really enjoy it. But I always know that there's Stacy waiting somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you can't keep on running forever. Stacy is going to catch up with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Jen's not exactly running. She usually has it pretty much together. She travels a lot. Yeah, she does run somewhat. She leaves places too quickly. If things start getting a little bit iffy, she'll kiss it goodbye and split. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not really her running in the sense of running away. It's sort of running in the sense of keeping a little bit ahead of the game. Are there good things about Stacy, too? [0:30:09.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She can be - well, Stacy's good when Diane loves her. Because Diane doesn't hardly even know Jen. She's always known Stacy. Even when she's really loved me, I've still been Stacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must be really, really good. Even the - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Stacy is like when New York is good. And it has been. It just isn't very regularly. (inaudible) The things that Stacy gets is insecure, and then grabby. But Jen isn't that way. And if Stacy isn't, then she's pretty good, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that it's very easy for you, Stac, to fall into that. [0:31:40.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes...I don't know. I'm trying to get some (inaudible). Something about finding security in other people. Then some kind of confusion about where the answers come from, if they come from inside or from other people. When I feel better, like last quarter, if I would feel good one day, it was always because I'd had a nice conversation with somebody else. And I kind of feel that most of my feeling about myself was really a reflection of how everybody around me was feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not coming from inside you and centered, like we talked about earlier.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Or sometimes I would decide during the day whether I wanted - like a couple of days ago when I was at home, it was about 8:00 or something, and I was trying to decide whether I was - Cathy had asked me to come over, and Jenny had asked me to come back to my old apartment and talk to her for a while, and I was trying to decide. And I decided no, I'm going to go home, I want to be alone. I'm going to go home and read, then putter around, wash my hair, listen to the Grateful Dead, just do whatever. [0:34:56.1]</p>

<p>And Stephen, who's - I told you he's staying with me? He's been staying at my parents' house and stuff. He's an old friend from first year. He wasn't really a friend of Diane's or Florence's, it was just they knew about him. And he went over to visit them, just to say hello. And I didn't know that. But in my head I knew, I had this (inaudible) that he had gone over there, though I hadn't seen him all day. And I said no, I'm going to stay home, that's what I want to do. Then he came back at about midnight or something, real stoned, really happy, really great mood, came bouncing in, told me what a fantastic time he'd had there. And I just felt terrible, this overwhelming, absolutely feeling terrible, and wishing I'd been there. And feeling I'd really missed something, this big feeling of missing something. </p>

<p>I used to always have (inaudible) in high school. On Saturday nights I'd go to four different places just to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. And of course I'd missed everything in some kind of way, because there wouldn't be any place in particular, I'd always be wondering what was happening somewhere else. But I just had this incredible feeling of missing something. And I felt terrible that I had decided to do something for myself and nothing with other people. Even after I'd decided that I wanted to be alone, (inaudible) that I was missing something. I really wanted to feel like, no. I thought all the rest of that night to feel good about having done what I wanted to do. But it's such a drag to have to fight for it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of. That you'd feel really sort of solid and whole and good if you could sort of naturally feel good about what you decided to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also that other people are that important. That they can make me feel bad about being with myself. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what about Stacy? </p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Other people are so important, and you're so unimportant. (pause) I don't think that's really quite (inaudible). [0:37:26.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not quite right, no. It's something that.... I don't know. I've gone somewhere else (inaudible). You are, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I felt like I was just waiting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess that's also, in this funny way, why I used to emulate in some little ways, and still do, crazy people. Really crazy people. Because they're so godawfully important to themselves. And they can dismiss other people. That's part of my attraction to that whole apartment. Because they could be irritable and say "Fuck you" to other people and just close their doors when there are all these nice people around. But it was really hard for me to do that. And I almost admired that they'd rather be irritable and by themselves. I don't know. [0:39:59.8]</p>

<p>I've been thinking.... The other thing is, I feel like I'm always feeling opposite things. Like (inaudible) just saying, there are always opposites. It's not purely.... I'm disputing that, because on the other hand I really love Emma, who's just not at all that way, this (inaudible) way. Except really - well, (inaudible), no, that's not a good dichotomy, I don't think, to put it up like that, because she's not like that. I don't know. </p>

<p>But the other night I wrote a letter to Alan. And it was just basically telling him how I felt all these conflicting things. Like right then I was feeling this radiance, this really warm, good thing coming out and just filling everything up, and at the same time I just really felt like I could just really cry, just really, painfully, gushingly cry. And at moments I felt very content, and other moments I just would listen to (inaudible) and feel really longing and start thinking about John and fantasizing about John. And just a whole bunch of feeling completely opposite ways, and almost simultaneously, so that it was really confusing. I used to really get hung up on that, that I couldn't ever say anything, because whenever I said something, the opposite was just equally true. And I spent whole months being totally tangled up and pretty unable to grab anything out of where I was, because as soon as I said it I realized it was just the opposite. That's funny. [0:42:40.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have an opposite now? Do you have a bad, unhappy thing going on even today while you're feeling good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems like there's this oscilloscope-ish kind of thing. I once got a flash of that when I was stoned. That sometimes it was this basic line and it was going up, and there were these two different forces that were interacting, going like this. And sometimes, when I was alone, it was basically going down, and there were these two things that were going or varying on it, but it was going in one general direction. Whereas today it feels like it's generally up, but lots of the jiggy-jag lines are going down. I think probably because also all the day is planned. I have today so that I only have half an hour in between anything, and usually I don't even have half an hour. I have half an hour before I have to go to work now. But the whole day is completely planned until 10:00, because I'm working. Because it always feels very comforting not to have any time to sit around and feel icky. I always feel pleased about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A whole bunch of things that are definite things to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I have myself all packaged up (inaudible) today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's really nice to be in the packages instead of uhhh.... How can I ever get this all together? [0:44:54.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And also part of it is swimming. I really love swimming. I really love it. And I'm good at it, too. And I love the movement. And I love getting my arms strong. And I feel very free swimming up and down the lanes, it takes me to a different place.</p>

<p>And working. I have this very Protestant ethic-y thing about working. I'm almost not doing the stuff I want to do at night so I can work, because then there's like some kind of atoning thing in me. Somehow, if I'm not doing something I enjoy for a while, it makes me feel better. I guess because I've never worked, never had any responsibility that I had to do, never got paid for doing icky things. And somehow it's something in me. I guess because it's also new. Probably in another month I won't feel that way. But right now it feels like it's right that I should be doing something not terribly agreeable but getting some other benefit from it. And then I'm getting money that I (inaudible) to do what I want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something real about it, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I found myself saying to a friend - (inaudible) people? (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) He was saying - actually he was bawling me out because I haven't returned his records. And he asked if I could return them tonight. I said no, that I'm working. And I went into this real little riff about how it was really nice to be accountable for fifteen hours a week. For fifteen hours a week I'm sure that I know where I am and I know what I'm doing. And he scratched his head and said, "Uh-oh." It's only fifteen hours. But still, start little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of work do you do? [0:47:27.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just work in a library. Making inane comments at people who check out books, flirting, and....it's not bad. I get to play with all these machines. They have all these sucking tubes and all these pumps that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yes, so cool, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I get to do (inaudible). I've been counterfeiting in my spare time. It's not bad. (pause) Do you feel really volatile?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Excuse me? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you feel really volatile? Do you get into things like walking around all day you'll feel good, and then all of a sudden you'll just feel terrible and not be very - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think, not as sharply as you're talking about. But yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How did you think it's not as sharp?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't make it not as sharp as in any good way, I don't think. For a long time I didn't. And then six months ago or so, I did. And it lasted for a while, and now it's sort of toning down without.... So I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you feel good about yourself most of the time? Can you listen to people if you're not feeling good about yourself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I feel bad about myself most of the time. It makes me feel a lot better to listen to people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because then you could be helpful and not (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Therapy's a good job. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Therapy's a good job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is. It's a good job. It is also hard (inaudible). [0:49:56.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it almost time? (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) You were going to say something? What were you going to say? (pause) You must see something in me that you like. Some kind of calmness or solidness or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A lot.</p>

<p>(creaking noises)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of looks like being together the way you want to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't tell too much because I don't know you very much, except in a very (inaudible) way. But in that way I feel like.... I like a lot of women. And also it feels like it's really important for me to feel related. Like I - I guess everybody does - but I always pick people that I feel like I'm related to in some way. Lots of my friends, we have lots of similar things. I think I feel - and that's part of the liking you - is that there's something familiar. I suppose that really alien people - not alien-unearthly, but just - I have no idea of what makes them tick. I have no idea of what makes them feel good or bad. I have no idea where any of their mannerisms come from. And I can never end up feeling close to them. [0:52:51.9]</p>

<p>I have one friend I've been friends with since I was four years old, this girl Vera Mays, who's very different, who's white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, long-blonde-haired girl, really different. But I know her so well. She's the only person, almost, that I know. Except for Jenny, and she's a little bit outside of the realm, but it's taken me a long time to be friends with her. But 'most everybody else has something. And it's not anything I can put my hands on, but some irrational - feeling a likeness in some way. And I'm sure people do that to their therapist, anyway. It's all part of (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That reminds me. You must feel awfully exposed about being stupid or not knowing something about yourself or something. That just reminded me of something yesterday when - I don't know, something happened yesterday. It was also like it would be humiliating not to see something. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I kind of heard the comment after I said it. The thing I said about "That's what people do with therapists, anyway." Then I noticed something funny about you. I don't know - it's a little bit like - I guess it has to - don't know how you're seeing how I'm talking. I don't think you're being - I don't have the feeling, from the things that you say, that you're sitting back and being Freudianish and listening to my word constructions and slips and this and that, and doing any of that kind of.... So I feel more comfortable than if somebody who was (inaudible) sitting there and they're seeing right through your clothes. I don't feel like that. Which is very relieving. That's uncanny. I feel they're not being fair to you, they're using trickery if they're doing that. But also when you talk you don't hear as much as the person who's listening to you, it seems. At least I know I don't. So you're probably hearing.... I'm also holding my tummy in. (inaudible) [0:55:40.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) They just said your brother is in Brief relational therapy, and I know they do that sort of thing. Like they tell you what your bodily gestures mean. And that's sort of another version of - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That at first got me really angry, that he was doing that. It would get me really angry that he was. Because I felt that he was not being fair. But then this one thing happened where I was feeling like he was hurting me, and I was...oh, this is the one I wrote a story about. Did I tell you about this? Maybe. I'll go further, then you can see if it's (inaudible). And we weren't getting along, and he was picking on me, and we were doing (inaudible) thing. And I was underneath the covers and all huddled up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said something about how much he hurt me and I burst into tears. And Donna, his wife, said, "(inaudible) you're hurt (inaudible) you're angry." And all of a sudden I just wasn't cold any more. And I thought if I just stared at him really viciously, really was venomous.... And all of a sudden he just smiled. And I found myself smiling because I had just (inaudible). And so after that it was spooky because I started believing in it more. And I also know that when I don't grieve, I choke myself up and I don't let anything flow. But they're a little bit (inaudible) there. But I usually sit kind of like that. That's probably because I'm getting fat. Unpleasantly so. [0:57:45.6]</p>

<p>I just flashed that I didn't talk about my apartment at all and that I'm thinking about moving back in. Kind of for lack of any better place to be. And I'm suspicious of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Suspicious that it's not...? That it's a weak thing to do, not a thing to do that's glowing or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I haven't told anybody really, because I don't want anybody to tell me not to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean any of your other friends could tell you not to do it? So they'd take that hope. They'd take the possibility away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess (inaudible) I'm not sure if I should do it or not. And half of me says, "Well, listen, you really don't have a place to be." But I did feel sufficiently different about Diane. She's much less crucial. And I could be more relaxed about it. And then some of me says, "But, Jesus, if you blow it again, just think how tragic it's going to be." And then something else says, "Well, you know, you probably shouldn't do that at all but find something completely new." And then some of me says, "Well, you still want to be there (inaudible)." I'm scared to talk about it, I think. Because then I'll figure out that maybe I shouldn't do it. And I guess I want to do it. Are we out of time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, we're out of time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it was nice to save it just for the end. [1:00:09.4]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are things going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh good actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah very good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's new, anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh [NAME OTHER], my girlfriend...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is moving out here in May.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really?  Is she done school then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's got one more week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she finished her comprehensive exams.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And passed all those.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now she just has to finish her last clinical week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So next week, unless something comes up and she can't get the hours in, she'll be finished at the end of the week and she'll have a degree and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we're all set to go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's exciting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She applied for her license as a [DEIDENTIFIED] here in [DEIDENTIFIED] and that's just a matter of getting paperwork in and when she comes out here, she's gonna take her board, it's a national board for the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does she know what she wants to do yet with it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she would like to be in [DEIDENTIFIED], um that's always been something that's fascinated her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's worked as a [DEIDENTIFIED] .</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And right now what she's doing in her clinical is working as a [DEIDENTIFIED] in an [DEIDENTIFIED] uh unit at the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Has she started submitting her resume yet anywhere?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's put a couple into.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I hear [DEIDENTIFIED] is desperate for [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're even looking overseas because they can't get enough [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh I'll have to let her know that cause I wasn't sure, I knew that [DEIDENTIFIED] was building a [DEIDENTIFIED] and so is [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'll have to let her know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED] is supposed to be opening very soon and they're having trouble staffing [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If they take all the people from down south, everybody would want to move up north.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what I thought but someone said that for some reason they can't or they're not so they're trying to sign new [DEIDENTIFIED] and uh...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've talked to a couple of [DEIDENTIFIED] that got hired there and again it sounds like they must not have been able to find somebody recently, they're really struggling but you know as a [DEIDENTIFIED], she's going to be able to pick her job.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So wherever she wants to work, she'll be fine.  That's exciting that she's coming up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is exciting.  Yeah, she's....  What we're shooting for is probably the beginning of May, give her a chance to get done with school and say goodbye to her folks and parents and then we're gonna....  we haven't worked out all the logistics to whether we're going to do a truck or drive, she doesn't have that much so we'll work it out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Well good cause I remember before when we talked it seemed like one of the things that was holding her back there was her family.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she's kind of come to terms with that [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she really has and uh seeing it as, for her, a very good thing for her to move out and be more independent of her family, have some distance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which makes me feel good that she's not, she's not just coming here for me.  I mean, that makes me feel great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's something that she feels she need to do for herself too and it gives her an opportunity to pretty much stand on her own two feet in life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's just great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's wonderful.  Congratulations, that's exciting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good news.  You won't be having to fly back and forth all the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, that'll be wonderful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we'll be visiting [DEIDENTIFIED] but when we want to and when the weather's not too hot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you get the best of both worlds.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, good, good, good.  So your spirits have probably been pretty good, I would imagine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and uh she just left not too long ago, about a week ago, um I had a whole house full of people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had, well my son's living with me temporarily...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And his girlfriend came down the middle of March and stayed with us.  [NAME OTHER] came the middle of March and her son came then about a week later and then [NAME OTHER] was there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I think it was the [DATE] or [DATE] when the last person left, I think that was [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it was a real busy time but it was fun, it was nice to go skiing and boarding.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And just have a lot of people around who got along really well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Did you take time off work too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, actually the last week was my first five day work week in three weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was rough.  It was...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have to get used to it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And this week, coming in on Monday, I only had two days off, it seems like I was just here.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you used up all your vacation time for a while?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good so you can think some more then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good.  So uh, oh, also I got a note from [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> From your last appointment with him.  Let's see, I think this was dated [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I'm going to see him this month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have that set up yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and he wants us to address or discuss the possibility that Zoloft might be affecting your sleep so...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was one thing he mentioned.  Let's see, what else, it's been a while since I read this.  He said you were looking at surgical options for the sleep apnea.  Um he said he thought you had a 50-60% chance of improvement with surgery and in the meantime you're going to try the CPAP.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And see how that works.  How's it going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh it's going well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've pretty much put the surgical option on hold.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh I've tolerated the CPAP a lot better than I thought I would uh  I need to talk to him.  There's still some struggles with it but I think I'd rather try to stick with that rather if, rather than do something so invasive as surgery and....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a 50-60% chance of it working or not, it's kind of, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know that, I know that with the CPAP, I'm sleeping better, sleeping, getting more rest.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I know it helps with the obstructive apnea, um what I need to talk to him about is how do we know it's helping with the central apnea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm, ya know, still not waking up like yeah, it's morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe I'm expecting too much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're not rested when you wake up in the morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm more rested.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How's your energy during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's much better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I think that that's a plus.  Yeah, I don't know if the Zoloft, I don't think it's really been affecting my sleep that much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um I'm still trying to find it.  The other thing I'm really struggling with is trying to find a balance of getting to sleep. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're having trouble getting to sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And staying asleep.  I haven't been using the Ambien because it seems like that makes me groggy in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I've been sticking to Klonopin and for a while I was doing okay on two and a half of the milligrams I have right now and I can't remember what those are.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me look and see.  They are 0.5, so two and a half tablets of them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that would be one and a quarter milligrams and that was working pretty well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well I was taking four for a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that would work well but I felt kind of tired in the morning and I felt like it might be from the Klonopin so I cut down and was able, for about two weeks, to cut down to two and a half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But then I started waking up during the middle of the night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where I'd wake up at two, at four and, you know, didn't feel right in the morning at all.  So now I'm, last night I too three and a half.  I slept through the whole night but it has like a residual kind of...  I feel a little more groggy the more I take.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm still struggling with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying to find a balance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and it's okay to keep working with it if you want to.  The other option would be to try something similar but with a shorter duration effect.  The advantage of that is you may not be as groggy in the morning.  The disadvantage is it doesn't last long enough you would be waking up during the night.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  It surprised me on the two and a half that I thought it would be longer acting, that I'd be waking up that much during the night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it's also, did you go right from four right to two and a half or did you cut back slowly?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, down from four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's possible it might've been a little bit of withdrawal from your body being used to the four and then cut back.  So you could go like from four to three and a half for a week and then three for a week and then two and a half.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sometimes if you go slower your body doesn't notice the difference as much and you may sleep a little better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you can try it again, if you wanted to, just a little slower.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.  You know it is a little difficult with the CPAP too.  I'm still not quite used to having this mask on my face.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think if I'm really not knocked out, I tend to wake up because you roll over and you have this snorkeling gear on your head.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] What is going on here? Um, Now the shorter acting, what would that be?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It would be something like a Restoril um Halcion...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Restoril.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've heard of that?  It's the same family as the Klonopin, it's just shorter acting.  The problem, again, sometimes it's too short acting, like it may wear off in two to four hours.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it may get you to sleep but it might not keep you to sleep.  Klonopin typically lasts more like six to eight hours but for some people it lasts a little too long and they're groggy in the morning. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I definitely noticed on the higher dose it's, I'm feeling more groggy in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So you're probably doing the right thing [PATIENT NAME] by trying to fine tune the dose a little bit to see if you can find a dose that gives you a full night's sleep without making you groggy in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, why don't I do that?  Now I'm up to four again, I guess I could cut to three and a half or last night it was three and a half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stay at that for what a week?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At least a week.  Yeah, the general recommendation if you're going to cut back on medicine like Klonopin is not to go any faster than 10% per week so if you're taking 2 milligrams 10% would be like, you know, almost a quarter of a milligram which is about half a pill so that's close enough, per week, so...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, let me give that a try.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and some people have to go even a little slower than that but that's kind of a general guideline..</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it's worth a shot to see and if you have questions, you can call me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What about um Klonopin addictive qualities, I mean will I need more and more, I mean is it...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know, usually not, um, before it went generic, I never had a single patient develop tolerance to it or that needs more and more.  When it went generic, I started having a few patients, so I've had maybe two or three in the last few years out of dozens that did develop some tolerance where it didn't work as well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if that happens, the key is that we don't keep going higher and higher and higher because after a while, even though you're on a whopping dose, you're sleeping even worse.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if four starts to not work, what I usually do then is back people off of it and try something else for a while, then you can go back on it later at a lower dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And again, the majority of the time that does not happen that people develop tolerance but it can.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So there are people that have been on it for years and years and years that never develop tolerance.  The two things that make it more likely to develop are the higher the dose and the longer you're on it then you're more likely to develop tolerance.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And again, four pills, 2 MG is not a high dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What about, do you notice any difference in your ADD type symptoms, the concentration, now that you're on sleep apnea, or the CPAP.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right um I feel like I have more focus concentration actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I wondered if some of the ADD symptoms might be related to sleep apnea and just sleep deprivation.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, definitely.  I definitely feel, um, I don't know if I have a lot more energy and that's kind of what I expected but I have a lot more mental focus.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And a lot more just mental alertness.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Something I felt like I had before I started the CPAP.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. And [PATIENT NAME] I think we talked about this before but one other option we could consider down the road, once you fine tune the CPAP and the Klonopin and all this there's something called Provigil.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which is used for a couple of things.  It's approved for the fatigue that can go along with sleep apnea if CPAP isn't working well enough.  It gives people more energy and it's not an addictive medicine, it's not a stimulant.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there is also a lot of evidence that it also helps with ADHD even though it's not approved for that, there's plenty of research showing it works, so for you it might be another option. It might give you some more energy during the day and even more focus.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I'd wait until we get the CPAP adjusted and the Klonopin adjusted and probably try it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah cause this is, I mean I started the CPAP right after I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in I guess it was March.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh I haven't been back so this month I'm due back so we'll see if there's any adjustments that need to be made on that or.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or whatever... I did hear...  I don't know if he told me, yeah, he told me that sometimes they can add oxygen for the central apnea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which I'm not sure if they'd be able to tell I have the central apnea without going in for another sleep study.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm imagine, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I'm not sure I really want to do yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I don't blame ya.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not the most fun thing in the world.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, I don't know if there's any way... they might be able to just put like a pulse ox on your at night, you know, the little clip on your finger.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That at least would measure the percentage of oxygen in your system during the night.  It wouldn't tell them if it was central or obstructive apnea but it would tell them if your oxygen saturation is dipping too low.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that's a good idea because pretty much they can tell the obstructive as being taken care of by the CPAP because, uh, well, I don't know if they can tell but my girlfriend can certainly tell.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not snoring as much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No snoring and not gasping for air. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She has noticed at times that I'm not breathing which is a whole different thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just forget to or whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's still happening then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, not as much she said but then again she's probably not lying there awake [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As much, right, especially if you're not snoring as much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.  She likes the CPAP.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good, good, good.  What about appetite and weight, have they been stable or changed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um stable.  Um yeah I've been trying to get back in shape, been working out and watching my diet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You look like you've lost weight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I've lost about 10 pounds since January. I 'm trying to, ya know, not overdo it but about two pounds a week or so.  I've got about 10 more pounds to lose.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  That's great.  What are you doing working out, you gonna to a gym or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We actually have a gym in the building I work at and I'm just mainly doing cardiovascular.  I'm doing the treadmill and the bike and then just stretches.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.  That's nice to have a gym right there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really is.  If it wasn't there, I'd probably be going north often.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know how it gets to be, work's done, you're like, oh I could go work out or I could just go home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well good for you so... let's see, so the sleep apnea is better, the energy is better, the concentration is quite a bit better.  Um anxiety, has that been an issue at all recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum-um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good and it certainly sounds like you're enjoying yourself, you're doing fun things with family and friends.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Definitely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, so the depression doesn't seem like it's an issue right now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, actually that's why I kind of hate to mess with the Zoloft.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't blame ya.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I guess it could be contributing to, you know...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It can be a side effect.  You're not on much.  Are you taking one and a half or two?  Of the 50s?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take one tablet and just got it refilled.  I think it's 100.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh did they give you 100s last time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think the insurance said they wouldn't pay for the 50s.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very likely.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think when I initially saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I think that, I think I had pretty recently gone up on the Zoloft and I was having a lot of insomnia, trying to get to sleep and that has definitely improved.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where I mean I think at that point I was up to one, two in the morning, I just couldn't fall asleep.  I'm pretty much on the average now, going to bed between 10 and 11.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, let's not mess with it then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The risk is greater probably of cutting back then....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And are you using the Xanax much these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum-um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You haven't needed it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum-um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember the last time you took any, has it been days or weeks or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying to remember.  I don't even remember now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good sign.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's been a while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I don't even know uh, I was thinking before I came this morning, I should have checked my meds to see if I needed refills.  I have no idea how much Xanax I even have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um that one, let's see, actually I refilled it in January.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's probably [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well if you need more, just call me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And let's see, the Zoloft I did a year's worth of refills in February, the Klonopin did six months or six refills in February, Prozac</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just got that refilled</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you still taking 10 of Prozac, is that right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that was refilled in December so we're good, well for six months' worth so that's good till June probably.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So good, well, anything else going on that I didn't ask you about?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're doing really well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Getting in shape, [NAME OTHER] coming out, you've got the CPAP, things are clicking.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They are.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They are.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's nice to hear.  And the kids are doing well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, my son is excited he's going back up to [DEIDENTIFIED] to visit his girlfriend.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then he's coming back here while we get [NAME OTHER] moved out here and then he hopes to go back up there in June to stay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is their hope, there's something called a sponsorship visa where she's basically sponsoring him to come there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Even if he doesn't find a job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So he can look for a job and get one if he finds it but he doesn't have to have it to go there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that's nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it would be nice if it works out for them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER] is due to walk for her graduation in May.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that's gone fast.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For me it seems like it's gone fast.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's [AGE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm like wow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what's she going to do after she graduates?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she's not sure yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What she wants to do is she wants to get into the special effects makeup and prosthetics.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That type of thing and that's what she been putting a lot of focus into.  She's hoping this summer to get a job or internship.  There's several possibilities, [DEIDENTIFIED] which is [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They do a lot of prosthetic makeup type work.  They might have a paid internship.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then there's actually a mask making company in [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which isn't directly what she wants to do but it's similar.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In that you're making a mask instead of just putting it on a person's face.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh well that sounds interesting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hopefully, it'll...  Hopefully, it'll work out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She will.  She's always had no problem and at this point, it's just getting done with this semester and uh her and her roommates want to go to [DEIDENTIFIED], they're trying to work that out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then we'll see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good.  It's like you've done it.  You've got them raised.  That's a major accomplishment these days.  A lot of them aren't making it.  Well good.  Well let's keep doing what we're doing and maybe check back, I don't know, a couple, two or three months you think?</p>

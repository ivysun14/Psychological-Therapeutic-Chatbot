<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You look like you've been dyeing wool. Well, I'm glad you're here. I was nervous for a minute that maybe you weren't going to show up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was kind of like (unclear) by the time I was like able to do that and I was like, ‘well, I can be there in two minutes anyway (cross talk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, that's okay. I mean I will wait for you, always. I thought, I know last week felt like a really intense session for me and I wonder if it felt that way for you and if maybe, you know I wondered if you were not showing up and maybe that was because last week was hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean I wouldn't do that without actually canceling or something. Reasons for me not showing up are either being really, really sick or that one time there was a time change and I forgot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, you're always very good about usually coming to session or always canceling if you need to. Did last session feel hard for you or is that just on my end?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did feel hard for me but I guess because I had all these other things that were harder like it was not much in the scheme of things because that was last Monday and I had to wait until Thursday to get the prescription for meds and then I couldn't start trying it out until Friday and it took a while for them to set in, so I was like going crazy like for all that time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the meds seem to be working. I was a little bit suspicious because it's called Cypromine and when I was looking it up on the Internet after our session it mentioned that it was a tricyclical med like (unclear) norepinephrine and [certinine] (ph) and I was like, ‘no, that's not going to work.' But, I called her and she called me back and it turns out that the Internet is misleading and it really only works (unclear) epinephrine. And so far nothing bad has happened so - I'm feeling a lot better, like there's still times I'm feeling like I want to die but they are a lot less intense and happening a lot less often so - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's an improvement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wish for you that you didn't have any moments where you wished you were going to die or wanted to, but it certainly seems like having some relief from that is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well it's kind of like the other scary thing is if she hadn't told - but I guess I would have figured it out when I was looking it up on the Internet, but you can overdose from this medicine. If you take too much it will be toxic and you can overdose which is not the case for most antidepressants and maybe that's one of the reasons why it's like fallen out of favor among psychiatrists.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you can't trust yourself to take the prescribed amount?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first few days it was like having my dreams because like you know he was on the other side of the bed and I would have had to get past him to get it and stuff, but he trusted me with it. And then today, well at first he couldn't find it. It must have fallen on the floor or something and then he found it and it was like, ‘okay, fine, then give it to me.' Like, I'm not doing this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, one thing you can do if you want to create - rather than having somebody else be responsible for it can also create some barriers to make yourself more trustworthy, is split it up and keep it in separate places so that if you were to feel impulsive, you want to take more than you needed, that would require going to separate places in your house, or separate bottles so that, what you're trying to do is - to this date any time you've ever thought about harming yourself there's also been a voice saying, ‘no, that's not what I really want to do. I might feel like this but I don't actually want to make a plan and follow through on it.' So, I think for your purposes if you can just delay your impulsiveness, you're going to tap into that other part of your voice, or other part of your head that has that more, kind of practical, longer view than what you're feeling in the moment. So if you wanted to separate your prescription out in a couple of different bottles then those are all steps you would have to take each time you could rethink whether or not this is something you really wanted to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Unclear) lot of bottles but right now this sort of did if for me because the pharmacy when I (unclear) get it filled they only were able to give me 12 pills out of the 120 and the rest of them I'm getting today after 4 p.m. I guess because it's a less commonly used drug now so, while I used half of those 12 pills, but like you know, and it was enough to last me, but, I mean I still could have overdosed from them because like they're 25 my pills and like the common adult dosage is 100 to 200 mg and so that would have been 300 mg in there and also you sort of like after you get to a certain point you have to take a blood test to see what the level is in your blood to regulate the amount, so (unclear) very good about taking the amount of drugs that I need to like in general, also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been very compliant with your meds.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, it's all so complicated and just also afraid the more that I step it up the more likely that some seratonin effect is going to come in though nothing is happening yet, and like really the main side effect is like dry mouth which whatever I may have also been sick, so I've been needing to drink a lot anyway and take the numbing cough drops and I guess the other one is dizziness and I haven't really been feeling that so I am probably okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:06:42 - 00:06:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I finally sent out a cover letter today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: For the first time in weeks. But it was really a long shot, so it wasn't like the world's best cover letter. It feels like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got moving again. Doing something in that direction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the cataloger at a museum. I actually went to that museum like a ton of times when I was a kid, like my grandparents would take me and stuff. We'd play on the big model (unclear) and stuff and so. (Unclear) It's not far out. I would need a car I'm sure but what a burden. It's like 15 to 30 hours a week which would be perfect but then it's like a one year grant funded thing and like that's fun - it's like a cataloging position that requires cataloging experience and I don't have cataloging experience; I have (unclear) experience and they're not the same thing so it was like trying to convince these people that - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's good enough?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's like the same thing and it's not, so like it wasn't the longest cover letter in the world and I'm like whatever, don't [sweat it] (ph) send it out, I'll give it to them and it was posted on the 14th so it's not even late [between that long] (ph) so - but like I haven't really done anything else that I want to apply to because all these things are like, ‘work on Saturdays,' or ‘volunteer, unpaid internship opportunity.' I'm not writing cover letters for a volunteer unpaid internship. I can get those without writing cover letters. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a volunteer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Yes. I mean, but when I want to volunteer somewhere I can probably do that without writing a cover letter as well. So, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even though this one's a long shot I'm glad to see that you felt well enough to write it and send it out. That's felt blocked for a number of weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like earlier in the week I like wasn't feeling much like it could really, I guess (unclear) Thursday me and Sydney both got sick and like he got really, really sick and I got a little sick which leads us to believe that it might have been the flu since I got a flu shot and he didn't and you know, fever and stuff and I didn't. But also because I woke up so early (unclear). Because we went to bed at 7 last night and so I woke up at 7 this morning you know even after having breakfast I was like okay, fine, I'll write this cover letter and I was going to write this cover letter then I can go down and dye all the yarn. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You used yarn as motivation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used yarn as motivation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you, Georgia. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But there's still a little procrastination in there because I was like, I use knitting as procrastination and then dyeing yarn since it's such a much more involved process as an actual reward. And then also my yarn did get featured in the newspaper for the holiday guide.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ‘Cause I like a person had written me and I wrote her back and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't get my paper this Sunday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it was this Sunday. I think it was Friday or something. It's also on the website for whatever day that was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mind if I go check out your article?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can check it out, it's the local@scene holiday giving guide and then it's like a slide show of 38 pictures and mine are the last three.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd love to see your work. I haven't seen a project in a long time.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: For projects, they're just in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to show me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You used to knit in sessions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [These do in the right stuff excellent] (ph) project; this is a long project. This is a project. [00:11:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very pretty colors.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is the scarf I'm knitting for Sydney, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure he'll be very appreciative. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's seen me working on it so it's not going to - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not going to be a surprise but I'm sure he'll appreciate it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also good because it means if he didn't like an aspect of it he can tell me before I got to far. But, yeah, there are so few things to apply for now. Like also today since he, the guy from the temp agency hadn't called me at all last week so I called and left a message today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I guess it'll be a weekly calling and leaving a message or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can put it in your calendar as your "to'do" to keep on top of them if you don't hear from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just seems like you know with the holidays is so sparse because I was even looking at like, when I was looking at the job log last week - I think it was after our session I actually did go and look and they hadn't updated it for the week and like the previous week there was like nothing that was local, paid and I wasn't even really qualified for, so it was kind of disheartening. I mean there were other sites I have looked at and need to look at and like this is just the easiest one to look at but like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad to hear that you've taken some steps. For a couple of weeks there you felt like you couldn't do anything and you've motivated yourself to write the cover letter, you called a temp agency. You followed up with them again. You dyed some yarn. It looks like you're ready to send some stuff out, so you're moving again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's only about like $130 worth of yarn for me on whatever day it was posted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a nice order.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was Thursday, the day it was posted. But it's just still disheartening. I'm still not that motivated and like, yeah, you wrote this one cover letter but now what and you know, still like not even sure who I should ask for a job. I don't know, I could - one of my other friends actually posted on Facebook and be like, ‘hey, I'm looking for a job in like anything.' And I'm just like, I don't know what would happen if I posted that on Facebook. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if you - would you consider posting a slightly more limited thing to Facebook. ‘Hey, I'm looking for a job, something related to library science.' </p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: I could. I just don't know. Especially because most of the people on Facebook are my age and like living in the area or if they are they are also looking for jobs or something and like I don't even know if that did her any good. Like I didn't see if there were any responses. I mean she also is like a licensed message therapist or something like has skills that I don't have and she was looking for like retail (unclear) type things, I guess because she - I don't know if she living in Chicago or wants to live in Chicago but like she is licensed in like Maine and then she'd need the extra money to take more classes to get licensed in Chicago in order to start making money doing that in Chicago. So - trying to find another job in the meantime. I just don't like doing things like that. It's not like I saw her posting and was like, ‘oh, my God, that's the most obnoxious thing ever, but it's just like I don't know if I could do that.' Also, because my parents are on Facebook. I guess I could probably write one like limited if I like put the [basement] (ph) settings. I never actually really explored the privacy settings on Facebook because I just, as a rule, because my parents are on Facebook before they started having privacy settings, I just made it a rule not to post anything that I wouldn't want my parents to see. So, I guess I could explore that and make it so my parents couldn't see it. [00:15:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It brings up just the idea of networking which as you know is a difficult area for you. So that was one way that this particular person chose to kind of put the word out there and hit a broad group of people depending on - </p>

<p>CLIENT: So she's also looking for a broad type of jobs like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is there a more tailored way that you could do something similar - not necessarily the same, not posting to Facebook but is there something that you would - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, not that I can think of that would like be useful like wherever people who would know things and stuff.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:16:30 - 00:16:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really not going to - like if I want to work in retail or something, I would maybe but I really, really don't. And if it's not going to pay enough for it to be worth it, I'd rather have the free time that I might be making $8.00 an hour which I think is reasonable. If it would be like working that much time, not in my field, not advancing at all or getting anything productive done, you know, for not enough money to live off of versus perhaps doing nothing but at least I'm not making myself miserable doing all this work and making no money for it. And I think retail is one of those more like it's a harder job for less pay and you have no down time and I guess I'm sort of traumatized by my experience working at my dad's hardware store and like never again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was so painful about working for your dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He always gave me minimum wage which was like $6.00 an hour at the time for doing tons and tons and tons of work and my grandma was there and there was no down time at all. If you had some down time it was like ‘oh, no, you can clean this thing,' or ‘oh, you can do book work,' or ‘you can do this or that.' No down time. She didn't believe in down time. Whereas, like you know, you might have a cushy office job where you're working for like - making (unclear) I was getting $13 an hour and there was like a lunch hour or a lunch half hour and that was actually part of your work day, you know. You got paid for that. And you could, if there wasn't a project that you were doing and there weren't any projects, and I have a lot of projects, but if there was nothing going on or if I was like specifically waiting on someone to do something, and you know they told me to wait, I actually had down time and I could like socialize with people and stuff. And so it was sort of like the direct opposite of retail. And the work was also a somewhat intellectually challenging.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's the direct opposite of retail with your grandmother in charge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With my grandma in charge. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder - it sounds like part of your traumatizing experience of working there is not just that it was retail, but that it was, it's something - there's the difficult dynamic with your grandmother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't difficult. Like it was a lot more difficult to be a cashier than it would be to say be in the Gap because you have special orders and contractor accounts and all sorts of crazy things that you wouldn't have at a clothing store or anything else store really, so yeah, it was like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it was just a bad work experience for you to work in your family's shop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the customers were usually nice and that was fun, it was just my grandmother was just a pain in the butt and like when my mom started working for the hardware store like, well I guess it would have been almost like a year and a half ago now, she would like say, ‘oh, all those times you complained about how hard it was to work with grandma, blah, blah, blah, blah, you were right and I'm sorry.' I was like, ‘okay, see. Yes, it was that bad.' She thought I was blowing it out of proportion, but no.' I mean now my grandma doesn't work there anymore, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But going back to work there really isn't an option for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sort of morally opposed to the whole - they pay their cashiers nothing and don't give them health insurance, so yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's what makes it not an option, how strongly you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like, I don't want to do food service either because it's like - the (unclear) is actually hiring and I'm like, ‘hmm, I wonder what kind of experience that would be? I'm like, I just don't think I would be coordinated enough to scoop the ice cream without breaking the cone or something and would probably eat way to much ice cream and so I don't know. Maybe working in some small, some other sort of shop wouldn't really suck so much, but I'm still sort of traumatized by it. </p>

<p>(Pause): [00:21:21 - 00:21:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you're more likely to take action if you focus your efforts on library related stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if it's not directly archivist jobs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're more motivated to really stay in your field.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also because like they would be more likely to give me an interview anyway. I'm having enough trouble with like the admin assistant jobs and I think of whoever is qualified for those, how much more over qualified would they think I'd be for like working in an ice cream store or something. Like, extremely over qualified. And so I wouldn't get those jobs either. Maybe if I came in with a resume or something then I don't actually - like I don't even put it on my resume any more because it was from like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So long ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So long ago. Yeah. It was like 10 years ago. </p>

<p>(Pause): [00:22:20 - 00:22:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't even have the relevant experience, I just have all these degrees that would make me cost more money. And then again everyone in the area has all these degrees that would make them cost more money and someone has to work retail so I guess that's not a complete argument against, but it just, yeah, doesn't seem like it would work. And I'd be fine doing admin work in like some sort of place somewhere around here, just don't want to work retail. I mean, with the exception of a yarn store. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you looking into those?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because they aren't hiring right now. I mean I like tried that before and like they weren't hiring when I was looking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was the last time you checked back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A long time ago. So maybe they'd be hiring now, but like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially maybe part - temporary and holiday season?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, though they require Saturdays and that would be a problem, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is pretty late in the holiday season now, but - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that would probably require going all the way out there and looking or calling them or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that may be like one phone call. I'm thinking about what would be your equivalent of sort of a general shout out to people that you're looking for work, maybe putting on your list something reasonable and manageable like calling one yarn store, asking if they're hiring. If they say no, asking one question. ‘Hey, do you know of any other similar stores in the area that may be hiring?' That could be sort of a nonconventional networking phone call for you. </p>

<p>(Pause): [00:24:33 - 00:24:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but would they send someone to their competition? And I guess it's less (unclear) than like some other industries, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I mean the existence of the store is there sometimes people are actually collaborative rather than competitive. Stores actually make more money when there are more stores near them because you draw a bigger crowd.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess it is a bigger place for yarn stores so people would go to the city and go to all the yarn stores.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know and some places are more of a community of you know, where all the people really into crafting - but either you don't end up in a worse position and you may not get a great lead out of it, but for the effort that you would have to put out to make that first phone call, it's certainly not going to harm you in any way and it sounds like one of the things in the past that we've talked about sending somebody an e-mail, a professor an e-mail asking a friend, or putting it on Facebook. One of the things you're worried about is well what would they think if I'm asking? But if you call a store that you frequent and you know, but they don't really know you that personally, there's much less chance of feeling judged. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially if I don't give them my name in the first place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so it prevents - it takes down that barrier that seemed to have existed for you in terms of networking, just kind of a fear that someone is going to think badly of you for asking. So it takes away that piece of it, but it could get you a lead.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At this point after being unemployed for a year I mean (unclear) kind of scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'm really sick of being unemployed or under employed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I can imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, they seem really enthusiastic at the temp agency but I haven't - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't heard anything back yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you sick enough of being unemployed to push yourself to do some of these uncomfortable things in the hopes of it leading somewhere?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how much of a - the risk versus the possible, the probable reward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think in something like doing a cold call like this the probability of reward is pretty low. I don't think zero, but I think it's pretty low. But I also think the risk is really low. It's not having to craft the perfect cover letter. It's not any sense of any public display of neediness. To me it seems like a very low risk with some potential reward.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:27:31 - 00:27:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is really hard to deal with and I have just a tiny little bit of motivation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I want to capitalize on that tiny bit of motivation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's also like you know I might be going to Kentucky soon and oh, I guess - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In theory, Sydney and I are going to Kentucky to meet his family for Christmas but it's sort of up in the air because he's sick and because he's kind of annoyed at them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I didn't know that you were traveling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I mean that sort of feels impossible. Well, I mean I guess I could send cover letters from there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long would you be gone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For a week which would mean I would miss next week's session, but - yeah, a week. Like we leave on a Thursday and come back on a Wednesday. Which is really fine because yeah, you've got this friend feature - oh, wait, what if they're going to want to buy things from you for Christmas? Do I close the store? Do I like bring a certain percentage of the stuff with me and only keep those things online or do I like put in giant bold letters, ‘if you buy this you will not get it until after Christmas because I am away, but please buy from me'. And so not going with (unclear) [00:29:02] but yeah - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The majority of Christmas orders hopefully will be in before next Thursday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this is Thursday. The thing is though like if they - true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Cross talk) last minute orders. </p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to get last minute orders. Usually if you're getting, doing last minute - if you're a crafter you're knitting last minute. You're not (unclear) late minute. I would have to put it in front of every single piece that I have in the store so that, and then when they buy it I would also have to (unclear) it there because they just don't like getting it in a couple of days. [00:29:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not getting it in a couple of days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want late customers but yet again I'm like, but there was the person who bought $135 worth of yarn. Maybe if people just buy everything in the next like three days then I won't have to deal with it at all, so that's not going to happen. Yeah, and I'm also apprehensive about this trip because Sydney doesn't have the best relationship with his parents. In terms of like his, like because we were thinking of staying in a hotel for like (unclear) and then when he was calling his mom and was going to tell her that she opened up the conversation with, ‘oh, like you're cousin (unclear) is so glad you're coming and they get to stay near you,' and like after that he couldn't like say - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Cross talk) you made that assumption pretty clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was kind of like well you could call your cousin and be like, ‘hey, we can all stay in the hotel.' But the problem is they're like I would actually be staying in the same room with him because like one of the reasons we were looking into the hotel was the whole if I am this crazy and this distress with like medications and panic and stuff I do not want to be sleeping in a room by myself. So I would be sleeping in his room, however, I would be sleeping on his bed and he would be sleeping on an air mattress. His mattress, his regular mattress is like at least 10 years old, probably a lot older than that. It is like one (unclear), it is broken. It's not just hard. It like hurts your back and he's been trying to convince his parents to like to replace it for like years and like they've put other guests on it and like when he told them he was like ‘you really should look into it,' and they sort of like laughed at him with disbelief like it's a crazy luxury item or something of having a mattress that doesn't attack your back so I was like well if I'm sleeping there, you know what, you're - because also his parents don't deal well with like complaining, and so, they're like, ‘when so and so stayed on the mattress they didn't complain,' and it was like because they were a guest, not because the mattress was comfortable. So it's like well you're thinking of getting your dad a more expensive Christmas present than that anyway, even like a $200 mattress because it's a twin bed, is still going to be better than whatever you have. Find something (unclear) and that will be their Christmas present and you are giving it to them and that's it. That is like the only way it will work because arguing with them isn't going to get you anywhere. So I guess he was talking with his therapist about whether or not he should go down, but now we have the - since he called them today to tell them that he was sick, we have that as an out because they don't want us if we're sick because I guess they have more (unclear) then my parents do. When I was sick my parents were like, ‘oh, yes, come down for Thanksgiving.' So after I hung up I went to the emergency room (unclear) whatever. Not like Sydney's parents who don't want us getting people sick which actually makes sense. [00:32:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Travel experience as well. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole airplane thing. He doesn't think he'd be able to manage it. And like he's going to be better by then, but then again he also thought he was going to be better for the past few days and he hasn't been so we kind (unclear) end of going because originally I was excited but now it's like, ‘ohh' the mattress issue and the panic issue and the everything else, like it just seems like it's going to be too overwhelming and he said that if we end up not going we can like use those tickets for something else like go to the Southwest is really good about like if not refunding, at least letting you use those tickets for something else. And that's what we both thought, so, like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I hope it works out the way you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me too. And you know I was excited about meeting his family but now I'm just like this is going to be too much. I'm just going to hide in the room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope it does work out the way you want it and I keep remembering that part of the reason you're fearful is because you're panic/anxiety has been so bad, but you did notice that for the past few days it's been getting better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hoping you can continue in that path would make the trip a lot easier if you end up going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I could pretend to be a normal, say, not panicking person long enough as long as I have somewhere to return to.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:34:22 - 00:34:30] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes the distraction of having to perform whether it to prepare for something else actually does help you to set panic aside. Sometimes this gives you a focus. So we'll see what happens with what you guys end up deciding how you cope with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I hadn't gotten the feature then it wouldn't have been a big deal to close my store for like a week and now I'm like I don't want to close my store for a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's nice to take advantage of - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the interest. (Unclear) like if I put it everywhere, like where the people - but then again I guess I'm worried about people who can't read, but like in theory any normal person would be able to see it because it would be like the person would see like, ‘items will not ship until after x-date.' [00:35:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and that's a common disclosure in thinking about when people can expect to get stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean but I feel like wouldn't people normally close the store if they were going to have that much of a delay, like it's a week's delay.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:35:32 - 00:35:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then again there are people who like buy things that it takes - you know I've bought things where it takes longer than that to ship and they don't have any sort of delay. That's just how they are. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, these are decisions that you are capable of making once you figure out whether you're going or not. You can think it through and choose what's best for your store. </p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Should keep a session on the books for next week or - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, I mean I'll know by Thursday whether or not I'm going, but I could let you know on Thursday whether, if I'm canceling and if I don't let you know assume it's still on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let's, if you can, move it to earlier in the day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Monday. (Unclear) lots of people are away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah, it's Christmas Eve. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could we do like an 11:30 or 12?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll just put it on my calendar. So let's plan for 11:30 and then obviously if you're not going to be here just give me a call. Give me a call Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By the way, did you hear back from the - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything's been sent off. I haven't heard anything back yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It often does take weeks and weeks and weeks for insurance to process things. Sometimes it's really - sometimes you hear back within a week, sometimes six weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is not unusual. I have sent in all your billing and I sent in your referral form with it. So, we're just waiting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, good, Hopefully, we'll - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I give you a bill last time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I made a bill for you with the sessions that we knew it wouldn't cover. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. So that does not include what I tried to bill them for.</p>

<p></p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (Unclear) [00:38:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then I'll, yeah, if they don't cover something, I'll just send you another, I'll include it in the next bill.</p>

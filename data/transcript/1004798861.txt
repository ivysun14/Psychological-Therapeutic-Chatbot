<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:00:02] in a little bit. I apologize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I understand. The vagrancies of the Square.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was what? [inaudible [00:00:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Vagrancies. I said the vagrancies of the Square.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, maybe that's right. Me, I usually think of the vagaries of something, but you probably meant the vagrancies.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I did mean vagrancies. The weirdness of travel around the Square. Yeah. In fact, being out last week also saved me from [inaudible [00:00:48], which I appreciated so much. Because I hate it every year. I mean, I hated it when I was a student, it sucks as a stock member. [00:01:04]</p>

<p>(pause) So (pause) one of the things I've been thinking about at work is sometimes I feel like (pause) I focus too much on things that aren't working. And so (pause) and then also lately, I've been trying to not—like when Karl's like "So, what do you think about that?" I've been trying to just not answer, because he doesn't actually really know, and it's not going to go anywhere helpful, and I just really don't believe in like if someone is asking me an individual question, because I'm trying to not just bust out about how much I hate various things. [00:02:23]</p>

<p>Which it's going OK-ish. (pause) I think it would be—part of what's frustrating is a lot of people don't want to make complaints or say anything negative because they fear that it will be held against them. So then I feel more isolated when saying something. So none of the librarians who have told me how much they dislike the Room will tell anyone in charge of it. So they complain about it to me, and then I say "Well go complain," and then none of them do it. So then I just feel like an asshole. [00:03:17]</p>

<p>And so one of the other librarians who works at the university, when we were both there, she also has been writing a column for the Journal, just like a trade journal, for a really long time. And she had this series of articles about—I mean, it was kind of funny because they were super obviously about all her transition problems there, except that she never mentioned where she worked, except that (pause) it's known where she works, so they didn't even have to talk about it. [00:04:00]</p>

<p>Anyway, so she's talking about something from library school in the '70s, and the teacher here was like "Yeah, you know, if there's a project or initiative at work, you can complain about it before it happens, or do whatever. But once it happens, you should no longer complain about it. Instead, decide is this something I can live with, or do I need to leave this organization, because this is pissing me off." And so she was going to do something, like "Well, I couldn't focus on positive and not blah blah blah blah blah." And so she's actually one of the librarians who did the long focus groups for the Larsen Room that were completely ignored. [00:05:05]</p>

<p>So I've been kind of thinking like, well—I mean she was in the position of doing all this work, presenting it, and getting completely ignored. So in theory, she should be in some ways more upset about it than I am. Then again, she no longer has to deal with it. Like, she's not teaching in that room, and doesn't have to think about it on a regular basis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So in that sense she's further from it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) And she's also—like I think seniority wise, etc., she's been here for quite a while, s she has some seniority and she has been tapped to do—she is tapped a lot to do sort of focus group-y projects. For whatever reason. [00:06:10]</p>

<p>So (pause) And then she wrote some other pieces recently and she was talking about how no one really wants to be a middle manager. I'm like, "yeah, that's true." I thought that was kind of hilarious that she was like "no one wants to do this." Like everyone just wants to be a higher level. Like you either want to have no responsibility, or responsibility and control, and not like a half-assed version of it. So you know, I started reading it and—I don't know, she talked a lot about—she was talking about like what are positive qualities in management, negative qualities, and back and forth. [00:07:05]</p>

<p>And so I've been thinking about all of this. And I meant to—I was trying to head over to ask the doctor about the [inaudible [00:07:14] and then she didn't get a chance to, because she's really busy and things. But (pause) it is one of the things that—I don't know, I find the idea of like stopping—sort of saying "Well, is this initiative, project, something I can live with, or should I just leave?" to be kind of (pause) a bit black and white. Like also, super not relevant if it's hard to find a job, and it's also a lot easier to do that if you're probably middle management, then I'll go in, or have a [inaudible [00:08:16], etc. then not. [00:08:20]</p>

<p>So I don't know, it's funny, but I kind of see the point of I guess—once upper level management has made a decision, complaining about it really isn't going to change anything, probably. You know, it's not how decisions are made, whatever. But (pause) I mean, if you think about it, like the main reason why I complain about—I'm trying to like Room—but when I do, it's usually because I've been trying to use it and it doesn't work, or trying to train someone, and it doesn't work. Which I feel is kind of different. [00:09:19]</p>

<p>I guess where I'm with this is, I decided to do something which I normally dislike doing, which is reading stuff about like—horrible books like [inaudible [00:09:36] or—there was this one which I didn't realize it was a business book.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like management books?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except, sort of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like management self-help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like self-help books, almost. Which I mostly find horrifying. And [inaudible [00:09:55] is a terrible book. [00:10:00]</p>

<p>But so I was reading a couple blogs that people I know follow, that give career advice. And then kind of more of it is -I thought I was reading this book on a Nook that I took out from the library that was about introverts, about being an introvert. But it was secretly actually about introverts and business. Because you don't see the book back. I'm like "cover says introverts."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Back says Nook.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it took a little while for the author to get to it, but basically her point is (pause) her two like main groups that she's talked about so far are she's studied business school students at the Business School. She also talked to I think some law school students, but mostly business school. And then she talked to some religious leaders. I know, I don't understand. Like she went to one of those really big Mecca churches that have 50 bazillion religious laypeople doing things, and talked to them, and a number of them were introverted. [00:11:20]</p>

<p>It really wasn't what I was expecting, but (pause) so she's kind of going on this whole thing of like introversion is actually valuable because you know, the imagined ideal is sort of the extroverted, and that's how you get ahead in business or ahead in the workplace, and then she's giving all these examples of things of people who are actually introverts, blah blah blah, studies that show—like people brainstorm better by themselves than in groups. [00:12:01]</p>

<p>And so in reading a lot of these, like in looking at these, mostly what I feel like is (pause) I just feel like not much applies to what I do, or like my job. Like depressingly, I am [inaudible [00:12:25] impulsive, like (pause) I don't have to work reports. I don't manage anyone. I don't particularly work with like—I don't work in a cube farm right now, although I will be. (pause) So it's like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression of the two things that you want are either, and better, to be listened to and actually taken account of by management, or to be able to live better with things you think are ridiculous and awful that management has done or decided. [00:13:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And (pause) none of this really addresses that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With the exception of, you know, if your workplace is really toxic, you just have to leave. And I'm like, well, cool story. Where am I going to get a job, if I just leave? Like, I'm not going to quit. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what this is about? I mean (pause) I've never heard you talk about looking for a job. I mean, if you were offered a job at a different place or an IT library or a school, or I don't know, somewhere top [inaudible [00:14:21] working at one of these. (pause) Would you—and I guess that the benefits are the (pause) same for library school and the health related work. I mean, if you had all that at another library, would you go? [00:14:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, except that (pause) It's not that there's a glut of library school students, it's that at some point like, I don't know, seven or eight years ago, library schools were like "Oh my God, all those old librarians are going to retire. New librarians. There's going to be tons of job openings." So there are a lot of librarians on the market. So most library jobs that are new jobs, you have to have a library degree. For even things where I'm like "It's not relevant, you're the overnight supervisor. Who cares." [00:15:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's actually part of what pushed me more towards finishing here—finishing MOS, or concentrating on it more. Because I started looking, and I'm just like "wow, there is—if my job"—well, I don't know, that might be true—[00:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. They'd like to replace you with an MOS.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They might. So it's sort of like a double thing, like they might replace me with an MOS, or they would replace me with someone who has like IT certification or something. And IT certification is the most useless thing in the world, but HR loves it. So people who do what I do, have been losses. Like I've sort of back-ended into it, which is how I came into doing like IT Web also. (pause)</p>

<p>And so all the people in the library I've talked to people who don't have library degrees but have been working there for like 10, 15 years, they're like "Oh yeah, I could never get this job again. If I lose this job it would require an MOS." So (pause) I mean, part of why I feel trapped is that (pause) most—I don't, so I don't have the paper credentials. For either library stuff or IT stuff. [00:17:21]</p>

<p>And if they bother to—I could talk to someone, or my resume got that far, like far enough in, then it wouldn't matter except that it will just be cut, which [inaudible [00:17:33].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Just because [inaudible [00:17:35].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which I understand, it's just frustrating. And I was also asking people, "Can you apply if your MOS isn't quite completed." And they're all like "Yeah, if it's like a semester, sure." More than that, mmmm. So I haven't been looking at jobs, because it's frustrating. [00:18:06]</p>

<p>And also the few times I do—the thing that's, I don't know—it's hilarious, it's something—I'm not getting a pay raise through getting this degree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yep. Because IT pays more than librarian [inaudible [00:18:26].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, and because you're part IT.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because so all my moves have theoretically been lateral. And I've just been like, I'm not taking it. I've said I don't want to take a pay cut. So I got a fat raise and I moved to IT from being the secretary, and then they never decreased that. So it's just been going up like a small amount, job to job. Which is [inaudible [00:19:00] at the university. [00:19:01]</p>

<p>So (pause) yeah. I earn—I'm basically earning right now, what a starting librarian in this area would earn, if not a little more. So (pause) but it doesn't particularly bother me. I just don't want to take a pay cut at a job that I absolutely never thought that a librarian would be, but I enjoy the credentials.</p>

<p>(pause) I mean part of what this, sort of why I've also been thinking about it, is so my brother and Ashby—his wife Ashby—Ashby goes a lot to a lot of networking groups in Chicago, to like at work, your business, whatever. [00:20:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ashby does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does she do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's a reporter, and she started an online blog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In Chicago. And the idea is her sort of [inaudible [00:20:28] of the Chicago African American with black swagger. So [inaudible [00:20:36]. She's an amazing writer and reporter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's really good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she's really amazing. Like she's won circle of boards, she's done investigative trials, and then more investigative trials. Yeah. So she went to Ivy League schools. My brother did too. So some of the things they go do are like black [inaudible [00:21:05] graduate cocktail party, whatever, I don't know. So what happens is—[00:21:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She goes—do they have journalism there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know. That was her Bachelor's. She has a Master's, I don't recall from where. (pause) Yeah, no, I was just kind of thinking, "Actually, I have no idea." So they go to these socials. So I'll get texts from my brother being like "Oh, do you know this person? They were here." And I'm like, "Hm, I don't know, let me Google." And I'm just like "No, I do not know that person who went to Law School or Business School or owns their own company, or whatever," which makes me feel (pause) I'm not usually obsessed with where my career is, but that makes me feel—[00:22:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:22:18] Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's like the—the thing is, especially when there's a direct comparison, like "Oh, someone I know, they've done all these things that are cool." And basically when my brother was at one of these, and he asked me about six different people. I didn't know any of them, and they were all doing amazing things. And three of them were lawyers, or four of them were lawyers. And I don't want to be a lawyer, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it'd be nice to be doing amazing things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'd be nice to have like "And these are my successes," or something. Like, I don't know what I want. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think—I want to [inaudible [00:23:03] here and you'd want to start with being happy with what you're doing. I mean, if you were doing exactly what you're doing now except you felt good about where you were working, this would be totally different ball game, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like, when I did Customer Support, which is basically the bottom. I loved it. I thought it was really great. I was totally happy doing that. I wasn't particularly interested in getting promoted out of it. But I would get certification pressure and I'm like "But why? I enjoy this, and I'm good at this, so who the fuck cares?" (pause) So yeah, I feel like I have nothing good to say about my workplace or my work. (pause) You know, like (pause) yeah, I mean talking about work is pretty much "And these various shitty things happened, and I'm super frustrated and want to leave." And then I ask to be laid off. (pause) [00:24:22]</p>

<p>Like (pause) and unfortunately, going to the university gives you a lot of examples of people overachieving. Which -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, a graduate in the city probably, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which I usually try not to let that bother me because there's just so many of them, and I don't actually—I never want to be a doctor or lawyer, and having my B.A., so that's nice. But like (pause) they just keep on overachieving in places sometimes that I'm actually interested in. (pause) [00:25:08]</p>

<p>I had this sort of neurotic freak-out over this author I like, Baratunde Thurston. He's a black intellectual comedian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:25:25] had to be black.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I listened to an interview with him on Fresh Air or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's hilarious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a year behind me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wondered actually if he was around your year, he seemed maybe like your age.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm. He's one year younger than me, and he was involved—I basically figured out that we probably have tons of mutual friends, but I never met him. Not that I can recall. Partially because he was involved in our [inaudible [00:26:03] Society, which I wasn't involved with. I was doing other North stuff. And he also was involved with the African American Student Union, which I wasn't involved in, and I didn't quite realize—I was just like "It's a student group," but I didn't really process that—basically all the other black students were in it, it seems like. [00:26:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, and you somehow missed that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just was like "well, meh." I don't know. I didn't do a lot of clubs; I was shy. My brother had this really weird experience with a black student group at his school, so I was kind of like eh. And frustratingly, when I look at the resumes of all these super high-achieving black graduates, they all were involved in CUMBA. And I'm just like (frustrated groan). Not that that would have mattered success-wise, but it's just like, "Yes, I didn't know going through CUMBA. Sorry." [00:27:15]</p>

<p>So yeah, Baratunde Thurston, he's a year behind me, went to Harvard, and we knew the same people, we were geeks, and he was a consultant, and then decided to dedicate himself to doing comedy. And so (pause) so I checked out the book How to Be Black from the library and then I had to return it, because it was making me feel bad about myself in this weird way. Because—so his book, it's really funny. And the thing was is that I was identifying really strongly with some of the things he was saying, but then I felt like "Well, we're similar in these certain ways, and I'm working in the Library and you're not." And what he does is something that I find much more interesting than the MBA. (pause) It's sort of—[00:28:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the one that kind of hurts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that one I was just like "Oh, damn it." And the other one that hurts is someone who I hated in college who's gotten ahead a lot. And just mostly like because I hate her. I partially liked this [inaudible [00:28:51]. She was writing for The New York Times for awhile, which was annoying. She decided to write a book about Asian American home cooking, and that got published. And she also is helping funding—she helped fund this private invitation-only conference that Ashby went to here. So (pause) [00:29:20]</p>

<p>It's one of those things where I'm like also, she must have had to be rich, or—just contextually, I'm pretty sure she has a lot of money. Or—because you don't help fund an invitation-only conference. (laughs) And some other things, contextually, I'm like, "yeah, you have money." Or access to people who have money. So that one I'm a little bit like, "Well, it really helps to have all the money to do these things." But it still is frustrating. [00:30:03]</p>

<p>Like the book that she wrote, I'm like "Wow, this is really interesting. I wish that you hadn't done a kind of half-assed job at it. Also I don't like you." But (pause) like her description of the process, which I'm sure is inaccurate, was basically "I thought of this site I was thinking about how I don't know enough about what my grandparents cook when I changed my [inaudible [00:30:28] so I'm just going to write a book about Asian American grandma home-style cooking." [inaudible [00:30:38] Like I know this didn't really just happen like that, but it kind of feels like it. (pause) And so yeah, I don't know. (pause) For me it's not really like the money status symbol of certain overachieving careers, but it's the [inaudible [00:31:18] of doing something really interesting that you enjoy, and it's like this is your frame, your creativity, and that's all awesome, and whoop de do. (pause) [00:31:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel inhibited when it comes to doing stuff like that. (pause) [00:32:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. (pause) Like there are people who've definitely done a sort of, at some point, leap of faith. [inaudible [00:32:44] left, like he was working his consulting job, training [inaudible [00:32:50] to do other things, and at a certain point, he basically said "Fuck it, I'm still doing some consulting," but he's taking the bus for a four-hour comedy intensive, and then taking a 2 a.m. train back to go to work. And then at some point he kind of [inaudible [00:33:19] this why would you have to be like "I'm doing this or I'm not." (pause) And (pause) the sort of leap of faith jump is very scary. (pause) [00:33:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've not heard you entertain thoughts about what types of things like that you might want to do. I mean, in other words (pause) My impression is that (pause) you don't get—you stop a few steps short of the leap of faith. You may be thinking about stuff like that. But (pause) we just don't talk about it. (pause) [00:34:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I do, like (pause) I do tend to stop like (pause) and part of it is, my grandparents' voice in my head being like "Oh my God, you have to have a job. You can't just quit without having another job lined up. Holy shit." [00:35:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is like abject terror.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, that's basically how they react.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess you too, a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, because I've heard them say it so much. (pause) And my brother, before he went to grad school, so he quit a job and had like three and a half months, so he decided to travel. Because he's like "I'm not going to have this much money again for awhile." So he went white water rafting, he travelled around, and did something else. And my mom was super anxious about it for the months leading up to it, the entire time he was doing it, and then a little bit afterwards. (pause) Like she just was really—didn't approve, thought it was like really reckless, and, you know, a terrible idea. And my dad agreed, though in a somewhat less intense way. So it's (pause) I feel like I already know what—I already sort of somewhat experienced—[00:36:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Vicariously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, they weren't calling me to yell me about it. They were calling me to then talk about my brother. Still -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it's sort of cautionary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, so it's sort of a vicarious parental freak-out. So that's hard. And it also just is—I feel like setting that aside as I move forward [inaudible [00:37:10]. (pause) A leap of faith is a leap of faith, and you don't know. [00:37:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you don't even know if what you might think to do would require one. I mean, for example, if you decided that what you really want to do is write a book about X. But you could probably just do that. It might take awhile because you're working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But (pause) I don't know, from my impression of like—if you write and think about things, if that was something you really set yourself to do, you could have it done in a fairly short amount of time with no odds of security (PH), I mean, I'm not trying to convince you to write a book, I'm just saying like—[00:38:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're not saying Nanowrimo.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nanowrimo?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, sorry. It's a novel writing month in November.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Novel writing month in—?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's called novel-writing month. And the idea is that you—collectively, people write the equivalent of a novel. And you send them off to Nanowrimo, and all it does is a word count. Like, do you have enough words for it to be novel length. And then it says "You won Nanowrimo." So lots of people I know have written novels that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not good novels. But the point is, the exercise is, that anyone can write a novel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right, exactly. (pause) So I guess I'm wondering, is the idea of a leap of faith a displacement of something else, such as—you said something like a cliché of a psychologist, a leap of faith in yourself, you know, even if it's not kind of a financial leap of faith, but it's leaving your job, just start new, that type of thing. [00:39:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I think I'm using the example of, I'm going to quite my job and move to a new city. Like I don't mean just that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that's like a metaphor for -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then in a way, clearly, not pursuing a variety of IT careers that I could have at a certain point and not pursuing start ups was (pause) I don't know, I just knew that's not what I want to do, and I—you know, dot com, blah blah blah. Everyone's like "Oh my God, IT." I have 70 friends that do it, and who are like "No, no, you could totally do this, you could totally do this." And for me, it was like "But I don't want to." And that was almost a reverse financial leap of faith, in that (pause) I just—yeah. [00:40:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or it was kind of a leap of faith not to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I feel—as time goes on, I feel very good about. I felt good about it at the time, and more and more I'm like yep, that's the decision I wanted, I don't even have to think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. I assume, because that's—it's not what you really would have wanted to do? It wouldn't have [inaudible [00:40:58] you in that way. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and also I think in the end, once I [inaudible [00:41:06] first and all these other things, you kind of have to be passionate about it to do a good job. Right? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, what if they're not paying you $200,000 to show up, play foosball and have happy hour every day. You actually have to care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah, and I just don't care. Like, I profoundly don't give a shit about the people like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that doesn't—right. (pause) So I guess that makes me, in a way, more curious why it seems there are other things out there that you would have been excited to do or think about, that you didn't. [00:42:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think (pause) definitely for awhile, I was mostly thinking -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you haven't, as you've been so frustrated and feeling stuck where you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I tend to think about the kind of jobs that I don't want. (pause) And also what I do want is a job I can either leave at the end of the day or I'm like "Yay, job."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, sure. Like you don't want to start with a job that sort of still is over [inaudible [00:42:44] and you don't like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not even—like I have a coworker who I used to work with, and he works at the map collection institute. He's been there for awhile. And it's not a thrilling job, it's not a horrible job. It's just kind of like meh. And that's how he feels about it, kind of like "mm, stuff." And he does that so that he can do art on the weekends and travel. And many ways, I'm like, that's a wonderful job. You do it, you feel fine about it, and then you go do other awesome things. [00:43:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And right now, like it's not job-related, but—well, one of them is that I've been thinking, I should really do a professional librarian blog so I have a dynamic presence as a librarian. But the other thing—I don't know if you've noticed, followed this Reddit scandal of—[00:44:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm pretty clueless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Reddit's a website, it's kind of a cesspit in many ways, and they have -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is their thing? I mean, I've heard of it, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So their thing is, like they're—it's a gazillion message boards or sub-boards, and anyone can create one on anything. So they do [inaudible [00:44:27] on your content and like you can create the atheist beekeepers board, and it'll be—yeah. So it also has a lot of misogynist and sexist cesspits. And lots and lots of porn. The bigger issue being that a couple of their most popular boards feature underage girls. Shots of women taken without their knowledge or consent. And graphic pictures of dead people. [00:45:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So there was this one particular guy who ran the most popular versions of these things, like—they obviously spent a lot of time doing that, and I can't remember exactly how the chain of [inaudible [00:45:23], so a reporter was like, "You know what? Who is this guy? Let's see if we can find out."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do people monetize these?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's interesting. The company Reddit does, but the people who run the boards don't. But what you do get is a ton of social cred. So he was someone who received a lot of social cred from the founders of Reddit and from people involved with it. So he was like a Reddit celebrity. And he was running those [inaudible [00:46:00] underage photos things and being really obnoxious about it. [00:46:05]</p>

<p>And those got kind of [inaudible [00:46:05]. So someone decided to find out who he was. And simultaneously, some of the women who also go to Reddit were like, "You know what? I'm going to see if I can dig up who the guys are who are posting all these underage pictures." Like someone was a substitute teacher or schoolteacher, and he was posting pictures of students in her class. I know, it's disgusting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you know what—here it is, like here is the available Internet trail, and it exposed this one person in particular. And of course, he's like some guy living in the Midwest, just some guy who's a complete horrible person. And so (pause) what that makes me think about a lot is writing something about the author of [inaudible [00:47:04] who has been harassing myself and my best friends. [00:47:11]</p>

<p>And I don't know, I've just been really thinking about why'd he do that. And also thinking I really don't want him—I don't think I want the blow-back. But I really want to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now. So I guess we have next Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I definitely do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I won't be around Monday, Tuesday. I probably won't be able to reschedule, but if I can arrange something, I will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Well thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Definitely am going to see my chiropractor.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I hope that helps.</p>

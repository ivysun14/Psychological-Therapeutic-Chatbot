<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So, this is so nice to see that you are feeling so well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A few bumps, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You certainly deserve it, to be feeling good, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel, I feel really tired some mornings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, some, and sometimes I wake up feeling drunk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Feeling drunk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like the same feeling I get at the end of the night after I've taken my pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes that feeling carries over to the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, which medicine do you think is doing that?  I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's, hasn't changed.  This has always been the case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Which one though, do you think, leads to that feeling of feeling drunk, we don't know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I haven't seen a pattern -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other than, it always happens sometimes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The same way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Very interesting.  Those days that it happens, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to sleep it off, like I'm drunk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what, okay, so do you miss work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many days in a week might it happen, or in a month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In a month, I'd say two to three.  Three to five, maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any connection to anything, you know menstrual cycles or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I noticed.  Um, I have noticed that if I take the pills earlier, it's less likely to happen.  So I've been taking them at 8:00 instead of like 11:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, maybe that's the secret to doing this stuff.  I mean, from looking at your medication, um, do you take, you take the Geodon, all at night, right, 2 pills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's probably, would be my guess, um, the, the, the most likely culprit would be the Geodon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But this happened before I was on Geodon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well then that, we have to back up and look at the, the time line here.  Lamictal, you've been on for quite a while.  Seroquel, you've been on the longest.  You know, the Seroquel, you've been on since '04, the Lamictal, since '05.  How much Lamictal are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 400.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Seroquel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 800.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, okay, well what do you think about, maybe it's the Seroquel.  I mean, Seroquel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, there's really no pattern because some days I wake up feeling fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  That's very strange because as you pointed out there's no consistency to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking any over-the-counter medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I took your advice on taking vitamin B12 and B6.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I just added a multivitamin again, and I wasn't taking it for a while, and I feel energetic because of it.  But it doesn't change the fact that I wake up -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tired -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or nauseated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not nausea it's like a drunk in the head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like I used to feel when I drank.  And I would wake up with a hangover -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or still drunk from the night before.  That's how I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  [COUGHING].  How are you coping with this with work?  Do you have FMLA in place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not, yeah, I'm trying to make up the hours, but I saved vacation time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice.  That's good, good pattern.  Are you getting along okay, um, you know, at home with, um, [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We have issues, but I'm talking to [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  How often are you seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> About every three weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, do you find the work with, with [NAME OTHER] is helpful in addressing these issues at home with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Does he come to any of the sessions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I wouldn't want him to.  We talk about really personal stuff, and I don't think [NAME OTHER] would appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  All right.  How's your daughter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's good.  She had a mini crisis -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which I did talk to [NAME OTHER] about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, um, cried so much that she couldn't go to school and [NAME OTHER] freaked out and called me, "What do you have?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was like, I don't want her to go to the doctor and get medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He agrees.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I think she's just going through puberty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was like that too, but then again -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess my mom told him at one point, she wishes she'd have noticed something earlier -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she did notice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it is something to consider, you know, that, that mood disorders, bipolar disorders, depression, you know, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She didn't know why she was crying and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I used to do that all the time as a teenager.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But, but there is, you know, some genetic, uh, connection here, potentially, um, does not guarantee it, not like all your children are going to have bipolar disorder, but there is a genetic link.  Um, something to keep an eye on.  Have you talked to your daughter since?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's okay now.  She, she has done this since she was [AGE], and she's been developing since she was [AGE], so I've attributed it to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hormonal imbalances and puberty, the onset.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm not worried about it, but, you know, [NAME OTHER] sees her more so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is concerned.  He was going to contact her primary care physician first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And talk to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's puberty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, there's certainly no harm done if, if you have her go in and talk to a counsellor.  You know, before, it's not like you have to run in and start taking medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean even a school counsellor could offer, uh, you know be a good turning point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ye, yeah, she doesn't feel comfortable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I asked her who she'd feel comfortable talking to and it's just grandmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just her two grandmas and her best friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't want to talk to her teacher or anybody at school.  So, he keeps her home [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does she explain that though, why she, she doesn't know why she was crying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She has no idea why she cries.  And I can totally relate, because in my teen years -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did the same thing.  My mom would say, why are you crying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does she seem depressed to you, or does she seem sad or withdrawn?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she seems totally fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, you know, keep an eye on it.  Um, don't ignore it, you know.  I mean, if she needs some help, it's, obviously, you can treat these things better if you get in sooner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't like the idea of meds, um, in teen years -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been hearing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Things about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It makes things worse sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  Well, just keep an eye on all of it, okay?  And, uh, again, you know, talking to somebody as a starting point, doesn't mean, right off the bat she needs medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  Well, [NAME OTHER] and I feel like that's what would be recommended.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would lead to it, yeah.  Well, keep an eye on it.  Give it some thought, okay?  The average time to get a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is still, like, eight or nine years, because people ignore it.  They go get -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, how do you differentiate from puberty?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's very tricky, you know, I mean, but there are some patterns that can be identified.  And kids, you know, when they present with depression, it could be different than, than adults.  You know, they don't necessarily have the classic symptoms of crying spells and, and feeling, you know, telling people they feel sad, but, you know, you might see things like changes in sleep and appetite patterns and this kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think she's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But, I'm just saying, keep an eye on it.  You know, that, that's all.  Um, how's your mom.  I mean, are you guys talking, do you see your mom often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We've been walking.  We've, we might -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Walk tonight -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We've been mall walking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We didn't for a week, because she got sick, but we did for about a week before that, every night.  We talk and walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which, which mall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Yeah I was there once, when the mall walkers were there as a group, people come out, at like, before the mall opens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever seen that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah she was doing that with her lady friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty funny.  I mean, there's just a ton of people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they drop their coats on a bench and walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's good exercise, because I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's great exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Was feeling it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm saying, it was, kind of, funny, I didn't know, you know, it was, like, an organized thing, you, you know, I mean to see people coming in, they would do their lap, you know, everybody knows everybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Heart patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  All right, well, I think that's great that you're getting some exercise.  Um, do you want to check your weight today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm scared to, but yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just keep an eye on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I gained 25 to 30 pounds.  Ouch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 184.8.  I was down to 163.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's a good goal weight for you, then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 145.  I'd be happy with 150.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you, um, well yeah, you're exercising.  When's the last time you had your labs done, blood work, I'm looking at, probably when you were in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I had the burning sensation in my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you ordered the lab tests, and I found the urinary tract infection.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  And again, this sensation you're getting in the mornings now is different than that, the hang over effect thing, and whatever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  And that has been happening since I got put on medicine, in 2002, I've had this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-hum.  Any paranoia, suspicious stuff going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I have to say, a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing that I'm concerned about and worth, call you for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, okay.  Any, any, how does it come about?  What, what is it that you're thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, little bit of ideas, uh, reference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At work, at home, where is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I listen to the radio, watching TV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.  Reading the paper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Conversations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, now, do you talk to [NAME OTHER] about that stuff too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not prominent.  It's not something that I'm concerned about, right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  It might help you, though, ground that reality when it flares up or gets worse.  To understand the differences when a symptom from your illness, versus what's real and what's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What might help?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Talk to her about it now, while you are feeling better, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Talking about my experiences I have had.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where I wasn't feeling good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it might not be the most comfortable thing to review or talk to her about, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm fascinated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think it will be important.  I think she'll find it interesting, but also I think it will ground you when things, you know, if, if they flare up again, that you'll have a reference to be able to talk to her or me about, to tell the difference between reality versus your illness, delusional thingy, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a fine line some times for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, I am such a spiritual person -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I believe -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In a lot of things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the difference between my beliefs and delusion is a gray area for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, it is for a lot of people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is for a lot of people, so, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel like I'm on stage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  All the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, right now.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, you're not on stage and that's for sure.  Now [DATE], um, [COUGHING], your medications, you get them through a mail in service?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are they pretty good about getting, you know, getting it to you in a timely manner and all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because your insurance changed for the year, but the, the, that part stayed the same, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Caremark?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Okay.  Do we, do we need refills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I still have a lot of 300 Seroquel.  And I know, last time I was in here you mentioned I might, one day, decrease to 600, I'd be able to use them.  But I'm at 800 now and I'm having a gray, fine line -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Between -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Reality.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we certainly don't want to be going down, um, but it's, usually when you take your Geodon, do you take that with some food?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  How much of it do I have to eat?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just a little bit.  In the hospital when we dispense it, we use, you know, we give them, like, some crackers or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not, you don't need a whole meal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But how big of a snack, sometimes I just have 1 cracker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, well, that's fine, fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or take it when you're eating regular, you know, well you take this all at night, to, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like to take it all at once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, you know, especially if you're trying to lose weight, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need to make a better effort.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you don't need an extra meal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little bit of food is good enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're still taking, uh, birth control pills with this, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, I don't think, um, we should be making changes to your medicines, you know, at this point.  What do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you think eventually, that you could decrease the Seroquel?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think eventually, but I don't think it would be a good idea at this point, you know.  Um, let's just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When will you know when you could decrease it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, in the past, when we, when we've, uh, decreased that particular medicine, we've run into problems I think, with your mood cycling and the stuff flaring up, you know.  I mean, you look so much better than you did, you know, a month ago or whatever when all this -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's like I'm in long cycles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like I cycle, maybe, every six months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know I feel pretty good for several months at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the, I mean, the new, with the new, you know the difference, hopefully, moving forward, is, this Geodon is new to your regimen and, maybe, will be the key to preventing your mood from cycling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What is Geodon all about, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is similar to Seroquel, it's an atypical antipsychotic, okay?  So, it can treat some of those ideas of reference.  It can treat depression.  It can treat anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't feel any anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's great.  It's a great -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Depression, a little bit, though.  I mean, I, sometimes go to bed at night and think, I don't want to wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, it is, you're right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I feel like, I'm [AGE], my life is over.  And I know it's a ridiculous statement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Logically, I know that.  But sometimes, I don't feel it now, so I can't really tell you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But sometimes I really feel that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [COUGHING].  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my coworker, her daughter's [AGE] and she has severe bipolar disorder and she's pregnant.  And they took her off all her meds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's not doing very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, hopefully she'll get some help and get back on her meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, the reason I mention it is because I'm [AGE] and I don't know if I want to have children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have lots of patients who get pregnant, and take some, through their entire pregnancy and do just fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  There's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But doesn't 10% of it go to the baby?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's plenty of data out there that support the fact that if you're unmedicated, unhealthy, manic depressed, mood swings, that's not healthy for the baby, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well why would they say that then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, um, it would be nice to see if you can't go through at least the first trimester of the pregnancy without any medicine on board.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Without.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it doesn't always work out that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But if you don't do well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then you get back on it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, how's that work, do you gradually release, reduce the doses -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, you know, you have a daughter.  You, I don't think -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Need to be thinking about having more children, at this point.  I think it's risky business.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I wouldn't unless I was married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm thinking in the long term.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The long term what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, if [NAME OTHER] and I were to get married, could we have children?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could.  I mean, I don't think it's a good idea, because, uh, I think you're running into a lot of risks of your mood cycling and being back in the hospital, but I also would support you if that was your decision, to help you through it, you know.  I mean, it's, it's a fragile mood disorder that you have, um, but, uh, you know, I don't think anybody can say that you can't have a baby.  I've heard it said.  I've had other patients come to me, that their doctors have told them that.  I've just never been one to believe that's a, a, a fair thing to do.  Um, you know, you had bipolar when you had your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was depressed for three years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Untreated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But I think you need to be careful, if you do conceive, you know.  There are risks with these medicines that, you know, you have to think about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's what I mean, like, I know this is long term, but if we talked about it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In advance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that would be smart, you know.  And have [NAME OTHER] come in too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean this is long term.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We aren't even engaged.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  And you're still on your pills, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, I wouldn't even consider it unless we were married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.  Well, look, I think you've got a happy, uh, situation here.  You got a daughter who's healthy, you know, uh, have some discussions with [NAME OTHER], whatever, I don't know if you need to be having children or not.  But if you choose to, I'll work out, you know, I'll go over the pros and cons of all these meds, being on them, being off them.  All right?  Sounds, just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something to talk to [NAME OTHER] about.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you know.  So yes, there's a possibility we can make some changes with your Seroquel, but let's not do it yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you can foresee, maybe, going down to 600?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I've got all these 300s I can't use.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can I split them?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is there a way to do the math?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but I, I will be getting some samples of, of Seroquel, um, in the extended release form.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See, what's the difference in that?  Because I, I sometimes I've taken the extended release -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I wonder if there's any connection to the days you feel hung over and the days you take extended release?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, see the extended release, I think are gone, or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that's a possibility that you might find on the days you take the XR, you wake up feeling like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've, all the ones I'm taking right now are the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But at one point, you gave me samples of extended release -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I, I don't think I noticed a difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably not, but I'd be curious to pay attention to that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean should I be taking extended release?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's the same medicine, it's just the delivery system, it releases at a, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't think I am.  I mean it is something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, normally -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should be doing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.  But sometimes I get samples of it, but given the fact that you have this unknown pre, pattern, you know, this unclear pattern of feeling hung over like that, I think we should just stick with the current regular Seroquel, which is what you're on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What are the samples that you gave me, I'll have to read them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, if it's like, they could have been, if they're extended release it's the XR, but let's try to stay away from that for now.  Eliminate that variable, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How much did I say I weighed 180?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, 180, 184.8.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so, um, let's see how things go.  We'll regroup, um, you know, next month, keep working with [NAME OTHER], okay?  Try to get to work every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm making up hours that I missed.  I feel like I'mgoing to go over 200 pounds at the rate I'm going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, you need to continue to, uh, working on your walking with your mom and all those good things and watching your diet, all right?  Okay?  So, it's a work in progress.  Anything is possible, all right?  But you look much better, lately, so keep it up.  Does that sound fair?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It looks like I'm six months pregnant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you got to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's all in the belly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got to work on that stuff with your mom, okay?</p>

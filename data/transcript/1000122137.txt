<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: October 12th, third consult meeting with Tim Collins, therapist Betty Johnson. Going back in, just gathering some more information regarding family history things that might (ph) occurred and to help me understand where you came from, problems (ph) all sorts of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Way back in the beginning.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I guess the, the, the one thing that came to me, we were talking ackewort (ph) was when you talked about the diabetes and how it's impacted your life. I'm wondering what life was like for you before the kidney disease, before the injury. How is life different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My, prior to that (ph) I didn't have a real good relationship with my spouse. Now, I can't say that it was the worst relationship, but it wasn't the best it would have been. [0:01:02.6] But we were very active in the church. I was Sunday school teacher and Youth Director and Treasurer all at different times and she was the secretary for the church, so we got along and we were always doing something apart, together. The people that I worked with, I was in the Coast Guard and I was a mechanic on an aircraft, went in and did my job and we got along, we did the best that we could. We traveled together, wife, wife and the kids weren't going with me all the time and I wasn't in a, I didn't have any alcohol abuse during that time and stuff, and it was all after the divorce and my traveling for Ford and the people that I traveled with would stop and party and. [0:02:09.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's when the alcohol and drinks began (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How, how did that im-, impact you? Your home life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, basically it hasn't because when we got married I stopped traveling, I started working for a different company and basically I stopped drinking. We get together once a year for remembrance of a. of a friend, but other than that, I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What about then? When, when you were married and, and for, (ph) forgive me, I can't remember your ex-wife's name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Janice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Janice. Okay. And your current wife's name is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kathleen. [0:03:01.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Janice. Okay. So, while you, oh that's right, you said that (ph) when you were with Janice, you didn't have any issues with alcohol -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: it wasn't until after the divorce and then working with Ford, working with this driven you (ph) working and traveling with that it was an issue. Okay. What about the anger? Was, how did that look? [When your is, how your life with Kathleen?] (ph at 0:03:31.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought I had it pretty much under control and stuff. I didn't really have any problems with that. That didn't start, that started when I started working for Jeep, which was about 2001 and we got married in 2002, but I don't think the anger was an issue at that point either. I think it was 2003 when I got hurt. I started getting real frustrated, so. I went to see a chiropractor last night. I was walking around in Foodlion and my back went numb and I got a burning sensation and stuff. I said I'm going to do something, I can't tolerate this, so I went to see him last night and he did some adjustments and stuff and I feel better today. [0:04:35.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A couple days ago, it seems like her and I really don't know how to communicate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Kathleen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't have a real good remembrance of a lot of things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like the doctor that prescribed the medication for me, I can't recall her name, but I can remember a lot of other people's names and stuff. And I don't know why it is. She mentioned yesterday that she gave her Foodlion card to her son to buy gas. I was with her, but I don't recall it. I didn't physically see her give the card to him and, and so she started arguing with me. That was last night. [0:05:36.4] A couple days ago we got into a similar situation where she started yelling at me, I started yelling at her. She said some things and if I feel like I'm antagonized, if I got my back up against the wall I'm going to say something that I don't want to say and it seems like I say I'm sorry a lot and I keep thinking that brat's (ph) the little boy throw the nails in, his dad had him pull them out and, but once you say something you can't take away the hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And so if, if you're saying that in your current situation with Kathleen, were there glimpses of that in your previous marriage?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not, not until she said I, I want a divorce, I don't love you anymore. And then I just, I just turned right against her. [0:06:36.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you kind of remember what made you turn against her or what came up for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just the, the hurt. I felt like I was betrayed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Must have been (inaudible) (crosstalk) right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: After being married for 20 years, and Kathleen was married for 25 years when she had the first, so we're both similar situations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. How much of that do you all think you carry into your marriage to each other? Because I'm, I'm not sure, how, how did what caused Kathleen's marriage to end?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Her husband had a, I don't know what they'd call that, but basically he lost his peripheral vision, he lost his job, and he says I'm not a good husband for you. I can't stay married to you, you need to get out and take care of yourself. And so she did a similar betrayal. She didn't want to and they stayed together for seven years and finally she separated. [0:07:57.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And how did you all meet, you and Kathleen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We met on a television station.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, how did that work out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That worked out pretty well. [It was I junk] (ph) country and I called in and left a message and I was gone on a trip. I was in Iowa at the time when she had responded and so we set up a simple date at a restaurant in Tyson's and we met, it was close to the airport and I got back in and we talked for about four hours that night and we, oy, '96 to '98 it was just basically dating and stuff. In the fall of '00 I bought a house from a gentleman I worked with and we moved in together. And in 2002 we got married. [0:09:13.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you met her in what year again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: '98.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 1998, in a television station and you guys then went out and then in 2000 you bought a house and moved in together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We moved together, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in 2002 you end up marrying. Okay. Yeah, so you both have been, so the radio station was kind of like a personals? Like, like they have personal ads and things like that, does it seem like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And you got divorced in what year?</p>

<p>PATIENT: '94.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, what was life like for you between '94 and '98 before you met Kathleen and the time when you got divorced? [0:10:11.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, one big party.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From, I had a buddy in the service that we'd get together with. He had a motorcycle and in 1991 he bought another motorcycle and so we worked together on that in kind of a project. I spent a lot of time with him, working on the motorcycle and stuff. We'd go out and get on the metro beach and just go out riding, set in the roads and stuff. Sometimes we'd go to the bar on Friday night and close the bars, sleep on the bike and cruise back the next day. In '94 when I got divorced, it seemed like I was doing a lot more then of that. [0:11:12.4] And I just seemed to go out and think we're having fun, having a good time and stuff. There was a band, guys I worked with, followed them around. Got involved with a few people and we just traveled together, partied, and had fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you dating during that time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. It wasn't until 199-, end of '93, there was a gal at the parachute shop on the base that always did the alterations on my uniforms and stuff. She had invited me to a birthday party, they called it a Leo party and there was a bar in Sheffield she invited me out, so we went out together and wholert (ph at 0:12:15.6). I don't know if you'd call it, I guess casual dating a few times. We went to the VFW club a couple times, went to the New Year's party, went to a Christmas party, went to a wedding together. And she got married in 1998.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Were you guys still casually dating before she got married or  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: how long did you - okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, that, we went to a Dating Circle together a couple times and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Dating Circle? What is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is a, kind of a social gathering personal place where, it's people that have kids but they don't have a spouse or they want to get together try to meet with people. [0:13:14.9] We did some line dancing, we did some other things, but the one time that I didn't go she met this guy and, and he was really intent. They started dating, af-, it was a casual friendship after that. I'd go over to the house to see her son. I'd take little things over to him, he had a Big Brother that, that started and so I was kind of trying to back myself off that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So how, how did you experience that Tim when you found out the day that you didn't go, she met this other guy, you had been involved and in now her life, with her children's life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had never looked at that as being a serious relationship. That was more just, just a friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But you made up your mind that you had to back off?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From her and her children's lives? [0:14:15.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she was, she was actually dating another gentleman that I worked with at the base and she was having some different problems trying to understand her relationship and stuff. And so we talked quite a bit. It was, it was purely just a friendship relationship. There, there was real no intimacy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What does intimacy look like to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [silence]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When, when you get in, you, you take a hand in (ph) when, when you say intimacy, what comes to mind? What is your understanding?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right now, nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Ideally. What I mean is just like what, what I may mean by that can you say anything? [0:15:16.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, very, just a simple kiss on the lips, that's intimacy. It can be a start, very personal sexual encounter. That's a very personal moment. And I just, I just don't, ever since I've been hurting. It's, it's just not the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay, and so before getting hurt, you were able to experience more intimacy than your, you're experiencing now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What's the difference when you look at before you were hurt and, and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there's a lot of difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, what, what year did you get hurt, and, and, and I know I have that information, just I have it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 2004. [0:16:16.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 2003, okay. So, 2003 when you get hurt, you, you (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: 2003 I got the kidney disease. I, I hurt my back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what did intimacy look like for you before 2003, let's say in comparison to now (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before 2003 we had a very, Kathleen and I had a very close relationship. We had our regular sexual times and stuff and, yeah, we were, we spent time kissing and hugging and talking and doing a lot of that, but afterwards, not, it seemed like just, I was like somebody turned around. [0:17:13.6] I talked with a doctor about it and he checked my testosterone level, it's, it's extremely low, but I also had kidney stones. I've got a, an enlarged prostate they called it, they call it BPH, and they give me medication for that but I, I just don't have that same, that same sense anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about Kathleen? Does she try, I mean I know she imaged (ph) on her disabilities and those sorts of things. Does she try and it's not a turn on to you or, or both of you had the same?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, right now it's, it's pretty much similar to her because she's in so much pain all the time. [0:18:15.7] We're both, we've both been hurt, we're both disabled. She was mugged and so she's got post-traumatic stress disorder and I kind of wonder if mine's similar situation, PTSD, and we both have the desire to, but it's just not the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you tell that you have the desire to? That you both have a desire to? And, and the desire to want to (ph) (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she, she tries to get close to me and tries to get me excited and try to get me to participate and stuff and, I can for a little bit but then it's just, it gets to the point I'm thinking about the pain and I just, I just can't finish what we started. [0:19:22.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How much of that do you think is consit-, I mean when we talked earlier about trying to figure out what's going on, was rocky (ph) (inaudible) when you think about the depression, you think about the anger, you think about not feeling yourself like last week you were saying not feeling as though you had a purpose and you can't do the things you used to do, your responsibility. In all those things, how much of not being able to have sex with your wife and achieve that, attributes to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh man. I know it attributes to it. Both of our pains attribute to it. I'd probably put that in a category of maybe 35-45-50 percent. But when we both start picking at each other, that's a big problem in our (ph) relationship. [0:20:34.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely. And does that interfere with intimacy? Like outside of the pain and physical issues, do you think that the picking with each other, the arguing can chip away at the desire to be intimate with one another or  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and fear of that? (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So, ideally, is that something that during this process you would want to work on or try and figure out how to get that intimacy back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd like to. It seems like I, I want to say it's kind of a mild rollercoaster ride.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, tell me more about that. [0:21:24.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's, there's some highs and some lows, I guess it goes to maybe falls in the category of manic depressants? Like they have their extreme highs or extreme lows. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When, when is your, when are your highs and when are your lows? Have you noticed a pattern?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really, I didn't really notice any particular pattern.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a given month, do you experience both highs and lows? I mean, when you look back and (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now the month of August we had gotten back from our trip to Idaho. [0:22:17.7] We went out West, we went to, then down to Alabama and she has some property down there, mineral rights and we investigated some of her heritage down there from her relatives and the trip was kind of a rollercoaster ride in itself. It was some good times and some, some bad times I guess put them [in there] (ph), but overall we had a pretty good time. Driving down, driving back, that really didn't seem to be a problem. In California, we were, we went out to see Bob Barker and the Let's Make a Deal show and we got to a point where we just couldn't tolerate with where we were going, so we turned around and come back and she got caught up on the Hollywood Boulevard traffic and, and six lanes of traffic all bumper-to-bumper for, for about three hours and so we're, our frustration started. Now it's hard to deal with - [0:23:33.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At each other, it went, it went from being on a six-lane highway traffic on either side and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, with each other -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Directed to each other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, I'm, I started to say things like, "Man, this is crazy" and seeing motorcycles going up and down, weaving in and out of that traffic, I guess it's legal to do that out there, and we both started get, getting upset with where we were at.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, at what point does it go from being, well that's something I think as I'm hearing you talk about how you and Kathleen relate to each other, it's like it's, these outside things you guys are frustrated with and then, or things about yourself that you're frustrated with. At what point, or how does it turn toward each other? [0:24:21.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I honestly, it, it's just, I can describe some days as being good days and some days as being bad days and I think it has a lot to do with the pain. She's in pretty much constant pain, she has Rheumatoid arthritis and my pain, now depending on when I wake up, I'm not always, I'm not always the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what sense? And in what sense are you not always the same?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I just don't have the same pain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So on some days it's tolerable, other days - [0:25:14.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Other days it's not. I take the same medications day after day, I don't change anything. But some days I feel good, I feel energetic, I feel like doing things and other days I just want to be left alone. I get tired, I go to bed and she'll say, "Is that what you're going to do, is you're going to sleep all day?" and get in arguments that always comes up and that's what we throw at each other. She spends a lot of time sleeping and one time I said, "Well you're good at that, you might as well go do it" and, and so we kind of attack each other from time to time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, and, and that's something that's obviously uncomfortable to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it sounds like you want to maybe work on ways where that will decrease because ideally if you could look at your marriage, which you guys have been married for three years now. What, where, where do you see your marriage headed? [0:26:22.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you this, where would you like to see your marriage headed? Ideally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like for the two of us to be happy and to move to a climate where we can be more comfortable. We've talked about going to college, learning some French, doing something to get to change now what we've been doing. Trying new things and try to, we like helping people, but physically we're not able to at this time, but there are some small things that we can do from time to time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what? What (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, just putting some time in a soup kitchen or  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You guys do that kind of stuff now? You volunteer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At some point you did that kind of stuff or is that what you want to work (inaudible) - [0:27:23.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something that we'd like to work towards. I have taken food baskets and stuff to people and it's pretty exciting thing to see the, the smile on people's faces to know that you've actually helped someone. And we have done some things with the church now, we've taken Christmas gifts for some needy children, we've taken in coats and we used to send our clothes over to the Veteran's Center in Chicago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you're very outgoing, an altruistic person. You're very altruistic, you like to help people  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and contribute and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Did you do those types of things when you were married before or in that time of your life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) [0:28:20.6]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was nothing to leave a bag of groceries at somebody's car. And like Christmas time I used to, I used to hand out Christmas cards anonymously and give gifts and stuff that people just didn't realize.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you (inaudible). Well, let me ask you this Tim, what you do see as some of your strengths? Your positive coancture (ph), things you're good at, what makes you a good person, you know your strengths. Because you've talked to me a lot about your limitations - things that interfere with your being productive or being happier in your relationships, right? What are some of your strengths, other than being altruistic and helpful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm a very caring individual. [0:29:19.3] And I have some good communication skills. With our grandkids, I, I'm learning to be more patient and try to do things with them and to become more involved. You know to be a grandparent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how often do you, do you spend time with your grandchildren?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Lately it's, it's been just the weekends, but  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And these are Kathleen's, this is Gary's children? [0:30:15.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Mike is ten; Geanie is five, four, but she goes to preschool now. And so we don't see her as often, but we used to go over and pick her up and take her to the library and going shopping, go garage saleing (sp?) and she used to enjoy doing things with Nana and Papa and, and she still does. If we go over to the house, she runs to the door to greet us and Mike comes right up to us. If we're at home and they come over, they, the kids are the first ones through the doors. </p>

<p>[Audio interrupted at 0:30:53.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the one follow-up question I have to ask is one, I wanted to ask that I didn't ask last time it came up is when we talk about your biological children that you have with Janice. You mentioned before that you don't have a whole lot of contact with them and I'm wondering what did, what was parenting like when you were married for those 20 years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, we were, the, the kids and I were pretty close. I, I cooked a lot of the meals and stuff and played with the kids quite a bit, games and stuff and different activities and things and it wasn't, wasn't bad, but it, it seemed at the point in time where we got divorced it, the wife had just turned the kids against me. [0:32:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you and Janice? (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she was very critical and said that I was a bad person, did a lot (inaudible) around and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what kinds of things was she saying about you? Like what would give her the impression that you're a bad person and I don't want you to be around the kids?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I don't know exactly why or anything, but at the time she started some comments about sexual abuse of her children and it went to trial. It went to trial with both daughters. The youngest daughter went to a children's home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, (inaudible) I don't know what happened to my pen. Let me get another pen (inaudible). Okay, so this went to trial when? [0:33:08.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went to trial in 1995 was the first one and the second one went to trial in '96.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this was [against at] (ph) your oldest daughters or the allegations were against the, you? Do you have, how many daughters do you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two, okay. Okay. And these came up after the divorce or during the time you all were  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they come up during the, during the separation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: During the separation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I separated from her in '90. [0:34:07.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And how did the allegations come up? What was said, like how did you go to trial or how did (inaudible) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I don't know how it came up because I was not living at the house. I was in, I lived on base for three months and then I moved, got my own apartment in about September of '95, '90, '91. We separated May of '90. [0:35:02.3 ] May was when I came home, I was down in Texas, I was at the missile range with the aircraft and stuff - it was, it was job related and when I walked in the door, she says, "I don't love you." Plain and simple.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was she saying those bad things about you during that time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, that had never -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Come up? And they didn't come up until when, like when were you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I received a Summons in '92.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And had you had, what type of contact had you had with her or the kids prior to receiving the Summons?</p>

<p>PATIENT: None.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: None? Any reason no contact with them? [0:36:07.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went over to the house one time, got some of my stuff and she says that she don't want me around, she don't want me coming over. We started arguing, I got upset, I took a 2x4, we, we had a car together that was out in the driveway and it had already been wrecked and the engine had seized up in it and stuff, but she says that my car, you get your crap out of it and so I took everything, put it in the car and got out and she started saying something again and I got mad to the point where I picked up a 2x4, it was just laying there and I started beating the car with it. And then I got, the, the landlord come out, she says what's going on. I said I'm just upset. I'm upset with this whole situation. And she says, "Well the Sheriff is on the way" and I says, "Okay, I'm leaving" and I got in my car and left. [0:37:21.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And from that point on, I didn't have any contact.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so in 1992 you received a Summons.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In '92 I received a Summons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what were the allegations?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The allegations were actual first degree  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: First degree?</p>

<p>PATIENT: criminal sexual conduct. Now Janice had a friend that became a paralegal and started working at the prosecutor's office in North County with Dave Shepard and it wasn't until after the divorce and stuff and she got to be very close with her. [0:38:29.8] I, I found out afterwards and I just wonder if, because the attorney that was appointed to my cases said that divorce cases can get real nasty as far as child custody and stuff, everybody want to keep the kids away from individuals they start allegations against one another. And I just didn't believe anything like that could happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whatever became of the trial? What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not guilty. Both counts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the trial lasted until, you said I think (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had one trial in, I want to say 1992, the Fall of '92. [0:39:26.0] September of '92 I went to State Police and, you know just all the legal stuff, turned myself in, got the pictures taken and was released on my own personal recognizance at the arraignment. I was never arrested. I was never held in custody and as long as I cooperated with them, they did their investigating and stuff and there really wasn't, there were some comments made by different people saying that we had a close relationship, but nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That who had a close relationship?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They, they talked about how we hugged a lot and we were, were close.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who? You and your daughters; you and your wife? [0:40:26.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The whole family. You know I hugged the kids at night, and hugged them in the morning when we got up, they went to school and stuff. And on the weekends we went to church, you know you hug one another at times, you're very, I don't know, you're very caring about people. You're happy to see them. You get like a, like a bond with people you're close to most of the time. I have a bond with the people that I work with. I know that in any given situation if we were involved somewhere that we would've given our lives for one another. And we do that in our own personal relationship. We would do anything to protect our wives, protect our husbands, protect our children and. [0:41:19.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that would make sense. You care for the ones that you love and you protect them and it comes through in your erections and [folks will perceive that] (ph). Unfortunately we have to stop now, but I do appreciate your sharing so much with me, talk about this (inaudible) information gathering peak (ph) so I'm just trying to understand what life was like for you before coming here to help us put together some pieces and understand what issues and (inaudible) so definitely have a lot of information here. Would you want to set up meet next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can we try two weeks? See how it is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the reason for wanting to do two weeks? [0:42:12.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't have any other appointments next week and I'm thinking about going on a trip. Is your phone number on the card? Let's go ahead and set up an appointment. I will call ahead of time if we're going to leave, I will cancel and make the appointment for the following week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that would make it a little more definitely. Be great. But I think you know Tim, you shared a lot, it seems like you really want some help by working on your anger and I want to see you happy. You talk about trying to, this ideal life that you want to see with Kathleen and, and how to deal with life, despite the diabetes, despite the back pains, and trying to help you with that. [0:43:14.6 ] So I think it's awesome that you want to work towards those goals and I definitely want to assist you. You do have great communication skills and that helps out a lot when you're working with someone. Because a lot of folks come in and they don't know what the problem is, they don't know how to identify it, don't know how to communicate it, but it seems like you are in touch with some things and that's a great place to start. And any outlet that you have, you talk about how things are so frustrated for you and things that your wife is frustrated sometimes talking about frustrations with one another doesn't always go the way that you like and so this is a place that, empty, that I'll definitely be a container for that for you to be able to just talk about that frustration because I'm sure it can be difficult to carry that around. [0:44:09.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. It is. I think both of us are kind of like a tissue box. You pull them out one at a time, and then as you get hurt, you pack them back in the box and all of a sudden you get to a point where you can't any more. The box just kind of explodes. Yesterday was a wonderful day, and today it, it's been off to a great start.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I feel better. After seeing the chiropractor last night and then after coming in here, you know this, this is our third time  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sure is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: and I think it helps. Talk about it, get some of it out rather than keep it all inside. [0:45:08.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely. And so I definitely want to see you for a fourth time. If you, I think it's important now that we have some things out in the open now we can build toward actually doing some work on those things. Okay, so, let me give you (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now is this mine?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's yours. Yep, you can have that. [Background noise] (inaudible) next Thursday I have, one, four. Next Thursday I don't have the 12 o'clock open because I have a transport that I have to do so I'm thinking about we could do it that morning Thursday? And if you like to keep it on Thursday or we can look at another day, do I really (ph) -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's look at Thursday morning. What do you have? [0:46:30.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. We can do it at, at 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 10:30 (ph), 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine. I don't like to do it in the afternoons because I get tied up in that US 95 traffic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. No one likes to be in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I drove from Champaign to Chester and Dundee. You know all the way across the country. Dundee and, all I, all I know is that the old Woolworth's building in the, in Chicago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) [Laughs] Let me ask you this, would Wednesday, would next Wednesday at my 12 o'clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: 10 o'clock's fine. If 10 o'clock works for you, that, that's the time I'd like to have. [0:47:23.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, that sounds, the way it's going [to be then] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was assigned to a work project in a Jeep and they were being built at that facility. I spent three months driving back and forth on the South Grand Avenue and here all the over towards the West Industrial Parkway and go down to Dundee.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Same with me (ph) with all that, that whole area being  - </p>

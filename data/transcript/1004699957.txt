<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p> CLIENT: (inaudible) hands.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So are you feeling any better?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that about? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you called in sick last time. I wanted to make sure you were ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. I—I appreciate your asking, thank you. It's just you—it's pretty sarcastic. (laughs) I had –</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you're projecting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I did see the psychiatrist on Friday. And she's upped the Lamictal, upped the Prozac. I'm now taking Nortriptyline every other day, and taking a Klonopin in its place. She had stopped me from taking the Klonopin at night, so I wouldn't be too tired, because I was waking up very tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not waking—you know, sleeping until –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like 10:00 –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok. [00:01:36].8</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and whatever, so I'll be glad to be off the Nortriptyline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't had a lot of, you know, dizziness or whatever, but I was playing Tuesday night and I got light-headed and –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I don't know if it was just because I had (coughs) biked forty minutes in the rain and then ran around for while or—or what, but I'm getting a little tired of that happening. So that will be good when that's—the question I have is I don't know if I'm should still need—if I still need to be on high blood pressure medication, if I go off of the—because I was like borderline high blood pressure, but nothing that they wanted to medicate me before, until I went on the Nortriptyline. So, I don't know. I imagine the doctor's going to want to keep me on that, because that's what they do. (pause) It's been something I'd—wanting to—the thing I miss most about you being ill is I had something that I just had to tell somebody that really—there's no one to tell that would kind of appreciate it or really that I could even tell. But—um –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I'm just about (inaudible). 003:10.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all right. People get sick. I don't, but people apparently do. Only when it's convenient, I say, "Oh, I don't feel good." But—um—we were at the after at practice and I was sitting next to Barbara and across from me is this lady, who goes to the games. So we were talking about the games or whatever, and Barbara says to me—she's like—she's a fan. She's like, "Do you have season tickets?" I'm like, "Yep." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And for a moment I was going to be like, "Do you want to go to a game?" But then I—I withheld any urge to do that. So I thought it was kind of funny. It'd be even more awkward if she called me up and said, "Yeah, I'd like to go on a date with you." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Me or my Patriots tickets? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't know. So life hasn't been completely horrible. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. [00:04:24].3</p>

<p>CLIENT: I seem to kind of go back and forth now between good moments, bad moments. I don't know if my dad sending me money—my parents sending me money is what's helping that, or I don't know. But that should catch me up on my rent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though I just got a notice of cancellation of my auto insurance unless I pay $1,145. So that's one month's rent I'm still going to be behind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the attorney I was doing titles for sent me like 700 bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I actually used some of that to pay towards my website, which I haven't paid in a while. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—um—you know, just some work-related expenses and fantasy football leagues and stuff like that, so—but I played last night and I had a good game –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which was nice. It was the hat league, so it was the first time I've played with these people. And I just played well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I only had one beer. I drink less at this pub, because I drink Guinness. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So when I go out with the team like at night, I get like the high alcohol beers, and you know—I had like three of those and—on my way. But this pub most like—most people order an Amber in a pitcher, which is just crappy beer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's cheap, that's why they order it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:06:23].5</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't—I'm not a big fan. So did you have a cold? Stomach flu?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had like a cold, fluey (inaudible). I'm a lot better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Lucille's been driving me crazy, because Jess says that she's says my name all the time. And—um—but like Sunday I was dropping Ian—Ian stayed over Saturday night. And I was dropping him off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really didn't want to hang out because I wanted to be—get to the game—watch the game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she just wouldn't even, you know—I looked at her, she went and grabbed her mom, you know? She was just—you know, but she had just—she had just woken up from a nap, but still it was like she just wouldn't even, you know—and then I went back after the game, and she was fine with me. She came and she sat down next to me and, you know, she wanted to play with me, and so—typical woman, I guess. I don't know if your daughters are like that. Can't make up their minds. So—but I'm picking her up from daycare tomorrow, which will be a little embarrassing because she's just going to cry. She's going to rather stay at daycare with her friends than go with me –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know? And Jess has been leaving the car seat turned backwards because she cries if she turns it forwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just like, "Just fucking turn it forward." You know, these are the types of things that drove me crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like you're—you're letting the baby dictate –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, to you—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just awkward in my car to have it facing backwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:08:34].4</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I was going to try and maybe place it forwards. I don't know if—if she—I assume that she's big enough that you can do that now. I don't know what the—the rules are. You don't know what the rules are, do you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I thought it was like a year you turned it around, but –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —for the—a vague recollection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to turn it around. If she cries, she cries, you know? So I don't know. (pause) I'm just really—it's like smashed into the seat, there's like no room for her feet or anything like that, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Jess says, "Oh, place a towel underneath it." But I have two towels.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can't really afford—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I gotta go buy a—a blanket because it's getting cold. The dog shredded my comforter. I'm without blanket. So I've already spent all the money that my parents have sent me. (pause) There's a concert coming—a couple of—not—maybe two, three Fridays from now that I don't know anybody wants to go to, so I'm just going to go by myself. I'll probably have more fun. (pause) Jess would have gone to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would have—we would have probably get a—a babysitter, but –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Who's playing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The [inaudible] Band. Their big claim to fame--they were kind of a ladies punk band in the '90s. And she's got a band, she's got a couple of albums out with them now, so—they're playing—I'm like, you know, I can walk there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:11:02].2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because why—you could sit at home or have Ian sleep over—you know, I can have Ian sleep over Saturday night. Just go walk over. Have a couple of drinks, get in a fight. I won't get in a fight. Pick up women. That's my strong suit. (pause) I've got a couple of new clients.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing—one's like a small claims case, and one's in the estate plan—small estate plan. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (coughs) I still haven't been paid by Jess's friend –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —who was –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were they trying to evict that one, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she—I had actually mailed the court for an execution, and she went in and got a stay of execution, and it's—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I told them, I go, "She's—you know, she's an elderly person. They were going to give her all the time she wants." You know? You can get up to a year, but she's not paying rent, so they won't give her a year, but they'll give her some time. So they gave her 30 days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:12:35].3</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and I was kind of shocked because usually the landlord is in on that hearing, but she just went to the court and got a stay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But in her paper she said she just needs time for them to fix up her new place and then she'll move out, you know? She's just asking for 30 days just to be safe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So hopefully she moves out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't have to do anything. And then at the beginning of October, I can send a statement saying, "Hey, you know, pay your $300 bill." I'm not even charging for all the shit that's happened this last week or so, because I'm a nice guy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unfortunately. (pause) My—audit got moved from Mon—it's supposed to be Monday. It got moved to October.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to go to the office on Saturday and get everything ready—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and of course, I didn't, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you find out about moving the—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She called me on Friday. She's like, "Are you ready for the audit?" And I said, "Yeah." The—she—theoretically, she would know that I didn't do all the title policies—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but maybe I'll start keeping—getting those done tomorrow, or Thursday. I've just got—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —I'm not going into the office today, but—I've got an early game. It kind of sucks that my games have always—so far have been Monday and Tuesday. And it looks like they're going to be that way. The other choice would have been Tuesday or Wednesday, but usually they give us like Wednesday or Thursday club games, and they haven't. They've been Tuesday. I rode my bike—been riding my bike. I don't know if that's—um—being unsafe or not. What's the question they always ask you? "Are you—are you taking more risks or –" there's some—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh –</p>

<p>CLIENT: —standard—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —depression or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's some standard question that they always seem to ask. [00:15:18].3</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think this is that. "Are you engaging in risky behaviors?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I'm riding my bike at night through bad neighborhoods. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is risky behavior. There's always collateral damage, so I've just been riding by—the wrong place at the wrong time. But I did ride in the pouring rain last Tuesday, so—but I really don't have a good—um—rain coat for the bike.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking that I probably could get one on sale this time of year, because everybody's putting away the bike material, moving towards the winter sports.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was nothing on L.L. Bean, but I did buy a yellow shirt, bike shirt, that was on sale. I had bought kind of like a windbreaker from L.L. Bean and I took an extra large off the rack and there was something wrong with it. So I put it back and grabbed the one right behind it, which turned out to be a lady's large—didn't fit me too well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I gave that to a friend. But just like a bright yellow rain jacket without spending 80 bucks for it. Oh, and that concert, the ticket's only $14.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With the service charge it's $18. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I probably could have bought it at the place and not paid the $4 or whatever, but, I don't know. I don't know when their box office is open. I guess I could have found that out. I was just being lazy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I lost two of my three Fantasy Football games just barely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of them, we have a tied score so—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it goes to who has the higher defensive score.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he has the higher defensive score, so I lose that game. And then I lost another—the team's league, 156 to 153.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you sound—uh—like life hasn't been completely horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I've had better days. And—I mean I –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I get it. [00:18:27].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: —my days—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your recent days have been better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been kind of busy, which is helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now like today, it's like I have some stuff to do, but it's like I really just want to go home and sleep. I was up—got home kind of late last night and—I had a late game, so I ended up taking a Red Bull—or drinking a Red Bull around like 8:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I didn't go to sleep until after 1:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. How much stuff do you—how much work do you have to do today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nothing that I have to do today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? But I've got two titles, one's due on Thursday and one's due on Friday. (coughs) And I should at least start and get a—get a sense for how difficult they're going to be. And I've got to go to the registry, I think, both of them. So I'm either going to do that today or tomorrow. Probably tomorrow. But at least do what I can online. And—um—if I—if I could get them done today, I could go in the office and be productive tomorrow, which, you know, there's some things that I need to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like super pressing, but I really should get it done, you know? There's just—for some reason, there's certain things I just can't do at home, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:20:02].6</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't have a good printer, even though I have three of them at home that have a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've got to do some kind of collection case. I've got to send in a—apply for a default judgment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've already got the default judgment. Now I've got to ask them to enter it. And the people are getting foreclosed on maybe tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. It's kind of like I'm not sure if I'll ever collect any money from them, but you know, you never know. That's the one part of all this that I—I have no experience in is collecting the money. But I've got a lawyer friend who I think I can—if not help me through it, just turn the case over to him, give him a piece of the action.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (coughs) I think I need to call him because I need to file a lawsuit for quiet title action, which I kind of feel like I should learn how to do it, but he's got an associate and he's in court a lot more, and—you know? He's more thorough than I am. Not thorough, but not as procrastinated—doesn't procrastinate as much as I do. He's really very helpful for litigation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder how come you procrastinate these days? [00:22:16].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: I always do. I always have, at least, as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you make of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, September is national procrastination month, but I'm not going to celebrate it until next month. (laughs) I don't know what to make of it. Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) You can get back to me on that one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we can talk about it Friday. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a—(coughs)—it's a symptom of my depression that I have no control over. Is that a good answer?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can that be true?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that could be true, but it doesn't really answer the question. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The question was why, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said it was a symptom of my depression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well –</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a psychologically chem—chemical imbalance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's unlikely. I mean, in other words—that's—it—it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: You had to look funny (ph), so... (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I guess maybe we're getting the answer. Maybe—maybe the way you're responding bears on the answer to the question. There's something where you don't like to work on things, or think about things. [00:24:10].6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh—I'm—I'm lazy. There was some—some doctor, I think –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Versec (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it could be—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Balzac. No, there's no (inaudible). Balzac. I forgot about him. (coughs) Jess's been posting on Facebook how she wants the big—wants to change her life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, she's tired of what she's doing. And then—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like career-wise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know she was looking for a job. Because she sent me a link—someone needed—needs an attorney to do closings, but they're all like in another county, and I'm just like, "I can't do that." And they wanted a resume, you know, and it's like they're going to hire some, you know, cheap, new kid out of law school –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —probably, but—I said, you know, someone would do that, surely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Apply? [00:25:28].6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For a hundred bucks a closing or whatever, you know? Just pick up the docs and get them signed. Easier than a title. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have a couple of closings in October. And I don't know—I hope—I've got two, hopefully, that close this month. I don't know. I don't know why I procrastinate. I always have. I always will. (pause) Sometimes I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can sympathize (ph). (pause) Um—I suspect it's partly a way of being like angry or aggressive towards the people around who are probably wishing, encouraging, or trying to get you to do whatever it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I suspect it's probably something like, you know, they don't see things your way or they're not really there for you, but they want you to do this. And so you're like, "Fuck you."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who are these people? [00:27:34].1</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, Jess, I guess, would be one of them. Maybe, although I'm a little unclear about this, like to some extent your parents. And, you know, a bit in here being (inaudible) –</p>

<p>CLIENT: You? Well, what I was going to say was that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I like the concept of having nothing to do. You know, it's like the pressure of nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then when it comes around to doing nothing, that stresses me out, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in advance, it seems like this (phone rings) dodging the pressure, not having—</p>

<p>CLIENT: My phone hasn't been working at work (ph)—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —at the office. [00:28:22].7</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in advance or in theory, the idea of just not doing anything or giving yourself a break sounds good, but when it actually—when you actually do, your time isn't that enjoyable. You're anxious or preoccupied or something like that. Is that kind of right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like today—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I know I'm—I'm just gonna—you know, probably just check those two titles out and I'm gonna—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I think I'll—I'll be ok with it, because I'm like, "Oh, I've got plenty of time tomorrow."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I get—I don't know if I have anything tomorrow evening or—tonight I have a board meeting and I'm blowing it off for a game, because we're playing my landlord's team. And I don't know, I go to all the board meetings, you know? I'm just—you know, I'm—I've got two finance committee meetings this month, you know, which I'm—I just—I'm gonna miss a game for one of them. So I might as well go to this game and blow off the board meeting. (phone noise) It's weird—um—my phone wasn't working, so they fixed it, unless you call the cell phone. If you call from a landline, you would—you would get through, but if you called from a cell phone, you would get this—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. That's weird. [00:29:57].2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's them probably either saying they still haven't figured it out or they fixed it. And even that hasn't really stressed me out, which is, you know—it's like I got—you know, my car—this is—I go—I drive out to my dentist. And—because that's Jess's dentist and I've been going to see him ever since I started going to the dentist again. And—um—so I drive out there, and while I was out there, I had my phone plugged in and the air conditioning on. And I go in and get my teeth cleaned, and actually very little scraping. I was kind of impressed, though she told me I wasn't using the electric toothbrush right, but easiest cleaning I've had in a long time. And—um—I go to my car and it will turn over once, like all the lights and everything comes on, but then it starts clicking, you know, the starters clicking—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so there's like not enough juice in the battery to start the car. So I'm like—that was a day that I felt like I had to get a lot of stuff done and I had to get a—um—pick up a file, disperse the file. The file was up north, and I just felt like there were things I had to do. And—um—some of which I procrastinated, just saying, "Oh, I'll do them Saturday when I go into the office." Ended up doing them yesterday. (laughs) But—um—I was worried that—um—you know, I needed a new battery or a new alternator, but I haven't plugged my phone in, and I really haven't used the air conditioning, but it hasn't come back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:31:55].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like—um—I've gone and started the car and turned it off and started it again, so it's like it's working now. And I know like if I were to not have the car on and I just turned the—the battery on and plugged my phone into the—the cigarette lighter, that that drains the battery really quickly. And I'm wondering—I do it all the time, but I'm wondering if that was just it, that I just had the AC going and the thing plugged—I don't know. But it kind of freaked me out a little bit that this—you know, it's like one more thing that might—I'm now carrying jumper cables in my car, but it's like, "When is this going to happen again, if it's going to happen again?" So—but I was kind of stressed out about that. That was a bad day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—um—(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't freaked out as I normally –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —might have been feeling –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know? So... [00:33:05].8</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was looking at the—you know, one minute we're talking about why you procrastinate and have a hard time doing things for work, and then, you know, you're talking about your car won't start, your battery seems to be overly drained and has too many strains on it. Um—(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've got to work on a whole week of stuff, you know? I don't remember everything, so... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) So –</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're—you're—you're taking that as a swipe against you, even though it's not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I was taking it as a swipe against what I said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're saying different. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it isn't. Maybe I misunderstood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I—I just meant to say, you know (coughs) –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stressful day the other day, although, to the good, you didn't sort of react as sort of intensely or badly as you might of—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —at another time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I don't know if—I mean, because I—at that point, I still hadn't gone up—I was on 25 milligrams of the Lamictal –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And then you moved up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I hadn't gone up. Now I'm up to 50.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:34:28].9</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's hard for me to think that it's the medications that's making the difference –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: –but I—I do feel—um –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't mean they're helping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —less angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um—I don't know. Why I was kind of swarmy (ph) about, you know, Barbara asking if I had season tickets, I don't know why it just made me feel good for some reason. Um—but it also—I think about, very often, getting rejected, and that bothers me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I was thinking—I wondered if that was nice because like—nice for you to have something she wants for—you know, like –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —doesn't need to (inaudible) (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking—I was hoping—she's like (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she probably heard me saying how I had extra tickets to games, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she, you know—I don't know. I still don't think she's bound simple (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:36:00].5</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm able to keep track of her through Words with Friends, so like—uh—10:30 on Saturday, she sent over a word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I know at 10:30 at night on Saturday she's playing, so –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —she may have had a date, but it didn't—you know –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —(laughs) progress anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had Ian sleep over and I didn't get mad at him or yell at him or –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —anything, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good. How did it go? I mean, clearly that went well—or it went well in that way, but—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he—um—he came over kind of—I was actually taking a nap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he—they came over—he came over like around 2:30 or 3:00. And the kids downstairs were leaving, so I had to entertain him, and we—um—we mostly just watched a little TV, went to—um—he played with the phone. You know, all the things he's not supposed to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Or his mom doesn't want him to do. We went to dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even though I know he had cake and cupcake at a birthday party, I still got him a cookie, because we always get a cookie. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why he likes going– because –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he got the cookie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —yeah, you know? And I didn't even offer him—I said, "Hey, buddy, let's –" because it was kind of early for dinner. I was like, you know, let—we did walk and just get a coffee. And I had offered him ice cream, but I was like, "No, you've already had cake and a cupcake."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:37:43].3</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we got to the coffee shop, and he's like, "They don't have ice cream here." I was like, "He he."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He forgets that it is –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —not too far away. (coughs) But Sunday, he played downstairs with the kids until like 12:30, and—um—um—I was going over to my friend's house to watch the game. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—um—they played well, which can, you know, account for a pleasant mood.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but normally I would be upset about my fantasy football, but it's like, "Ah, I just barely lost both. It's the first week." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just—I don't know. I don't know what's going on with me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you've gotten some money and there's a bit more going on at work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm almost over as president of E&G– </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which will be nice. Um—(coughs) I did have an old client e-mail me about doing a condo conversion. So that's good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:39:35].2</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to charge like 1,500 bucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Flat fee. Plus the sale of the unit would be additional.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's if they hired me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've had a lot of people ask me to do condo conversions, but no one's ever hired me, so—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To actually do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (coughs) But this one I think is—they've been wanting to do it. The last time I saw them on their estate planning stuff, they were talking about doing it, so they've been doing renovations and whatnot. The one problem that people run into is that they have the multi-family with one mortgage over the whole house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And unless you've taken out the mortgage with the idea that you're going to sell off the units –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —they don't let you take off part of the—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you've got to refinance, so –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —it's—I've done them before where you're ti—timing a purchase, you know—they're—they're timing selling one of their units around one of their—around their refi—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which makes it very difficult for your purchaser, because you're at the whim of the refinance –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which purchase, they're going to get through the system, because they know they've got a date, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —in a refinance, they don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. They don't think about (inaudible) –</p>

<p>CLIENT: That can take 60 days, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I wish I was getting more orders in for refis. That would make me feel a lot better. But—um—getting in that—what were you going to say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I need to stop in a minute, but I have some scheduling stuff. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But go ahead. What was the—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to say, yeah, it's getting to that time of year where things, you know, are getting slow—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I wish I could save some of this money and, you know—for when I don't have any. But...</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh I guess I'm [INAUDIBLE].  I'm on antibiotics now, I've got this sinus thing going on.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's in my ears, I don't know what that is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get allergies?  [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I started - I went to the doctor because I was getting aching in the ear and scratchiness in my throat and they put me on amoxicillin and I just don't think it's doin any good [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long you been on it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm almost done with it, probably at least a week now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, did he give you antihistamines or anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got nasal spray too and I went and bought um Mucinex.  He told me to get some Mucinex, I bought that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You still got headaches?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I still feel, you know, I feel some feeling in my eyes and I wasn't hearing that wind sound in my ears first either, but now I'm hearing shwhew, when I'm walking I'm hearing shwhew-whew - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're right, it's probably not working.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don't know what that is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, do you go back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I haven't been back.  It's just one of those doctor walk in clinics.  But I am - they been callin me on the phone so I don't go back.  I don't need to.  I'll feel worse than I already was feeling.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was a good choice but it's not working.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not working.  I always thought he gave me Augmentin instead of amoxicillin.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well there are some that are better at getting into sinuses and stuff like that, that's one of them, but - so I don't -  Augmentin's awful close.  They've got other ones, newer ones now.  It's beyond me [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 875 milligrams of amoxicillin - a pill - I take two a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, should be enough.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know why it's not - it could be too this weather, it's just flip flopping ya know from hot to cold, hot to cold.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, there's so much pollen in the air, it's awful.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I never had sinuses until I fell and hit my head in that accident when, I fell and hit my head.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said something about my [INAUDIBLE] motor nerves, something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Something that she saw on my CT scan which controls your sinuses, that's what she said I think, it controls your sinuses and I've been having sinus trouble ever since I fell and hit my head.  That's weird, but that's how it's been.  I never had sinus problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you are taking antihistamine pills?  You don't have them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like Zyrtec or something?  I have that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I'd take that every day, especially now, I do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh okay. Yeah I heard that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If I don't do it, when I wake up in the morning, man my head's so full.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I've got a couple of medicines for you here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Make sure I took the things off of them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm having something weird going on with me.  I'm having like anxiety when I'm driving on the highway only, not in regular traffic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like the interstate?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like when I'm on the interstate, all the sudden I'll panic like I can't control the wheel, but I don't know why, it just comes from out of nowhere and I'll literally get off when I have it.  It's happened to me about, since the last time I saw you, at least four times.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know where that's coming from.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You never had that before.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  It's scary because it's like I really panic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it when a truck comes around or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I just, I'll just be driving along and doing the regular speed limit, I won't be speeding or anything and all the sudden I'll just get a notion that I'm getting ready to wreck, I'm just getting ready to have an accident.  It's like I feel like my wheel is actually going to come out of my hand, but it's not, but in my mind it is and I don't know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you start that Cymbalta?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's the only thing new isn't it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I'm like phew - I got off there.  So I kinda - it don't happen when I'm just driving, you know, just around the street area.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, but - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] and then what I do is I just immediately get off because I, I really, it feels like a panic attack and - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I guess it is I mean - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, yeah, cause I feel like I'm getting ready to hit somebody or somebody is getting ready to hit me and just, nothing be going on, it just be, I'll just be driving along and all the sudden that feeling just hits me like, like, you know, you're gonna lose the wheel, the wheel's gonna come out of your hand or, you know, watch out for this car over here.  I don't know why or where this is coming from, but it's like a panic attack.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did the Cymbalta help you any with the pain or depression?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't even really say that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It didn't do anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't really say that it has.  I'm not feeling, probably, I don't know [PHYSICIAN NAME], I just, I'm so much in the house and I don't get out and I don't, I stay to myself.  It doesn't make me want to like jump up and run out of the house and do anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and that's what my son, my youngest son, momma why you in the house, you stayin' in here, you just don't do nothin', you don't go nowhere and the strange thing about it is I don't like even sitting out in my living room.  I stay in my bedroom.  And, I think - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that new?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've been doing that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Actually, I've been doing it. I like just being in my room.  I don't like sitting out in my living room and there's nobody in the house, but me, but I just, I don't know, I don't like really going nowhere if I don't have to go and I just kind of stay in my room and watch TV.  I don't like out in my living room and watching TV unless somebody come over but - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We can cut down the Cymbalta or we can stop it.  You're up to 60 mg.  I gave you different sizes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, I am now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or we could just try just 30 if you want to see.  It's not doing anything else?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  The only thing I worried about was that panic attack really, to be honest with you.  I mean, me being at home is nothing new.  I've been like that forever now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but it might keep doing it.  I mean, it's possible.  I've had it make one person more depressed.  I haven't had any panic attacks until now, but then a lot of people it helps, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What if these panic attacks are not a part of that?  Could it be just me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just ride it out.  No, because you haven't had them, I mean, something sets it off and that's gotta-  The way that works in your brain, it's possible, you know, the chemicals it works on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's scary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'd better do our experiment.  I tell you what, I'll give you enough to go down to 30 mg for a few days and then stop just so we don't cut it off, but if you're not telling me anything dramatic, it's not helping, you know, so it didn't work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In case that keeps happening, did you take your Klonopins?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, I take it.  I didn't take it during the day, I took it at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean you might need it if you have one of those panic attacks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Balance it out, yeah I didn't even know where that was coming from so I didn't figure, I figured it was maybe this medicine, I don't know, but - I had my granddaughter in the car with me and I just, a couple of times, and I was like okay something ain't right.  I don't know where that's coming from.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is she?  Little?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Four, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, you don't want that to happen.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, no.  I mean, I immediately just slowed down and got off the first exit I could and then I just, you know, then as I was driving home regular, I was fine but it's almost like being on the highway, the rush around me sets off something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't understand it, it just does, but that ain't never happened to me before, but it's been happenin' at least on four occasions.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I have plenty of people that have panic attacks and they don't go on the interstate, they'll drive other roads.  They'll avoid it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I ain't keen with it now.  I ain't been back on it since the last one, I'm like okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, just wait til, you know, do this about five days, one a day and then that will be all right, I bet it'll stop.  There's no reason for it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Am I veerin' off of it or stay on just 30?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No I think you're gonna get off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just veer off of it, okay.  Yeah, because I'm like, okay, what's going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a funny drug.  It's a good drug - when it's good, it's very, very good.  I have a feeling it's doing this.  I don't think they have a thing in there that tells you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh it's just so weird.  I was like what in the world is wrong with me.  I knew it wasn't the people around me and nobody was like jumping in my lane and trying to make me panic, it just, something just sticks in my head like uh oh you're going to have a wreck, you know, it was just wow, it was just, it was a panic attack, that's the only way I can describe it.  I mean, I was grabbin' my wheel and I  was like, I gotta get off,  I  gotta get off, you know, it was like, whew, it was scary, it was real scary and I was with people on the highway, like what is she doing because I mean, I was, I dropped back in speed and eased my way off and you know, and tried to be as careful as I could, so now I'm like oh, don't need to be doing that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it didn't say that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Could something be going on with me?  Maybe, maybe not that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think so.  Well, I mean, we'll find out I guess, but you know I'm pretty sure I'm right.  What could be going on with you?  I mean everything is calming down now isn't it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean nothing's new that's happened.  [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, but the stuff that really irritates me is in [DEIDENTIFIED] so I haven't been worried about what's in [DEIDENTIFIED] though, cause as long as I don't hear from em, I'm fine.  I'm better off that way, but everything else, I'm just, I pretty much just keep to myself.  I don't really have a social life.  I don't go nowhere.  I go to church, that's about it.  Church and to the store, that's it.   I don't wanna do nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not dating?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, oh my God no, absolutely not.  I know some guys are like what's wrong with her.  No.  I was like back up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Leave me alone, no.  No that's not even a thought.  I think I'm better off, especially with the things I'm going through and my injuries and freshly divorced in December, I don't even wanna date nobody, that's the last thing on my mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I mean, you need two years of nothing going on - boring calm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It'd be nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It'd be nice if I could have that.  We did sell our home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?  Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We signed the contract, yeah.  We took a $23,000 loss on it, but it's going so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what about that one in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Did you get [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's actually - I got - I'm gonna try, at the end, before, about three months before the lease ends, I'm gonna see if they want to purchase it because they really want to buy a home so they love that house so I'm just gonna make the offer to em if they want to purchase it ya know.  I don't need it, I'm not going back there so - and I just have to deal with that property management company but, I don't know, I feel like I'm just sitting around waiting to die.  Is that a good thing to be thinking?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do, I just feel -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you're not making stuff to look forward to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe that's what it is.  I don't know. I just feel like, okay, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe you can take the grandchildren or some of em somewhere for the summer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My other one's in [DEIDENTIFIED], but the one that is here, the one that you met, the little girl, she's - I still have her a lot.  I mean I try to keep her around because she keeps me happy.  She keeps me laughing and I try to give her a glass of milk with a pancake, she was like Nana I'm lactose intolerant.  She's only four.  I said what.  She's real smart.  She said I'm lactose intolerant, but she was that way when she was a baby.  She was allergic to milk when she was a baby, but she's not now.  That just made me laugh.  Out of nowhere she said this.  She kind of breaks up the day but - I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I mean if you knew you were gonna take them on a cruise in June, you know, something to look forward to than just nothing.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  I guess they just - I guess really I need to readjust my life I guess, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you do, but -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Readjust other things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't be in a hurry.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I'm not.  I'm not in a hurry. I just got in the house, I'm set up in the house, and now I'm trying to look out for me and, you know, make sure, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Is there something you want to accomplish or something like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I have started my admissions application back to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did do half of it.  I need to finish the other half.  I'm just hoping I can keep focused though.  Retaining thoughts - it's hard for me retain - seems like - the information I already know is retained, but sometimes when I'm reading, it's hard for me to retain what I've read and it never was like that, everything, my whole - they don't even get it, every thing's just changed, you know, everything just has affected - this accident has just affected like everything and limits me on what I can do.  You know, even taking my grandkids to an amusement park - I don't do that because, come on Nana get on the ride with us and, and you know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can't do that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, so I can't.  I mean I'll take em as far as the mall and let em ride on the merry go round because I can sit down, you know, and that's real slow but, you know, something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yeah, you ought to be able to do school, we'll see.  Well this whole divorce thing, that's just several years of mess. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh my God.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's still [INAUDIBLE], like you got to be kidding me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, at least you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We can -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have anything else -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> After the house, no and that's what I, you know, I've even just really really cut him off even after my phone cause he'll start off talking about the house, then he'll end up talking about me and what we could do, you know, now he understands that he was wrong and the money and, you know, which was hid and all of that, but it's, I could never even entertain that.  I told him, I said oh no.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not putting my life in nobody else's hands ever again, that just ain't gonna happen. I can't do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I ache and hurt enough, I don't need nobody, you know, stressing me out mentally, as well as physically, so I can't think about doing that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you aren't waiting around to die.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I just, sometimes I just feel that way and then sometimes, I don't know, I just get in that mood to where it's like, I don't know, I mean, I just feel like I'm just here and what is the purpose.  I don't feel like doing nothing to myself, I don't feel like going in the kitchen and cutting myself or cutting my wrists or doing nothing crazy.  I don't feel suicidal.  I guess I just feel like, it's just dawned on me at [AGE], it's like this thing has just knocked me down because I am used to being so busy at school and working and I got still so much in me - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That, you know, and then it's like, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you can do a lot of things, but it's gonna be a slower pace.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, slower pace and, you know, even with them, even with volunteering they say well if you volunteer anywhere, you know, that means you can go back to work.  Well, no, because if I wake up in the morning and I don't feel good, I don't have to go.  It's totally different.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If that ever comes up, I told you to do it, that's all, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As part of your therapy [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah cause I mean, I need to stimulate my brain.  I can't, I mean, it's like I just need to just sit - you know, to me it's like you told me to just, they have me like feeling like I just can't do nothing, but sit in the house, actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, well you can do some little stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I mean I try to do stuff and gather stuff for my church and stuff like that, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I give away a lot of things and try to help other people the best I can, but I just feel like, I don't know, my son be like mama when you in the house, why you just stay in your room.  Because I do and I just - now I get up, I shower, I dress and then I'm just in my room and he's like - I don't feel like going out in the living room.  I mean I'd be the only one there. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You need to get a hobby going or something, you know.  Maybe you should start selling stuff on [DEIDENTIFIED] or one of those deals, you know, so you got something to do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I guess, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] said people are, she's pretty sure some people like go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] and they pick up stuff and then they go sell it on [DEIDENTIFIED] for more money.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?  Oh that's horrible, well I wouldn't do that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you've got to know -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The [DEIDENTIFIED] already overcharge people for things, I mean that's the purpose of them being there.  They sell stuff like they're dealers.  I was like oh my God.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah they do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I haven't been in there in a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh my Lord.  The one on [DEIDENTIFIED] does anyway, but the donations they get, most of them be designer stuff, but I mean, still it is the [DEIDENTIFIED], that's the whole purpose, for you to get better things at a low cost because you're less fortunate than most people</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes, you know, some people just like to shop in those second hand consignment shops anyway.  There could be some nice stuff in there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but you  got to have a way to, like, turn it over and make a little money.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, I think it's bad for them, an organization to be selling stuff like that.  I mean they be selling shirts for like $50 and it be just a shirt, you know, and I'm like, oh my god am I in [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE].  The one in [DEIDENTIFIED] is bad for me in prices, they don't do all that great with the clothes and with some of the donations.  They almost, it's like they're tryin' to get money from - yeah, like they're a store, like they're from [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.  I mean they might get new donations from places and then they try to sell them for like new, as new, you know, and it's like wow.  I stopped giving them stuff after I saw that.  I was like nah, I'd rather just give it to somebody -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Than sell it. That's what I do with my stuff, I give it away.  Or I take it to the church and put it in the clothes closet so people that's trying to look for jobs and don't have clothes, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stuff like that.  Take some stuff to the [DEIDENTIFIED] because that was my job for the veterans program, I mean that's what I thrived on, loved it, you know?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you are doin' some stuff.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're just kinda being restless and impatient, I guess.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess. And then I feel like, I don't know, my body is - I mean - I'm not firm like I was.  I mean I'm only [AGE] and I'm like okay if I went to a gym or something, which I know I can't lift, but just to help my lower extremities or something.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That would be good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Would I be in violation of anything?  I mean, it's like, I'm not getting any therapy, I'm just sitting around going to get cellulite if I keep, I mean I used to jog, I used to - you know - I used to be in a gym, I used to keep myself up.  Now it's like, which I know I can't lift, okay that's understandable, but I mean, I go walking, I do go walking, but that's not really taking care of the area.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well even if the gym had a pool you could walk in the pool, things like that, you know.  No, you're not gonna get in trouble for doing that, anything like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just feel like any little thing I do, I'm in violation.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The way they talk.  But I'm glad that [DEIDENTIFIED]'s looking at them, that's all I got to say.  They told me I don't have to come in front of them, they have a person, they pulled my records again.  So they keep talking about my arm and all this, [INAUDIBLE], I'm 100% better versus just being 50% before I fell, I was like wait a minute, she's right and I said now I know I can't get paid from both places, which is fine, but obviously I'm worse than what y'all trying to acknowledge, so, that's when I got that letter.  You know what, we don't need to see you, all my records are in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Even my personnel records, they're in [DEIDENTIFIED] cause I called to see, well if I did switch over to retirement, how much would it be?  They couldn't even tell me.  They said well all your records are in [DEIDENTIFIED].  We don't have no idea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I just had a girl who's a pharmacist at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I took her out at, oh hell, a year and a half ago at least.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because they were just jerkin her around, but the point is, she's had her paperwork at [DEIDENTIFIED] over a year and last week they admitted they lost it all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh my God.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we did it all again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  They gave me - everything with me was clear.  I had all my stuff within ten days, Social Security called me on the phone, we're not gonna send you anywhere, we're not gonna send you to any of our doctors,  we're gonna give you your Social Security, this is informal, we'll send you a formal letter.  The same day, I got a call from, well the guy next door worked at the [DEIDENTIFIED] and he walked my letter over there to me, said we just granted you unemployability. This is the same day, umployability at 100%.  I was like are you kidding me, so I got that call from Social Security, then the guy from the [DEIDENTIFIED] lives next door, and then um I got a call on the phone from [DEIDENTIFIED] that - that was informal - that they were sending me out a letter that they would grant my retirement disability - the same day, all three people, but that was, you know, I had wrote the White House too, so it might have had something to do with it, I don't know, just some workers contract, cut my pay off for two months.  They cut me off for two months, no income and I wrote [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you still got this little issue of the - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think I'm getting my raises.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Divorce.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think they've given me -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't see, I can't see it, I can't see it so I'm gonna have to end up probably going over paperwork with a fine tooth comb with these people.  You know, I don't know who's in charge of these folks but it's just, that agency, uh-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know who is either.  I told ya I wrote one letter and told them that this claims examiner is making this guy sicker you know, give him a new one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they didn't want to do it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're so nasty.</p>

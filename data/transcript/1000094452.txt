<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless you would rather I just wait and transferred it out in my head. Which direction would you </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a pretty good feel for what happened first session. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you are going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: From the standpoint of science </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From the standpoint of science?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well from the standpoint of science I should fill it out now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From the standpoint of science</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you do not care. I do not care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am willing to do however you would like to handle it. It is perfectly alright at this point. It does not take long. Do you need something to write on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So why don't you go to the restroom? I am very sorry this is. Do you want to? However, you can stay there. That is fine. I just feel a bit corny. [0:01:00.3]</p>

<p>The S.A.T.'s [0:02:00.8 to 0:05:22.7 silence]</p>

<p>Everybody since the enlightenment thanks you. I am very sorry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can remember for a long time that anything we do today will wash it out. I am pretty sure about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is yours. Yeah, you know, maybe you might be right, but I noticed something, you seem the whole time that you are filling it out now, extremely [0:06:03.6] apologetic. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I should not have lost the first form. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I wondered if you had thoughts. What was going on at the time? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess I sort of I have had trouble just getting this information into this program forever. I could never get my check here. It has just been. It just seems. I actually feel like every aspect of my life that I am about a week behind. This [0:07:01.8] just seems like one other one. Some fun. I also sort of want to keep it clean. I do not want. I like the ideas of the lines of responsibility. Nice and clean. So for me to have not done that that sort of. I think the problem as far as I can tell is that I do not tolerate gray zones very much. I do not know. Those tend to generate arguments because once you are in a gray zone, there are always issues of interpretation of who is right and who is wrong. Invariably I defend myself very poorly and so the thing is to do what [0:08:03.9] you need to do. Be right or wrong. Get it done like you were supposed to and then when somebody says or you are taken aside or something is taken exception to, just say no I did this and this. A little spin control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could tell that you came in with kind of a sense of urgency about getting it done. Asked if we could do it first, but even when I said, "Fine, yeah no problem."</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is true. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You laugh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Two things. I did not know the tape was going. I was going to [0:09:05.6] sneak this off. I thought I was going to get away with this. Sorry I thought you were just rewinding the tape and I thought, oh shit, that cannot be good. So I think my little devious plan has now been pulled off. I do not know why I am laughing because up until this very second I have been doing nothing like that. No laughing at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe there is a reason that you are laughing right now. Can you identify anything? Anything that might be going through your head or anything you might be feeling? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I have been laughing inappropriately a lot lately. [0:10:01.5]</p>

<p>Well I am not completely on this here. I do not have a good explanation. I know that it has something to do with kind of the disgusts around the pressure that is always there. Half the time I am sort of defending this as a great system. I have got my rights, my wrongs, I do this by the appropriate hour and then there is a side of me that is [0:11:09.6] completely cynical about this and thinks it is an asinine system. I get in this case busted. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I noticed that you are smiling again. You have not even thought about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have no. Yeah. I feel like I have been busted. There is a certain amount of release going on here. This has been a very hard ugly week and I [0:12:01.6] feel like I am just sort of dying for any outlet. I have stepped out of New York life for a few minutes and this windowless room and all of the sudden it feels like the rules are different. So anyway </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know, interesting a release from a week that sounds like it was maybe a lot of pressure or something and I still find myself asking but why. But why laughter? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have always done it. I have done it a lot. Not a lot. It has something to do with getting away with things. I know that. I remember that from and [0:13:08.0] actually I remember very clearly that sort of nervous laughter that people think is really fake and disgusting. Some people have described it as that. They cannot stand it. Not that it happens every week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well your demeanor certainly changed when you said, "How people react to it, fake and disgusting." </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughter) Yeah everything we are working on. There are a hundred other things more important to talk about at this but here I am stuck on this point. [0:14:00.0] That is disgusting. I do not know how to say it. About 99 percent of the time I feel like do not tell anybody, I do not like this system that is set up very much. I know it works. I know it works better than anything else. This little sort of be real careful about rights and wrongs, doing doubt, (inaudible at 0:14:49.8). I think it works better than anything else I have had like where there were no rules and just I did not have any kind of [0:15:00.7] guidelines for myself. At the same time, I resented the shit out of it and I feel like, as Herman Melville once said, "I feel like running down the streets and knocking the hats off of people's heads." When I was thinking about. When you said my demeanor changed, I was remembering an incident where this came up. A very similar setting, like the first counseling, I was like19 years old or something like that, I went to a counselor a couple of days. Unusual teenage angst and I was very good with my hands. I still am. I told this counselor that I would repair his garbage disposal or something like that [0:16:00.7] before one of the sessions started because it was a simple thing. I got there sort of late and did not get a chance to repair it. It pissed him off that I was late because I said that I would be there early. It was back in the days of group therapy. I actually did not like this guy at all. He was a creep. I thought he was really self-centered. I think he was. Just that. He had chalk boards to show us like parenting. My parent would adult relate to his child. He was always diagramming shit. Anyway he was like and one of the things was confrontation in front of the rest of the group and I started giggling when he started bringing up the garbage disposal. He hated it. In retrospect I knew I was wrong. I should have repaired his fucking garbage disposal but I also just. I thought he [0:17:05.9] was an ass. I did not like him from day one and I had no right to say any of this or at least I felt powerless to say anything. This is, I do not know how far field we have covered here but yeah, it has something to do with being nervous. I mean in this situation, I have to admit, I have found, no offense, actually it is completely unrelated, I have found dealing with this program very difficult. Jesus Christ, I mean the [0:18:10.5] amount of time it took to get. Thank god I was not hanging from the edge of a cliff because the amount of time it took to get into see a counselor was just. It took a really long time and the first one did not work out. It was like paperwork all over the place. If I see one more standardized test I was just going to puke. Yeah. Part of me is just really skeptical about whether or not this is going to work. There are all these sort of feelings but I am giving it time and blah, blah, blah, blah. By the same token so here I am trying to do the right thing like I care. I mean I do but I do not. It has been very frustrating and so I get to this point where I am supposed to be very. I should have gotten it [0:19:05.6] in earlier but we could not get it in last week. Like you know, whose fault is this? I just want to do the right thing. Get the fucking thing filled out. So my little giggling session. Make of that what you will. I do not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that I am sorry I did not hear?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Make of that what you will. It does seem to center around sort of just being pissed and really frustrated. Just short of going postal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is the similarity to the other story that you told. If I understand you correctly. Being pissed but giggling about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I was not giggling about being pissed. I was giggling because I was nervous because I could not do anything being pissed. I was stuck. Ok. I [0:20:05.2] can rant at you about my previous MD or whatever or counselor or whatever. Or I can rant at you about how many standardized forms I had to fill out. But first of all, I do not think it would do any good. I do not think that you are that involved in the study. Second of all, I know you do not have anything to do with standardized forms. I think so what am I going to do. So I just feel like it is one more thing that I have to suck it up. Plus you think, I am sure you were bored. You had no book. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure how that would be connected to the laughing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, because it was just one more piece of pressure. I just thought [0:21:08.4] we would do this on the sly. You would go off and get a coke and I would just do this. It would not be any skin off your back but you were sitting here so now it is like one more thing. It feels like not only do I have to do it but I am putting this guy out. So like great, one more one more date. (laughter) That is put on tape. I can see the camera with which I went through this boring. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again, I kind of find myself wondering if you felt on the spot or something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Absolutely. Well I think that is why realizing that that [0:22:01.4] thing is running sort of made me giggle even more. I was like. I am. I have been busted. That is the whole point of putting me on the spot. Yeah. I just have never really had the strength. I have gotten better but I have never had the strength to just sit down and handle these situations with any kind of solidity or decorum before. Frankness and just say, "Hey, I did not finish this." Too bad for you. Too bad for me. What are you going to do? I admire guys that do that. I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seemed to me as if you were describing reasons that you had that were laughing or felt like laughing at the moment. [0:22:59.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That does not seem logically inconsistent with knowing that I have an inability to handle it with just frankness. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure that the laughing was not frankness too I guess. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are laughing again. You have been caught again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. (laughter) This is not the right session for this week. I mean. Now I have to laugh at something else because I will becoming auto [0:24:06.4] referential. Now I am laughing because I think we are focusing on this way too much. Now I feel on the spot and I am about ready to come out and say, "Hey this is silly." Of course I want to make a nice impression on you and want to roll with the punches and do the right thing and stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look like you were going to say something else. [0:25:05.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughter) You are a slave to fascism. You know, two nights ago I was sobbing like a four year old. I swear to God it has just been. I got a note from my ex. Just seeing her hand writing just sent me right off plus I was just exhausted from having to take a trip to my mothers. So anyway, I did not feel up to it. I was just certain that I would come in here and be a wreck, right. I was nowhere in my ideas of how today would be, was I sitting here giggling. So this is very odd indeed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if you have anything in mind to account for that? [0:26:01.3]</p>

<p>Because it does sound</p>

<p>PATIENT: Asinine. Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well odd at least.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean no. Most people I know are very concerned about me because I have been in an absolute funk and I am getting home from work, closing the door, and sleeping as much I can and trying to snap out of it but this is like a whole different gig. Do I have anything to account for this; absolutely not. It is refreshing. I mean sort of messing with my mind. I appreciate the fact that you are as brave as you are because if you [0:27:05.9] keep it up, I will tell you what I think. (laughter) I think there was one thing that was striking me was the fear. It was sort of striking me as annoying but on the one hand I was sitting here giggling and on the other hand that you, my new counselor, are completely oblivious to the wrenching hell that I just went through the past eight days or something like that. I mean it was just a miserable week and here I am giggling and sort of focusing on this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I wonder though, given how bad a week you had, it [0:28:04.2] seems to me to make the giggling not less significant but possibly more significant. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Fuck. This has never happened. (laughter) Yeah. Let's see I had decaf at 3:00. Man, I do not have an explanation. I am Mr. Rational, I swear to God. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe not an explanation but you are smiling now. What are you thinking? How do you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's see. I feel two things. I feel as out of control in this way as I did when I was crying. This does not feel like laughter in some sense. It just [0:29:03.9] feels like something that my body is doing that I am sort of watching this but I am not part of it. This is not like enjoying a good movie or something like that. It is not like you told a great joke. This just seems like. I was standing over some fucking chicken trying to slice this and tears are streaming down my face and my roommates are kind of walking around checking my head. I got the onions out so that I would have an excuse. I am completely in control and it just kept going and going and finally I just had to excuse myself. This feels the same way only it is laughing instead of crying. What triggered it, well the form, the rest of that. So I guess I am not sure what we have [0:30:06.6] discovered except that I have got a loose screw or two this week or over this past few weeks. I cannot get a handle on my life or something. I cannot. I am just all over the map.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is interesting that you say that it is an almost out of control action and not really like a genuine kind of laughter. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It was actually implode. Just kind of. I can feel that laughter. I know that sense. I have never actually been asked to define it or think about it. I [0:31:03.4] know that and what will often happen when I am doing that is I will come out with the most vitriolic stuff. Left up to my own devices, that is when I can say the nastiest things. It just sort of. I do not do anything. I will often say things that I will end up apologizing for later. Everything sort of out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you were laughing this time perhaps you had something nasty in mind to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. I was like ok. Oh well this is frustrating. I went back [0:32:02.5] there and I was just counting left and right. I was angry at the program that I agreed to bring that down. When we start the questions we start off immediately with why are you giggling and I am like, "Look I have a pint of tears on my bedroom floor, can't we talk about that?" Then I caught you in a logical inconsistency and I felt bad about that because I was not supposed to see that. Then you kept pushing. If he keeps pushing then I am going to tell him a comment that makes sense. I guess the more you push the more my mental state of mind is going to </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it feels like I am kind of pushing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am going to start pushing back. [0:32:59.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You may well feel like pushing back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. You want this to be a soccer game, I can do that. Suma wrestling or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is actually not really that I want to push. But it was striking to me. I think worthwhile to talk about. It is your last week. Particularly given what you said about how your week has been. It may feel much like because, you are not crying and you are laughing, that I am not going to get the right impression about how your week has been. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That is good. You are on it. This is the first time that anybody [0:34:08.5] has ever said anything about it. The last time. The only other time this had been identified was by somebody who made me feel like an asshole. I just thought it was fake and deceptive. This is the first time it has been identified that I have evaluated or thought about it. I mean way to go. This is new. I do not like feeling this. It does not feel genuine. It does not feel peaceful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does not sound like it. [0:34:54.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It is not. I could use some of that. Yeah so. I said I want to get two things out. One is, I enjoyed our last session a lot. I thought that you were very bright and I do not think that of many people. Believe me. Believe me. I was surprised and I also think you are too young to be bright or whatever. My guess is I am older than you so always I translate that into reality, probably not going to be. Once again [0:36:11.8] you have like been on it and found something. So there is a second thing that is sort of fitting in here which is some surprise that I am enjoying this. Third thing maybe that just came back to me, is Cynthia is young and I admired her. This is an odd parallel. Cynthia is the ex. The one who left me in tears not two nights ago. I guess there is no [0:37:03.3] rocket science here, it just seems sort of odd. I guess I felt like just getting it out to have gotten it out. To get around the table and get it instead of having it sort of jangle around upstairs. I just have to get it behind me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Get it behind you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just get out peace. I feel like one of the things that I have problems with is I have a kind of instinctual reaction. It works easiest for me if I do not like people and I look for the wrong things. I look for the bad things and I just find lots of [0:38:02.3] </p>

<p>reasons. I know that. It does work easier for me in some ways as far as just like getting through a conversation. But at the same time, when I start to realize that I like somebody, it is sort of like the fish in a bowl materials program after World War II, give everybody your weapons and then nobody will hurt each other. I tell you what I was thinking then I can no longer use that. If I say, "I can no longer think of you as too young to be my counselor", if I have already told you that, then you are going to be hip to that. If I think you are stupid I would certainly never tell you because you would be defensive but I doubt so I can anyway. I do not know if you can do anything with that. I just thought for us to be frank. [0:39:06.0]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it was hard for you to push those things out. It is hard for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is true. I did not want to admit that I thought you were too young. I did not want to. Yeah. I guess I had reservations about going into this program and so I have been holding it at a distance and now I do not want to so I was trying to get rid of my defense mechanisms. Turn over my weapons to the local authorities. [0:40:16.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And me being younger might be </p>

<p>PATIENT: That would have been a reason to dismiss the things that you say and tell me about. So I guess the bottom line is I think you are a pretty cool guy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I wonder if you still have reservations. I appreciate actually the positive feedback and stuff and the compliment. But it is like your reservation couched did not compliment. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I think. (laughter) And there are the gigglies ladies and [0:41:00.3] gentlemen. Probably. Probably. Two for two is pretty good. Two insights in two weeks. Nobody gets that. What is funny is your backpack. I just looked at that and god a student. I ditched mine a couple of years ago. It was getting towards the end. So I just look at that and I go (inaudible at 0:41:37.5) Jesus Christ. So here I am just like blinked right at this backpack. This is hard. I guess this is one of the sand traps of [0:42:02.9]</p>

<p>getting old. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or one of the sand traps of me being young. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I said it is just I feel like I relinquish trust slowly so I am very surprised to be two for two. I mean that is my whole gig these days. This [0:43:02.7] is like New York. The whole point of New York seems to be beware, be ready to be disappointed. Be ready to end something and then get a start. So this is, like I said, sort of a surprise. This is a lot of work. I am damn near quite the tennis pro here. [0:43:57.0]</p>

<p>Yeah and I guess as long as I am handing over all of my defense mechanisms, I did have a good relationship with a counselor for a while right after during graduate school so that was another reason to be sort of disappointed. He was an old. He was a lot like me. He was an ex carpenter. He was an MD so I respected him for his physical scientist even though he actually knew less about the, I think I knew as much about the body as he did. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But between you and I there are some of these differences or at least we are not as alike. [0:45:01.2] </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. But I am surprised, like I said. No those differences are there. One the one hand I was completely surprised that I just got along with you. This is something different. Something new that is interesting, etc. etc. But I continued the rest of the week sort of. I am scraping together. I am just scraping to get the time for this and the money. Please give me a reason to duck out of this. This is going to be $2000.00 [0:46:01.8] before we are all done. I am still paying off my student loans. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But me being young enough let's say could have been a reason like that or could be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it would have had to been a subset reason. Young did not help. It was like an Oh. Oh. I was sort of hoping for a grandfatherly type. Been there done that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder. I find myself wondering if you have any thoughts about me being younger. What about that? [0:46:59.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually ever since I said, it reminds me of Cynthia that is the one thing that has really been bugging me. Because she was little Miss golf Pro too. She was just on it. I ended up spending all my time in these arguments that seemed like they were differentiating and we would never get back to these issues of integration. I wanted to address my issues of lifestyle and how I was going to lead and what kind of life were we leading. She would sort of be sitting here working at the fringes of language and what does that mean. What does that mean? Ok. Give me a break. I want to talk about a broad issue and she is living from minute to minute and from point to point. Even our discussion today is sort of dealing really with what I brought up right here [0:48:04.2] right now rather than some sort of integrated historical whole or something like that.</p>

<p>Who am I to question the wisdom of an entire therapy program? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that is right. It is. It has been very much what is happening immediately now. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is like so of course, part of me is immediately like bored with it. With the thought. It was just like that with Cynthia. I thought it was incredibly engaging. I learned tons of things about myself. I learned tons of things. I learned incredible ways of dealing. I learned so much about myself with her about. She was so fucking brave. I mean she just picked up 100 things in a room I swear and pushing me all the [0:49:05.3] time. So part of this, I have things killed putting around this again when one thing it just seems really creepy. The other thing, part of me kind of wants that. Tell me a nice long story. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But kind of creepy that I would remind you of Cynthia so much. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Young and sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to admit that took me by surprise when you </p>

<p>PATIENT: It took me by surprise. Imagine how I felt. You did not even date her. (laughter) Yeah. Well like I said it is mostly the style of interaction. Just [0:50:01.1] aware of everything. There was not, I have already said it, there was not one nuance. There was no one to Cynthia, there was no such thing as that. She picked up stuff that I had not even felt yet. You seem to be pretty good at it too. So I do not know. What the hell, maybe it is like old humbling. I get to visit Cynthia without even having to go to her house. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you said, you had mixed feelings about that kind of similarity. I wondered if you could identify any of those. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is probably bad science but part of what I report on, part [0:51:03.0] of what I discuss, and part of what I want is to identify my central problems. Part of me is concerned with each issue with each time I walk in the door we end up sort of like doing this Hi. Interesting way you said hi. Well interesting you say that, I never thought about the way I said hi. It is real interesting to do that but I also wonder can we get to the fact that I was sobbing on Tuesday night from roughly 6:00 until 11:00. So part of me is concerned as with Cynthia, discussions never went anywhere. I mean they were the most interesting discussions that never went anywhere but they also never went anywhere. Like ok, are we going to live together? Are you going to quit going to parties until 4:00 in the morning? Are you going to quit coming on to other guys? Are you going to do this are you going to do that? [0:52:10.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is one</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that is a concern. Is this going to be more games? More language games? Not games but more like (inaudible at 0:52:23.1) that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And are we going to get somewhere? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Are we going to get somewhere? That is right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are we going to get to the central stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be nice. So I was sitting here going well is this the center stuff anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we did not. Ironically enough, it is about the end of the session. One thing we did not talk about was the sheet I gave you last week. [0:53:02.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Time to start giggling again. I read half of it and then cannot find it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Cannot find it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh and I am very sorry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is ok I think I have another copy of it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You have another one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I have one. Not as good of one. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I apologize. Here I was stopping for that and here it is produced. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So a not as nice of a copy. A copy none the less. Interesting in the context of the discussion we were just having about what this is like and how we were talking about things moment to moment and so on. But we can talk more about that next week. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. I am sorry. It is just another thing that did not happen this week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Quite alright.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will be thorough next time. [0:54:00.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a couple other kind of logistics. I have got a whole stack of these questionnaires now we can handle this a number of ways. I can give them to you, you can just take care of them or I can have them each time or have one each time for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't I just take them home and this time I will not lose them as long as </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I think there is probably. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She used to have envelopes. I will need to get the address from her but I can do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Possibly I could get some envelopes by next week if that is easier.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Well at least I can pull them out. Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And my discussion with Maria regarding payment and switching this over and so that is supposed to be handled between us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am comfortable doing that. [0:55:02.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. You want a check in the envelope or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess we do not need an envelope. You can just give me a check.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Why don't I give you </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So but we can do it whatever arrangement you would like to, every two weeks, every session, once a month. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Why don't next week we settle up for the past three sessions. We will just make it clean next week and then after that we will do it every two weeks. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is fine with me. Sounds good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Just about this huge psychotherapy research project, is that anything you can add to or to shock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. You should make it out to them. That is who you were making it out to before right. Yeah. You should make it out to them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And basically I will just be getting a check at this point. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. We all done?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All set. Alright. [0:56:01.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh and again this time? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think so. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This time is better. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah this is good. [0:56:09.6]</p>

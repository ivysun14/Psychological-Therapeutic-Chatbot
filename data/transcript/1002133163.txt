<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>VERDA HEISLER, PH.D., a diplomate in clinical psychology of the American Board of Professional Psychology, Inc., practiced full-time in San Diego, California, beginning in 1951. She published articles in many professional journals, and is the author of A Handicapped Child in the Family (Grune & Stratton, 1972).</p>

<p>She is the THERAPIST in the session that follows.				</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These two group sessions were selected because they illustrate the dynamic interaction that exists within my group and the effectiveness of this interaction in breaking through the rather rigid defense system of Betty, a highly competent and successful professional woman whose frustration in her personal life stemmed partially from an overemphasis on maintaining the persona of maturity. We begin the recording when the 75-minute group session is about 15 minutes underway and I am speaking to Betty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Betty, you're being so honest and courageous tonight.</p>

<p>BETTY: (chuckles) Dr. Heisler (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'm wondering if you can take it on the chin on another matter.</p>

<p>BETTY: Oh! ***! Go ahead.</p>

<p>DICK: I want to hear what you want ***.</p>

<p>BETTY: Go ahead. What is it you want to hear?</p>

<p>DICK: Well she thought you were going to reveal something and evidently you're not. And I'm wondering what it is.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well maybe I'll reveal it some other time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gee, I'm wondering too what that is. (chuckling) Oh well, that's not very important. Um � I was very uncomfortable with something from you last Wednesday. And as I thought about it afterwards. I thought about the fact that I don't like this in you. And the reason I don't like it in you is because it's such a blind spot, it seems to me. And somehow I want you to be better than this. I want you to be free of such a blind spot. And � to get right to the point, the thing from last Wednesday that I'm talking about is the humor that you were expressing, and you generally do express your � racial prejudice through humor. This is always the form which it does come out. And � it was with regard to � the threat that you were posing to your mother about the possibility that you might marry a Japanese boy or a Korean boy, and this was very funny. [0:02:27.6]</p>

<p>And � I really wonder, are you completely unaware of the prejudice that you are expressing in this kind of thing? I know that you see yourself as a very liberal � as a person that's very liberal kind of orientation. And I ask myself, "How do you square it?" You know, I know I have prejudices, but I think I'm enough aware of them that I have them, that I don't express them in that form. And it really bothered me. I thought, "You know, how do you expect *** to feel?" (inaudible)</p>

<p>I haven't seen *** during the week, but I felt very bad because *** because of this. And I wrote it out. I didn't want to be ***. And I thought, "I've just got to take that up with Betty because my feeling � I feel about you as I did when I first � when you first came in the group. I felt that Betty's feelings were the same as she had expressed. But I didn't like her very well. And while you were talking, I want to say, "Oh, you're just like my mother." And as I thought about it, it was the same thought. How can you feel so liberal and unconsciously be so prejudiced?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I get *** I really haven't ever faced it before. I'm just full of feeling right now. I found that when I started talking about it, I just got angry all over again. It really makes me angry. [0:04:09.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was full of feeling last week when you were talking about the Japanese boyfriend and I was just � felt � I felt throbbing inside. I can't identify the feeling I had. But on the way home, I was trying to figure out how I could be wrong (ph). This is typical of me. And I decided that you were just expecting your mother's prejudice, not yours. I figured that, � that this is your way of making fun of your mother and her prejudice. And I � because I thought, "Betty can't really feel this way herself."</p>

<p>DICK: Feel what way?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um � feel prejudice herself. I thought Betty didn't really have the prejudice � that she was expressing her mother's prejudice this way. Then I shouldn't be angry about what Betty said because she was expressing her mother's prejudice, not hers. This is just my way of handling it. But I was full of feeling at the time. Not now so much.</p>

<p>F: Well I guess that didn't register with me there because when Betty was doing it, I was thinking that she found *** her mother's weak points. She was getting at something her mother would � that would really upset her mother. And you were digging at your mother through that.</p>

<p>DICK: Well I'm having some reactions, and I'm sorry to have to interrupt this, because I want to defend this on a non-feeling level, although I am feeling plenty. I think we have to be a little bit more realistic about humor and the nature of humor and the fact that prejudice does exist, certainly in Betty's mother's mind. Now this was some joking from Betty's mother's frame of reference, I think, and I don't think it has anything to do with Betty's prejudice. I think that perhaps Betty wouldn't � I don't think she'd share this. It would be the same way that if I � I have an aunt that's a member of the WCTU, a great-aunt. She's 90 years old. And it would be like me saying, "Well the next time she comes down, I'm going to get out a martini and mix it." And she'd be shocked. But I have nothing against martinis. I drink them all the time. But from her frame of reference, that would be big funny kick (ph) to make a mention like that just because she feels so seriously about it. [0:06:29.9]</p>

<p>And another thing. Humor has in it some realism, of course. Mother-in-law jokes are as old as the hills, and mother-in-laws are a very serious problem. But yet there's mother-in-law jokes and I don't think that � I feel very defensive about this from Betty's standpoint because I don't think it reveals as much � I don't think it reveals enough for us to get that upset about. And I further feel, ***, I have a friend that has a Jewish wife and once in a while I get off one about the Jews and she laughs. And I've had a Negro debating partner and I can joke about the Negroes with him when I was in college and he laughed. I think that there's a certain sophistication that we as minority members, which we all are, of course, have to reach in this and face the reality of humor and the reality of racial prejudice. Let's face it. We've all got it. It's there. What are we going to do with it? I'd rather joke about it than � sometimes, in certain situations, than to get morbid about the thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The primary difference - it's a very major difference to me between the kind of thing you're expressing and the kind of humor you're expressing and the kind of thing that I heard YOU expressing, Betty - is the consciousness of the prejudice. As I said, I'm not free from prejudice. But I think I am enough aware of myself and enough free from blind spots in this area that I know when I'm feeling it and I know when I'm expressing it. And I don't think Betty knew that she was expressing it. And I don't think she was conscious of her own attitudes as being expressed here at all. And they WERE being expressed. This was not just her mother's prejudice that she was communicating about it, was your own also. But I feel you're not aware of it. I feel you have a blind spot. [0:08:32.0]</p>

<p>BETTY: Um � well, I know that � I used to say that I'm prejudiced against ignorance and � stupidity and things like that. But � I know that I do have prejudices. I mean, sometimes � but the way I know it, it's not a very � it's not a real knowing, kind of knowing. It's � like sometimes I don't like a reaction of mine. I'll get a reaction, and I'll not like it. And I guess it's because it doesn't fit in with my scheme of me. And � so I'm thinking that the reactions that I feel are probably based on an unconscious prejudice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. I agree definitely ***.</p>

<p>DICK: Well why does it anger you so much?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um � well I mean �</p>

<p>DICK: There's a lot of ugliness that comes out of the unconscious. Why does this particular one grab you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a good question. Let me think about it for a moment. Um � I'm not always angered by it, although I'm always reactive to it. And I'm particularly reactive to it in Betty because of your unconsciousness of it and the extreme opposition between this, which you reveal, and the attitudes which you consciously espouse, so to speak. This discrepancy is something I want to get in there and reach. Um � however, I wasn't angered by it when it came out two or three weeks ago in regard to Sarah. I picked up on that and tried to focus your attention on it and you � dispensed with it in the way that Noel Shade turned to rise to the level as if he told you you did. ***.</p>

<p>BETTY: No. No.</p>

<p>F: You have an answer for everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You have an answer for everything. That was the kind of thing when you expressed your prejudice against Sarah. And I tried to pick up on it about three weeks ago. I was not angry in that situation, and I probably would have been if someone had been hurt by it. Your complete insensitivity to Edie, I think, is what made me angry. How did you feel about Edie in the context of that communication?</p>

<p>BETTY: Well I wasn't feeling anything about Edie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that's pretty damn insensitive and that's what makes me angry.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well I didn't relate her in any way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>F: *** Japanese.</p>

<p>BETTY: I didn't know Edie had anything that would ***</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you Japanese, Edie, or half Japanese?</p>

<p>EDIE: No, I'm part, I'm half Oriental.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the difference? Japanese, Filipino, Korean, you know, I mean �</p>

<p>EDIE: I consider myself in the same pot with all the Oriental, however, so � I think that I � in one way I felt, "Well, Betty's not even thinking of me and my background."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "They're not one of those."</p>

<p>EDIE: Yeah. Uh � I think I can express it better, my feelings I had about Betty, in comparing her with my mother. My mother considered herself a very liberal woman without any prejudice whatsoever. And she came from a very prejudiced family. And in order to � this is what I saw Betty doing, in a way. In order to shock this straight-laced New England family, she not only married an Oriental but she produced some black-eyed, black-haired babies and used all of us to throw in the faces of these prejudiced people. And she seemed to get a certain amount of glory out of it, that she had really stepped out of the straight and narrow and done something that would � her satisfaction was in shocking people - a blond mother with these little dark babies. And we, the children and my father, were the ones that suffered from it. Mama apparently got her moments of glory out of this thing that she had done, not out of love, but out of a desire to hit back at prejudice in her family. Thinking herself very liberal and in my way of thinking, my mother was one of the most prejudiced people on earth, not only about race, but everything. And to me, it *** such a shame that Betty is striving to be the liberal person that she would like to be, still has this hurdle to cross without apparently knowing it. The thing with my mother. [0:13:51.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and that brings two more things I want to say. This to me is the difference between a martini and a human being. There are a lot of jokes that just aren't funny to me, and I may be deficient in the area of humor, although there are an awful lot of jokes I can really appreciate. But jokes which are veiled scapegoating or something of this sort involving human beings really aren't funny to me. And there's a big difference between using a martini or a human being in this way as a weapon toward others. And I think what you just said about the way you and your father were used by your mother shows this in a pretty extreme form, that on a different point of the dimension it's the same thing that you were doing. And � I had another thought � oh, the other reason why I got angry is because I found you so unreachable on this, you know. I find that tonight I really *** hard enough with this, but I think maybe I'm getting through. And this is going to have some impact. But I think one reason that I got angry at this point was because I tried to reach you on this many times, and you've always had an answer, you know, as Perry (ph) did, [so effectively] (ph). And I think this is the part of the reason for my anger, Dave (ph).</p>

<p>DICK: Well I'm really glad it came out because as I sit here, I was kind of enjoying the humor of the thing *** and remember the other day when I said I was trying to remember something and couldn't? It was when I was laughing so heartily at all this and looked over at you and boy, just the opposite! And it really had an impact on me. I wanted to mention that to you, how that � gee, that took the wind out of my sails. I thought, "What am I missing?" And you just answered it, what I was missing. And I, too, realize now that I had not considered Edie either in this fun-making somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>DICK: But of course, that's the nature of prejudice. It's that projected generalization out there. It isn't that � you're different, see? I mean, that's prejudice for you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>DICK: You know this is really wild (ph) for me. I'm glad it came up because I didn't realize it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why I really genuinely feel it's important for us to be aware of our prejudices. [0:16:21.2]</p>

<p>F: I remember pretty clearly, I believe the time when Sarah was discussed. And I was pretty troubled about it. And when I thought over � when I was trying to explain to myself why this happened and why this seemed to stand out, the conversation last week stood out so in my mind. I remembered the conversation about Sarah and also about the father, the Mexican father I believe that came to see you? And that time you realized that you might have handled the situation differently. He was a laborer and he had come in from work and that sort of thing. That's the closest I think I've seen Betty get to understanding this � uh � feeling she has unconsciously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. She seemed to take a big step forward at that point.</p>

<p>DICK: *** whether Betty's feelings are hurt or not.</p>

<p>BETTY: Oh, well sure. I mean not my feelings are hurt. It's not that.</p>

<p>DICK: ***</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah, I just feel so injured.</p>

<p>DICK: I � I keep � wishing there was another way.</p>

<p>F: Yeah, I guess I do too.</p>

<p>f: I don't feel angry towards you, Betty. I don't feel as � I was hurt last Wednesday, but I don't now. My feeling is more of I wish you could see it and wish you didn't feel that way. Because my picture of you would be so much more complete if this thing weren't there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm interested that you feel injured. I don't understand that.</p>

<p>BETTY: I feel like � assaulted. [0:18:30.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your defenses are very precious.</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah, it's like I've been stormed, you know, when I wasn't looking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>DICK: I think that's about the most direct I've ever seen you be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't like it being ***?</p>

<p>DICK: Well, no, I'm not judging it. I � I've � it may be very good for progress. The things that are going through my mind were some of the things you said earlier about, well, you have to have a certain amount of confidence before you can do that. *** confident away. And I was wondering why it hasn't happened to me and I kind of shrugged that off. And then I think of who else it has happened to. And it has, to the women, I think, more than it has to me and to Betty more than it has to anybody else. But maybe that's helpful for Betty. [0:20:00.9]</p>

<p>Pretty painful treatment, but � treatment's treatment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But the pain in it, what is the pain?</p>

<p>BETTY: The pain is the feeling assaulted, feeling attacked. The feeling ***.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Injured.</p>

<p>BETTY: Injured.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stormed.</p>

<p>BETTY: Stormed. Stormed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like there's a castle with battlements and walls around it and this has been stormed. Well this is very true. This is exactly it. And this castle and battlements and walls, these are the defenses that protect you blind spots. And you're feeling very hurt that I assault *** defenses and want you to give them up. And your reaction tells me that you're more motivated to protect those battlements than you are to know this in yourself. And that distresses me.</p>

<p>BETTY: That even distresses me.</p>

<p>DICK: That's so true of all � that's the nature of defenses, though. Who is that not true of?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are degrees.</p>

<p>BETTY: But don't you think that those defenses are me defending myself against me too? It's defending me from knowing myself. I mean it's not just that I have been stormed, it's that I am being forced to see something that I have defended myself against seeing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Exactly. [0:22:12.4]</p>

<p>BETTY: So it's not just an external thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's all internal. It's all within you. Yeah.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well I don't know what you mean by that. But it's just that I know, I mean I feel that these are things that I just don't want to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>BETTY: And to be forced to think about them hurts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>BETTY: And of course I � I mean just � when I realize that I've been masquerading for years, makes me know how much I wanted to be � how much I want to be a kind of person, and therefore makes what I am so far away from that. (blows nose)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. There's something in that that doesn't quite ring true to me because if the motive - the drive to be a particular kind of person, a person who knows his prejudices - is strong, then the willingness to relinquish the defense against it is greater than the resistance to relinquishing that defense is less if the motive �</p>

<p>BETTY: I didn't say that I was motivated to know my prejudice. I was motivated � I wanted to be an unprejudiced person. And the knowing � I mean, that � it's not that I was motivated to KNOW my prejudice. It's � I was motivated not to HAVE any.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's hard for me to try to reply to because it seems so kind of incredibly na�ve for you to think that just by pretending it's not there, it will not be there. You must know that in order for it to be not there, or for it to be less, you have to know it. You must know that.</p>

<p>DICK: Well, I know how you feel.</p>

<p>BETTY: Pretty worthless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wherein lies your worthlessness?</p>

<p>BETTY: (weeping) Oh, stupid and not seeing things that are so obvious that I'm feeling so defective and just seems like no matter how far I go I never get anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because the route to getting somewhere involves facing that about ourselves which we don't like.</p>

<p>BETTY: There's always that to face.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes there is, Betty, for every human being. And why should you be so exempt? [0:26:10.4]</p>

<p>Why is it a special persecution to you to have to face the human challenges and human dilemmas and human conditions that are a part of life for everyone?</p>

<p>BETTY: Gee, you just make me feel so put down. (blows nose)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It comes to me now that in this, you need to be put down because you're clinging to a concept of yourself as a person without prejudice. And how did you ever get that way, you know? I haven't reached it. And I doubt that very many people have reached it completely. And yet your self-concept is that you've got it 100%.</p>

<p>BETTY: No it's not. I'm very prejudiced against Catholics. I know that. Not Catholics, but Catholic philosophy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not Catholics.</p>

<p>BETTY: It's hard for me to understand Catholics, but I'm prejudiced against the theology and the dogma. And I know that. And probably against Catholics too, I mean, since they follow it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But Betty, you said not too long ago that you have an image of yourself as a person with no prejudice.</p>

<p>BETTY: I said that's the person I want to be. And I've tried to think of myself as a person with no prejudice. I guess I think I have fewer prejudices than most people. But I've always known how I felt about Catholics. [0:28:30.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I generally end up feeling kind of defeated when we reach this point. And I have a feeling that we've been here many times.</p>

<p>BETTY: I feel the same way that I felt that evening when I was thinking that you were wanting me to do something that I didn't know how to do. And I told you that it was like you were expecting if I would suddenly begin speaking Chinese. And I don't know Chinese. And that's the way I feel now, like I'm supposed to DO something. And I don't even know what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the only thing I have asked you to do is to try to be open to the possibility that you ARE prejudiced against Orientals, against Mexicans, against Catholics, maybe, that you have some prejudice, some racial prejudice, that you DO have some. I'm asking you to be open to the possibility that this is so. That's really pretty clear. Clear cut. [0:30:07.1]</p>

<p>BETTY: (sighs) What I really want to say is, will saying "yes" end all this? I mean, how could I not be open to it? It's been, you know �</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't seem very open to it to me, Betty. And when you say, "Will saying �yes' end all this," you're saying, "Okay, I'll say �yes,' Dr. Heisler, and that will shut you up and get you off my back and that's the important thing." So I feel defeated and I feel, okay, let's let go of it. Maybe another day we'll try it again.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well gee whiz, I'm so embarrassed in front of all these people. Why couldn't you have done this when we were alone? (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it happened in group and it involves other people. If you had brought it up in individual � if you had come last Thursday and said anything about it, then we would have gone into it then. You brought up the matter of Mary and you ***.</p>

<p>BETTY: (crying) (blowing nose)</p>

<p>F: It isn't very comfortable feeling involved with this knowing that ***.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I'm sure it isn't. It's a very uncomfortable situation for everyone here including me.</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>I'm feeling that I'm being seen as the terrible person, the ogre. But I feel that I'm not that. And I feel that the suffering Betty is undergoing *** suffering is a part of life for everyone in some way sometimes and if there is an issue on which it has to be met and confronted ***. And I feel that I'm doing this for you, Betty. Even ***. [0:34:56.3]</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>BETTY: This is a terrible experience. It's the first time I've ever REALLY wanted to walk out. It's an almost intolerable thing here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't want you to walk out, Betty.</p>

<p>F: I feel the same way, Dr. Heisler, just as she does. I don't see her as an ogre, but at the same time it doesn't lower my estimation of you, if that's why you're so afraid to stay. I don't know why � you're afraid to suffer in front of people this way. But it's for progress for you.</p>

<p>BETTY: It's very embarrassing.</p>

<p>DICK: What's the embarrassing part about it?</p>

<p>BETTY: I'm embarrassed with the way I'm acting. And it's the way I'm feeling. And I feel so defective.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We are all defective in one way or another. You are defective in that you have a blind spot you're trying to protect.</p>

<p>BETTY: I don't know why this particular area has such feeling and such humiliation for me. But it's like the most unspeakable thing that you would not do in public, I am doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that? [0:38:16.3]</p>

<p>BETTY: All of this emotion. Being so much the victim of my emotions. And � being blind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Betty, this isn't in public. We are all your friends. Even I am your friend.</p>

<p>BETTY: I guess I really am a phony. I mean a real one. A hard-working phony. Just like to think that I'm better than a phony. [0:40:45.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that working on this blind spot of prejudice that you have would help you stop being, stop needing to be a phony.</p>

<p>BETTY: Actually, I suppose so. But I think the way I was feeling was that when I said "worthless," it was like on top of everything else, I'm this too, you know? I guess it's very precious to me. It just � it was � I had good feelings about myself, I suppose. And then to lose them and just (sighs) � just seemed like nothing left. [0:42:21.4]</p>

<p>I know what it is, it's like, I'm a failure in so many ways, and I'm REALLY a failure in this way. I mean, even as a human being, I'm a failure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, in having prejudice?</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have prejudice and it doesn't make me feel that I'm a failure.</p>

<p>BETTY: But it was one of the things I could like about myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you have none.</p>

<p>BETTY: It's something I could approve of.</p>

<p>F: Any of the feelings you have about this, could it be that since you circulate in pretty liberal-minded group and that this particular day and age with race riots and all of that sort of thing, one of the biggest emphasis is on liberalism, lack of race prejudice? And aren't you in some way thinking, what would your friends think who consider you very liberal and without prejudice, what would they think? Not so much of what you think of yourself, but how important this subject is at the present time? And your standing in your circle of friends is, in your opinion, lower at this moment if they were to know of � even you're trying to recognize it. All of them don't know, maybe, but they might find out. And this would make you a failure with this circle of friends? [0:44:20.7]</p>

<p>BETTY: It might be mixed in. But I don't think there's too much of that. I think it's a much more personal thing. I just think it's that there are so few ways that I can approve of myself.</p>

<p>F: And this is one less.</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you are really such a worthless person, with so little to like or approve of in yourself, that you have to pretend something that isn't so, to use it as a basis for self-acceptance and self-approval?</p>

<p>BETTY: (sighs) I guess so. I've tried to think of what I approve of in myself. And the only thing I can think of is my professional abilities. And that's not really me as a person. Then I can think of other things. But my first reaction to me is that there just isn't too much that I can feel good about. [0:46:41.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if that is your feeling toward yourself, then it is important that you know that.</p>

<p>BETTY: I keep thinking I know it, though. (sighs) But every time I really have to deal with it, it surprises me. It's funny, it's like I KNOW some of my value as a person, but that I feel that I have no value.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if you didn't have value to me, I wouldn't get angry at your blind spots, I wouldn't be concerned about what kind of person you are. And I wouldn't be trying to reach you if you didn't have value to me. [0:48:19.2]</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>BETTY: I don't understand why I feel like such a nothing. I mean, I just (sighs) I really guess I just thought that I can't divorce my value from my work. I keep thinking that beyond the work day, that I don't have any value, that I just work and I go home and � and get ready to work again. And yet it isn't that bad really, but it's like I have nothing � like there's no reason for being except to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't come to any valuing of yourself, toward yourself in our work � the kind of work you do and the kind of work I do, we find our value in our value to others and serving others and helping others. But when that is set aside, then you have no value to yourself, of yourself?</p>

<p>BETTY: I don't think so. [0:50:04.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have always experienced my self-worth in terms of caring about the kind of person I am. You experience your self-worth through caring about the kind of person that you � this is the way I experience it.</p>

<p>BETTY: I'm not sure that I really know what that means. I mean I sort of do, but not really.</p>

<p>F: I've been experiencing the same kind of a feeling when I come home, you know, when I'm off work lately and I don't have anybody, anybody else to look forward to seeing. I feel kind of lonely and � like there's just nothing but a void there. And I've been trying to figure out what � you know, what I could do to make my life more enjoyable or you know just being with myself. I don't *** with myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you find your worth in caring about what kind of a person you are.</p>

<p>F: I'm wondering if that can help me, as a single person, learn to enjoy just being alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's just the most important thing of all, you know. I think the most important thing in any aspect of life. [0:52:40.2]</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>f: In order to have that feeling, you have to know yourself pretty well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know, Betty, um Edie, um � this was just sort of coming to me as we've sat here through this experience, of kind of coming back to me that � this is something that I came to really in my early childhood. And I didn't KNOW myself in any sophisticated way. But this was the orientation that I came to as a child, that this was what was important to me. And it really is � it's the base of living, you know, the whole self. And it reduces other problems. It's the thing that is more within your control than anything else in life. This is the thing that probably carried Cardinal (ph) and Betty through the imprisonment. This is the thing that enables to withstand brainwashing. This is the ultimate source of strength. This IS the ultimate strength within a person. [0:54:31.3]</p>

<p>F: That goal seems to get pushed aside in some cases or pushed underneath because I feel like in my life I've � my goal has been to find out � to know what kind of a person somebody ELSE wanted me to be, not what kind of person I want me to be, caring about what kind of person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That can be a real self-betrayal if you get to it, too far in that direction. That's your problem too, isn't it?</p>

<p>F: Mm-hmm. You think *** I can't � I'm like Betty, I know what kind of a � what person � what kind of person people WANT me to be, so I know how to be that all right. But I don't know how to find out what I want to be. I don't even know what I want to eat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>BETTY: I'm still not sure that I really understand this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Do you feel that way?</p>

<p>F: Oh yeah. It's like a blank piece of paper. And you know, going to create something on that piece of paper, but what? [0:56:31.7]</p>

<p>F: you know, and I feel troubled for you to say to me "Forgive yourself." But *** to Betty.</p>

<p>F: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>F: And I feel fragile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let me see, ***. Can you give me an example of when I said this to you ***?</p>

<p>F: No I can't, but I'm thinking about � I can't *** example, but it ties in with that dream I had where I stepped in the glass, in the broken glass, and you said I was punishing myself. *** if you think I punish myself over much and that I should � let up on myself so I can get in a position, like a race horse, I could do the third job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the main thing that comes to me is that I certainly don't see you as being surrounded by walls of defense, you know, that have to be broken through and stormed and gotten past so that you can meet yourself. I just don't see you as having that kind of defense.</p>

<p>F: More like on a raft, drifting around the middle of the Pacific.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>F: And I don't know what day it is or what year it is or which direction I'm going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Mm-hmm. [0:58:01.9]</p>

<p>F: That's more fragile. That's why I have to forgive myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And find that orientation. Which I think this may help you with. I'm glad this came out tonight because I think this should � it would seem to me this would be of value to everyone to have this concern, to think in these terms. But it came to me in connection with you and this blind spot and I really wish you would try to think about it in that context.</p>

<p>BETTY: Yes, I will. I mean that's why I thought you didn't need to keep at me so long. I mean, I thought you could trust me to think about this. But it's like, you didn't. You just had to keep at it here as though I just wouldn't do anything with it when I left here. So that's what made me so mad was when you had � I felt you just had to reduce me to the pulp here, because you didn't have faith that I would do what I could.</p>

<p>F: I felt that she finally did storm the defenses and she'd better do what she could do while she was in there or you'd put them up stronger again and she never would make it back in.</p>

<p>I just feel bad ***.</p>

<p>But another way of saying she didn't trust you.</p>

<p>Yeah, I did feel that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is a reduction in it because the blind spot is unrealistically seeing yourself as really being up there with no prejudice. And I don't think it's very easy for you to come down from that perch. So there is a reduction in it. [1:00:17.7]</p>

<p>BETTY: Did I say "reduce me to a pulp"?</p>

<p>F: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>BETTY: That's what I was thinking. I wanted to be sure that I said it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>BETTY: But a living pulp, because it's really a palpitating pulp.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in your dreaming?</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah. A little baby-like creature. Yeah. But I'm glad there's life there, you see, that's why I put in what I was thinking. I'm thinking about how I always want to run away or hide. And I just thought maybe it takes more energy to run than to stand and slug it out.</p>

<p>F: When she said this was public, I was with her. Until you reminded us this is not public. I was feeling this was public too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It will really be a therapy group when nobody any longer feels that this was a public place.</p>

<p>DICK: Well I'm advancing then because I didn't think it was public at all. I thought, gee, this is just the opposite. This is in the bosom of your family. I was glad you brought that up.</p>

<p>F: I was glad too.</p>

<p>DICK: I guess if not here, where? This was my own reaction.</p>

<p>F: I think some of my feelings were how much better to *** it here than to actually work up to a situation where you might be confronted with certain things actually in public. And when you express embarrassment, I thought how much worse it would be if before a group or in a group other than this group would be if the situation were forced. I began thinking of my own experiences were terrible frightening aspects of it without anyone who would understand.</p>

<p>DICK: I just have one very extraneous feeling that I've got to say to you, *** and that is that with your skirt kind of high on your knee there, it looks provocative and sexy to me, and that's my reaction to it. And I wanted to tell you because you might not wear it next week and then you'll � I couldn't you know, ***</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>DICK: It was a little distracting at several points.</p>

<p>F: *** grandma!</p>

<p>DICK: Well ***.</p>

<p>F: It's lovely.</p>

<p>F: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a very good note. Thank you.</p>

<p>(first session ends)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The second of these two group sessions occurred about four months later with the same participants except Alice, who was absent. Again, the session is about 15 minutes underway. *** paintings which he does as a spontaneous expression of his inner life. And the group communication has so far been centering on the painting. As we open, Mary is speaking.</p>

<p>MARY: How do you feel about this one?</p>

<p>DICK: Oh, all right. Actually this one's kind of � has some ambiguity for me. Well they all do, but this one puzzles me a little bit. [1:04:59.4]</p>

<p>This figure here puzzles me a little. In my mind, I don't know whether it's a male or a female.</p>

<p>MARY: What about the kneeling figure?</p>

<p>DICK: Well, what about it?</p>

<p>MARY: What do you � what is it?</p>

<p>DICK: Well it's a fellow (ph). (long silence)</p>

<p>F: *** bolt of lightning. *** figure is � is kneeling in front of this.</p>

<p>DICK: Well chronologically, the lightning was kind of late in the game. I had the two principal figures in, I think, long before I got the lightning in. No, I don't think so. [1:06:15.1]</p>

<p>F: That lightning just sort of comes out of nowhere. I mean it's not raining. It's not lightning. It, you know, comes down unexpectedly.</p>

<p>DICK: *** middle of last year I did that.</p>

<p>F: That figure standing up reminds me of � a clay thing I carved when I was in junior high school that � it was a woman, it was a girl who had her hands folded and she had a robe like that on.</p>

<p>DICK: Do you still have it?</p>

<p>F: Yeah. Yeah. I kept it. It was like a doll I have that I can never part with.</p>

<p>DICK: Why don't you bring it in, because I just completed a clay figure with a robe too.</p>

<p>F: Oh really?</p>

<p>DICK: Yeah.</p>

<p>F: Oh. Maybe I will. I remember thinking when I finished it that � this peace or this quiet that this figure � I was trying to put quiet and peace into the figure and I was thinking, "This is what I'd like to have. This is what I'd like to achieve inside someday." I don't know if that � your figure means the same thing to you or not. [1:08:19.4]</p>

<p>The crosses. You have crosses in two of them. Are those of religious significance or death?</p>

<p>DICK: I think they're religious. *** death ***. I'm pretty religious in kind of an irreligious way. I mean I drink and smoke and *** and all that, but I'm pretty religious in my makeup.</p>

<p>F: You mean in that you believe in a greater being? Or �</p>

<p>DICK: Well I believe in something out there or in there or wherever. Uh huh. Some unknown that must be fathomed a little bit.</p>

<p>MARY: I was wondering if it was � believing in religion was a guilty significance, that you're going to be punished eventually for your sins.</p>

<p>DICK: Probably.</p>

<p>F: That lightning kind of made me think of that and your man connected with your cross, you know, that's a mighty � that man just packs a punch for me. He seems like such an overpowering thing and you wanted to connect him with your cross. There's a connection there. Overpowering man. [1:10:25.8]</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>DICK: Well, you know, everybody that's seen, that has commented on the powerful figure of the man and everything, and it doesn't � I'd never thought of it that way until someone said so. To me, it's an INTENSE thing maybe, I could use that word. But I never thought of it as particularly powerful in the sense that I think you mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems kind of something almost sinister in that, to me. I don't know.</p>

<p>DICK: To me, he seems very � how do I want to say it � not even brooding � well, maybe sad would be probably better. Sober and sad. I don't see it as sinister. [1:12:17.2]</p>

<p>I'm going to have to bring in a couple of my face � man's faces that �</p>

<p>F: Yeah, I wish you would.</p>

<p>DICK: And you can � I don't know maybe you'll see in all of them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To me it's like he's the personification of MAN and then this woman � humble �</p>

<p>DICK: Kind of beat down?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Woman. (chuckling). Yes. Subservient.</p>

<p>DICK: Well a man is a big giant ego out there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, man, woman. (chuckling) Big strong man. Little weak woman.</p>

<p>DICK: Well what does a woman need with strength?</p>

<p>F: She needs it just as much as man. Not this brute muscular type strength, but strength of personality, strength or integrity. She needs it just as much as a man does. She needs to be able to stand on her own two feet, be right up there with him. [1:14:05.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bring in a *** some more of you. I want to see them.</p>

<p>DICK: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bring in your clay figure too. I'm sort of set on the crosses or hooked on the crosses. (chuckling) You know, I've been sitting here thinking, you know, is it the Christian dogma that you subscribe to, or is it that, you know, Christ died for the sins of man and we are all born sinners so, you know, you have to pay. You � I wonder if the cross meant that you thought YOU had to pay for your sins. Kind of the guilt motif that Mary was talking about. But then you said you didn't � what you believed in God was � or a supreme being, was a greater power, something like that, and you didn't mention being a Christian specifically. But I think it's pretty interesting that you have a cross in two of these pictures.</p>

<p>DICK: Yes, I think that the guilty will be punished for their sins.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think the guilty will be punished? [1:16:10.2]</p>

<p>DICK: When they'll be in Judgment Day. They might not be in Judgment Day, but I think that they �</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When will it be?</p>

<p>DICK: I think probably during the act itself or, I'm not sure. I think there's some kind of cosmic � justice.</p>

<p>F: Retribution.</p>

<p>DICK: I wanted to use that, but then I thought I'd just kind of tuck that one away. Yeah, cosmic retribution.</p>

<p>F: Guilty according to who?</p>

<p>DICK: Well � I'm trying to stay on the feeling level of this thing, you see, I � and when you give me a question like that, it's pretty hard.</p>

<p>F: Well what I was thinking of, you know, judged guilty in a criminal court for instance, or merely burdened with your own guilt feelings that are not necessarily a guilt that you have to bear.</p>

<p>DICK: Well I'm not trying to talk about it intellectually, so whether you have to bear it or not. I think that � there are � you have the picture of your world and there are pitfalls in your world and if you go the direction of the pitfalls, you're going to stumble into them. And you're going to have a hell of a time getting out of them and you're going to suffer and you're going to pay for everything. I don't see it as doing it and then going up to Judgment and then getting a judgment pronounced. I see it as the judgment and the doing it all in one activity. [1:18:09.0]</p>

<p>The judgment is made before you do it, you might say. In my view.</p>

<p>Pretty hard for me to talk about this stuff.</p>

<p>F: Why?</p>

<p>DICK: well � *** the words, you know. I find � I read about Christianity and I � it makes me want to puke. And I read about, let's say Taoism, and Tao. I don't have to think "God," you know, "God" with all the primitive *** all my childhood associations with God. I can think of Tao with the natural flow or order of the universe and the � all the paradoxes surrounding it and *** I can actually get a feel of this as I read. But Christianity is so loaded for me. [1:20:01.8]</p>

<p>God is too personified. He's too personal. He's too � too much my childhood � father.</p>

<p>f: with a ledger, keeping track.</p>

<p>DICK: I don't feel that way. Is that the way you see it in your childhood vision?</p>

<p>F: Well God was not in my life, really, when I was a child.</p>

<p>DICK: Really? Gee, God was in my life overwhelmingly.</p>

<p>F: What was your father like?</p>

<p>DICK: Personality, you mean?</p>

<p>F: Mm-hmm. Meaning, toward you.</p>

<p>DICK: My father was a � was domineering in the sense of wanting to have everything his way. Not domineering in the sense of physically punishing me.</p>

<p>F: How did he get things his way? How did he go about doing that?</p>

<p>DICK: By talking, I guess. Arguing. Talking. He wanted me to think his way. I think that was it. But he wasn't a force in my religious education. He didn't stand in the way, but he's not too religious outwardly.</p>

<p>F: But how did God get into your life so much in your childhood?</p>

<p>DICK: My mother. Sent me to Sunday school every Sunday.</p>

<p>F: Sent you? Or went with you?</p>

<p>DICK: Oh sometimes she'd go, but you know, Sunday school is kids.</p>

<p>F: Did she � she didn't � you don't know if she went to church or �? [1:22:43.9]</p>

<p>DICK: Oh, she was a churchgoer, sort of. I mean she's very � she's quite religious. Whether she went to church or not every Sunday isn't really relevant. She saw that I went to church or to Sunday school every Sunday. Yeah, that's right, in those days Sunday school was first and then church was after. Now it's kind of a combined thing, most of the places. So I had to sit through church too a lot of times. That's right.</p>

<p>BETTY: I think it's quite relevant whether a parent goes to church or not. I think there's a considerable difference.</p>

<p>DICK: Yeah, I know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>BETTY: I'm serious.</p>

<p>DICK: It's okay for the kids, but for them ***</p>

<p>BETTY: That's right. I think you teach kids a lot by sending them off to Sunday school, you know, and then staying home and �</p>

<p>DICK: And what?</p>

<p>BETTY: And just stay home. I was thinking of looking at the Sunday paper.</p>

<p>MARY: Betty, you know, I'm getting angry with you.</p>

<p>BETTY: Why?</p>

<p>MARY: I � you know, I feel like I'm interested in Dick. I'd like to hear about his parents and I feel like you're cutting in *** all the time.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well he didn't think it was relevant whether his mother went to church when she sent him to Sunday school. And I think it was quite relevant.</p>

<p>MARY: Yeah. I'm getting upset, I'm not sure why. But I feel like you're just carrying it off into � you're going into kind of an impersonal thing.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well I didn't intend it impersonally at all because I think kids learn from these. And I think he learned something. I think it was part of his experience. [1:24:22.5]</p>

<p>Gee, it makes me feel I shouldn't say anything!</p>

<p>MARY: No, I just wanted to tell you what I was feeling.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well, you did. And now I'm mad. So you just go ahead and talk to Dick. And I will listen because I don't want to be impersonal.</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>MARY: I was feeling that this is one of the few times that Dick has ever begun to fringe upon talking about his parents, his mother and his father, and his feelings about them and what they were really like. And I just had the feeling that you're, in a way, taking this away. Maybe it's just taking it away from me because I want to hear what they were like. But you were taking it away by saying, talking about how relevant it is and how much kids learn.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well I learned it specifically.</p>

<p>F: Do you still feel like talking about your mother? [1:26:09.8]</p>

<p>DICK: Yes, but I'm wondering why Betty is not expressing the feelings she's having right now.</p>

<p>BETTY: I have. I didn't like what she said. I was offended. That's it.</p>

<p>F: do you feel like she's feeling something other than what she's expressing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was wondering if it made you uncomfortable to hear him talking about his mother.</p>

<p>BETTY: I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because in a way, you're kind of clamming up now by saying you're not going to talk anymore. And you're � in this way, you're not expressing your feelings.</p>

<p>BETTY: No, I said I wasn't going to interrupt the flow anymore. Well that's what I meant.</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>DICK: Because you really got disturbed at that, didn't you? [1:28:16.6]</p>

<p>BETTY: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>BETTY: But I don't want to talk about it. So why don't you go ahead?</p>

<p>DICK: Well I don't feel very comfortable about going ahead the way you feel.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well I'm sorry, then.</p>

<p>DICK: Well you know, it's like � I mean, if somebody's real disturbed as you are now, it � you know, it's hard to go on just like � just like nothing's happened. [1:30:03.5]</p>

<p>BETTY: Well, um � I don't want to be an obstacle, particularly. But I just really don't feel like talking about it. And � and I guess I feel that I shouldn't have become as angry as I did.</p>

<p>DICK: You've got a little piece of tissue paper up here on this left eye, right eye. Yeah, there you go.</p>

<p>BETTY: Anger, you know, to me always seems real childish. So I'm feeling pretty childish. (blows nose)</p>

<p>But I don't know why it made me so mad. And in a way, I don't want to know why. I guess it's sort of � I don't know, was like � I mean, it's ridiculous to go from something so small to something � to a pretty big idea. But somehow I think I experienced that situation a lot in my life. And for someone to say, "You're getting in the way," just � it just hit something. Or "you're in the way." It just hit something very hurtful. [1:32:38.2]</p>

<p>Because I guess I'm afraid that I really am in the way, not where I'm supposed to be, because there's no place like that. Just in the way. It's either that �</p>

<p>F: Did you say that she was in the way or she was cutting him off?</p>

<p>MARY: Well this � I felt that she was cutting off his personal train of thought and she � it made me feel that she was in the way, that she was interrupting and in the way. At least this is the way I'm interpreting your ***.</p>

<p>BETTY: You know, it's like "Get out of there. You don't know what you're doing. You don't do the right things." I guess it hits pretty close to how I feel about myself, which is like a clod. [1:34:30.3]</p>

<p>(long silence)</p>

<p>See I don't �</p>

<p>EDIE: Does the subject of religion or religious background have anything to do with it, Betty? Other than �</p>

<p>BETTY: I don't think so.</p>

<p>EDIE: When you were doing � saying the things that were bothering me, I had a feeling that he was getting into uncomfortable territory and you were trying to get out of it in a way.</p>

<p>DICK: Yeah, my mother couldn't have been sincere unless she went with me every week. Right?</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah. [1:36:09.2]</p>

<p>Well my dad sent us to Catholic church. And my mother, for a while when they were living together, sent us to Catholic church. But she's not Catholic. I mean, it didn't make sense to me. She hated the Catholic church. And my dad insulted her, called her "goddamned Methodist," but she sent us to his church. That was only for about a year and a half. And there's just � I don't understand sending a child to church if you don't go yourself. I don't know � I think children � I think I learned things about church by being sent and not having my parents go, that you know, they're not in the Sunday school curriculum. I resented it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm feeling kind of amazed after all these years we've worked together that I've just learned that your father was Catholic.</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah, I'm a baptized Catholic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's obviously a very significant fact and one that I've never known. It's all kind of amazing to me.</p>

<p>BETTY: I'm ashamed of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BETTY: I don't tell people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>DICK: You expressed quite a bit of � in a few areas where you expressed prejudice, one of the most intense *** is against Catholics.</p>

<p>BETTY: I now it is. I'm violently anti-Catholic. [1:38:11.5]</p>

<p>Actually, religion was a great source of conflict, those few years in the home, when my dad decided it was time to get us to church. At that time, I was around seven. I always felt very left out in religion because my other � my friends had very orthodox faith and it was always like they knew something I didn't know. I mean, they knew God existed. And when I was going to catechism and going to church, I was just � I always felt like a fraud . I didn't know that God existed. I didn't understand the whole thing. And I � I wanted to be like all the other people in the church and all the other kids and grownups that I knew. And so I would DO these things, you know, like kneel and say prayers and all that stuff. And � but I felt like there was just this gigantic secret that I couldn't share because I knew nothing about God. It was like I was too old to � it's like I was too old to believe in God when I was first introduced to the idea. And then I spent years living in a completely Christian culture, and I wasn't Christian. And I sort of wanted to be and kind of thought I was. But actually, I wasn't. And now I can say that I'm not Christian. But this has only been for the last year or two. [1:40:42.7]</p>

<p>DICK: Well you sound like you're anti-Christian, when you say it that way. You don't say "Christian � I'm not Christian" in the same sense you say, "I'm not Mohammedan, I'm not Buddhist." Are you saying it with the same feeling that you'd say, "I'm not Buddhist"?</p>

<p>BETTY: No, I'm probably more hostile toward Christianity than I am toward most any other religion. I know that I'm more uncomfortable with the real true Christian than I am with anyone from most any other religion.</p>

<p>F: What is a real, true Christian?</p>

<p>BETTY: Well �</p>

<p>I'm *** but I don't expect an answer.</p>

<p>BETTY: Yeah. Because I'm thinking of a real true RIGID Christian.</p>

<p>DICK: That reminds me � you remind me a little bit of my *** when I was about 24, 23,22. And I was talking to a psychiatrist one day and he said � started talking about religion. And I said, "I just really don't care anything about it, you know. I have no interest. And this is a lot of hokum," and so forth and so on. And he said, "Well, remember, though, that it's one of the � don't knock it too much because it's one of the � probably the oldest institution. It probably even precedes marriage as an institution in human culture." And I didn't think much of his comment at the time, but I've thought about it a lot recently, in the last 10 years or so. And I think � I think there's a lot to that, you know. It's so universal. It's a universal need to express that we as individuals have to come to terms internally with this whole business, regardless of what your beliefs are. [1:43:15.4]</p>

<p>When you're *** to come to terms with it *** effort.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well � I know that I don't think in this area very much. I still feel that I'm in the � information gathering stage where I � I go to the Unitarian church and I hear what the minister has to say and then I talk with people in other circumstances, I mean other situations and I know that I haven't formed my own � I haven't crystallized certainly what I would call my own religious orientation. I know better what I'm not, or what I don't believe in than what I do believe in.</p>

<p>Actually I thought a very tolerant fact yesterday, and � I was talking with a welfare worker who's very � delightful young girl. And I was telling her about our Unitarian young people's group. And it frankly had not occurred to me that she would be Catholic. And she said that she would � she said she goes to the Catholic church, which I thought was sort of different from saying, "I am Catholic." And so I asked her if she was Catholic, and she said, "Well, yeah." And I said, "Well I guess you wouldn't be interested in this group." But then later on driving home, I was tempted to think, "Gosh, and I thought she was so *** and here she is Catholic." Sort of like, gee, there couldn't possibly be anything good about her now. (chuckling) But then my tolerant thought was, "Well, gee, I hope that it does something for her. I mean, I hope that there is something in there, in that religion, that gives her something that she is needing apparently. I hope it's a source of strength to her." And then I forgot about it. But I was kind of aware at the time that that was much more tolerant than I'm usually able to be about Catholicism. [1:46:15.6]</p>

<p>DICK: Well all you have to do is look at all the Catholics there are in the world and that answers your question about it does something. People don't stick at something that doesn't do something for them. I think Catholicism is imminently successful in doing things for people. I don't know what it is they do, but I have been brought up anti-Catholic. My mother is very anti-Catholic and I've had � I've been very prejudiced against the Catholics for years until say last 10 years or so. There's so much � there's so much nonverbal business that is part of the religion and ideas that *** and ideas that can't be expressed verbally very well. And I think the Catholics somehow capture some of this. I don't know. Another thing that helped me was this book by Jung. Remember that book? See he does a beautiful job of bringing out, I'd say, the good parts of � some of the good parts of Catholicism. And I assume he's not � no, he wasn't Catholic. And all their symbolism and everything that's so meaningful that some of us Protestants, you know, were robbed of that. Some of the earthy experiences too. You know, Catholics feel like they are consuming (ph) the body of Christ when they go to Communion. Well, nobody told me that when I went to Communion. It was all very symbolic and � but imagine, if you do a � if you eat the body of Christ, there's an experience for you. But you'll never have it and neither will I. [1:48:10.8]</p>

<p>I think too that Pope John did an awful lot for Catholicism.</p>

<p>BETTY: Once when I was an adult, a friend of mine gave me the *** as a part of his doctoral study. And I � and one of the questions was, "What is the capital of Italy?" And I couldn't think of Rome. And I know now that that's pretty significant. I thought of Genoa, you know. And I just � I mean, he, you know � well, he thought it was pretty interesting too, because I think he knew that I had this Catholic background. And he gave me a couple of little leads, you know, just to see � well, I think he assumed I would pick up on it. And I never did. *** You know, couldn't think of anything but Genoa, where Columbus was from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>F: ***?</p>

<p>BETTY: Wexler Intelligence.</p>

<p>(inaudible, cross talk)</p>

<p>f: Wexler Intelligence Scale. Yeah. [1:50:07.4]</p>

<p>BETTY: *** way too. I mean, this situation today is a funny way to find out. It makes me cry about my religious problems. I didn't think I had any religious problems. I'm just, you know, anti-. It was a marvelous experience for me to find the Unitarian Church. The first time that I went, and the minister was talking about things that were ideas of mine that I had never verbalized, I had never felt free to verbalize. And gee, you know, here was a whole group of people listening and, it seemed, accepting and agreeing with what he was saying and it was like a real homecoming. I hadn't realized that I ... would ever find people who shared my ideas, my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think a very interesting phenomenon has occurred during this session, and I can sort of describe how I see it, but I would � I think I would rather know, for example, how you see what just happened, Betty.</p>

<p>BETTY: Well, apparently I WAS becoming uncomfortable and I probably WAS depersonalizing, although I THOUGHT I was being personal. I resented Dick's mother sending him to Sunday school and not going to church herself. And that � and I wanted to focus on that. (blows nose) But I guess the lack of comfort that I was having wasn't related, you know, to him. It was � to Dick, it was to me. And apparently this is � a pretty charged area for me. I still don't quite see why, frankly. I guess that's all I see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. I'm kind of interested in going around, I think. How do you see, Dick, what happened?</p>

<p>DICK: Well I think I see that too. And I think I've seen my taking advantage of the situation to get *** of my own. You know, it's pretty nice to have Betty come along with her emotion at that point. And � I just *** a personal thing that's been taking place in me. I think now that this thing has gone on, I am a little pissed off at my old lady for sending me to church to relieve her guilt feelings so she that she feels she's doing the right thing while she stays in bed and lolls around on Sunday while she booted me out to church. And � I feel � I'm sorry I can't respond a little bit better to your question because I feel too that something very interesting and important has been going on here, and is going on. And I can't put my finger on it. I don't know what it is. It's � it's � somehow we have gotten problem center here in the group. [1:54:46.7]</p>

<p>I'd like to think about it. I don't have anything more to say about it right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well this is, again, I think very productive the way both you and Betty have answered the question. Actually, I kind of think that each of you has answered, not the question I asked, but a different question, which was more: How did you experience what happened? I think each of you has told more of how you experienced what happened yourself subjectively rather than giving a more objective description of the total phenomenon, which was what I was trying to get at. But your answers were productive and meaningful. There are different levels and different ways of looking at this. I think it's all very interesting. Would you like to respond?</p>

<p>EDIE: Well I'm just glad that I asked Betty if religion had anything to do with her discomfort because it appeared to me you were hiding so hard behind this feeling, "Oh, I'm just a clod." And you were crying and � to me you were holding this clod up to ward off something that � as you, you know � as Mary said, you were cutting Dick off. It was on religion and then you became the clod and you were holding the clod up to avoid the subject of religion. And it might be that because I felt your discomfort before on the subject of religion or Catholicism in particular, and this has always interested me, to some extent. When I saw you drop that clod and be able to look back and more inwardly to try to find out what this discomfort was, I was glad you could. [1:56:35.4]</p>

<p>And in a way, it rather reminded me, Betty, in a way, maybe not quite as drastic, but the time that we talked about prejudice. And it was so painful to you who is � you, who are so very anti-prejudice to feel that you had prejudice. And in this instance, I think it's been hurtful to you to think that you might possibly have religious feelings. You don't know what they are. But you are very anti- now, and maybe it means more inside ***.</p>

<p>BETTY: Actually, that sort of � in a way, I've had thoughts like, you know, no one would call me a religious person because I don't adhere to the externals of, you know, the great Protestant or Catholic religions. And yet, gee, I think that most of my life is very ethical and as I define religion, you know, which is being of service to others, in my capacity, I try very hard to be of service. And I'm � I'm so oriented, you know, I think I try to be, towards humanitarian things. And yet I don't earn the label "religious." And I think I kind of resented that because I can't go around, you know, telling everybody what a great Baptist I am or what a great Catholic and, you know, wear ashes on my forehead on Ash Wednesday, you know. Then I haven't any title. And in my own quiet little way I keep thinking that I'm more religious than they are. [1:58:28.3]</p>

<p>DICK: I've got to add to my *** comment. I'm sorry to change the subject, but I think that Mary played a very important role in today's discussions. And also *** most important things in that her honesty and her sensitivity in responding to Betty and at the same time � I would say that Mary might have � Mary and perhaps even Edie exerted some leadership inputs today that was kind of constructive here in the group.</p>

<p>F: I think � maybe it was a combination of things, though, because if Betty hadn't been ready or open to be able � because her first immediate reaction was to clam up and to close up completely. But then she opened up again and discussed it a little bit more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd like to give you a little credit there, Mary, that is relevant to one of the aspects of your functioning and I was very much impressed. And that was that despite your very deep, real involvement in Dick and what he was revealing about himself, when Betty's emotions and problems really came to the fore, you were really able to let go of your interest in Dick and you became genuinely interested in and understanding towards Betty. And I was thinking, "Gee, what a great therapist!"</p>

<p>MARY: Gee, that makes me feel good!</p>

<p>DICK: Well, and she was very successful at drawing me out too with her questions, which I usually *** resent. And I didn't find myself resenting them this week for some reason. She was questioning me about the � myself. And I always think somebody's got an axe to grind when they start that, you know? And I didn't have that feeling this time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And I think our time is up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Dash 018, session number 3, session number 3. This is January 27, 1971, client 1923-018, session number 3, January 27, 1971.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:00:30.6) still searching (inaudible at 0:00:34.3) with my roommate. I came to a decision last night not to go see Jay. And I settled down for a nice long night of thinking about other things. And the phone rang, it was a person of the ski club, and he wanted me to pick something up at the lodge, and I had to go anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, after you decided and everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: After I gone through three hours of should I or shouldn't I? You know, makes Jay mad when people say they're going to do something they don't. He doesn't really need me. I never really committed myself. Back and forth, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so - and all that effort was for nothing. 0:01:06.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I finally decided I'm not going to go, you know. See what kind of a reaction I get out of him. If he'll get mad or do anything. He gave me kind of a funny look when I walked - I didn't get there until nine o'clock and I was supposed to be there at eight. But he gave me kind of a funny look but didn't say anything much [almost every night] (ph). Going to play - we're going to either play cards or paint posters (inaudible at 0:01:41.2). That's the reason I had to go because I had to paint a bunch of posters. I was so aggravated, I was so proud of myself because I was being strong. I wasn't going, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of weakly chasing after him and then look - attempt (ph) you made all that effort to be strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, really was. I wanted to tell him, you know. I wanted to tell him I almost wasn't going to come tonight. And I made up my mind that I wasn't, how do you feel about that? But I had to and I thought, that kind of loses something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a waste of time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did I tell you the other day that I've been thinking about quitting my job?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get frustrated (inaudible at 0:02:35.4). Well, I - and I talked the other day to my boss about my (inaudible at 0:02:42.4). And he said he didn't know, he had to look into it. He didn't think there was any money in the university and everything and whether I'd get it or not. And he came in today and I almost said, listen, I need the money. And I almost said - you know, if I can't get it here I'm going to have to look some place else, you know.</p>

<p>I didn't have the guts to say that because my job frustrates me and it bothers me. And the place where (inaudible at 0:03:19.2) I really like my boss. And I hate to, you know - unless I just couldn't see any other way around it to quit. And (inaudible at 0:03:28.8) today and he said he doesn't know if he's going to get any money or not. And then if I have any - you know, any offers for any good jobs or find anything out, you know, I might just casually - there's no rush yet. He's got money until May. But I might just start casually looking around (inaudible at 0:03:46.5). So that was one burden off of my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, like that he doesn't - he isn't trying to keep you, he doesn't need for you to stay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, he said, well - he - if he gets money and I quit, he's going to have to retrain. So, like, what I do isn't hard but there's so many different things that I do. You know, because I've been with him so long and different things that I do, every once in a while I have to do. 0:04:12.0</p>

<p>He'd have to train somebody else. But I don't know, it's just like he said - you know, he said that he didn't want to - you know, he wanted to tell me that if I - to go ahead and start looking because he didn't know what the situation was. And he thought he owed it to me to tell me so I could start looking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so then now, if I find a job I can say, "Well, I took your advice and I was looking around, and I have found something that I'd really like to do." And it took the burden off of me of saying, (inaudible at 0:05:00.4), "I really like working for you, but I hate the work I'm doing."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not exactly like that but I mean, you know, and that was helpful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to let him down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah, it makes me feel good because I still don't know when I'm going to get another job. I've got a problem, though, there's several different things I can do. I'm trying to find - to decide, you know, like, what I'd be happy at. I could get probably down in the hospitals doing blood work or something, some kind of a technician. But they don't pay as well as - they pay about the same thing I'm making now. And that would help because I need, you know, I need more money. And I could get a job. I have two - for three summers I worked in the accounting department of this small company. It was my summer job while I was in college, and so I've got accounting experience.</p>

<p>And I was looking through the newspaper Sunday, and they got all kinds of jobs for people with accounting, some experience, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And accounting pays pretty well. And I always enjoyed accounting when I did it. But I always had the feeling, you know, for three months I enjoyed it then I got bored with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always had the feeling that I wouldn't be able to do it very well. You know, like, maybe if I could take it for three years or something like that. There will be money in science again, I could come back. But I don't know. It's a big step, you know. I don't know what to do, and I'm a procrastinator anyway. 0:06:31.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One of the great procrastinators of our time. But that's one thing that's been bothering me is how was I going to tell him. How was I going to tell him? And I don't have to worry about it anymore now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really have anything to talk about. Do you have any questions or anything that I - you would like (inaudible at 0:07:08.1)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know, I don't usually ask people questions (inaudible at 0:07:14.0), let them talk about what's on their minds.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, take off from there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Because I really have nothing on my mind (inaudible at 0:07:26.5). I'm wondering what's going to happen with Jay tonight. I don't think much of anything. I mean, anyway at all. I told you he had sort of a funny reaction last night when I walked in, kind of a funny look on his face. But I don't know because he had a headache and he had a cold at the same time or what, I don't know. But I was telling him that Jimmy wanted me to do these posters tonight. Jimmy's (inaudible at 0:07:53.9). And he said - and I said I can't and I told him that - I told Jay that I had told Jimmy that I couldn't do it tonight.</p>

<p>And Jay looked at me with his eyes (inaudible at 0:08:03.6) and he says, "You certainly cannot." And I thought, "Wow, he really cares whether I do something like that or not," you know. And I thought, "Oh, that's a good reaction."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, he made a fuss.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and later on - I'm trying hard to decide whether it's - see, I told you he wants his boyfriend, Kyle, to start going out with nicer girls. Now, I don't know what he says, (inaudible at 0:08:28.9) nice girl and whatever is. But he doesn't particularly like the brand of women that his boyfriend goes out with. And this is - last week they were supposed to go out on Wednesday night. And Meg's car broke down out in the suburbs so she couldn't go. The two times before that she couldn't make it, you know, two times before that we tried to set up dates, you know.</p>

<p>And so I don't know if he's so anxious about tonight going off because, you know, he wants to see me or not and he's counting on it, or he's just - doesn't want tonight to fall through because so many other nights have fallen through, you know. So I was thinking about that afterwards because again, it's - I read - I might be reading too much into it or I should just accept it like it is, you know, without worrying about it. Because he said - when we said goodbye last night, he just said - he said, "Well, I'll see you tomorrow night." No enthusiasm, nothing, you know. And I thought - but he doesn't usually say - have any enthusiasm. 0:09:29.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's just like I guess I'd [like to see him enthusiasm] (ph). And so then, I know - so many uncertainties, you know, because he won't - you know, did he make that comment last night because just didn't want it to fall through with Kyle again, or because he was really counting on Wednesday night, you know. I wish I could quit worrying about such things and just accept it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like my mother, I haven't got things to worry about, I make up things to worry about. As long as I've got something to worry about I'm happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm sorry if I don't seem quite with it, something happened just before that was - is preoccupying me and, you know, I'm not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry (inaudible at 0:10:18.1). I had a question about this psychotherapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I just - you know, I just like coming and I talk to you, and tell you, like, what's on my mind and what I think about things so you - king of an idea who I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, or like, I try and help you work on whatever seems important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I was just wondering because I just sit here and talk, and I don't get anywhere. Well, I - well, with my not liking myself, which is the only what I know how to put it. It may not be very clear to you, but I understand, but I can't put it into words somebody else can understand. But I was telling you this, I think the first time that I'm not sure why I don't like myself and with what happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it does trace back, as far as I can remember, and I think probably the reason I don't like myself is the - is, like, I always felt like I was on the outside. And I think maybe the reason I don't like myself because I've always had the feeling other people didn't like me, so why should I like me either?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking about that the other night. And so that's probably the reason I don't like myself. And then now, if somebody likes something about me, I don't know why I don't like it, except it's just I'm so used to not liking myself that I figure they're lying to me or something, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like now, when someone says something, like, you're so much in the habit of - it just doesn't fit with everything else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. And - but I still don't know how to - what I'm really searching for...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is some way to combat this, to, you know, like, be able to take pride in one or two things about myself, you know. And I told you I like my hair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've got my - it doesn't look too good right now. That's something I know I have healthy hair, and it's nice (inaudible at 0:12:39.6) the right color. And I just cut a little bit of it off, but it's a good length and everything. But it never looks just right when I want it to, you know, which is frustrating. 0:12:47.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm probably expecting too much of it. But I really can't take that much pride in it because it never looks the way I want it to. I think it would - you know, I just - I don't know how I'm going to go about finding something, you know, or combating this dislike of (inaudible at 0:13:07.8). I just - I can't take really any pride in anything. And I don't even - well, like, I made pretty good grades in college. I made pretty good grades in high school, but I - they're not that good. But I graduated from college with a - I think a 33 overall, and, like, a 36 in chemistry in my major field (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not even that proud of that because, you know, most of the people that I knew did better, you know, because I ran around - because all the people that I knew were, like, I was in a biology honor society. And so, you know, half the people in the honor society, they were doing better than I was, you know, because they were making four points and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, so there was nothing special about you there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, now my...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:13:51.1) mediocre in the group - you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm just average in the group I run with. Now, on the overall, I'm above average, way above average, but I always tended to, like, be in honorary groups like that with people who were - where I was a medium.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I never really got that excited about my grades. And I've always had people, you know, think that - my brother got - went through most of his life thinking that I was a genius or something. And he thought I graduated from college with a four point, something like that. He thinks I'm just the brain. And I had to shoot him down the other day, I told him what kind of grade point, and he (inaudible at 0:14:31.9), "I thought you had a greater point than that."</p>

<p>My mom's always talked about my grades. And she's always been very proud of my grades. And people - well, getting grades is always easy for me in college. It was always very easy for me. The knowledge didn't go along with it, though. I mean, I can't memorize anything, you know. The only way I can remember something, like, you know, "Pledge Allegiance to the Flag," which we used to sing and I've forgotten by now, just repeatedly doing it and doing it and doing it over a long period of time, and then I still forget parts of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the stuff you learned doesn't stay with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, but I don't memorize the stuff that I know. I go in to take a test, I'll sit down and I'll read the text. And then go over the high points again, and walk in, know the premise, the thesis - I mean, the premise of what I'm working with, know the basic functions. I know the material but I don't retain it, you know. So I could go in and somebody could study about three - my roommate and I used to be in the same major, and she'd study for hours and hours and hours. And I would study, you know, about maybe one/third of the time she's studying, I'd go in and I'd get an A and she'd get a B or a C. Now, she probably remembers most of the stuff she learned. But I don't remember any of it, you know. But people go on the fact that I made good grades.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:15:49.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so I should know all this stuff but I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and, like, when you don't remember, it's like, well, it doesn't - your good grade doesn't have anything to do with you because you're not the same person who got the good grade. You don't know what you got the good grade for now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it's not like - the only thing that I fall back on is the fact that I did - when I took the test, it wasn't memorized, I knew it. I have just since forgotten it. I can learn it again, you know. But it doesn't do me any good now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so, I can't even take - what I was leading to is I can't really take any pleasure in my grades or anything like that because I never considered them anything special. Because a) I was in the group that had the higher grades, and b) I know that I don't retain any of it so it doesn't mean anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I retain some of it. This job bothers me too because things that I know I used to know how to do, I've forgotten because I'm just using everything. And my boss is such a wiz with calculations, and I'm just totally intimidated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that sort of brings you down a little in your own estimation too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and I've done some searching to try to find something I can really be proud of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so, like, I have never really - I can't really count anything, you know. And I used to think, you know, all I got to do is, like, have somebody, like, have a man, you know, that will really, really like me and just though I was great, you know. And I thought, "Wow, if he thinks I'm great, you know, I must be great." And I get my confidence from him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:17:32.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that doesn't work either because, well, the clich� that my roommate uses is nobody's going to like somebody that doesn't like themselves. And nobody's going to have confidence in somebody that doesn't have confidence in themselves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And (inaudible at 0:17:46.7), I can't wait for somebody else to really like me and then decide that they like me. I like me because they do or something like that, that doesn't work. Because I find myself, you know - like, I told you about the movies that they took of the ski trip and how horrible I looked in the movies. And instead of thinking that's just a bad movie, you know, I started thinking, "Now why does Jay like me?" Because if I was that ugly in the movies, I must be that ugly all the time, and so that just blew my theory now that I stop to think about. Because I was thinking - I wasn't thinking those must be wrong because Jay likes me. I was thinking, "Now why does Jay like me because those pictures have to be right."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So, like...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It can come from somebody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it can't, it's got to come from me. And when this is, you know - this is basically where I came to the counseling services for some counseling and guidance. Because I've, like, taken it as far as I can by myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know where to go from here. Because I don't if there's any answer. I mean, you can't just walk up and say, "Well, this is nice about you and this is nice about you. " Believe me and accept it because that won't work either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the big thing you've been working on. And you've really tried, now - you know, now what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now where do I go from here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know. Where will I go from here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my, well, I really can't tell you, you know, like anything specific, like your idea about, well, look into yourself and find the things that you can take pride in. I can't really tell you something like that. 0:19:47.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I - I'm probably putting you on the spot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean, like, I just - I don't want specific, you know, like I say, I'm not asking you to sit here and tell me, "Well, you know, you have this and this and this, be proud of it."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, like, maybe a different approach that I could take.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm thinking by myself or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Knowing - of the lady - one of the girls I work with, she's 38 years old but she doesn't look like she's any older than 27. I just can't think of her, you know, sitting with one of the girls. But she was saying that, you know, she never really had this feeling I have of being alone or anything like that. She had, like - she was just, you know, enjoyed doing whatever she was doing, you know, the joy of being alive or something, which I've never had. That I've known except maybe when I was little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Were little. And she said to me, if I really find something I really enjoy doing, it might help. But I don't know, I can't think of anything I really enjoy doing at a long term.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, except I really enjoy sitting around feeling sorry for myself I think. Sometimes I wonder. I don't really do that much feeling sorry for myself, though. Well, I just - I'm mad at myself in thinking, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of an impatience?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I've always had the feeling, you know, that I'm basically intelligent human being, I ought to be able to work this out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I - like I said, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, how come you're still stuck in it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You ought to have gotten out of it by this time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I figured if I'm not out of it by this time I need some help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm not going to make it on my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Maybe one thing we could do here is, like, there's a kind of exercise people do sometimes. Like, pretend that there are two parts of you, one that sort of represents the way you don't like yourself, sort of standing off looking at you. And, like, pretend that this part is a person looking at the rest of you, and sort of talking as if you were the part of you that doesn't like you, sort of, like, acting it out like - almost like in a play or something. 0:22:34.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you lost me. Separate myself, like, the things that I don't like about myself I push off into another body over here on the side?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, the...</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my mind?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, you're right about pushing off into another body in your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I was suggesting was the things that - not the things that you don't like about yourself, but the part of you that doesn't like you, like, pushing that off and trying to become - pretend you're speaking for that part looking at you, looking at all of you, looking at all the rest of you except the part that looks at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The part of me that doesn't like me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is separated?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's voicing its thoughts?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, the way it feels about you and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Think about that one. As far as I know, the part of me that doesn't like me is in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying it is separate from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm saying...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, in my mind, I mean, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see, like you're replacing it just now as you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was replacing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, the part of me that doesn't like me is all in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The part of me that doesn't like me is all in my mind. But I think the reason - again, I think I've said this before, I know I have. The reason that I don't like myself - I mean, the reason I get really upset is because of the impressions that I get from other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, these are sensa - census coming in, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess I'm more sensitive to them, that I might even see them when they don't exist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because all of my life I've gotten more and more sensitive to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thinking, like, maybe you really sort of blow up out of proportion the ways other people don't like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but, like, again, I said it could be because it always happens when I'm with a group of people, you know. And remember, larger than just me and somebody else, you know, two people besides myself or more. I don't know if it's because, like I say, I don't have anything important to say or maybe I'm unconsciously interrupting somebody else, and they don't want to be interrupted or I don't know.</p>

<p>Like I say, you know, it's just this feeling of a fifth wheel and I - I've had people tell me that I just don't bubble, you know. Well, I can't bubble. You know, my mother says, "Just relax and have a good time." Well, I think I'm relaxing I just - you know, just let yourself go, be yourself, can't do that either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I try, I know I'm failing because I know it's just not (inaudible at 0:26:34.0). But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can - it's like you can see in other people's reactions to you that it's not working, or do you mean they're - like, you can see that you're not relaxing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I can tell that it's just not working. I'm - it's like maybe I'm thinking about making an attempt, but I'm not really making it, you know, like, maybe I just don't know where to start or how to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, how to just relax and loosen up, you know. One time Alicia was telling me, "Just relax and loosen up," you know, so I thought - well, I tried it for a while and it didn't work. So I thought, "Well, I know of one good way to relax and loosen up." So I got bombed and I don't do that very often. And I was still uptight, you know. I knew I was bombed, and I knew I was talking extra loud and being silly, and laughing and stuff like that. But I still was - my always uptight. I wasn't - it didn't help, should have known it wouldn't. But I was willing to try anything at that time. I was really depressed. 0:27:38.7</p>

<p>But it's - I think the thing that bothers me is the fact that I feel like I'm transparent. I feel like, you know, can be two people in a room and I was one of them, the other person wouldn't know I was there. It's the same thing as being alone in a crowd.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like, well, I go up to the three and be waiting for Alicia who's always late. I'd be sitting there and there would be people around me, you know, and I don't know if it's because an emanations - I mean, you know, waves that I give off or a sense somebody has about looking at me, if I look said, if I look depressed or I look dull or what I look, they won't even talk to me. People won't talk to me and it's really - you know, except maybe somebody will walk by who knows me and say hi, and then keep walking or something like that, you know.</p>

<p>And it's, like, you know, I sit there now, everybody's talking to everybody else. And there'd be some really ugly girls in there just having guys just flock around them. Maybe I'm more guy oriented than I should be. But I don't know, I just - I sit there, I sit there for an hour waiting for Alicia, nobody ever talks to me. I don't know, like, if I look - I sit there and I think to myself, this is when I do a lot of thinking I think, (inaudible at 0:29:11.9) talking to you. Well, you're probably sitting here looking like a real sad sack, and nobody wants to hear somebody else's problems, you know. They don't need to talk to somebody sad. They're in here to have a good time, not to be sad, you know.</p>

<p>So I try to (inaudible at 0:29:23.8) - so I do (inaudible at 0:29:25.0) things, like, I sit there and I smile at myself, you know, the dumb smile face. And I thought, "So that's going to look really dumb."</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how to bubble myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how to enjoy myself, you know. If I was just enjoying sitting there all by myself, somebody would say, "Well, she's having a good time just sitting there all by herself, join her and see why she's having such a good time about," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know how to enjoy my own company.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's a - I don't know, that's not - I don't know how - I don't think anybody can tell you how to enjoy your own company. I wouldn't know how to go about developing something like that. But I really think that would solve a lot of my problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could enjoy yourself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I could just enjoy myself...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And be happy by yourself that people would be attracted to you because you felt kind of happy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's kind of (inaudible at 0:30:20.5), you know. Or it's kind of like - you know, as it is now I'm just, like, trying too hard and people can tell or something like that. The idea that I've decided - if I liked myself, if I could just enjoy my own company, had a good time by myself, I wouldn't care whether, you know, I was with anybody else or not. I could have a good time by myself, just enjoying my own company wherever I was, you know. 0:31:04.8</p>

<p>And, excuse me, you know, like, (inaudible at 0:31:11.3) if I enjoy my own company, other people will enjoy my company too, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of, just like, you know, I still (inaudible at 0:31:20.4) all the time I ever hear from my friends is, like, when they need help, you know. When they want someone to talk to, they need help, you know. That's why I said, when Alicia called me last Saturday night, I figured she probably wanted to talk about something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:31:32.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: She wanted to talk about a problem or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're only interested if you can do something for them. They're not interested in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, they're - I (inaudible at 0:31:46.7) that feeling. I have the feeling that they - it's not that I can - they're interested in me when I can do something for them. That's not the feeling I have. It's not that kind of a negative attitude. I can do something for them, I can help them. But they're interested in me - they come to me because they have faith in the fact that I can help them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, so that's part of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so I - it's not like they, you know, they only want me around when I can help them. And they don't care - they don't mind if I'm around at other times. And they know they can count on me, and they trust my judgment. So I don't feel like I'm being used. I think it's like, you know, it's like an honor instead of an abuse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never - when people come to me with their problems, I've never felt bad about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I - a pride point, you know. Something else Jay said once. It's a pride point that people trust my judgment and all kinds of different - you know, they just ask my advice for different things. I've always enjoyed this. But I've always had people tell me I was a little (inaudible at 0:32:53.5), you know, and all this horse sense, common sense, you know. Sometimes that bothered me, you know. But I think one thing that Jay said really made me - you know, I don't know how - he said, "You're," he called me - was it a ding-a-ling or a dizzy dame or something like that.</p>

<p>Oh, I know, I said something about - oh, I coughed and I coughed real hard and it made me a little bit dizzy, you know, and he said, "What's the matter?" I said, "I'm just a little bit dizzy." And he said, "You're always dizzy." And I thought - I (inaudible at 0:33:27.5), I said, "Thank you." And he thought maybe - I don't know whether - he looked at me kind of - that (inaudible at 0:33:32.2), like, you know, he thought I was giving him a smart aleck answer back, you know, but I really appreciated that. The first time anybody ever told me I was dizzy in my life, you know. 0:33:39.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess dizzy sounded like bubbling or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, dizzy sounded like to me, someone says you're dizzy, a dizzy dame is one with not too much horse sense, common sense or any other kind of sense, you know. Bubbling goes with it, but it's like completely out of the character of being, you know - well, common sense and calm at all times and things like this, you know. Dizzy all the time, you know, wow. I am a little dizzier when I'm around him than I usually am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes, when I first met him I was. I was really - oh, I didn't believe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you don't want to be sober and level headed and nonsensical all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not all the time, no, you know, I just - just what - you know, just relax, enjoy life, you know, don't have to worry about it or anything. But I don't sit there and tell myself, now, relax, just forget about it, think about something pleasant, you know. But that's not really enjoying myself, sitting by (inaudible at 0:34:49.1) pleasant...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sitting there trying to enjoy yourself, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sitting there thinking about something pleasant isn't enjoying myself. And I don't know how to go about enjoying myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, what I try to do is sort of sit there, you know, I'm by myself. But I (inaudible at 0:35:03.7) sit there and think about something pleasant, so I might have a pleasant expression on my face and nothing else. And sort of sitting there and telling...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Smile or something. Again, I have decided that this is what I need to do, but have no idea about how to go about doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what you need to do is to be able to enjoy yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that would help (inaudible at 0:35:33.4) immensely. It's all tied together, if I enjoyed myself I'd like myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:35:38.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. You need to change your attitude toward yourself, but, like, that's easy to say and you don't know how - like, you've got lots of energy, but - so how do you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. And what you suggested about separating yourself, I'm not really sure that I could do that. I don't know, I'd have to think about it some more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean that you should - I don't think you understood me. I didn't mean that you should separate yourself, you know, as what you do in life is you make this separation, see, and you just often...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you were saying that I should, like, take analyzing myself from the point of view of the person that - the part of me that doesn't like me. Isn't that what you were saying? Try to analyze myself and look myself from the part of me that doesn't like me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of. I wasn't, you know - I was suggesting that that was like a thing we could do here, and it's not a matter of analyzing yourself so much as getting into that frame of mind, and those kind of feelings about yourself. And, like, expressing them separately, like not - not like - so much like you'd find out anything new.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I made it all...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not misunderstanding because the idea I got was that, the part of me that doesn't like me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You, like - the idea is just like - it's like a game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To separate, you know, like, in your mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yourself into two people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You got - in one person you got an (inaudible at 0:37:28.6). I don't know if it's just a speech or a dialogue going on, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, like a dialogue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A dialogue going on between the part of you that doesn't like you and the rest of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:37:40.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm not sure I understand how it would help because I have the feeling that, you know - like, first of all, the part of me that doesn't like me is in my mind because that's where everything is. But, like, I'm looking at myself all the time from this aspect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have that feeling from what you said that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I (inaudible at 0:38:06.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes it helps to bring it out even more, and sometimes it helps to, like, carry on the other half of a dialogue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean, defend myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, or whatever happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean like - I don't know, I'm still not sure what it is. Example would be sort of defending myself, you know, for everything that I can think of that I don't like about myself, to try to think of something that counteractive that's good?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or a defense against the way (inaudible at 0:39:00.8)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm not even saying defend yourself. I don't think I can explain it to you. I think I just have to let you to try it and sort of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try just starting out from the part of you that doesn't like yourself and, you know, start to talk like you are looking at yourself and judging yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean just sit here and express feelings of the part of me that doesn't like about me has?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the feelings that the part of me has that doesn't like me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The part of me that doesn't like me thinks that I'm definitely overweight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, try, like, you know - she's definitely overweight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, she's overweight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or maybe better - you know, you're really overweight like you were talking to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all right. You're overweight - I know there's things (inaudible at 0:40:33.1) myself besides - sometimes I think I've got an ugly face and sometimes I think it's not bad. The part of me that doesn't like me thinks I'm ugly. You're overweight, you're ugly, a tendency to be loud.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A real loud mouth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I have a real loud mouth. An awful lot you don't say very much (inaudible at 0:41:21.3) at one time. I have a tendency to be pushy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a tendency to be pushy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, you have a tendency to be pushy. I have a tendency to be chicken and - chicken is not a good word. You have a tendency to be intimidated by things that are difficult. And a fear of failing, therefore, you won't try.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just sort of fade away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is one of the problems you have with your diets. You have a tendency to be (inaudible at 0:42:29.3). I have a tendency to interrupt people when they're talking. You have a very gross tendency towards impatience, very impatient, messy, (inaudible at 0:43:22.8) messy, messy, messy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A real slob.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Actually, it's not so much messy as the fact that you're very lazy. One of the world's great procrastinators, procrastination, your procrastination could stem from the fact that you're partly lazy, partly again, afraid of failing. (Inaudible at 0:44:37.1), surely can think of lots of other things to say about myself. 0:44:42.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any feelings towards the girl you're talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do I have any feelings toward...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, talking to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not really, nothing - right now, I'm not feeling - I'm just not - no - no strong feelings one way or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, kind of neutral and sort of (inaudible at 0:45:26.8) looking and trying to see clearly after laying it all out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I - you know, sort of telling truths.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really ought to be able to think of something more concrete (inaudible at 0:45:48.1). I feel like I ought to be able to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're stuck, maybe instead you might want to switch roles and, like, now that she just said all that about (inaudible at 0:46:11.8) you, how do you feel carrying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, all the things I could think of I said, were things that I had developed, traits that I developed over the years as defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure - I'm not - the loud and boisterous part and talking a lot have all been things I've developed not necessarily have over developed. I was born with the gift of gab. But they are semi defense mechanisms for trying to keep (inaudible at 0:47:05.4) attention. Once I get it, trying to sound off loud and clear so people know I'm around, part of them are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I try just sitting around with my mouth shut at different times because I realize that I do these things. I guess I'd have to sit around a lot longer than I have to get results. But I'd be too impatient to do that. And (inaudible at 0:47:38.6) again, all right, I got the feeling when I was saying all these things about myself that I really wasn't that bad. I mean, nothing extraordinary bad, of course, that's just defending my honor, myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So just - you're not that boisterous, you know, it's not that extreme.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm not that bad. I'm not half as bad as I used to be. I used to be really bad (inaudible at 0:48:18.2). I'm also not as sensitive as I used to be anymore I don't think. I felt sensitive last night, but I'm sensitive to a lot of things that I didn't used to be sensitive to or getting (inaudible at 0:48:32.1). But I told you this the other day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, starting to cry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, being very sensitive to things that never would have bothered me before or would have aroused only anger. I was thinking that - as I was thinking of all these things about me that I don't like or things about her that I don't like, not really that bad. Like, I feel like I ought to be able to think of something more concrete than that. Something more - something really horrible (inaudible at 0:49:16.4). Something that's really bothered me or something, all these little things, you know, the things that I have decided that bother people about me. 0:49:30.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It goes back to this acceptance thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except for being lazy. And then (inaudible at 0:49:46.0) nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's something you don't like when you're around other people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. Because I never procrastinate when it has something to do with anybody else, like work or something like that. Just - I procrastinate on things that I myself wanted to do for myself. I just - you know, (inaudible at 0:50:12.0) why (inaudible at 0:50:13.6) going to do. (Inaudible at 0:50:18.5). These are kind of the excuses I feed myself. But it's not anybody else oriented, just myself oriented. But those things that I mentioned aren't really that bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:50:42.4) of something a little more concrete. Except - well, they aren't that bad, but like I said, they are what I have decided is the stumbling block between me and other people. Other people and me, myself and other people. 0:51:04.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like when you put your finger on - or they don't add up to - as bad as you feel about yourself or something, or as bad as you think other people feel about yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it doesn't add up to the feeling that I'm getting from other people. Like (inaudible at 0:51:25.5) missing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it seems like they're always turning their backs to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't see, you know - there are some people who are bothered by people who are really loud, I'm not that loud. There are other traits that I have that everybody in the world isn't going to like, but I should have a larger majority of people that do. So there's something I'm missing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something I just don't see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is something you're doing or not doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes you not get a response from other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't show that much emotion. I don't really get that excited about anything, you know. Someone tells me their problems, oh, you know - someone brings exciting news, you know, and I'll smile and that's nice and I think it's nice, but, you know, I can't just (inaudible at 0:52:22.8), you know. If I would do something like that, they'd know it was fake, at least I have the feeling they'd know it was fake.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because it's - you know, what I - they could be something because maybe the reason I don't get any satisfaction other people because they just don't get any satisfaction out of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, if you were more emotional. If you had more - or...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I either had more feelings or more reactions, more feelings or if I displayed more, you know. But there are people who are - don't convey that much emotion who are perfectly accepted. So that - again, that could be part of it, but I doubt it's all of it. But there could be something I'm missing and I just - but I don't have emotions like that. What I could try - trying to get a little more excited about something, you know. But again, that's relaxing, you know, just relax and enjoy it. That could be another thing. (Inaudible at 0:53:37.9), you know, the part of me that doesn't like me could see. 0:53:41.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're not relaxed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This - you're kind of a dud emotion wise or excitement wise, just a party pooper type dud, type, you know, don't really get excited about other things that people get excited about, can't really get with the program.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things happen and you don't respond?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I respond. I have my own responses. Well, there are things that some people would respond to that I don't respond to, you know. That I just - some people enjoy that I just don't enjoy. Some things that people really think are great that I don't think are that great, you know. And I probably - not so much verbally as any other way, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Make no bones about imparting to these people that I don't agree with them at all. I may not say something, but they can tell, you know, like, the look on my face. My (inaudible at 0:55:01.2) I let out a big sigh or, you know, this could be part of it. They - one thing someone told me who doesn't have as much education as I have, told me that people are intimidated by the fact that I went to college.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is not - which may be true with this one set of people, that they don't want to get into a discussion with me because they think I'm going to be smarter than they are. Just most of the time not true, but this doesn't apply in a college situation, which is what I was in, which I was also frustrated in. So I don't put that much stock in it. 0:55:51.9</p>

<p>I do know if I ever would ask some of the people that I do not - probably because I don't bubble, I don't show that much enthusiasm, I don't have that many emotions or a combination of all these things. I don't make any kind of a permanent, lasting impression on anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never have. This is the reason I'm going to be alone in a crowd. This is the reason why I - as long as everybody else is talking to people listen to me when somebody else is talking. This could be part of it. The other part of it I think is the fact that maybe I talk and don't say anything just so I can have attention or something. But if I ask somebody what they think about me, you know, a lot of people know who I am. But I do not arouse in anybody any kind of a strong emotion one way or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't. I mean, this is - my personality or anything, I do not arouse any strong emotions in most - in people in general. I don't have any (inaudible at 0:57:21.2). I don't think there's probably anybody who really hates me because I had done anything really mean to anybody in my life on purpose. 0:57:27.6</p>

<p>And if you ask somebody, you know what, if someone were to ask you, do you know Susan Miller or what do you think of her? I've asked a couple of people this just - and I've had a couple of my friends ask (inaudible at 0:57:40.1) this, just testing, Susan Miller, she's a nice kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have any strong emotions about her one way or the other? She's a nice kid, you know, what can I say? What more can I say, she's a nice kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's a good sport.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But no one feels like - you know, there's really something about Susan.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, wow, I don't quite know what (inaudible at 0:58:03.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's just - I - you know, I don't even arouse hate in anybody, which (inaudible at 0:58:13.1) bad, you know, I mean, I don't arouse any strong feelings in anybody, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except my mother and my mother's (inaudible at 0:58:18.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that must be part of, like, why you feel like they don't think you're there or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why? Again, I don't know why. It's an attitude or a personality or something like that. But - and it's something people can tell about people just by looking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't tell these things. I have to get to know somebody before I decide whether I like them or I don't. But Alicia kind of bubbles, and she doesn't even have to do anything and people, you know - what do you think about Alicia? "Wow, Alicia's really neat," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That might...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Alicia's really neat."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, they might not have any other comment, you know, about her. You know, they wouldn't say she's a really deep person, she's really intelligent, but they'll say, "She's really neat," you know, "She's fun."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whereas, their comment (inaudible at 0:59:19.9) be, "Susan, do you like Susan Miller?" "Yeah, I like her, she's a real nice kid."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you know - "Would you invite her to a party?" "Sure, I'd invite her to a party." And I'm thinking to myself - thinking to themselves if I thought of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's like, nobody minds having me around. I don't bother anybody. I don't arouse any strong emotions in anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But nobody really wants you around either and that hurts or frustrates or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if they don't - you know, I prefer to look at it as not the fact that they don't want me around, as if they just don't care one way or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. No one sort of actively cares whether you're around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, if I'm there, fine, if I'm not there, fine, you know, it's no loss one way or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not a detriment to the part if I'm missing or if I'm there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They wouldn't miss you if you were gone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, (inaudible at 1:00:19.9) "Do you like Susan Miller?" "Yeah, she's a nice kid." (Inaudible at 1:00:24.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be nice to be a big deal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. All this goes back to maybe a lifestyle - approach to life, which is again, you know, if I enjoyed myself, other people could enjoy me more. See that I'm basically underneath really cool or something like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But again, I'm back to the problem - what we just did that day. I said to her, "Well, it's not really that bad, you know." I can't really see anything - if somebody, you know, kept their mouth - you know, if I met somebody like that, as long as she kept her mouth under control, I could get along with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, me personally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Myself, just meeting somebody else like that, I wouldn't be particularly offended by it unless she's got, like, too big a mouth or something or was untrustworthy or something like that. But again, I get along with just about everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'd like...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get along with yourself all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get along with me all right. I don't know, if I could get along with me looking at it that way, I would be able to get along with me by myself. But a good theory, proof is in the pudding. I don't know if that helped or not, except maybe, you know, not really that bad. But I don't know - don't know how to go about letting the rest of the world know that they've all been wrong, and I'm really not just a nice kid, I'm a lot of fun. I'm not just a nice kid, I'm neat. 1:02:20.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would be to their benefit to get to know me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have something to offer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. Not that they'll benefit monetarily wise or advice wise, but just character building person wise, yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Guess I should (inaudible at 1:02:52.6). I'm going to be back in town Monday - sorry, Tuesday the 9th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tuesday the 9th, yeah, in the morning all right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, is that good, the 9th?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 1:03:21.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Certainly isn't working.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could you take it apart?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 1:03:30.0). And again, like (inaudible at 1:04:06.3) secretary hasn't come (inaudible at 1:04:07.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The people that live there now are people that you sort of [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:04), but you know what I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I picked them out because four of them were [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:08) before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So really it does feel like a personal rejection because these are people that you chose to be your roommates and they chose you and now it feels like they're un-choosing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. And I know for sure that I made this super-explicit. I was like, "Look, this is going to be a community where we're friends and this is not just a regular house. This is the number one thing that I talked about when I was looking for roommates. It wasn't a side thing. That was the main thing, specifically Tim. Tim is absent from the house. He is literally never home. I haven't seen him in three months. He's home maybe once every two weeks to pick up rent checks. [00:01:02] Tim is the only one that I didn't know before they moved into the house, and so with him I made it super-explicit when we talked about it. When I showed him the house I told him all of this and how this was the most important thing to me. This whole time, even when he was living there, he's always been like, "Oh, yeah. I picked this house because it was super cheap to live in." I was like, "But that's not the only reason." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't want that to be his only reason.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So I kind of had this inkling. But now that he's never home it's so clear to me that that's the only reason that he was ever living there and that's really shitty. It makes me really angry because it's not what I wanted. I'm just really frustrated with everything. It's just really shitty. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it didn't turn out how you hoped.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's fine that people are moving in with other people, but you still have to come home. [00:02:01] Chores haven't been done in a month. I stopped doing my chores. I was like, "Well if nobody else is going to do them, I'm not going to do my own. That's just not fair because then I'm cleaning up for four weeks' worth of other people not doing their chores. That's not constructive either, right? But still. I keep sending these e-mails like, "People, you need to come home and do chores and you need to take care of the trash." I'm the only one sending these e-mails out. Nobody else thinks this is an issue and since I'm the only one that's home, I think I'm painting the house in this negative energy because I'm the only one that's after people. I hate being this person. I hated it when I was an RA. That's the worst part of being an RA. I hate it now, but I still think it's important. We agreed to live in this community. It's not unreasonable for me to expect people to do their part. I don't know. So anyway, I'm really frustrated. [00:03:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then at work it's similar. The last assignment I had - I never had any assignments, basically. I have maybe one assignment which is for one or two days every two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're running through them really fast?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But also they're totally the worst assignments ever. They're mostly reception, so like this last one I answered five phone calls and I distributed mail in nine hours and I was like, "Oh, my God." I know this is a really shitty attitude to have, but I was like, "I'm smarter than this." I've never felt that before, actually, (chuckles) because I'm always like, "I'm not qualified to be here. It was a mistake they let me in," and all this stuff; but I was really frustrated that I can answer more than five phone calls a day. Do you know what I mean? I can do more than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you can and you want to. You want to feel productive. [00:03:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't feel productive enough for that amount of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's also totally not fulfilling. (chuckles) I don't know. It's really frustrating. And then, I know this is totally not that important I'm frightened, but you know how I always have to go to the dentist - ? because sometimes I'll be [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:25) like, "Oh, I have a dentist's appointment." I go to the dentist because I have really shitty teeth. I have a million cavities and two root canals. I have really crappy teeth. I just found out a couple of days ago that they're going to have to extract one because it's in such bad shape and they're going to do an implant where they drill into your jawbone. It's this huge thing and I realized that I don't have anyone to go with me. They don't generally knock you out, but I told them there was no way they were drilling into my jaw without giving me something because I'm already horrified to go to the dentist. [00:05:03] I don't have anyone to go with me, I just realize. That feels like a really shitty thing, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah; really, really lonely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also that was a hard thing to hear because when they told me that I was losing a tooth I just started crying. (laughs) That's my tooth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's scary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's really scary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When do you have to have that done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Soon. As soon as possible because I could have bone loss or something if I don't take care of it now, not that drilling into my jaw isn't going to be bone loss but . . . (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in a controlled way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly the word that they used. I was like, "So what if I just don't do anything and I wait until it's bad and needs to come out?" because it's not uncomfortable. It doesn't hurt. Nothing. And they were like, "That's a bad idea." (laughs) [00:06:01] I was like, "Okay." At least my dentist is nice. He is nice. All this has been going on and I hate everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you talked to anyone or have you asked anyone to go with you - or do you just assume that you have no one to go with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The place is super-far away. You'd have to take four busses to get there, so I'd really rather drive there and there's nobody that I know that has a car that would be . . . I don't know. So maybe I'll just tough it out and grip the chair and drive myself. And then - this is the part that I'm super embarrassed about because this is awful - remember a couple of weeks ago I was like sometimes I feel really controlling of other people and that's not fair? Julia and Angela (sp?) have been hanging out and I feel so jealous when they hang out. [00:07:05] I feel really jealous. I wish they didn't hang out and then I'm like, "Wow, I'm an awful person." (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you want someone to hang out with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I don't think it's just that. I wish it were, but I think it's more like . . . I don't know. Angela is the nicest person of all time. I don't think there's anyone she's ever had a falling-out with like I have; and so even though she tells me all these things that bother her about Julia, she still hangs out with her and they go out for drinks and they go to dinner and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want her to be more with Julia in action, not just in word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I know that's bad, but I can't help feeling that way and I feel really bad when I feel that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's how you feel and you don't need to judge it. [00:08:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's a really hard one not to judge because it's me judging other people and saying you should act as if her world revolved around mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you want a comrade, sort of like a comrade in arms that will battle your battles with you. You're really mad at Julia and feeling very distant from her and you want Angela to echo that same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. But I understand and I know that's not fair. That's not a fair expectation to have. She's my friend but she's not my friend only. She's other people's friend, too. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder what would make it important to make her sort of have more in solidarity with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, because nobody else is. (both laugh) That sounds really lonely and sad. [00:09:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are really lonely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It kind of sounds like you don't have anyone to be your best friend or your partner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And some of it - like Charles and I get along really well. We get along super, super well; but he's moving away. I'm moving away. I don't want to get super attached to him and then have to break that off. I kind of just want to move.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you want to be lonely now because you worry about being lonely later?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughs) Not when you put it that way. He's also really busy. He has a thesis and he's still in school. We hang out probably as much as we can anyway. [00:10:01] But I kind of feel like everything is in so much flux that I kind of want to move and just start over. I have to move anyway, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't know where you have to move to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't even know what city I'm going to be in in two months. That's really frustrating. I e-mailed Vanderbilt University Medical Center and I was like, "Hey, please. What's going on? What's the application status?" On Monday they e-mailed me back and they were like, "We're reviewing your application today." I was like, "Okay. (both laugh) So tell me; and they still haven't told me." It's totally stressful to know that they're going through my application that day, but it was okay. I was at work doing nothing so . . . (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard to sit and wait. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The waiting is the worst. I didn't expect it to be this bad. At least in college when I was waiting, I was taking classes and doing stuff. [00:11:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you don't have a lot to really distract you from it right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I've been reading, but - I mean, literally, that's my only distraction, which I realize is super [nerdy] (ph?) I don't know. My grandmother's sister just died yesterday on my mom's birthday, so part of me is like, "I wish I was home." I don't remember her very well. I remember seeing her and I know what she looked like. I remember she was very nice to me, but I haven't seen her in years and so I feel like it's more of my mom's loss than it is my own. I wish I was there with her. I feel super unwanted by my life situation here and I feel like I could be doing something at home, but then I can't be home for too long because then that's awful. [00:12:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you talked to your mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I talked to her a couple of times yesterday. It was her birthday so . . . She's doing fine. She was like, "I wish I would have visited her more often." She feels kind of guilty about that, but I told her, "That's not useful because that's in the past and you should just focus on the times that you did see her and how nice that was." She was like, "Yeah, you're right." I think she felt a little bit better after that because she did visit her just a week and a half ago with her brother, who happened to be in town. So she did see her recently, which was nice. She was kind of comforted. My grandpa, her dad, died. I don't know if you knew that, but he died. [00:13:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A long time ago. I was little. I was like six. He took 17 years to die. He was having little strokes. He had emphysema. He had all these chronic issues for like 17 years, really sick. It makes no sense because he was a doctor and he was a chain smoker. (snickers) He smoked a carton every two or three days. My mom said that she was really sad to see him go through that and sometimes she just preferred - like when he died she said she was sad, but that she was relieved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he wasn't in pain anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People often, when they have time to anticipate the loss, they prepare themselves, especially when you see somebody struggling like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. She said that she knew it was coming. At the end he didn't recognize her one day and she was like, "Ohh." She said it was a similar situation with her aunt. [00:14:05] She wasn't able to move her body until somebody said, "Hey, we got a new pope," and she was like, "Huh?" (chuckles) But even that was a huge effort so in a way, my mom said, she had no quality of life. Everyone was there. At the house they go and eat together. If somebody dies, they just all go and hang out for days. I felt bad that I couldn't go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You weren't present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I'm already distant from my family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard not to be there at times like this. Those rituals, whatever rituals your culture has, having those rituals to participate in really does bring a sense of togetherness and support. [00:15:08] And it's hard to be apart from that and not able to participate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it turns it, I think, into a positive experience because you end up telling stories about them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You get to share in your memories and connect. I think funerals and wakes and sitting Shiva - every culture has their own thing, but they're all about bringing people together. And that's exactly what you're feeling. You're so set apart right now from your family, from friends here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though, like I said, it's more of my mom's loss, it was still a big family thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's part of your family. It's the family's loss.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I guess that's all kind of been coming together. [00:16:03] (sniffles) I don't know. Also, I guess part of it is I don't want to feel like I'm waiting for an answer. I feel so out of control, so I've just been thinking recently that if I don't get into these programs, maybe I'll move to Seattle or Los Angeles or Orlando. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would those places bring you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Orlando has really good music. (laughs) I don't know. I think a new start. But then I feel like I had that when I was here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are you trying to do differently with a new start? What are you trying to change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. Start over. (pause) [00:17:02] It's interesting to see how . . . I remember getting here May 25th, 2010, a couple of days after my graduation from college and I remember I was like, "Wow. I can be whoever I want. Nobody here knows me. This is a new place."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So who do you want to be for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I don't know. (chuckles) I guess my whole life is figuring that out. I don't know. It would be nice to have that feeling again, though. (chuckles) I don't know. Maybe I'll go home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could go home. I don't think I would be happy if I did. I like snow. (chuckles) (pause) [00:18:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what it is that you're really craving. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess new people because I feel like it's such a huge city that's so densely populated. I feel like there isn't anyone here. I don't know. (pause) (chuckles) I sound so pathetic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem pathetic to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That also kind of makes me feel like what is it about me? I don't have friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's nothing wrong with you, but I wonder if there isn't something that you're doing or repeating that's stopping you from being able to maintain some of the relationships that you've started. [00:19:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I agree. (chuckles) I don't know what that is, though. I still feel like the whole cut-and-run thing? (sniffles) When something gets bad, just end it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can hear yourself saying it. You can hear yourself say "I just want to move already and start over."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still feel that very strongly. I know we've been talking about that for a year. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. Core issues are really resilient. They're hard to make those changes on and you have made changes, but it's hard to do a 180.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, it's interesting. Looking at Angela who is like - I really like Angela. She's great. She's a really nice person. [00:20:01] But she's never had cut-offs like I have, do you know what I mean? Even when she dislikes someone, like Julia, she really doesn't like a lot of things about her right now. (sniffling) They still go out to dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think holds them together or what is it that allows Angela to see these things that she dislikes but also stay connected?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. (laughs) I've been thinking about that for a long time. I'm like, "How could she . . ? (sniffles) How could you . . ?" I've been thinking about it for a while. I really have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well you're watching this play out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it would be nice. Even though I don't necessarily want to be friends with Julia, but it would be nice to be able to do that. (sniffles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just to use her as an example. I think we talked a little bit last time about what are the things that feel disappointing to you in that relationship and what are the things that are hard for you to reconcile? [00:21:05] But I'm wondering would there be value or what is the value in continuing a friendship with her or a relationship with her, even though she's making these decisions that you disagree with or acting in ways that you find uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would be the value? (pause) It would be nice to have a friend (chuckles) but I don't know. There's a saying in Spanish - I'd rather be alone than in bad company, right? That's kind of how I feel. I did talk to her. I think it was yesterday or the day before. (sniffles) I actually asked her about Sergio. I try not to talk to her about relationships, but that's the only thing she wants to talk about. [00:22:02] I was like, "Is he still applying to PhD programs?" She was like, "Yeah, but he's not getting in. But it might be for the best." I was like, "How is that for the best?" I thought about it later and I thought maybe she's just trying to make a bad situation better, like maybe other opportunities will open up or something. (sniffles) I think it's okay to say, "Hey, this is shitty. This really sucks. Maybe I'll try again next year. Maybe that's the solution. Maybe I won't. Maybe I decide this is not what I want." But that doesn't make it any less of a shitty situation. I felt like she was talking to me, like I'm sitting here waiting and I feel like I'm probably not going to get in because I was rejected from Cornell so quickly. And she said that to me before when - I don't remember - something else bad happened. She was like, "Oh, maybe it's for the best." [00:23:02] I was like, "No, it's not for the best." (sniffles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a dialog you can actually have with her or are you having that in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my head. In my head, yeah. I did try to push back more than I usually would, actually, which I thought was good. I was like, "But I'm sure he's disappointed and, if that's what he really wants to do, then maybe he should do something kind of like reapply or something." I said something along those lines like "maybe he would think about reapplying" or something like that. And she said, "Well she can force them to let him in." I was like, "That's not what I'm saying." (chuckles) But then I just dropped it because she seemed kind of defensive, which I understand because we have had such a rocky relationship recently. So I just dropped it. I was like, "Okay. Well, bye. I'm going upstairs." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like it was probably a pretty unsatisfying conversation for both of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. [00:24:01] I mean before that she did ask me about my job and all and I was like, "It's really shitty." Like I said, I hate 9 to 5's and answering phone calls and whatever and she's like, "That's' really crappy. I've had jobs like that, too. But I like 9 to 5's." I was like, "Okay. Okay." (laughs) We did talk about that. It was kind of awkward. We were both cooking, though, so it was kind of unavoidable. (pause) It was nice to know that I was able to talk to her without being rude. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it feel like bad company?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt uncomfortable. I didn't really want to talk to her, I just wanted to leave. [00:25:02] It was nicer than I expected. We did actually have a text message argument, which was really super immature. I think I told you that she said that I was being unreasonably loud. She texted me and I said I was not, that kind of thing. The other morning, it was like 7:00 AM, and she was slamming things super loudly downstairs. I've heard her make noise before, but this was really, really loud. I was sleeping. I texted her and I was like, "Hey, would you mind . . ?" What did I say? I said it really nicely, but I don't remember what I said. It was something like "would you mind keeping it down" or something. "I would really appreciate it if you would try to keep it down" or something like that. [00:26:04] And she was like "I wasn't being loud." And she was like "Just kidding, but remember that's what you said last week?" (sniffles) And then we had this huge argument and I was like, "Well, that's because all these other things." And I told her that I put up with all this noise that she makes and that I'm totally fine doing that, but she's like, "You should tell me every time anything bothers you." The thing is that happens so often any time she's home that I'm not going to tell her every time that I hear her slam drawers every five minutes. That's so annoying and that's something that I can handle because I chose to live with four other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I don't think we're anywhere near on the same page with that because I think that we should be able to tolerate each other's noise up to a certain level. And then if it's super bothersome or more than usual, then you can say something. [00:27:00] She called me crazy for putting up with her sex noise for two years. She was like, "How did you never say anything about that before?" and I was like, "Because that's so awkward. How do you bring that up to anyone?" We just basically agreed that we're moving out in two months. I'll try to be nicer and, in my e-mail, I don't think I was rude. And if you can try to keep it down that would be great. She was like "okay." So we basically agreed in that way, I guess, so it wasn't particularly constructive but it wasn't the opposite, destructive. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like it's not friends. It's not maintaining a friendship, but it's trying to have conversations to figure out how to be civil. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how to share the space that you do need to share for the next two months.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's kind of like what it felt like in the kitchen that day, it was like being civil. How is your job? How is your mother? Okay. That's good. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's one that's important. There are going to be relationships you have where that's all you can do because you can't necessarily make a friendship out of that or even necessarily companionship; but being civil so you don't have to feel angry all the time. It's unfortunate because you guys were close friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not cutting off. It's like you're trying to find a way back from that line where you could just totally cut her off and pretend you don't see her when you see her. It's like you're taking steps to not do that and maintain a civil connection. This gives you options.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I never really thought about it like that. That sounds so distant, too. That's funny - "pretend you don't see her" - because I did that so much in college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you did. That's what people do when they cut off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's interesting. [00:28:58] I even had a dream that I bumped into that guy who was the awful relationship, but it was such a weird dream because it happened eight times and each time I did something different. (chuckles) It was weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were testing out possibilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. It was strange. I don't think I decided anything. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What thing felt best? What iteration?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think there was one where I punched him (both chuckle), but I'm not like that in real life. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it feel good in the dream?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the dream it did, yeah. I think that's okay if it stays in the dream. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a way to get that feeling in a safe way. It's like being able to experiment with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think there was one where we nodded at each other and acknowledged each other's existence that I thought would be the most reasonable, but didn't stop to talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did that compare in feeling to being able to punch him? [00:30:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It actually felt better. I think the one where I punched him was kind of like the old me coming out or when I was in a relationship with him, what I wanted to do then, but it didn't seem what I want to do now. Do you know I mean? So it kind of seemed like something I've been holding onto or wanting to do for a long time, but maybe not necessarily caring that much about it anymore. (pause) I think that's why the cordial "okay, we're acknowledging that we are not going to stop and speak because you're an awful person and you think I'm an awful person; but we're acknowledging each other's existence." (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's being very human. You're human. I'm a human. I don't want anything to do with you, but I know you're there. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. (chuckles) That seems more likely, I guess, the kind of reaction I would have now, which I guess is progress. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You did it because you like it better for yourself. It sounds like in some ways punching him feels good because you're really angry and you have good reason to be really angry at him and it's a good way of letting out all that aggression - but then you feel kind of bad about it. So then you're left with feeling guilty that this is the way that you're expressing your anger; and it sounds like you feel better about yourself kind of acknowledging him and also acknowledging yourself that you want nothing to do with this person and you don't like who they are. Yet you don't have this need to hurt and it sounds like that leaves you feeling better about you, which is really what it comes down to, feeling okay with yourself and not needing everybody else to like you in order to feel okay with yourself. But you don't need him to like you. You don't like him either and that's okay, but you do have to like yourself. [00:32:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting because, hearing you talk about the dream and the different reactions, reminds me of how you dealt with your dad coming to graduation. In some ways it was kind of like you wanted to hit your dad for even thinking about coming to graduation. He came and you had some awkward interactions with him, but in the end it was kind of okay and you were kind of surprised by it - Am I remembering this completely incorrectly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that sounds right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I kind of remember you talking about this dinner where he was there and it was awkward, but it was not as bad as you thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt sorry for him because he was the one that was really out of it. He was clearly not a part of the group. I think that shifted my thinking about him to feeling sorry for him. [00:32:59] I'm also angry but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not as much anger so you sort of dominated what you felt about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like with him and with the ex, being able to let go of a little of the anger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know what's really funny, now that I'm thinking about it? Angela is actually good friends with him and I never thought twice about it. I just told her when she moved in that I would prefer if she not mention him all the time because that would make me feel uncomfortable, but obviously if it comes up once in a while, that's fine. Maybe it's just because it feels that way now, but not the same way that I feel when she goes out to dinner with Julia or something. That's interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So something is more okay about that. I wonder what makes that . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it's complicated. (chuckles) (pause) [00:34:05] I don't know. She even lived in his parents' house for a while with her boyfriend. Maybe it's because her relationship with him wasn't by choice; it was through her boyfriend, who was really good friends with him. She said that when they started to hang out she was like, "I don't want to hang out with you." But then she did because her boyfriend was there all the time. Maybe that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she talked about it with you a little bit, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And has she talked to you about why she continues to be able to be friendly with Julia?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Maybe it would be interesting to ask, also to see if I can maybe (chuckles) learn a little bit from her. I would definitely feel comfortable asking her about it because she's so nice. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I wonder if it's part of the unspoken piece in your math. You're trying to figure it out on your own. I wonder how accurate your assumptions are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That may be. Probably not very. That makes sense. Yeah, maybe I can do that. I would definitely feel comfortable doing that, too, because we are good friends. [00:35:08] Okay. (laughs) That sounds like something constructive I can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that sound as a homework assignment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds good. (laughing) That sounds really doable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Coming up with your homework is always such a great [thing.] (ph?) It's like asking a kid to develop their own consequence. They're always harder on themselves. (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that true? (laughs) That's funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Always" is probably a strong word. Often. Often it just makes more sense. You know what? In both instances when I ask you to sort of come up with a homework assignment or asking a child to come up with a consequence, it's because you choose something that's meaningful for you. I could choose something for you that makes sense out of what we talked about today and it might make sense, but having you just kind of think of it on your own is something that really feels meaningful to you. It's going to be so much more valuable. [00:36:02] The conversation goes nowhere or the conversation gets you what you think you're going to get out of it - either way, tackling it clearly it's meaningful to you just to approach it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it also sounds doable, which is nice. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And any goal should be doable. You don't want to set yourself up for failure, but if you can do this and have this conversation, then you have something to build on the next time rather than feeling like "here is a really hard task I set up for myself. It's too hard to approach" or "it's too hard to do." And then you feel badly about not doing it. It doesn't get you anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) Something to keep in mind as well. (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how many sessions do we have left? I know we're near the end so I like to keep tabs or are we changing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that idea. (laughs) [00:36:58] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can go with that, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, I know for sure, though - I like that I'm measuring my life in weeks now, like a pregnant woman. I know that I'm going to be here. We have the 2nd.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. At 4:20.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of all the dental work that I need done, I'm definitely going to be here beyond that. The 16th would be hard. Can we try for the 9th? And then if I find out in the next week or two that I'm going to be around after that, can we maybe change that to the 16th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 9th I'm totally booked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean the 9th-ish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the 8th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe the end of the week, if that's helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Totally booked up. I'm not here Wednesday or Thursday and my Friday is totally packed. I could do the 8th and the 16th you're not here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might be. I don't know. [00:38:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not sure?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You know what? We could try for the 16th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want the 4:20 on the 16th?
CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I can do that. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry to change it up. I just have no idea what's happening. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. That's all right. And then, unfortunately, your check bounced.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait - which one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Last week's for $145. I think last week you gave me two big checks, so we made it for all of that together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I gave you the . . . Oh, I see. I only saw one of them. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. So that's that. It helps your records to know which check it was because they sent me a copy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Yeah. I'm so sorry about that. [00:39:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your apology is accepted. So I have to have you pay that, which is $145, and then $12 for the . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'm going to make two separate checks. I hope that's okay. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's totally fine. And if you want me to wait to deposit one because it's more than you expected to pay today . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think what happened is that all these bills just kind of piled up at once and it went over by like $5 and I didn't even realize. I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I saw a bounced check and it was for the insurance, for my car insurance, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It stinks when you have a bunch at one time and you don't know what's happened and then it happens on a number in a row.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just switched insurance and so they changed the time . . . Anyway, I feel bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm adding in my head. (both laugh) [00:40:00] So $145 for today and then $157 would cover the bounced check.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. What is today? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today is the 22nd. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Here's one. (pause) [00:41:20] Oh-oh. Can I do that? I just messed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it depends on what you messed up. Oh, that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I initialed it, just in case. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't see why that would be a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. But if it is and you'd like to send me an e-mail, I can drop one by before the next time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. I'm sure it's fine. Most people's writing isn't completely legible. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

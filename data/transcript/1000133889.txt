<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: See if I can talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? You're feeling pretty bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of cramped in here. You know I felt guilty when I left here last week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel as if you feel that I'm feeling sorry for myself. I shouldn't come into counsel with all of this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that I think I'm ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems so silly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum. And you think that I think or I must think that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I was gonna ask you how serious a problem do you think, you think I have?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you asking me that? What if I said ... well, let me think. Is it like if I said, "I think you really have a serious problem", then that would make you feel better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm just wondering if people are dealing with what I'm dealing with everyday without bothering to seek professional help for it. I'm just wondering if the way I feel is worse than most people feel much of the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if it isn't, then you feel like you shouldn't be taking up my time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. Maybe I should deal ... I don't know. I mean sometimes I wonder, "Am I really that much more unhappy than other people?".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or, "am I just trying somehow feeling too sorry for myself?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. Well another thing that I really hate myself about and I'm really getting disgusted, and I don't understand why. For seven months, I've had the same infatuation for a person that I'm not involved with. I don't understand why it doesn't go away. Why I don't have the discipline or the strength and I'm just wondering. I think that sometimes I feel that's really sick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, it's really sick not to be able to get over it because there's nothing going on between the two of you?</p>

<p>0:03:14.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And never has really that much. I think that would be ... sometimes I feel that's a real indication that I have a serious problem emotionally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that makes you worry how you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It makes me worry about my self and what's wrong with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "What is it that I can't ... just looks like it should be pretty simple, but here I can't even forget about this. I can't get this off my mind".</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know what I've figured? I thought that perhaps a man or a woman, like a woman if she's normal, has a capacity to love or to like a man to be attractive. And what I think it is, is that it's sort of like you have certain energies like a young boy or young children have energy that have to do certain things. And if they don't have activities, these energies ... well these energies are expelled in some kind of way, in a destructive way.</p>

<p>So I thought that perhaps I have so many of these crushes that are not ... that are one-sided because not dating or not getting involved in a relationship where the feeling is mutual, that capacity that I would have to love a man would be ... you know, that would be a normal outlet. So since there is no normal outlet, it comes out this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words, can I as a woman help being attached to somebody? It would be healthier, more normal to be attached to someone who felt the same way about me, but since there is no one, then perhaps I attach myself to somebody anyway. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you have that energy inside of you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That capacity or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh ... to be expressed and since it can't somehow right now be expressed to somebody who cares about you, that could happen. Gets expressed anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That way of thinking about it makes it more acceptable to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's a way that I could try to understand it Even though ... of course I don't know if I would be attracted to this person if this person had not made certain advances to me perhaps. I don't know how it would have been these past few months. Maybe it is possible. Well I think I did go through this once, which I wouldn't attach to anyone or have a crush or infatuated. But it really bothers me to be in a situation like this. It's not as bad as it was a few months ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really bothers you to still have strong feelings about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not this particular question. It's just the fact that I still have it and what does that indicate about me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. What does that mean about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm astonished.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like that could show something about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or is it because I want the excitement of it or is it because I still have hope because there is no hope? I don't understand why ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what keeps it going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What keeps it going? I don't know (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like not knowing when it touches me and keeps the feeling about that and worrying you that it means something is wrong with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder if it's lack of acceptance of the way it really is or ...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're innocent. You don't ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I don't accept, accept the situation for what it is or (inaudible) Maybe I can't think ... well of course I think. Maybe I can't face the fact that he's nothing to me and that I'm nothing to him. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you can't take that. Maybe that's too much to realize that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I do realize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum. Then you realize that that's the true, but it's still a very strong reaction to this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think I feel better about myself. I don't feel that I behaved wrong or said the wrong thing or it didn't work out because I didn't (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I might have, but I don't think I (inaudible)</p>

<p>0:09:27.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Because, well for example, I know there are certain women who are supposed to behave in certain ways and ... well I have a friend who thought she was boring to a guy that she was going out with. She talked to me about that she felt that she was boring. To my way of thinking, the way I was thinking that she shouldn't have done it because then if you think, "Oh do I bore you?", you're begging the person for their approval and you're being self-abasing to the person that you care about, which will make him respect you less. But she still goes out with him and apparently this didn't make any difference. So apparently there is no right or wrong way to behave. It's just a matter of the way men feel about you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) objective ways of feeling you should or shouldn't say ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. There are no rules.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and no rules like that, but it's on some other basis.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's ... I'm sure that they were ... you shouldn't make a doormat out of yourself. There are certain things you shouldn't do, but I think the nice part is you're looking for some kind of guideline of the way to behave to attract men or to keep a man that is attractive and interested. There's no one that way (inaudible) behave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No list of rules that you can learn and keep a man that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) interest. And it sounds like that's what you were depending on before is a set of rules.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't. No. I wasn't. It's just that in this instance, with this person, I had decided that, "Well, I didn't behave independent enough. I didn't show enough self confidence". I know women who don't have confidence, who do date. I know they don't have confidence, So even that isn't ... I thought that you needed self confidence to attract ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Apparently that isn't the case, you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you feel that more it depends on how the man feels about you or about particular things you do.</p>

<p>0:11:54.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I know if I'm attracted to somebody, there isn't much they can do or say that would turn the feeling off. The feeling ... when I start feeling that way, it's usually because I just felt or circumstances separated me from the person, but they don't really say or do anything that makes me feel different. I'm sure it's the same way with other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they say that that's decisive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not in feelings. You don't know why these ...? Do people that you see have this problem often? Does it seem pretty normal to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) what if I said yes they were. I'm trying to see what you really wondering what I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if I'm wondering, I don't know how I'm going to find out?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm wondering, I don't know how I'm going to ever know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ever know what? I don't know what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. If I don't know what's wrong this time, I don't know how I'm going to handle it if it ever happens again. I've got to get the key to it to why I react the way I do so that it's something I can command in the future because it's no fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. So what is this about? What are you asking me about the other people for? I'm not clear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That wasn't what you were really asking me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I was just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're really wondering is like you're feeling somewhat like hopeless. Like well, like you want to do something different in the future, so it doesn't happen again, but you don't know what to do because you don't understand what went wrong or what created this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least I don't know why it's lasting so long.</p>

<p>0:14:24.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That �s the next part of what you don't understand too. What is making this hang around so long?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's just daily (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the fact that you ... like if you weren't around anywhere, then you would think of him less I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I would have forgotten him easily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's an important part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But he's there all the time. His name comes up and he keeps coming around the corner, so forth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, physically present.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like that is something that you do understand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That might be ... but still, I mean, if something doesn't work out, you're supposed to forget about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you're supposed to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you should. I mean ... well I'm sure you should because .. I mean, why, why bother? I mean it just doesn't make sense. I don't think it makes sense. I don't ... I really don't understand why a person would continually be interested in someone that didn't return the feeling. We're sitting here talking about it. it doesn't seem to be as bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What doesn't seem to be as bad? You still having the feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. It doesn't seem to ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well talking about it is when it seems less important or in the mix of feeling things. It's almost, well, talking about it, it doesn't seem like it's a bigger problem as it did maybe yesterday or this morning because I'm telling it to you or maybe true, something in the back of my mind thinks. Maybe you don't feel this way. Maybe you are older.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Telling me what ...</p>

<p>0:16:36.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't really understand. Almost the difference of saying, "Why am I sitting here telling her that I like this person". I really don't think I do. This is what bothers ... this is what ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Wondering, "why am I spending time on this?".</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems less important when I'm saying it to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like a thing that has some kind of quality of making you not sure if it's true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this feeling is very silly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said "silly"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... to feel that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "It's very silly because, why don't you just get over it, you say to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you think it feels silly and probably because silly to talk about it, but very often it really bothers me a lot. It makes me very unhappy. That is you feel hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like when I told you that I was jealous of other women and imagining all kinds of affairs going on (inaudible). Even if there were, I should know it's nothing to me. I felt well these other women are better. They more charming or they're more women. I must have been born without some kind of magnetism. I really sound silly to myself (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying, "I have too many worries".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Well I'm sure I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's some quality of even, well you think there're silly, but they hang on. You can't get them out of your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm constantly worried about what he thinks of me.</p>

<p>0:19:35.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Possibly when you ... are you doing something wrong when he thinks bad about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Do you mean I'm doing something right now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No. No. I mean you're wondering does he like me. Does he respect me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which that's not important too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not important?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Actually it doesn't change anything. It doesn't ... I (inaudible) Really the way he feels about me has no effect on me, except the way I feel about him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think ... it sounds like the way you feel about it, it really does affect you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I care. And what can I do about it anyway?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel it's useless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it's useless to care what anybody thinks only because you can't do anything about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that's the part that's painful. It's that you can't do anything about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like one thing is happening, is that it's hard to take your feelings seriously. Like you think of him and then you think a lot of this seems silly to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm ... it certainly seems silly in the sense that they affect my mood and my temperament, the way I feel. But these are the things that I shouldn't feel unhappy about. I should not be unhappy about this. I should say, "Okay. That's the way it is. What difference does it make".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the way, the way you really want to live and think you should live is not to let your feelings make all that much difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not to have certain feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what if you do have them?</p>

<p>0:22:25.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not if you have them ... well, I'm sure people, I'm sure people have done drastic things to themselves because they couldn't change the way they felt. Not that I would do ... I don't mean myself, but apparently ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying it could be dangerous to ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm not saying it's dangerous, but you see people say, like you say, "Well, the feelings are there", but (inaudible) doesn't help the person. I mean he's got to find a way to control, to control the feeling. It's like being sick and not being able to do anything about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not saying it's dangerous. I was saying in extreme cases, people (inaudible) this isn't normal. I'm not saying that most people do this, but people not being able to change the way they feel, they've gotten very desperate. I mean after over a period of years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) yeah. Yeah. I'm having trouble because I look at things a little differently. The way I look at them has to do with ... I think that's true. There are feelings that can't change. But I think just to turn them off and to try to say, "I shouldn't have those feelings", and to try to make them go away in that way by controlling them before you really know what they are, is very hard. It takes a lot of work. I guess what I'm encouraging you to do is like find out what your feelings are a little more. It doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be harder to control what you do if you know what your feelings are. Sometimes it's easier in the long run.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have no idea how to go about finding out how I really feel because ...well, if a person is on your mind all the time, how would you do that? How do you find out how you feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, there's no real 10 meanings or less.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I know, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess part of what I'm saying is ... well, okay. I mean, how does it feel. Like (inaudible) talking about what that's like to have him on your mind all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does he mean to you that it makes it so hard to forget about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What does it mean to me?</p>

<p>0:27:20.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I can see that's (inaudible) to hopefully start (inaudible) what sounds like I mean one thing and (inaudible) some kind of a source of ... well you spend a lot of time worrying how he feels about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So why? You're asking me why do I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why (inaudible) what that's like more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm thinking that ... what it's like is it's feeling that ... like I feel like it says something that it says something about what I am as a woman. Like if he thinks that I'm silly, immature, maybe I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like his feelings have a lot of ... it's like his feelings have a lot of effect on how you feel about yourself and then you doubt yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you feel that you really get inside of you, eat away at how you feel about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what would he mean to me? Is he sort of my ego or something? What does alter ego mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't think it matters. I mean it's in like, I didn't mean that abstractly. I mean it's just the kind of thing you were talking about. Part of what it sounds like he means to you is somebody who is very important in deciding what you're like or how worthwhile you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's right. And I guess it would help if I knew what he was like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's sounds like a part of it too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How valid are his opinions? What ... I know sometimes I try to assess the women that he seems to find attractive and I'll ask him. None of these women do I know too well and I try to find out indirectly if they're intelligent or what they are. If I had some idea of what he seems to like in other women, it would help me to decide how valid his opinion is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So part of it is like you're unsure how much importance to put to his opinions. And it would help to know what he values and what kind of (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would help. You're right. It would help to know what he values. If I knew that ...</p>

<p>0:30:56.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you knew that, then what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it would help (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would that do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it would help me to evaluate him better because I could make a better evaluation of him, which would help me to ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean if you agree with his values, then you would think more highly of his opinion? Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you found out you disagreed with the kind of people that he liked, then you wouldn't be so affected by it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Right. I could feel the way I do and not care what he thinks. He seems to be a person who values intelligence in people, but however, I don't know if he sees any of these women. If he's attracted to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go back a step now. When you're talking about, it sounds like if he agreed with your values, then you would consider his opinion really important in valuing you. Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would think more it would probably feel worse, but ...if he cares about glamour and external things, or even personalities, I wouldn't, it wouldn't matter so much. Well it depends on what aspect, what kinds of personality he wanted. If he is looking for a frugal, sophisticated-type woman, then I wouldn't think as much ... Well I might care that I wasn't sophisticated, but I don't think that it would matter as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying those are your own values, is what you'd like to be like. Right? Certain ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to be that way. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I guess I'm trying here ... you're saying that if his values agree with yours, then you would care more how he felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying something like, "I want to know how I measure up as a person to my own value with what I'd like to be. If he's a good person to measure that, then I'll take his word". Is that it?</p>

<p>0:33:42.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Of course, this is all blind because I don't really know what he thinks of me. I don't think that I would want to be like any of those women. They're not women that I would want to emulate. There are women around that I'd like to be more like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't like those (inaudible) become attracted to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what does that do to you to see that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that helps. I sort of like ... I like a lot of things about myself I think that I can accept.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean as you look at yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think there's anybody else that I want to be right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd rather be you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is a very recent feeling. I really don't want to be anybody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean before you sometimes thought you would rather be somebody else, but now it seems more attractive to be yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I ... yeah. It does. Except, you know like, if he thinks that I'm silly and childish, I really don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't accept that. That (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I doubt it. But he might see me as childish if he thinks that the sophisticated, grownup type of an affected, bourgeois manner is very important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He wants that. But you'd feel critical of him like if he wanted that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if I am the right ... I suppose. Well no. I mean ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure if you should fit (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not so sure that I should feel that he should value what I am. I mean, why should ... see I'm not sure of this. Because people have their own opinion. I don't have to be ... it's not up to me to please him. I mean there's no reason why he should like me or not.</p>

<p>0:36:25.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there's no reason why he should value the things I do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it almost sounded like you kind of look down your nose a little at those kind of bourgeois-type people. If that's what he values, you wouldn't be very interested?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you put it that way. I haven't thought of it that way. I think well maybe I'm just trying to save face. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe I'm kidding myself trying to say, "Oh well, those women are not better than I am. He's just shallow and they're shallow". Maybe that's a copout. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you really like to be like those women?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm not sure what they're really like. You know. I'm not sure if he values them. You see, I don't know what he thinks of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not sure what you think of them either I guess?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Because I don't know them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure if you'd want to be like them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it's significant in the fact that none of them are my friends (phone ringing). I think the fact that none of them are friends of mine is significant, which means there was nothing to draw me to them or nothing about me that attracted them. The fact that I don't know it. The fact that so many of ... and his friends. A lot of his friends are people that I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is the significance of that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We have a complete different, completely different set of friends or acquaintances.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That means what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well on the surface, it would mean that we don't have much in common and yet we can talk together about some things. And we do have, you know, there's some ground of agreement on certain matters that have ... well things that have to do with ...</p>

<p>0:38:38.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it means ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Things that have to do with general things, like racial problems. Stuff like that. Just general things, but yeah. He doesn't know my friends and I don't know his.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't know what that means then. The fact that you each have your separate circle of friends who seem to be different, but what's ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're attracted to different people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that shows ... that's ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it means that ... well his friends are not, the people that he talks to the most ... I don't know if they're friends, are not as ... I think they're beneath him in intelligence. I think it indicates an ambivalence on his part of wanting to be feeling intelligent, that he's intelligent, because he talks about being intelligent. But yet I think that he's shy of other kinds of people that he would admire more. Because he mentions those people don't say anything. Their conversations really shallow. That they don't say anything and yet he's constantly with these people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what does that say about ... what is it by figuring that all out you're trying to establish as something for yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to assess what he is so that I can stop worrying about what he thinks of ... it's so stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. You're trying to figure out what he likes so that you can separate your feelings from him and get rid of him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's so ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could understand him better, then you could put yourself in perspective to him better. Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. That's right. But then of course if I decide that he's not worth it, then I was saying, "what difference does it make if he's intelligent or how intelligent he is. What a great thinker he is?" Because suppose he were a Ph.D. and he had a Ph.D. in humanities, archeology, and everything, then what would I say to myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you couldn't say, "Well he isn't intelligent".</p>

<p>0:41:36.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. He's dumb. So. There has to be a better way of freeing yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're trying to do now I guess you're saying is to try and find fault with him. And that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's sour grapes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To find enough things wrong with him so you can stop liking him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's a ... I don't think that's the way to gain confidence in yourself. I think you have to believe in yourself and your own opinion of yourself. Even if the person is wonderful and has an IQ of 200, because obviously then you can't ... you're sour grapes or whatever. Or say, "Well, he's so horrible".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying that you have difficulty in feeling tied up with him isn't really what he's like, but it's got to do with your doubts of your own opinion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I've got to go on my own opinion so that I don't have to use that sour grapes equation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying that's very difficult. Because your own opinions are pretty weak and shaky?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so. In spite of the fact that I have other friends who ... I have friends who might think like me and respect me. That should tell me something, but they're opinions don't effect me as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: His opinion. Something about his opinion is the one that makes a difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I suppose everybody is like that. Everybody cares what somebody thinks of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes the difference like what your friends say doesn't really count and what he is thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It counts, but not as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What gives him that extra?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose the way I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is?</p>

<p>0:43:44.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose I feel attracted to him. I suppose that's what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, just because you like him. It's more important for him to like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he doesn't anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't, but that still doesn't change your wishing him to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Maybe that's the way I feel though. Maybe I want him to ... because you know when I'm not with him, I don't really miss ... I'm thinking about him, but I don't really want to be with him. I don't miss him when I don't see him. I think about him, but I don't miss him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not that you'd like to be there with him or some time with him. It's something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not spending time with him doesn't bother me. If I get a favorable reaction from him on a certain day, then I don't have to see him anymore that day. I feel okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean. It's like not the time, but it's sometimes the quality of how he acts toward you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're in and out of his favor. Something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See that's why I think it's so sick. I think there are so many more important things to worry about in life. Besides that's not the reason I sought ... that's not the reason I sought counseling anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the reason you sought counseling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not this one problem. It's just a problem I've had all my life and feeling that ... well I had decided that I would always be lonely because I couldn't attract men, because I couldn't change certain things about myself. And I didn't know how I was going to cope with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what happened (inaudible) ? You keep finding yourself thinking about this particular problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Next year it'll be the same one. The same problem, with another ...</p>

<p>0:46:21.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just goes ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the problem really isn't just one man?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something more (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's the general problem that might be affecting ... I think that another woman with different background and experience would have shaken this off. It wouldn't become so important. And maybe I hang onto it because I feel that there's nobody else for me. And even though this is nothing, I feel that beyond him, there's nothing. It's just a big black whole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's even worse. It's like blank.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like an abyss. So even though this is nothing, maybe it's just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like this is something compared to what lies ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though it's nothing. I mean I know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost as if by facing the fact that he doesn't like me, it's almost like having to face the fact that nobody else ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words, I guess what I've been looking for all my life is some sign that it would be possible to attract somebody. And I look for this sign in different people and I think maybe I was looking ... what I was wanting from him was some kind of feedback, some sign that I was attractive. And the fact that he doesn't find me attractive, seems to be saying, "Well men in general don't find me attractive". Maybe if I face the hard fact that he doesn't find me attractive, it will be almost like as if I'm saying, "Well men don't find me attractive".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I see what you're ... it's not just saying, "this man doesn't like me", but it's somehow saying, "I am unlikable".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's right. That's ... yeah I think that's ... especially if he likes someone else. I've known some women who couldn't get anywhere with a man and he didn't have another girlfriend who was sort of effeminate. So they could cop out, "well he's a homosexual". That's very easy.</p>

<p>0:48:57.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's much harder when you see he can like somebody who likes somebody else, and doesn't want to commit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like the very fact like you said, it's almost saying that I'm unlikable. I am unattractive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not the kind of person anybody would like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if I were likable, he'd like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the fact that he doesn't, shows what I'm really missing and what I'm not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why my opinions should be tied up in one man, except it's a whole string. He's just another person. A long line of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm hearing a kind of (inaudible) kind of starting out with the idea that nobody likes you and keeping, trying almost desperately to find somebody who does. Does that change your opinion of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're asking me that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure that that would be close to it (inaudible) . I think it's something like that. I think it's just another frustration in my attempt to break out of this vicious circle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like to stop caring about whether he likes you, it seems like falling back into that circle of nobody likes you. It's no (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's what keeps me ...you know silly things run through my mind. I'll have a different dress on. Well if he sees me in this dress and it's totally irrational and I know it's silly. If a guy I don't like has on a nice tie, I don't change my opinion of him and so I know now that is really silly, but those things run through my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Silly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep thinking about tomorrow or I'll talk about ... like if he likes to politics, I'll mention something about my own and then he'll think that I'm really smart.</p>

<p>0:51:48.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll be able to change by doing something he likes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He'll think more of me if I say this or I'll bring that up. It's almost as if I never give up and of course when you care what somebody thinks, you may think (inaudible). He probably thinks worse of me because I'm trying to impress him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like kind of a feeling of keeping trying. You're keeping trying to do something that'll change the way he feels.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think it gets worse because sometimes the reaction is real good and then nothing happens the next day. Other times I say, "Well, I shouldn't have started the conversation at all. I said all of the wrong things and I just made my ... I just ended up sounding stupid".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So wait. What are you saying there that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's almost as if the more you try, the ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The worse it gets, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because then you start feeling silly about the way you tried and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then I feel worse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or embarrassed about what he thinks now because of what you just said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, if I'd have left it alone, it wouldn't have happened. But all of this is going on at the same time I think my opinion of myself is getting better. It's almost ... I don't know what it is. I think it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You hope it is maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well of course ... yeah my mood. Bad moods don't last as long. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though you know all this is going on, in someway you're feeling better about yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least I can see what I am doing. I didn't see it before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's clearer to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I tried, during the day, I tried to say, "Well I tried not to behave". I try to behave as I would behave if he didn't exist or if I didn't see him (inaudible). "No. I won't walk that way. I won't do that". But then I find myself acting the opposite way, and why shouldn't I speak. If he were just a friend of mine, I would do that.</p>

<p>0:54:17.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So sometimes you feel you'll try to like avoid him. Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I didn't feel that way, I wouldn't try to ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you'll say, "Well why should I try to avoid him? I wouldn't if he were somebody else".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So a lot of it is trying to act as if her weren't anything to you, but that's very hard to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's hard because it's become a habit. I suppose if I could develop independent opinions of myself, maybe I wouldn't have this need (inaudible) . I think maybe if I stopped caring about what he thought of me, I would ... the feeling would go away or at least it wouldn't be as bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you're saying before. It's maybe if you also kind of determine how you felt about yourself, not just about how he felt about you. Well, I don't know if you're saying this or not. Maybe. It's sounding like you're saying, "My opinion about myself is so weak and shaky that that's what makes it so easy for his opinion to be so important".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I'm sure of that. I think even with a husband and a wife that are really devoted to each other and really care, they care what each other thinks. But I'm sure that if one walked out on the other one, they would be hurt. But I think the more strength that each one had, the less traumatic it would be. I think it's relative (inaudible) you know, like I might say, "I hope he likes me because if he don't, it's not gonna be the end of the world".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you were stronger, you're saying, then it wouldn't be the end of the world if he didn't like you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not the end of the world, but (inaudible) You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know. Well we have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>0:56:39.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I got ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) my bill too ... huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a telephone number for you if you're still interested. There is this guy who is ... remember the guy I told you about before? I talked to him and I told him that you were a client of mine. He wanted to know what you were interested in, because he wasn't sure how he could be helpful. So I told him that you hadn't talked to many people who had (inaudible) difficulties. And that was part of it and that you were concerned about how other people would react to you. Things like that. So ... pardon?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What did he say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He said, "Well, I don't know if I can be encouraging". I said, "Well, I don't want you to be encouraging, unless you could talk about what's real. Talk about reality". Then he said, "Well, maybe she would be more comfortable coming into my house or coming over here to the building". That's the hospital, about a block from here. (inaudible) I said, "I don't know. You can work that out with her". So we left it that you would call him up.</p>

<p>I think if you have some feelings that if you'd rather go to his house or see him in his office, then be sure to make that call.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I'd rather see him at the hospital.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At the hospital?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let me talk to him about it. Okay. Now, his name is Dr. Lenny Crasner.</p>

<p>PATIENT: L-E-N-N-Y?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Crasner. C-R-A-S-N-E-R.</p>

<p>PATIENT: C-R-A-S?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: N-E-R. His number there is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you say he couldn't be encouraging, he doesn't know what to say to me or ?</p>

<p>0:58:50.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He thought that I wanted ... I think he originally thought that I wanted him to say positive things to you like, probably things like when people don't have the option to (inaudible) affirmative and this is much of a problem. You know, that's not realistic and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. I'm so tired of encouraging ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I thought when you say ... so make that clear to him too. I tried to too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, we spoke of this in the office textbook.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. He doesn't what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think having friends is one thing, even though people, even a woman might be (inaudible), but I'm not aware of anyone who (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, right. I know what you're saying. You're just saying you're concerned about how men feel about it. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, ask him ....</p>

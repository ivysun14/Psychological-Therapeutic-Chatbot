<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, we're rolling.  So, um, all [NAME OTHER] aside, the last couple of weeks, you haven't been feeling as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And nothing you can think of that happened, you know that, that, uh, has contributed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, did my mom tell you about my dad?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, she, she has told me about that.  What do we think about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it's bad but I don't think it's why I'm not feeling good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's honest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, especially because I haven't been home -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> During it all and I mean, he's already, like very conveniently the day before I got home was like the last day he has to go to radiation or anything so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not, it's weird for me, I think -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whereas like kind of removed from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he looks fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's happy because he bought a new television.  He was allowed to buy a television and a BluRay DVD player.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> His beloved Jets and everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so, the, uh, like the Pixar movies, that must look pretty cool on that, on the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He hasn't hooked up the DVD player yet -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's working on it today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's the new toy.  You know, we're very, we're very old school.  But anyway, um, what did your mom say, I mean, what's the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In terms of how concerned they are, how, you know, what's the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, they pretty much just say just that's he's going to be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He has to, as of now, he just, he is fine, he probably just has to go in for like routine checkups every once in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like make sure nothing comes back, but, I mean he's supposed to be done with treatment everything [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I don't know all of the details but I know it's a very treatable form of cancer -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It seems like they caught it pretty early, so that sounds all good to me, but I, I don't, uh, you know, she told me about it, but not all the details.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I know and I'm starting to get, like, more worried about [NAME OTHER], because it seems like [NAME OTHER] is not doing very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not, I think she might have like breast cancer problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because like her family has like a history of that and so she's been going like routinely and like she, the very beginning of like the square, she had to like, she had a mass and like they biopsied it and she was fine and then now they found like two more and he's supposed to go visit her on Monday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so now I'm like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Isn't that un, unheard of in your 20s?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, it's, her family has a history of people getting it young, her mother, I think and her grandmother and like aunts or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usually in the 20s, when people, you know, when they get, uh, cysts and stuff, it's, it's what they call fibrocystic breast disease where they, they form these lumps and cysts, but benign.  You, I could, I'm not, it's not my area -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They are saying that they can't, like for some reason, they can't biopsy them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So she has to just have surgery to have them removed regardless of whether or not they're cancerous or benign -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just, I feel like he's like I don't know, I feel like that's part of the reason why he's like acting like more playful now just because he's probably going to like not have a great time there, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like he was supposed to sort of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, earlier today him and [NAME OTHER] were arguing and like yelling a lot and so I got really upset so I went to go take a shower and then I came out and they were fine, which made me angry because I've just been getting really angry lately.  And that made me really mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, uh, I know you're a close family, but, on the, on the downside, when one person is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and I was really expecting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not doing well, it seems to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm frustrated because like I was doing really shitty at school and I just wanted to come home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We have tissues right there.  All right, so you started, you, you were doing fine for a while and now, and now you've been feeling depressed for a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, and you're only on that tiny bit, that, that 25 mg of Seroquel, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are on 50?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you imagine being higher or you, you feel it would make you too tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, right now it's making me too tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's not an option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to sleep like 10 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so it's not an option.  It's a bummer because it, it's very helpful sometimes but the side effects are limiting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Those, I didn't even know that [NAME OTHER] wasn't feeling well until yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, because in my head, I was like it's really weird that like I'm not feeling well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that he is feeling better with all of it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I found out yesterday that he wasn't, it's really weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the Seroquel, he was on a little more than you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he seemed real good for a while where you were always not quite, you know, but you're on less.  But, then he started not doing as well, so I thought maybe we'd really landed on a good spot, but, but we have to keep working at it I think.  Now, what your mother asked me was about the Lithium and in October we tried going up to 3 and you, you said you actually felt worse.  I don't know how long of a time we gave that.  Yeah, we gave it a couple of weeks, actually.  We went up a smidge to 750 and you actually said, felt worse.  Um, and you were still cycling, and that's when we added the Seroquel.  So we've done, Abilify and Seroquel for you.  We have not done Zyprexa.  We've not done Risperdal.  We've not done Invega.  You remember I said to you Invega, the concern I have is that Risperdal and Invega are almost the same and they can elevate uh, prolactin levels, I mean, you might remember me saying that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not, um, prolactin is what you secrete when you're going to have a baby, so, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That would kind of suck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it would suck if it were symptomatic, I mean if it's a little bit and it was asymptomatic, it would be fine, but if it's, if it's more than that, then, you know we're doing something that we don't want to do in an unhealthy person, so I'm, that's that one we're actually trying on [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He didn't really seem -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I have a little more reluctance ironically to do it in a, in a young woman than in a, in a, in a guy.  Um, and there's other medicines that we, and we know already that, or at least we think already that antidepressants don't suit you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Although we haven't really tried that many, right?  Zoloft had a bad, that was, uh, bad, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin was bad in [NAME OTHER], but we never really tried it in you.  And then this other group of medicines that are in the same family as Lamictal, other anticonvulsive medicines that we use like Trileptal and Tegretol.  So I guess I have to decide, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a bummer.  Remind me what happened with Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, do you know what month it was?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was May.  Here I have you felt hyper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, that's where I wasn't sleeping and I like rearranged all the rooms in  -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The upstairs of the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And there's a lore or a belief that Wellbutrin, which is a nice antidepressant, is less apt to cause that than a medicine like Zoloft, but it's not an absolute.  We have how long till you have to start school again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we have time to try some stuff.  If I were to have your mom come in, what else should we talk about before we include her, because I wanted to, I know she wants to be included in this discussion about the medicines.  What else, what else should I know is going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I'm just feeling very weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you mean, weird?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I'll feel like I can like, remember a long time we talked about how you were saying how sometimes people feel like they're not, like there, but they're, like, I don't know, I keep feeling like I'm hearing myself talking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But like I don't realize that I'm the one talking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So a little bit disassociated feeling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like little separated from yourself a little bit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I'll get agitated and start like saying something and it's like I'm not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, normal people can have that experience, it's not, you know, um, a very unusual experience, but if you're having a lot, it's unpleasant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, how did it work out with the long distance relationship over this semester?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's doing well.  I'm starting to do that thing again where I think people are dead, like I use to do at like the really beginning, really like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, say that again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like at the very beginning when I wasn't on any medicine -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would like, if I didn't hear from someone, I would like, feel like they were dead -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like there's, like two weeks ago I had to like call my boyfriend's friend at school who I like, barely know, because I like, couldn't do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To see if he was okay?  Uh-huh.  What made you feel that something was going on with him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, it was like 6:00 PM and I hadn't heard from him and it was like, like I usually do, but it's not like, and like I knew he was probably sleeping, because like he's always, he sleeps ridiculous times because he goes to bed, like in the morning, and then he doesn't wake up until like 7:00 at night, but like, for some reason it just like, I don't know, like I knew he was sleeping, but I couldn't convince myself of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it happened again with my friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Any other weird things happening?  Nothing else you can think of?  Or something that you don't want to talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] to keep up.  Talk too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are these, do these weird feelings, worried about people, thinking about death, feeling disassociated, do they always correlate with feeling depressed?  Like when you're having these things, it's when you're kind of depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's usually when I'm kind of depressed, but then I just get really, really anxious, like I can't sit down -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll like, I don't know, I felt, like, I'll like sit there and get sad about it, but then mostly I'll just like start getting extremely anxious and like, like I'll start crying, but it's more like nervous crying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what, what are you feeling at those times?  What do you think is, what, what are your thoughts are going through your head?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I start thinking about like what I would do if they were dead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So you're spending a lot of the time during these days, during the day with these morbid thoughts?  So this is the kind of stuff that you were having well, before we even started, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, sh, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just get, I'm out of myself for thinking.  It's like on the way here, I was thinking about how, if like you purposely crashed a car and my parents would have to pay for the, like pay for it, the insurance wouldn't cover if you do it on purpose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was thinking how this during this weather, no one would know.  Well, like, I, I, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it must be rotten to, to be having these feelings all the time.  Again, other people do have these feel, feelings, but not all the time, that's the difference, you're having them so much.  You're spending so much time during the day having these morbid feelings so we've got to knock them out.  Well, when you first went on the Seroquel, it seemed to help, lifted your mood, seemed like it was doing something good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now when you first went on the Abilify, that happened, too, but then you got all antsy.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, I see that, it, it, it kind of makes sense that a medicine in that category might be used.  Um, [NAME OTHER] was on Zyprexa which you were never on.  But that's, again, in a, in a, in a woman, it's very sedating, it can be very sleeking, um, [INAUDIBLE] usually, it just seems like [INAUDIBLE] don't have to worry about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, um, well, as much as you're having these thoughts, you, does your boyfriend know you're having them?  Yes.  You're family knows you're having them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes.  Do you feel you have enough outlets to talk about, you know, what you're going through?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I mean I wasn't going to talk to anyone else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  But, um, it's, sometimes the hardest part about having these kinds of thoughts, I mean, I think you're having symptoms.  I don't think these, it's important first to say when you have thoughts like this, it doesn't mean that those are real.  It doesn't mean, you know, they don't define you, it doesn't mean that we should give them proper weight.  In other words, you might think, okay, I'm going to, um, take a shower, I'm going to wear this pair of jeans and then, you know, then you have the morbid thought.  It's natural to give them all equal weight, but you shouldn't because we want to define this as in a normal thought, as a symptom, as something that's going to go away once we, we figure it out.  So that's very important, you know, I mean, and people have all kinds of thoughts that they shouldn't give equal weight.  When people are very insecure and they think that they're funny looking and everything, they're stupid or whatever, those shouldn't be given equal weight, you know.  And, uh, and this kind of thing should not be given equal weight.  So that's important, but still, one of the worse things about having these kind of thoughts is walking around with them and not being able to expel them, like sometimes telling somebody, talking about it, you know, and then not freaking out or anything, helps you do a little better, you know, like a little unburdened, and so it's, it is a burden to walk around all the time and have them and not being able to, to talk about it to anyone.  So that's a concern to me because your boyfriend's at a different school, you're not always with your parents, I mean, now you're on break, so that's good, but I think, would it give you permission to let people know you're having all these crummy thoughts.  You want to have your mom come in, can we talk about it a little bit?  Bring her up to speed or are you worried about making her nervous or upsetting her or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've not been telling her about everything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that because you're embarrassed or because you don't want to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I want to like talk to my family a little bit.  So she just starts checking on me all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  So you don't want to be the sick person?  Well, that certainly wouldn't require it.  I'm just trying to think of how we can help you, you know, deal with it better.  Could you figure out a way, I mean, if you write these things down, does that allow you to dismiss it more easily?  Does talking with your boyfriend about it help at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It helps, um, to write stuff down, but like, I don't know, if that's really like, good, it's been like I can keep reading them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which I feel like is bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like the opposite of getting rid of it, it's like there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you could title it bad thoughts I probably shouldn't be having and you can write it down and then you can enjoy and say, well now I don't have to think about it anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What else could we do that might help, you know, you shake them off a little more easily?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could get your little digital tape recorder.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And listen to myself talk?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, you don't have to listen to it, you just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just say okay, I had this thought and then, then you don't have to think about it anymore, because, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks, if I didn't feel crazy before now, I'll talk to myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You filed it away.  We want you to be able to acknowledge that you're having them.  It is a symptom.  It's not going to be forever.  Um, we're going to figure out how to help you with that uh, but at the moment is lousy so we want you to be able to not be miserable all through your break, right?  Um, you, you feel if you tell your mother, she's going to worry about you and hold your hand and say how you feeling all the time and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we could tell her to not do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't know about that.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm going to let you decide what to do.  But, um, you could always leave a message on the machine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And say what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Say, okay, I'm having a this stupid thought I just wanted to share with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just wanted you to know that happy Hanukkah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Right.  Felt like sharing.  All right, well let's see if we can knock them out all right, I'm going to have her come in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We can just be nonspecific.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just tell her that I'm still not feeling good, okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dang tape recorder does taping that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's very hot in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hot in here.  Yeah, do you know what happens?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't you like it?  You know I hate the cold.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's really hot in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the, in the corner, um, there was a lot of cold air coming down, so I had this heater and, um, I put that on and once it warms up, it really gets hot, plus when the heat does run, because this rooms colder, it runs a lot into this room so it gets real hot and then it gets real cold when it stops and then gets real hot again.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think because it has so many windows.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> There's a corner?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No it's the tip, tip, tip, tip.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there's a corner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, so we all agree that [PATIENT NAME]'s not doing so good.  You asked me on the phone about the Lithium.  We had tried going up a little bit, and she said she felt worse.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, that's why I said to check your records.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it seemed, I mean, again I hate to mirror the two kids, but it seemed like that there was a ceiling on that Lithium as well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What was her reaction so, did you go up to 750, is that what it was, the extra 150?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, that's right.  That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, that's what I thought it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And so, because that's why we ordered the smaller bottle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And you, you felt worse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know, we're on the Lamictal.  Do people go higher?  They do, usually, usually we feel that we're getting what we're going to get from the 200.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, did the, did we feel that the Lamictal helped with your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like it had some antidepressant properties?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it did.  It felt better once we added that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It felt better once we added that.  Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that and the Lithium at the same time felt better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We did it at the same time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I still have them both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I know, but what, which came first?  Lamictal was there first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It felt better once we had them together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I thought that, that once you hit this 200 with the Lamictal, didn't we do that one time with [NAME OTHER] raise it and it just seemed like we just went back to what was considered the maximum dose for that, like [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not an official maximum and, you know, with most medicines, there's not a single dose, you know there's a wide range -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But this one we seemed to kind of pause at 200 in bipolar disorder.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because like you're saying a little higher might help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who, who's to say, I mean, if she has a rapid metabolism with that medicine or something.  Um, it was studied at 50 and studied at 200, you know, who's to say that she could be on 275 or something, you know, but it, it's a maybe.  You know, the Lithium, it seems like there's a ceiling.  The Seroquel in both kids seemed to initially have the best result for them, independent of the side effects.  It's too tiring, you know, you can't be on much of it, but it seemed like initially it had beneficial effect.  Um, so, I, I do wonder about using a medicine in that category.  But it's not a fabulous category, because we have Zyprexa which [NAME OTHER] ultimately found dulled and sedated him.  Uh, we have Abilify which was too activating for both of them.  We have Geodon which, um, is, is, is a, is a possibility, um, it's a hard one to start.  Sometimes it's too tiring, sometimes it's too activating, it's a hard one to start.  But, it's a possibility.  I think the reason that we tried the Risperdal with [NAME OTHER] is because there such small increments, you can go up little by little, which is attractive.  Um, I kind of talked about Risperdal with, with [PATIENT NAME] a long time ago and I said, well, the thing about it is, a common side effect is elevated prolactin level.  Now if it does a little bit, and, um there's no symptoms, then it's good to give okay.  But if it does it a lot, it's not good to you, okay?  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's shaking her head.  So, uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sounds great.  Free milk.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Does [NAME OTHER] know about that?  [LAUGHING].  I'm sorry, oops.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Is [NAME OTHER] going to start lactating?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How come you didn't tell me about that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, um, well if he, if he sticks with it, we'll check it, as -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But anyway, despite that, I'd think about trying it because -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Try what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Risperdal.  Because it's not too this and it's not too that.  It's not too -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Still I'm very concerned, because I'm not sure if it's really, I don't know if that's the drug, my family was wondering if we were going to be taking [NAME OTHER] off of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  We're kind of on the fence, like I'm saying give it a chance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But it seems like, for example -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of course, she's got [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's had a very, he seems a little manic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yesterday he seemed somewhat manic, he seems that he's been a little more happy and then not happy, you know like more of the ups and mixed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's weird.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And it seems like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do not like him when he was yelling at [NAME OTHER] today.  He sounds like a creep actually.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, well, I think that, um, yeah that was right when you called, so that was the whole incident, and it's like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was afterwards, actually.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But you know what, I think that that was partially, um, when I went to talk to [NAME OTHER], afterwards, he seemed to be, um, really good actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I think that what -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When, did you talk to him after I yelled at him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, there you go.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So I think that, what we're facing, I don't mean to go back and forth, what we're facing really for [NAME OTHER], being the youngest sister of two siblings -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And a father -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's, um, you know, we recently told you, so being all of this happening in one year is a lot for anyone -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And for everybody -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I think that for [NAME OTHER] especially, I think that what she seems to forget is that [NAME OTHER] and [PATIENT NAME] beyond the fact that they are both bipolar, I think that she don't, she doesn't realize it also getting older.  And that neither problem she would have had, whether they were bipolar or not, like about [NAME OTHER] wanting to go to California to spend the holidays with his girlfriend's family and his girlfriend, because it's also her birthday.  So I think she's upset about that and I think that that's where this was where all the fight was coming today was the fact that you weren't going to be home for the first day of Hanukkah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't be yelling at me, yell at [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, no, no, but the reason was she, it was almost like what really happened was she had just learned that [PATIENT NAME] was going to a concert the first night of Hanukkah.  She was extremely upset about [NAME OTHER] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who are you seeing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wu-Tang Clan.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, God.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's my boyfriend's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I thought you'd be seeing Vampire Weekend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I already saw them.  Saw them like four weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So, you know what I'm saying is I think it was the icing on, on the cake, or whatever you want to say, is what happened was she just learned that about [PATIENT NAME] and she staying in the kitchen baking, you know how she always, she's always baking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She yelled at him for putting milk out.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And see, he put the milk down on the island and then she yelled at him, what are you doing, you know smiling at me, and he says I'm mad and yelled back at her, this is not your kitchen, you know, and he gets mad and so they were yelling back and, which usually he doesn't say anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, and so -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So I think that that's what happened was it wasn't the milk on the table, it was more I'm really mad at you because you and I were all going to be here for the holidays and now [PATIENT NAME]'s not going to be here for the first night of Hanukkah so that's where it was coming from and that had nothing to do really with the bipolar, it happens to do with getting young adults who, I went to Florida on vacation -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're never going to have three kids never fight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know, I know, they were all starting to get along very well and I think that's what it was -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did you hear the way he yelled at her when she came back downstairs?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I was on the phone call with the airline and so I was trying, I finally got the airline on the phone -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she was not appropriate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, but you know, again, let's -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But what's funny is that he said a lot of things maybe that he shouldn't have said but the thing about it is that she also said things which, in some ways it explained it to [NAME OTHER] a lot of what he might have said was true, and a lot of what she might have said was she was very immature, whatever the hell she was saying, and a lot of that might have all been true, but there's the right way to do it.  And that's the thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I would tell you that, if, if you know [NAME OTHER] were to come here and you wanted a therapist's appointment, we would just kind of write this off to, you know, he's away in school, now he's back, their fighting, stop fighting, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, all right, so back to [PATIENT NAME], so you're not excited -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not excited to -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm mixed about, that's why I asked you about the Lithium because the truth is, is that Lamictal and, the Lamictal and the Lithium are the best [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mom, don't start lecturing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But that's the thing is that they're really the best ones.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stop lecturing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're not the doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know I'm not the doctor, but we're talking about Risperdal -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not really true.  Lamictal is very attractive.  Lithium does have more side effects as you go up in dose.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But they're not that high.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depends on the person.  Some people don't find it tolerable at all, some people find it fine, um, the other one to consider is Geodon.  Now it's tricky to get on, but it lacks the prolactin side effect, it usually doesn't cause leaking.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Why are you saying it's tricky to go on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, you, it's one of those medicines, stop biting your nails -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I've done it since I was like [AGE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, but, he's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Grandpa yelled at me all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see, let me see them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're terrible, I can't not bite them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I bite my cuticles, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's terrible.  Is, is this the fingernail of a young lady?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  I'm not a young lady.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's, here's, here's, I used to bite my nails, too -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] .</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you know you go like this, and you pull it and go, uh, huh!  And it's like half gone, you know, oh, that's not a good idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See, I don't pull it, I leave it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you have better teeth, but you know what I did, around your age, plus, minus, you get a little nail trimmer, you know, for like $3, and you cut them nice and short -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You see, then I start biting my skin -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they bleed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You cut, you cut them nice and short and nice and rounded -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Might as well wear gloves all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when they get a little longer, and you can't say you cut them nice and short, somehow I was able, just by doing that, to get out of that habit of biting them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't think that's going to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have like cuts all over the sides of my nails because I bite so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not an aesthetic thing, it's a nervous thing?  Could we give you something else to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some, maybe you could start smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and get yelled at.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I told her to drink coffee, it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about gum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  And [NAME OTHER] was teaching me about chewing tobacco.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, some chaw.  How about gum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Gum?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about a binky?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Not a bad idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good [INAUDIBLE] Elmo or wear puppets all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean, I don't know, like you said, I, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So Geodon, the thing is you have to start at a moderate dose, you can't just be on a little bit, and a little bit, and a little bit.  It's not well tolerated.  You have to be, you start on, in other words the, the, the target dose would be 120 to 160 and you start on 40 twice.  So you start on 80, um, you know sometimes it's too tiring.  Sometimes it's too activating.  Sometimes a little of both.  So it's annoying like that, but, if it works, it's nice.  You'll like it.  If it works, it's nice.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> As opposed to taking the Risperdal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Risperdal is easier because you don't, you don't see any [INAUDIBLE], a little more, a little more, a little more, so that makes it easier to start.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But Geodon does lack the prolactin elevation, which is a big liability if I give Risperdal.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, but like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How quickly would you feel, like would you know it's good or bad, like how, like she takes this new -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, like any medicine, you know, it, it might be within hours or days, that you hate it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, otherwise, then, it's, you know, days to you know a week or two to see if it's helping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if it feels bad immediately then do you know what I mean, like could I just wait?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Would you, thinking you've started out with the 80 with for the total per day -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And like you're reaction can be either A, B or C, I'm going to tell you the action is, what would your reaction be, what is your action -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I don't know.  Clean my room.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, but you know what I'm saying.  Like, if her reaction is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we could stop it on a dime.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It, so you can, you know how it is, will you know, well you know sometimes we have to give it a chance, what would you say give it a chance, that she started out Wednesday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know the deal, call me and if it's terrible, we'll probably stop it, if it's a little funky, then we might give it a few more days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  So you just want to do that 1 instead?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is that something that you could, so what is she going to do then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because there's other options, you know, there's adding another anticonvulsant like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would I take that at night, or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You take it twice a day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Forty so it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It seems like, I, I just have this impression, this vibe that it seems like this is the missing, for example, I think we could have her on twice of Seroquel and that might be that, she might do better, if she was on more, but she can't tolerate more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If, um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I think I agree with you, because I think -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get symptoms when I take the Seroquel.  I feel like it like replaced the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It did replace the Klonopin.  So, but again, if we get you real good, then you might not need it again, a young -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Person doesn't usually need it [INAUDIBLE].  So, you, we might be able to do that, but, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What would I do for now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you're taking 50 right?  We could probably lower you to 25, add the Geodon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, that works.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because I think the with the Sero thing [NAME OTHER] was doing great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The Seroquel 75 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, if you're getting also tired -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah that's what happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then we might have something, right, so that's why I was wondering if we could put something in that category that would be interesting too.  So let me see if I have samples.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That would be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  Hello.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't even keep anything closed.  [PHYSICIAN NAME] is a very good doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know about classical musical?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's making me look classy.  I think, that [NAME OTHER]'s hot, but I can't remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We had to take a whole course on classical music at one point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really, did it make you classy?  Well -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Don't you take scuba diving next semester?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's cool.  Well -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's a nice [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] would be jealous.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not with this, I don't have any samples, unfortunately, I have a ton at the other place.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Ugh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You could give me the fancy case.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, I mean it's up to you if you wanted to wait until Monday, I could get you some samples -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, we can start it and you could give her samples, too.  Or, or, that's stupid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, um, today's Friday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Are you still wanting to start it, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you, is, do you, hit the place where you get, uh, reimbursed, for prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I mean we probably did, but then now because of this, the time of the year, it starts all over again on [DATE], so I could go do that there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All right, sounds good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean, is it a generic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no, it's real expensive.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really, very funny, ha, ha.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you pay a percentage or you pay a copay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you pay a percentage or a copay?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, I'm supposed to pay a copay, but if it's not a generic, then it's the highest copay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's up to $50.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you, you see it would be much, I mean, she might hate it after two doses, so it's a bummer.  I get a lot samples, but I don't have samples here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We could start like this and if I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> See how much I love you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so let's start at 40 twice a day, the key is you have to take it after eating, so that's why -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got a headache.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take it after breakfast and dinner.  See this is for AM and this is for PM.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, you have to have full meals?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's cool.  You're obsessed with food.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I'm not, I'm just asking you a question.  If you, if you, she has to have it after meals, that means you really have to eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See what I mean, she's obsessed with me eating.  I eat every day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and, and, in fact, um, not just like a cookie, but they really say, like calories, you know, like 800 or 12, you know, like a real meal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I only eat two meals a day, now.  Are you saying -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which ones are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to eat 1,500 calories a day?  Two thousand?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which, which meals do you eat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm going to start eating two meals a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So eat a real breakfast.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You weren't even eating two meals a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm saying now I'll have the shorten it to two from eating like four -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know why -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to divide it up.  I'd rather have it in a big lump.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right so eat, eat a real breakfast and then take it and eat a real dinner and then take it.  Start tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't start tonight.  And, and knock the Seroquel down to 25.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then let's see how that is.  So Geodon 40 twice.  Let's, we'll try it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'll write it as if you're taking 3 a day because we might advance it up to, you know, 40 and 80, or 80 and 40 but, uh, we'll start with 40s.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So it's probably better, like you can make it 110 now since it's before [DATE].</p>

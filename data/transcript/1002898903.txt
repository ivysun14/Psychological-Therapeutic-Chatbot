<p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p>

<p>David Mee-Lee is a leading expert in co-occurring substance use and mental disorders with over thirty years experience in person-centered treatment and program development. He is not your usual psychiatrist, nor is he your usual educator. He writes and speaks in down-to-earth, jargon-free language and makes learning challenging and enjoyable. Audiences consistently express satisfaction with his combination of rich content and practical approach delivered in his engaging style. His down-to-earth upbringing in Australia coupled with his Chinese heritage makes for an interesting mix of dry humor and quiet wisdom.</p>

<p>David is a Board-certified psychiatrist and is certified by examination of the American Board of Addiction Medicine (ABAM). David has trained and consulted for hundreds of organizations, ranging from small mental health centers to government departments and national behavioral healthcare companies. David has also authored a number of book chapters and papers in a variety of professional publications. He is Chief Editor of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria and is Senior Vice-President, The Change Companies.</p>

<p>David's medical, psychiatric and addictions training began in his home country of Australia. From there it took him to Ohio, Massachusetts, Hawaii and eventually California. He has trained and consulted in almost every US state, and his international work has taken him to Australia, Japan, Singapore, Germany, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.K.
David Mee-Lee is the Moderator in the session that follows. He is interviewing this "65 yr old woman" in this role-play to illustrate how to attempt to engage a person with fixed delusional thinking.  The interaction is less around her psychotic thinking and more around helping her stay in the housing she now finds comfortable.

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>MODERATOR: Now, this is a male or female?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: This is a female client. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: A female client, about how old?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: 65.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, have a seat. Now, you have a seat. And the setting is what? She's 65, and what sort of setting?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Senior apartment complex.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Senior apartment complex, 65, and you've been working with her for a while? She's your client?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Yes, about six months.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Six months, okay, and what is...why did you think of her to present today?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Because she has fixed delusions of government conspiracies but the actual problem that we're facing that is imminent is that she is in danger of being evicted.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: From the assisted living?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: From the senior apartments.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: From the senior apartment. Okay. So, the government is doing what to her? So...</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: She says that they've been using her, abusing her, treating her like garbage, that she's a terrorist to them, and...</p>

<p>MODERATOR: All right, and she's being on the edge of being evicted because of what? </p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: She is not paying her rent. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Not paying her rent. Okay. Good. All right. Well, I'd say, I'm going to then take this and obviously, I don't know all about the case, but I'm going to be you in this situation and like we said, sort of reviewing the treatment plan, and what will we call her? What HIPAA name shall we call her? Just a first name?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Okay, we can go with Agnes. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Either way, I win, right? Well, Agnes, we've been working together for six months or so and we have to review your plans from time to time, and as for apart from that, I realized I'm not sure what's the most important thing you want me to help you with, and so what is it that you want me to help you with, Agnes?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well, they need to stop using me. They...I'm important. I'm the most important person. I worked for President Reagan and they just used me all the time, and they need to stop.</p>

<p>[0:02:23.2]</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, is that what you want me to help you with? To get the government or whoever is doing this to stop?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well, I don't know if you can help me. I'm a very important person and...what experience do you have? You're so young you don't know about all this.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, I'm sure there's a lot that you can help me with but I am assigned to work with you so I want to help you as best as I can. I appreciate you being willing to sit here and work with me on it. But I don't know what to help you with. So you said I can't help to get them off your back? Is there anything else I can help...can I help you tolerate being, having this happen to you, or the stress of that? Or is there anything else I can help you with?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well, how would you get them off my back?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, I don't know if that...I don't even know if that's the most important thing you want me to help you with, because there are other things that I can help you with as well.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: What can you help me with?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, one of the things somebody told me that you haven't been paying your rent and that you might end up being out of here, and I didn't know if you were happy with this living environment or whether you would want to be somewhere else, or whether you don't care if you get evicted. </p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: They've been moving me! They've been moving me, and to places with drugs and alcohol. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: And they've been moving me all around for years and years.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: And not very nice places, you mean? Places you don't like to be at?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Terrible places.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Terrible places, yeah. Well, is this place a place that you do feel is better than the other places you've been to?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I...I like it here. And the government, they need to pay for it.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah. So, you would like to stay here if at all possible? Is that...</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Is that something you would like me to help you with? To stay here?</p>

<p>SF: Yeah.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, yeah. She's a good person.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: She is, I trust her.</p>

<p>[0:04:24.9]</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Really? I mean, yes. That's good. That's not something I (inaudible) put that on the air. Well, that's...yeah, no, she's...she's an impressive person. Now, what do you want to do, though, about staying here? Now, firstly, is that the most important thing you want to have with her? Because you also said you were (inaudible) the government being on your back and all that, but you weren't sure I could help you with that. So, getting the government off your back and not doing all the things to you, you (inaudible) stay here in a place that you like?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: The government needs to pay me. They need to pay me a million dollars because they've been abusing my family for years.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, and that's another thing that you'd like the government to do? Now, is that something that you want me...see, I don't know which of these are most important that you want me to help you with. Getting the government to pay a million dollars, helping you to stay here in this place, getting them off your back, you know, treating you this way. Which of those three things would you like me to help you most with? You know, to stay here at this place you like, getting the government to pay a million dollars or getting them not to be treating you however they're treating you?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I want to stay here and the government should pay for it.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: You want to stay here and the government should pay for it?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, well, I have to check on that to see if that's possible because I have a feeling that staying here but getting the government to pay for it may not be possible. Because I don't want to set you up having you to stay here or something, I'd be willing to work on. If you want to stay here and have the government, well, I'd have to check and see if that was possible. I've got a feeling it may not be, but I'd be willing to put that on hold until I find out for sure. Now, if I find out that they won't let you stay here and they pay for it, would you still want me to work on helping you to stay here?</p>

<p>[0:06:13.6]</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Yes, you're a nice, sweet girl and I would like you to help me. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yes. And I'm very trustworthy, too, and, so I really want to...so I'm a bit like Hillary, though. No, but I'd say I want to have you to stay here. Now, why is it so important to stay here, because you didn't like those other places where there were drugs and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Because they've been moving me around and chasing me around and...</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I don't...I can't do that. I want to stay here.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah. Yeah, and you're settled here. Okay, well, I really want to work...now, do you know how to get to stay here, though, especially if I don't get the government to pay for it? Do you know how (inaudible) and if I can't get the government to pay for you?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: What can I do to stay here?</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Well, we have to figure that out, but one of the things is do...why have you not been paying your rent?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well, my rent, it's $820 a month and I don't get that much. The government needs to pay me. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I want my full Social Security. My friend gets more than I do.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, so you don't have enough money so we have to look at that. Anything else about why...why hasn't she been paying her rent, just on the side?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well, part of it is she can't afford it, and she stopped working. She had had a job to supplement her income, but she quit.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: All right, so there are some real money worries. Well, you know, one of the things that you were paying your rent for a while but that was when you were working, so what happened that you stopped working? Is getting some work to supplement the money you have still a possibility that we can help you with?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I...I can't work, my back hurts, and when I had a job, they thought I was a terrorist and they stole my identity, and John Ashcroft, he stole my Social Security number.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: This is more real than you think. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: All right, so...so what we have to work on is how to get you more money and to be able to stay here. We have to work on making sure that...is there...are you saying you couldn't do that job because your back? Or are you saying you couldn't do any work because of...?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I don't think I could get a job now. My back hurts and I can't work.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, so we've got to work on how to get money in. And right now, I'm not sure how you would get more money if you don't do some work, but that's something we're going to have to work on. Now, where and when do you want to work on this? Is this something you want to get busy with as soon as possible and ready to work hard with me on?</p>

<p>[0:08:58.3]</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Well, I want to stay here.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, yeah, that's what...so, let's really keep our eye on the prize. That's what we want to try to work on at all costs to try to stay here if at all possible, right? Okay. So, there's some urgency to this. So, I'm writing down what you want is to stay here because this is a nice place, better than those other places you've been bumped around to. We have to work on how to get more money, and yet, you're not sure you can do any work, so we're going to have to think how to get more money, and I've got to find out whether the government would actually pay for or help you with it. And if not...</p>

<p>MODERATOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I don't think so. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, well, if you could think about...one of the things you might think about, Agnes, is if there is any work that you could do to supplement that wouldn't be so troublesome to your back. Also, we could look at, is there something we can do to help your back? Because you're still a young, young woman, relatively, you know, you're younger than the presidential candidate on the Republican side. So, you know, there might be something you could do or maybe something we could do to help you with your back. Because it's good to feel like you're working and...</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I have a doctor's appointment next week. I'm going to see him.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay, good, well, let's make sure you get there, and we can follow on that. So, a doctor's appointment, look at your back, see if there's any work you could do. See how you can increase your money. These are things we've got to work on. We've really got to work hard together to have you to stay here if at all possible? Right? That's what you want?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I...I just don't want to work.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Don't want to work?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: No.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Okay. Why...</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I'm too old and the government needs to pay me. I don't need to work anymore. I'm an old lady.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Now, what are we working on together? Are we working on not working? Getting the government to pay a million dollars? Are we working on getting them off your back? Are we working to help you to stay here in this place? Which is most important to you that you want me to help you with?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: That I stay here.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: That you stay here. Okay. So, let's keep our eye on the prize, then, and let's work on that. And let's meet and I'll find out what I've heard about and if you can think about any other ways that you might get money legitimately or any ways that you could do some work, or to get some help for your back, whether that might help you to get some work, might be different work, but something to make up the money difference, okay? Well, thank you, Agnes, I appreciate you working with me. </p>

<p>[0:11:26.0]</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Thank you.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Let's get busy. Want you to stay there for a second. All right, so, as Agnes, now, not as her worker working with her, but just Agnes in the role play, how did that feel? Good, bad, or indifferent? Did it feel like we were fighting? Did it feel like we were helping? Was it good, bad, indifferent?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: No, you were very calm, and you listened to me. It was hard to keep going with the delusions. </p>

<p>MODERATOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Luckily, I've heard them a lot.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Yeah, yeah, so it was hard to be resistant when somebody is right there trying to hear you and take you seriously?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Good, well that was the right answer, so....now as the worker...</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: And keep, you know, trying to evoke it from the client.</p>

<p>MODERATOR: Right, right, and that's why it made it harder for you to go off on these other things. The million dollars and the...John Ashcroft and all that kind of stuff. Right.</p>

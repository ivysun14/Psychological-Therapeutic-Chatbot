<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... because it rained for five months in Ohio, took a view, and then for five hours we rode down off of that delay so I wouldn't miss my connection and have to land somewhere in Florida. So I got off the plane late two hours ago. Sometimes you have a three hours at your stop and two hours time. But I need to catch on. TBryan you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Doing okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you feeling today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm going to see James. Yes, it's a - I think we're going to kind of move towards seeing each other less often but longer, like once a month or so for four days instead of two days, which would I mean, also the biggest - well he has his job application due in October and he has to get three papers out and write it, philosophy of teaching statement and all that, before then. It's bad. But also just I'd like to take a day or so to get back in sync. I was pretty kind of tense and anxious and unhappy the first couple of days and then I felt relaxed and that was good. And now I'm back. I got another job which is great. A friend frantically trying to finish a dissertation so I offered to read it and he offered to pay for it so that worked out well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. [inaudible at 00:01:42].</p>

<p>CLIENT: And mind you I let myself in for doing a lot of work in the next couple of weeks but okay. I mean the dissertation being between 200 and 1000 pages so. But, yes. So we're watching Buffy - I mean [inaudible at 00:02:28] - and it was excellent. I think it's Season Two, but Buffy's mother dates a guy, turns out to be a robot. But the point being that he's this super nice guy but then it threatens Buffy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, the guy from Three's Company? [00:02:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. And I think that just threw me for a loop. I got really upset I think because it's a dynamic where Joy's not protecting her daughter. Joy's picking this new person's high over her daughter and so forth and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the [inaudible at 00:03:29]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he doesn't do it a lot but the point is she moves too fast. He says we, talking about Joy and himself against Buffy; he gets all of her friends on his side, and Buffy's like this guy creeps me out. Everyone's like oh he's so wonderful, you just don't like your mom dating again and happy. So she says well I guess I should keep my mouth shut. And then he threatens her and she tries to tell people that he threatened her and nobody listened. And then she accidentally killed him because he hits her and so she beats him up and he falls down the stairs. But then he comes back as this robot. [00:04:13]</p>

<p>So most of the show is one of those half very realistic kind of relationship tension and half robot. And, I guess I'm pointing and talking about this as though I don't understand why I can't just be over things. I was - my mom dated a lot of jerks; I never got molested but that was not because she was careful. It was because I was lucky. And my dad was overwhelmed so pretty much anybody - there was just a lot of people who I didn't know very well in my life who held a lot of power over me. And it's something irrationally I'm okay with. I mean I'm not okay with it but, you know. I mean I don't know, I get to decide who I get - who I spend time with. [00:06:04]</p>

<p>I don't know why I don't feel bothered by these things. And I have spent a lot of time thinking about it and talking about it and kind of saying well I guess this was not okay. Talking and hearing about it just on limited extent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was not okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That my parents didn't protect me and that they chose other people over me. We haven't had - we lived out in the country so our water came out of a well. Did I ever tell you about the water? Okay but this is one of the things that still upsets me and so I talk about it a lot. So water came from the well, it had some kind of bacteria or something in it - we never really found out because I don't think they ever had it tested - but it made me throw up when I drank it. And I said Papa the water makes me throw up. I think we need - I think something's wrong with it. I can't drink our water. And he just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old were you roughly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten to twelve. I mean it took me several years to realize that I threw up every time I drank water because I usually, I drank tea or milk or whatever. So it took me a while to realize I wasn't just drinking water too fast, it was this water was bad. And then it took me much longer after that to say something because that was me. And it doesn't go. So I tried to say the water's making me throw up, what is up with that? And kind of [inaudible at 00:08:21] ourselves. And then my father's long-time girlfriend, Karlie - did I? He dated her for 10 years. [00:08:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you mentioned her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was really wonderful in some ways and we found someone wonderful in our lives. But since she was over at our house and she had a glass of water and it made her throw up. And she said David, you've got to fix this. He said oh, oh okay, okay. And within three days we had a little...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a filter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a filter, we just didn't drink that water. We had a tank, yes, bubbly tank. Yes, that kind of thing. My mom always wanted us to be, have some strong relationships with father figures with her boyfriend. But we were like fuck no, they only last three months. I'm not going to learn your name until I've seen you at least five times. I'm sorry. I mean, not to that extent but Amanda was more that way. I was more just I'm going to be here now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean when you say I'm going to be here now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I just was polite and avoided them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I'm going to be over here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [inaudible at 00:10:24], situations where parents don't listen to children who are in trouble it makes me so angry. So angry because no, you don't do that. The child is never lying. I mean maybe sometimes the child is lying but one in a thousand cases ... [00:10:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They need to learn that lying is big even when they're not lying publicly. In other words, even if what they say they're upset about isn't what they're really so upset about, they're probably upset enough about something to be making it up that way, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that it should be taken seriously. Yes. It just makes me so angry. And I don't know why, really. I don't know why I'm still angry about these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I mean for one thing they still go on all the time in your life in the present day, although the configuration's a little bit different I think in that you're completely right [inaudible at 00:12:19] when you say you can choose your own different people, different sorts of people that are. But for being really upset about something and then sort of struggling about whether, when and how to bring it up and then I guess feeling by yourself or usually it's some clearly unintentional way but the person that wasn't sort of heard, recognized and responded to, I think that happens a lot. [00:13:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think it's different in that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think when that does happen, I feel like I dramatically overreact. I get so hurt when that happens when but it's usually almost always it's completely unintentional.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think there's some level where that doesn't matter at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, clearly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I know. That's redescriptive but yes, it's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I was in the - so James and I were driving back from the other airport. Anyway, we just spent two hours in an unair-conditioned car yesterday that we didn't have to so I'm still grumpy about that. We were talking about let's get out of here so then James said I was glad that you were on the phone with the woman on the airline rather than me. You handled that much better than I would have. I said yes. He said I would've had a really hard time controlling my anger. I said, yes, that's not a problem for me. Losing my temper is the worst possible thing that could happen so I don't [inaudible at 00:14:51] that option. But I mean it was a similar feeling of that airlines just piss me off. This flight - we don't fly American any more. This flight was bought - we had a voucher that American gave us because they cancelled our flight. [00:15:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just the sort of thing that cautions you to fly any more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes I think I could imagine that sort of situation in a way works well for you, like having to deal with an airline or an insurance company because there, as infuriating and soul crushing as that can be, everybody knows that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and also the person I'm talking to is never the person who actually caused the problem. It's easier for me not to get angry at someone who's just a woman on the other end of the line who is stuck with the job of rebooking people. But, yes, I guess so. It's easier for me to be angry and then to say okay, well, this is what we've all got to deal with and it's human behavior. If they will - my being angry doesn't affect change so I guess I'll just keep my temper and fix the problem. Does that make sense? [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well all the things that, I think that you're bringing up are internal; all of them is sort of why it is easy to manage your anger in those situations, not the fault of the person on the other end, because it's not going to help matters any. I'm thinking it's all different, which may be wrong, but it's not about why you don't get as angry or have as much to manage as in some other instances like the ones alluded to in Buffy but maybe...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not entirely sure that's true though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they're both situations where I just shouldn't be this way. I'm just as angry at the insurance company for making it so difficult for me to get coverage that they require me to have as I am about an individual doctor who mishandles my case in a way that hurts me. Maybe...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, maybe. So you're saying there can be things about like the insurance situations, that help you to manage how angry you are but you're saying you actually aren't any less angry about that. [00:19:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't think I am but on the hand once I get the insurance thing resolved then it's over and I don't think about it any more. I'm still mad at the doctor 10 years ago or whatever. I have a hard time letting go of that, which really bugs me. I really don't like being that person. So I do forget what a pain in the ass it is to fly every time, in between trips. I don't mind flying actually. I do passes really well. If there's nothing new I just kind of sit and let what happens happen. I'm pretty good with that, [inaudible at 00:20:31].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I should also say is I know you were not diagnosed with whatever side disorder that they claim and I don't know if you have that or not. But what we are talking about are what I would call sort of borderline vulnerabilities, which are...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of unmanageable anger I know is one but the rapidity of one which helps other things you taught me. [00:21:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why did you jump in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:21:21].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it was - I suspect there was something that was starting to make you a bit anxious about what I was saying or where I was going. And that you jumped in to, in a small way, to sort of take some control over what was happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly, although more specifically and although weirdly. I just want to be clear if I do have borderline personality disorder I'm okay with that. I mean on one level I'm not okay with that but overall I really am. So I just wanted, I kind of want to say I've read about this, I've considered it and it's okay. We can talk about this. So talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What - are you okay and not okay with the title?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not okay with it because I'm pretty sure my mom has BPD and she's done a lot of damage to people in her life and I wouldn't want to be doing that kind of damage. I am okay with it because the point of diagnosis is to help. It doesn't mean anything other than this is what my work concerns. [00:23:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're really scared of being like her? Again, there's something - I guess it does feel like there's a way in which that label would not just be a description of what's going on but would indicate that you are like her in...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I can tell myself that the label is descriptive but I feel it as prescriptive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I totally get it. I understand. There's been a break here on these terms, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, like you said I'm not sure about it but what I'm referring to with the, I guess, phrase like borderline vulnerabilities are intense reactions - could be anger, could be sad, could be hurt, could be frightened - to in branches in which you've been kind of ignored, in the mud, struck down, pushed away by somebody, something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I'm supposed to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And which feel sort of from a cool distance like tremendous over-reactions or which push you very quickly into wanting to act in some way. In other words, it's very hard to just contain currently the intensity of them. Feels like it's too much and it feels like you're going to fall apart from it. [00:25:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that makes sense. I guess what scares me is that I kind of have gradually learned or had to gradually learn to kind of you have to put limits for your own self-preservation on relationships with people who are difficult, people like my mom, people like my ex-boyfriend. That it doesn't matter how much you care for somebody, you have to put limits on that to take care of yourself. And I don't, yes I'm just terrified that people are going to have to choose between taking care of themselves and being in a relationship with me. I talked to James a lot about that this weekend but... [00:27:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I imagine in a way you're working very hard, very often to protect both the other person and yourself from their having to make that decision. I'm sorry, I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'll be back in a second. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. He got completely, royally pissed off when he heard that the guy that I just mentioned choosing the claim thought I had borderline. I think because, or and the way that whole day went, being that his mom's a psychologist and so what he knows about borderline is historically that's where you stick people that you don't know what to do with or that are difficult. [00:29:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is some truth to that because especially in certain contexts and sometimes in the past but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I didn't know that until you told me so he really upset and I didn't know why, but he expressed to me this anger I didn't know he had but it was fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I guess I do think it can also provide some helpful sort of descriptions of things that happen to people that can otherwise be confusing and I think one thing that has been a tongue [inaudible at 00:30:57] for you is when a very strong reaction to something with this kind of disguise. It's unclear what you're reacting to or why you're reacting that way or why the reaction would look like it does. [00:31:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I - yes, I guess that's what's managing how said reaction plays out in front of other people that I can't actually deal with it. That's how - and I don't understand. Even look at my life for the last 12, 13 years I'm very good at building sealed relationships. I'm very good at that. And my oldest friends are my closest friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you don't have the things that so often goes along with borderline personality disorder where people have very unstable and explosive relationships. I mean that's generally thought of as one of the hallmarks. And you don't have that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I guess what I don't understand is why can't I trust that? I, yes, I can't believe that my relationships are going to continue to be stable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, actually maybe that's a better way for me to put it. As in maybe it says a lot about you as I think about it. You know, maybe you do and don't have that characteristic. You don't in the sense that if you're looking at the actual sort of interactions and behaviors in ways you and the people you're close to treat each other, it wouldn't look anything alike. But if we look at your internal version of the relationship, your worries about it, ways you work to sort of contain or manage yourself out of fear of doing it harm, then things get more complicated. [00:33:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. I mean I don't do the thing - I don't - the way that I look at other people or think about other people doesn't fluctuate dramatically. I get very angry at people but that's not - it doesn't mean that I think of it in view of those changes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I - that totally makes sense to me. Right, you don't do the thing where you - like one day somebody's awesome; the next day they completely suck. You tend to have - it's not that [inaudible at 00:34:29] I can't have various nuances end over end, that's where people get off on, especially when they're worked up because they're hard to maintain. But it doesn't seem to be the case for you. I'm agreeing with you that it's not like that. Even if you end up fighting or temper's running high or you're really worried, I think some of this could happen maybe if it's around fragility and worrying about fragility destructiveness thing, but that - you know I can think of a few other words, where you were that through some combination of what the other person can handle and what you're going to dish out, you're going to be really alone. But I think that can sometimes vary depending on how you're feeling but that's not much else that I can think of that I know about. [00:35:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I do - it's really hard for me to be in a situation where I am upset with either person or have a fight without feeling that that relationship is on a precipice, yes. I really don't understand. I mean I do but also...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Here I imagine it feels familiar and clear but it's hard to understand why it feels that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, just because I figured out the dynamics is one thing doesn't' mean that it's going to go away. And I have a hard time dealing with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel any of that kind of worry or upset from our talking about this now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It feels fine. Yes, I guess I feel - I guess I'm anxious that you will think that I have been over-reacting in the past when I tell you about these situations with other triggers that didn't go necessarily well and I worry that you will think that I am, I don't know, pig-headed or something. Which if I think it through I don't actually think that but I get anxious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me also make a position statement, which is and which may be different from your position but I'll lay it out there anyway. I don't actually think there's anything - I don't think over-reactions really exist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to go away and think about that for a while. I mean you talk about that [inaudible at 00:38:00].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean sure from the perspective of what may be socially appropriate or what may be expectable, I know what somebody is usually referring to when talking about over-reacting. But I think always when it becomes clear what was actually at stake in that moment or what's really going on emotionally, I don't think there's any such thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That's a very kind way of looking at it. Yes, sorry [inaudible at 00:39:18].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I have things to do. Yes, but I guess I'm sort of playing Devil's Advocate here but I guess I tend to think of things from the viewpoint of futility. I mean there's certainly reactions that are not appropriate or are not helpful that don't get both people what they want. And I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually disagree with that too. I think I understand what you mean in that there are sort of more or less constructive ways in a sense to have a conversation about something for people. Like it one starts jumping up and down screaming and swearing and the other person when they're asked if they want a glass of water doesn't [inaudible at 00:40:51] what you mean. I guess the part of it that I don't agree with is that whatever was sort of done or said that lacked any kind of practical utility I think probably had a very important sort of emotional utility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yes, that makes sense. [00:41:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if you're in the middle of an argument and the argument blows up, I think your point that it's not going to sort of foster constructive discussion in that moment in a way. But it's going to show something or express something or communicate something that's more important let's say to you in that moment than the way things would've been talked about that was quote constructive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I - that makes sense. But then the image that comes to my mind, I think of the time that the glass of water. So is that like my expert take on it at 16 or 17 nearly on the back porch. I was drinking a glass of water. I think he had a fight with his mom and he came inside and he took the water out of my hand and he threw it out in the yard. I said Bryan are you angry at me? And he said no. And I said then do not do that to me. He kept doing that because that's what he does. But so I see what you mean in terms of where Bryan is coming from but what about me? [00:43:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see your point. I guess I would say that - I guess it seems to very neatly capture your dilemma in that we both say in a way in real life as in that incident you're the person who can get somebody to be true to others that could not be treated well but otherwise not feeling to be treated well, not being treated well is an important way and how you have a right to speak up about that. But I guess it hurts. I think what you're really worried about all the time and I think where I disagree is being more like Bryan. I mean that was like are you one or the other person? Please don't answer the question. But I guess my impression is you're right. You probably, purely from the point of communication, you know, what Bryan did was that very foolish? Yes, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I knew he was pissed off with his mom. [00:45:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I also knew that he was really angry at me for something that I didn't have any control over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you're totally right. I'm not quite sure what to say to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is, I mean I'm not trying to stump you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, it's important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess what I'm trying, I think what I'm trying to get at, I'll figure it out once I say it, is that I like what you were saying about over-reacting not actually being something and I think I agree with that and that makes sense to me from what I've seen of people. But if you accept that as by itself then it is no way to do things better or to change relationships. Or I don't see a way to. I don't know how you help people to hurt less.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We better stop for now but we'll [inaudible at 00:47:00].</p>

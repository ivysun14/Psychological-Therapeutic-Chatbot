<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) I've been thinking about the fact that when I came in here, and even before I came, I just felt as if there was really nothing that I had to say.  And this is something that has happened to me in a way all day.  I, I'll go to do something or I have been wanting to see somebody and I'll see them and then I can't remember why I wanted to see them.  And, or else I will know I was planning to do something and I can't remember what I was going to do.  And I just have this feeling as if there's nothing in my mind.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I wonder if it's just coincidence that you mention that the day after you also mentioned how you assume that, ah, you encounter a lot of people who've heard you talk from the recording.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I know I was thinki—, wondering — I couldn't remember what I said yesterday.  I could remember some things but I'd forgotten I said that.  But all day I've been aware that just, somehow I've felt under pressure and I didn't know exactly what the pressure was.  And so then I would say, well, it's because I'm testing the children and in the past I felt under pressure doing that.  But I really don't.  And I would, at one point I thought, well, maybe it's because we're beginning to do all the things for Christmas.  But the thing that made that pressure was that I, in doing a project I couldn't think today what I wanted to do and, and that if I could just think it out, then it wasn't anything to be pressure on me.  So it, then it made me think again about what had happened yesterday.  And all I, I can remember sort of vaguely having a feeling, perhaps it was last night or maybe this morning, of, that I was just somehow getting off the point.  (Clears throat) And I couldn't judge whether I was or whether I was just telling myself I was.</p>

<p>And I also was surprised at a reaction I had to something MSCZ said about — he was just talking about the fact that he'd been thinking about a certain relationship between himself and somebody in his family and talking about it.  And I was just very surprised that after all this time he would be doing that.  And the first thought that came to my mind then was that, well, I've talked about just about everything I kn—, I am aware of that happened to me in the past and there's nothing more to say.  (Pause) And just nothing comes to mind about anything, even from today.  And the on—, the only impression I have of today, if I think about it, is this feeling that my mind just isn't working and I just feel sort of powerless, I can't do anything.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yesterday when I asked you how you felt when you thought that you were being listened to, you said defenseless.  Now you say, powerless.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I suppose that's because my attitude is, if I'm defending myself I'm being very aggressive, which means having power of some kind.  But this powerless feeling comes partly from not being able to control my mind, that I, I know it's — I mean, sometimes that I'll try to recall things that I have thought of so I know that I, the thought is there and I don't have the control to get it.  And this is the type of thing that I'm immediately aware of anyway, that's frustrating me.</p>

<p>(Pause) And the other thing that puzzles me is I rarely think about the fact that this is being recorded.  And perhaps it's on my mind a lot more than I am aware of but it just hasn't seemed to bother me that much.  But I guess it's one of those things that I'm really just putting out of my mind.  Because I don't like looking at the microphone.  In fact, I think of all the time I've been coming here, I've only looked at it about 2 or 3 times.  (Silence) I suppose the thing about it is that I can't know what is done with it, I have to trust what you told me.  And when I think about that, I, I don't know, in a way I wonder if I've ever trusted anybody.  (Pause) I mean, it's not that I think people don't mean what they say at the time but I've just never thought that I was important enough to them, to anybody, so that if something else came up that made them feel differently, they would keep their word to me.  (4-minute silence, analyst coughs at one point)</p>

<p>I suppose it, I was just thinking of who have I ever trusted.  And I thought for a while of the close friend I had when I was in high school.  And I suppose in a way I did because, simply because I knew that she had a real feeling for me.  And then I thought of my parents and, I don't know, I began to think, well what kind of trust do I mean because I knew I could count on them to be fair with us all, but I didn't have the feeling that I had really trusted them.  So I suppose it's just based on how much you think somebody feels toward you and that I basically doubt that they loved me.  (Pause) And at first, that thought made me feel extremely sad as if they probably loved everybody else but not me.  But then I, in thinking about it, there are times when I know they show a happiness at my being around as much as anybody else, and it's probably a question how much they really can love anyone.  Because whenever they're happy, it always seems like I'm gratifying something and again, it's not love.  (Pause) And I was going to say, it's never the feeling that they're glad I'm alive just because I'm what I am.  But then I'm not sure that's what love is either.  I don't really know what it is.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>The more I think about it, though, the more I realize I associate not finding fault to a real feeling of love and an acceptance of a person just as they are so that the, any faults that might be there are not very important.  And I don't know whether this view of it comes from the fact that I always feel in my family that everyone, including me, is on their guard and constantly being critical of everybody else and finding fault.  (Pause) And not so much to our faces as, as behind our backs.  (Pause) Or at least, certainly with FNA it was because they, both my parents, and I know all of us have said things, too about FNA behind her back but we didn't say them to her face, or not very much.  And it wasn't something that she was still a person that was acceptable so we could just joke about these particular areas of her personality or her character that seemed false to us, but, I mean, they were, they were really big things.  I, I don't know, I think I always thought of her as my father's favorite because he was less inclined to do this than anybody else.</p>

<p>But then I began to think about FYC and I'm not sure that — she seems to be the one that people aren't that critical with.  (Pause) But somehow I have the feeling now, especially since her marriage, that she's taken the position of sitting up high and judging all of us, including my parents.  (Pause) And I've always felt she judges me.  So I never really felt that she particularly even liked me.  I think there was a brief time after she left college that — she finished — that I felt maybe she liked me a little bit.  And then at one point we traveled for part of a summer in europe together.  And I was very surprised that she even wanted to do that.  Because I didn't think she'd ever want to have even that much time with me.  And I just accepted, when I was at college, that she'd ignore me while we were both there together.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's sort of interesting.  My thoughts went in 2 directions after that.  First I thought again about how I feel in trusting you regarding the recording and all I could think was that sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.  And if I don't, I just felt resigned to it and that there was nothing I could do.  And then I thought of my sister and how she is with her children, which in a way is thinking about my parents and how they were, their attitude just toward having children, and how as FYC has more children — well, she only has two, but even after a while with her youn—, her oldest, MDI, she is easily exasperated and, I don't know, tries to keep pleasant with them but somehow I wonder how much she's really enjoying them.  And they both are, I think, unusually nice children.  And yet I wonder how much she can really enjoy them.  And sometimes I've thought, well, it's because of the fact that she's their mother and there's so much emotional basis for their relationship that they can't get beyond that to just enjoying each other but somehow that seems to be wrong.</p>

<p>And it's almost, I don't know, it's not exactly a duty that she's having children or that my parents did but people just do, and then once you do, they're a duty.  And sort of, the duty gets in the way of the real reason for having them.  Or maybe the real reason is that then you feel you've done something and something will go on after you die, I don't know.  But just somehow, enjoying them at that moment for what they are seems to get lost.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you see any connection between these 2 directions that your thoughts went?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I think I sort of felt one when I said it but now I can't — (pause) well, I suppose in a way, I don't know if this is what occurred to me when I first thought there was a connection but right now when I think about it, it's the question, again, of how do you trust someone who is just looking upon you as a job.  (Pause) I think especially lately that's been bothering me about how I think you must look on me and I know that's how I looked, I thought my mother looked upon me.  And not just me there, I think all of, I think I included all of us in that, but me in particular.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you think I view you as just a job, a duty to be done.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know if I attach duty so much.  Well, I guess in a way I do.  I do with my mother, I don't know if I do so much — I suppose how I see how you feel is somewhat related to what I was saying one day about how I compare myself to the boy in the book, "Dibs"  and the fact that if somebody's unusual then it would be fun to do it and interesting.  And if a person isn't, then it must be very boring.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And since you feel boring you assume I am bored.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  (Pause) And I think s—, I don't know how often I've done this but one time recently, maybe it was yesterday, when I wasn't saying anything, the thought occurred to me that if you're going to be bored anyway then maybe I could make you more bored by just being quiet.  In a very hostile way, I was thinking it.  And I think thinking it made me feel somewhat powerful too, for a while.  And then I realized the fact that it was a hostile feeling and not just a joking kind of feeling and then I felt uneasy about having felt that way and, I suppose, guilty.  (Pause) And I never thought of this before but probably I feel that way partly because, knowing that my mother, anyway, didn't ever seem to really enjoy us or have fun with us and enjoy just being a mother, I must have thought at times that if we were different, then maybe she would.  (Pause) I'm most aware of thinking, though, if she were different then what it might have been like but probably, underneath that, was the thought, what if I were different.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And maybe that's part of something that has, a kind of person that has always been attractive to me or I've always thought I'd liked to be like, is somebody who's, well, sort of like Natasha in "War and Peace", just very gay and honest and sort of innocent or childlike, and with a lot of spirit and, I don't know, the type of person that you just enjoy and you can't help yourself.  (Silence) It's funny, too, when I try to think of my mother when I was quite young and the impression I have, or when I was in grade school and coming home, and I suppose she must have smiled but I can never recall her laughing.  And late—, much later, she ha—, had a portrait done and the person who did it had her with a quite a grim expression on her face.  And, you know, there were a lot of people who were quite upset at this and said it wasn't a flattering portrait but to me it seemed the essence of my mother.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Meaning, that the artist saw what you saw.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  Because most of the time she looked that way.  By the time the portrait was done, I knew that she had gayer side but you didn't see it too often.  And certainly, when I was young that's all I remember seeing.  And then, that, that is generally the way she seems to feel, sort of grim and determined.  And it needs to be a very strong personality to lighten her up.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

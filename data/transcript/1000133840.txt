<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the nineteenth interview...nineteenth interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How you doing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay and yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, I guess. I mean...yeah. How was your weekend?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Busy. I'm getting all ready to go out, get out - except I had to go to a picnic.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't done anything. I've got to start [thinking of] (ph) unpacking. We just - Sunday - I didn't realize Monday was a holiday. It just slipped me. And Sunday we were all going to go to the dunes; my roommates and Don and I and all these people. And so we were waiting around for everybody Sunday morning. And it became an extreme hassle just waiting around people were going off. Don and I [went outside and said] (ph) to hell with this crap and we decided to go to the County. So we put some stuff together and went up there and didn't come back till last night. And it was really nice to just get out of the city. And I had a nice weekend. Monday wasn't as nice as it could have been. And driving back was a real bummer. Traffic was bad. So we stayed at my folks house Monday night. And I was just thinking driving over here I really hadn't even thought about - and it struck me coming over here, it must all be due to ending Friday anyway, but I hadn't thought about anything. Like for a couple of weeks while we were meeting, I was very consciously aware of coming here and conscious of things that happened that I thought were very worthwhile for me to talk about. And I guess as the end approaches I don't think about it. [2:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't feel that need to do that or [this is important or something]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the other thing that I thought of coming over was I guess there was - I don't know what it is. Kind of a decision not to want to talk about anything or not be conscious of anything very deep or difficult to deal with kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. [Kind of it's like so little time left. It's kind of like you don't want to start anything big that can't be -</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...finished.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...might not be - yeah, be able to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. So that kind of thing is sort of - I guess there was a consciousness of that as I was coming over this afternoon. I guess things are really mixed up all over just in terms of leaving Chicago and getting ready to get out of here and planning on the trip and all. I've finally come to decide that I'll be back in August. At first I told Don I'd be back by the first and then I sat down and looked -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The first of...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of August. Then I sat down and looked at where we were going and tried to figure out time wise and figured that I'd really be cutting myself if I tried to make it back by the first so I decided the fifteenth of August would be a good time to come back. And I think he's trying very hard to grapple with that. [3:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Accept that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And understand my going and all. In fact just this afternoon we sat down and talked - also that and this retreat this weekend with the people from Albany. I think I mentioned that we were excluding husbands, wives and all that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that this past weekend or coming?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this is this weekend. So we went out with Gary and his wife Saturday night and had a really, really nice time with them. And I guess at some point Don and Gary got a chance to talk together. And I guess he started saying to Gary that he really wanted to come this weekend. And I was a little perturbed at that because we had talked about it and I had said, "Look, no people are coming other than the staff," and I said - and he couldn't understand that. I said, "Part of it is there's a lot of work to be done. Many of us are kind of spreading out for the summer and it's sort of a thing that we want to conclude together." And he found that really hard to accept. And he mentioned it Saturday night. And I guess at some point they were talking and Gary said, well, he'd see what could be done. And I know that was said as not wanting to just put someone down and say no but trying to be nice about it. And I said, "Don't count on it." I said, "I don't think-" And then he got really defense about, "Well, what's going on?" [5:02]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "What's going on that I can't come?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and again I don't know this might be my own paranoia, "What's going on between you and Gary that I can't come? What's this group supposed to be that no one else can come?" And just haven't said much about because I'm not sure whether it's my own paranoia. He sort of created a lot of guilt feelings in me this weekend about that whole thing with Gary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About the thing with Gary. How's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I talked about the summer and I'd be gone all summer and his going out with other girls and all. I said, "You know that's fine. I think it's a good idea. It's crazy if you try and seclude yourself and all that kind of jazz." And he made it clear - I don't remember how - but in one way or another I got a clear understanding that he wouldn't be having any kind of sexual relations with anyone. But he'd be going out. And things like that that made me guilty about even considering -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Here he wasn't going to be considering having sexual relations with someone. Here he was considering seeing people perhaps but not sleeping with them. And that kind of made you feel bad because here you are and here he is here and you're considering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think what sort of happened is that I've decided that he's going to be around that that's just not going to work. And I'll feel too uncomfortable if we try to work something out; Gary and I to get together. And that it is best left the way it is. The kind of discomfort it will create for me and for Don probably too in an indirect way isn't worth it. [7:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's not worth the potential of risking the people involved and it isn't kind of worth what you get or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I only consciously decided that or really looked at it. We talked last Friday and I didn't really come to terms with dealing with that over the weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were kind of saying that you'd have to think about that and you stashed it away to think about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I haven't until this morning. I wrote a letter to a very, very close friend of mine in Connecticut. And I was telling her about the whole situation as it had come up. And as I wrote it, it sort of just clarified for me ways of dealing with that and not carrying through the potential that exists there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like not letting it (inaudible@ 8:01) [you kind of worked it out in your mind that that seemed like the best or the clearest thing to do]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that bother you that that's kind of what you decided?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I feel much better about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel like you're depriving yourself or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think I'm ready to deal with a relationship except for Don and I. I don't think I'm ready to deal with that. I don't think our relationship is such that I can deal with it. I don't think I'm at point where I can deal with it and be comfortable about it and feel completely good about it. That some of those comfortable feelings I had had are gone as a result of some of the guilt that Don has created in me. And I think he's more important to focus on than Gary is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, it's kind of like Gary is important to you but not in the same way as Don is. You don't want to risk hurting that.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I really don't. And I think some of it is just the excitement of that kind of presenting itself as an experience. And as it comes closer to realization, I'm not ready to handle that. I kind of would like to see if someday I could that and not feel guilty about it; not have it hurt Don and my relationship but just be a comfortable thing. And at this point I'd like to see that happen but I don't care too much if it does. It's not that important. I think part of that - like when we were at my folks house Monday night and yesterday. My mom and I went shopping yesterday looking for something to wear for the wedding. And then yesterday afternoon in the early evening we went through a big hassle about the wedding. My brother won't let us have it at his house. So my father turns toward having it inside again. And I found myself being really bitter that that's one thing I had really demanded. And I had said, "I'm not going to go through the hassle. If it becomes a hassle I just won't do it." And I came to recognition, hassle or not, man, I'm fighting for that. I really want that. [10:42]</p>

<p>And we went through a big deal and worked it. Don and myself and my Mom and Dad worked it out to the satisfaction of all us in terms of having the alternative. We're going to have it at their house, which is right across from the church. So that if it rains it would be very easy to move it inside without too much difficulty. And I think then it works out okay. And just things like when Mom and I went shopping, asking me things like - it's really funny, he said, "You know I don't want to be too personal but are you going to take birth control pills?" And she's really funny about it because she doesn't know anything about it except what she hears from her old lady friends. And I said, "Yeah." And I told her I'd already started taking them. And it was a comfortable kind of situation. But all those kinds of things made me realize how the focus right now has to be on Don and I and getting married in September and dealing with this summer kind of stuff. And the thing in Albany with Gary just isn't - [12:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. It's kind of like there are important things to be dealt with and they kind of focus around you and Don]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It just occurred to me now that as there's an issue at home with the wedding and all I'm not disturbed at all any longer about the situation around the abortion and not being able to share with him. And I don't know if this is good or not but it's almost as though that whole experience hasn't happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it just happened while it was there but now it feels like it just hasn't happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's almost as though it never happened. It just was so fast really. What was it? A week and a half, two weeks at the most that that whole crisis was. And I was writing Ana telling her that everything had worked out alright except for a couple of days afterward feeling really down everything was fine. And it just is almost as though it never happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And does that feel strange to you that it (inaudible@ 13:19)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess well it does in the sense that that was a huge thing for me to go through, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I guess you seemed to go through while you were in it but it's like really settled now in a way.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Maybe it's because lots of times when crisis's occur they aren't just resolved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't have an end to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when you have an abortion it's an end at least to the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess depending on what it does to you psychologically, but I really feel as though that was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It hasn't done anything to you.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's like I feel very much the same as I felt before. Maybe a little more experienced in the world kind of thing. But it's just like it never occurred and I guess that's - you know usually crisis's carry over in some way or another. And it's just sort of strange that that's [just over and gone with.] (ph) And it doesn't disturb me at all except in the sense that that was a really big crisis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now it's kind of like it doesn't have any residue there now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't feel it does at all. And I think part of it is there are so many things I'm looking forward to right now. I've got all these maps out and I've got everything planned where we're going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're charting your good time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! God, I just can't wait. I'm looking at the map and following it out to Denver and to Glacier Base, and actual park where I've been. And I just absolutely love the place. And then moving on to Salt Lake City and then up. God! I just can't wait to leave. And I still don't feel - only when Don gives me these strange looks and talks about it do I feel guilty about going. [15:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like when you think about the trip by yourself you get real excited. But up comes Don's feelings about your going and [you find that kind of disturbing to you.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm almost afraid it - I want to talk about it so bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, it's kind of a thing like you're real excited and you want to share that excitement but it's real hard to share it with him.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I want to talk about it where we're going. And I feel like I can't. It just rubs it in that he's not going. It's been kind of hard to keep quiet. And I've tried to do that. And I guess I sort of keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, but it's like you kind of wish you didn't have to.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really do. Yeah. I don't know - I guess I'm sort of not knowing what I want to talk about now and Friday. I really don't know how to use the time up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You feel kind of at a loss for what's the best thing to do?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't - [yeah, I feel at a loss because I don't have anything to say. I don't feel uncomfortable about it. ] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, you don't know what to say but it's not the end of the world. You're not squirming in your chair.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, kind of a neat thing - I don't know if it's neat but I kind of felt good about it - Sunday when we all up and decided immediately to leave, Daisy got really, really upset about it. She was really looking forward to getting out and then she said something, "Well, this was all planned for you." And I said, "What do you mean it was planned for me?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was planned for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Going to the dunes. The Indiana dunes. Jill and Kevin went and Kerrie and Jack, the other couple that we had that party for Friday night and this other couple went. And I said, "What do you mean it's all planned for me? You and Jill were the ones talking about going and I said, "Yeah, it sounds like a great idea. I'd like to go. Don and I would probably like to go too." And she said, "Well Jill and I wanted to do something for you and Don kind of thing and that was going to be it." And I said, "Oh, well, I didn't know." And then as she talked on, nothing really was planned to do for us anyway because of the other party. They just didn't have time for anything else. So then I started to feel guilty about going. And Don and I sat around for about ten minutes, "Well what in the hell are we going to do? Should we go or shouldn't we go?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 18:18)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I finally said, "I guess I ought to check with Daisy because Jill was out getting something to go. I guess what I feel good about is - I don't if I'd have done this a while back. Maybe I would have anyway but I felt like it was an uncomfortable situation. I went to talk to Daisy just to confront the situation and deal with it. I don't know if I'd have been dealing with it last fall. And I went in and said, "Daisy, wow, I'm not sure what's going on? Do we really put a wrench in everything if we take off? I don't want to wreck some plans that you've got made." And she'd been crying and she was really upset about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're not going?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I didn't know. And as it turned out it was more just the whole frustration of sitting around having to wait for everybody to get together to take off. She was just so anxious to get out of there. And our deciding, "Well, we're not going to sit around and wait for you guys anymore. We're leaving and we're not going there, we're going someplace else." I think it just hit her in terms of, "Let's get the hell out of here!" So it wasn't so much our not going, as it was just wanting to leave the city for a while anyway. And I felt like I was able to confront her with it and feel okay about it and be able to leave without-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [To do what you really wanted to do without kind of feeling close to acquiescence or something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I guess it worked out all right. I haven't heard anything from anybody coming back. It occurred to me while we were gone. I wonder if everyone was angry with us for taking off. And in one sense I really didn't care. The only one I really cared got hurt by our leaving or felt bad about it was Daisy. The rest of them I guess I don't have that much feelings about. [20:39]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 20:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably not. I just really kind of avoid dealing with them all. The party Friday night went pretty well. We had a ton of food left over. Nothing else happened. That worked out all right. And it seems like I'm not even there anymore. Like our leaving Sunday and we didn't come back until last night and Jill and Kevin had friends over so we really didn't talk with them very much. I didn't see Daisy until today. I just don't feel like I [live] (ph) there anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [But you're really calm over it. And you're planning your trip.] (ph)</p>


<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm going to be gone all this weekend. And I feel like all I'm really there for is to mechanically pack up and leave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When are you leaving again? Next weekend? I mean, a week from this weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess not - I had hoped we could leave by the fifteenth, Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is this coming Tuesday. A week from yesterday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, a week from next Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a week from the following Tuesday. But Daisy's got to go home so we probably won't leave until around the eighteenth which is Friday. And I'm moving out the Sunday right after graduation, which is the thirteenth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [To where are you moving?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to move all my furniture. It's going to be moved to my brother's house. And then I'll probably go up to Don's for a couple of days and then make some kind of arrangement to meet Daisy someplace and pick her up and just take off. Jill's leaving this Friday and won't be back until the following Saturday. And won't really be living -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It sounds like dispersal.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's what it is. And everybody's just sort of dispersing. And that's the place where I feel least bad about leaving from. In fact right now, this minute, I don't feel bad about leaving any place. A strange thing that hit me the other day was that this friend - sort of friend - I'd been in high school with is getting married and sent me an invitation to her wedding. Just really strange [that I would be invited to her wedding.] (ph) And what it brought back to me was thoughts of friends all around. Friends that are somewhat distance in the sense of closeness now besides friends that are close but far away. And it was as though I had a feeling I was leaving all of that. Leaving everything behind. And the approaching wedding was sort of a final kind of a culmination of just leaving everything else behind and not caring whether I hurt some people accept for very close friends or talk to them or even let them know that I was getting married kind of thing. [24:23]</p>

<p>And I guess out of being invited to a wedding there's some obligation to send a card anyway. And I didn't even feel like fulfilling that. [To hell with that all.] (ph) All kinds of things like that. I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to get everything packed up and out. Get things packed in the car for travel. Get back and get things ready for the wedding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're not into social amenities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Not at all. I really just don't care about them. And I don't feel bad about that either. That's just the way things are [moving along right here.] (ph) Like even waiting around for graduation is just sort of a mechanical thing to happen. And I don't know that it has much significance either. Like yesterday, this one class I have was missing the departing from friends from school. And having that been missed it's like I've said goodbye by not being there. By not being around for that. And I don't know if it's - it's sort of a sense of leaving something unfinished because I wasn't there for the last class. And yet the [unfinishedness] (sp?) isn't too severe because there's only one or two people there that I wish to make departing comments to. And it's all - and as people are having parties next weekend and stuff like that, I'm not very concerned about even being there. They've become pretty insignificant kind of. [26:52]</p>

<p>Just not being as close to people that are going to school here. I feel like I'm just babbling about nothing. Very much so. Do you have lots of feelings about leaving Chicago and leaving friends here and stuff?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I've had time to think about it very much. I've been here eight years so it's - I was undergraduate here too. And a lot of my friends have gone or going now. But there still are some and yeah, when I think about it - like when you were talking about it a couple of weeks ago, it was hitting me [as you were talking about ] (ph) (inaudible@ 27:49) I haven't had much time to think about it because I'm just trying to get all the work done I have to get done here. And I haven't even started to think much about moving but I have to move in three weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ooh, you've got more time than I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but I mean also [it's a whole lot of stuff when it's moving to the East Coast. I'm starting to think I really should make a - find out about renting a truck or something like that.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess for me it's like this leaving is that I've got all this free time. I've got all my work done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I can see that. That's kind of a different thing because then you're somewhat at loose ends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I know I don't feel at loose ends. So if I felt at loose ends like I had a lot of free time I probably would be able to have more feelings about leaving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I suspected -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really know [I don't have feelings about it at all.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it's different to have been in a place for a longer time and leaving people here or if everybody you're close to is sort of scattering too. It makes it a lot easier. [28:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [There are only a few people that are still going to be here and I think I'll really miss them but I haven't had time to think about it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I ever take time to think about missing people. I guess here the only person I really thought about missing is Gary. And I have some friends at work that are - well they were very, very close friends of mine from college - who are around here. In the last year, we've lost some of the close touches that we have had and so I don't feel as though I'm really leaving them at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, I think - something that I think about is when I remember the friends I had in high school that I was very, very close with and we kept up ties [for the first few years after when I was away at college.] (ph) And then [kind of how I lost contact with them and I kind of think that that was sad and that would be sad if I did that with friends here.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's the most hurtful kind of separation is a gradual kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's kind of like you know that you'd be close if it weren't for distance and that you really - it's good to be close. That's kind of the way I feel. And when I think that that could happen it makes me feel sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm. It just occurred to me that some of the most (inaudible@ 30:23) I guess it's just been thrown at me a lot too; separation and termination and all this kind of jazz. It's thrown at me a lot more in the last three weeks than ever before when I was leaving. And someone was saying about you know when you leave some close friends behind or in moving on what really becomes tragic about it or kind of negative is not being able to move on to new friends, new relationships. [Just bemoaning the fact that other people close to you are-] (ph) I kind of feel like that's what having kept in touch with some people I went to college with by their being here for a short period of time on and off has somewhat kept me from that moving on while I've been in Chicago. Although, now that's been worked through and I feel much more ready to move on and want to make new friends and meet new people. And I guess as I look towards the fall being really beginning to do that it'll be kind of more exciting sharing that growth with Don getting to know new people through him and just together. It sets up a whole new dimension to meeting people and building relationships with people. I almost feel as though right now I've been overexposed to separation kind of thing. [32:12]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, like with these retreats and those kinds of things.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, camping trip and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. It's like having to - it being drilled into you or pounded in your head just because it's the end of a - I don't know if you ever went to summer camp when you were young but that was kind of the thing that always happened at the end of the summer camp season.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I went once. And I remember towards the end of the week - it was a week thing - I remember crying towards the end of the week partially out of homesickness and partially out of leaving. And I guess they do throw that at you there. I never thought of that before. I guess that happens. But I guess I think of a week at summer camp as a pretty short time to at least for me to develop the kinds of relationships that carry on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you mean you were only there for a week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I was only at summer camp for a week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I thought like you were there for a summer or something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I've never done that. I guess the only kind of summer camp would have been like Upward Bound. And certainly that carried a lot of impact when I left. And again when I separated from Upward Bound they had this great, big, huge celebration for me. And leaving was kind of just this huge gigantic thing. It was really, really weird. And it was drawn out for weeks in the sense that I was going to leave and then somebody offered me some money to stay around for the rest of the summer. So they postponed this big party they had until the end of the summer. So it's probably more of a thing for them because they had all this stuff ordered and had to freeze this cake for six weeks. I guess that was a big separation thing. I don't feel like talking about that. That's just an overemphasis on it. [34:41]</p>

<p>I was just thinking about whether there's anything I-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Want to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess there really isn't. I think about anxieties about getting a job but again that's in the distance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I imagine given the trip and everything it must seem terribly far away.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does. On one hand except people keep throwing at me, "You can't find a job. It's really hard to get a job. They just don't exist. You better get on your tail and get something done about it!" And I just really don't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You don't feel very anxious.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not at all. I'm supposed to be getting a resume all developed so that Don can pass it around and that kind of thing. I haven't even really done that or focused on doing that. I'm just not very anxious about it. I'm sort of in the sense of I was talking about last week some time about the security of the fall and I had wanted to face the summer with insecurity approaching when the trip was over. And I guess it's that being that now I'm able to sit and I'll take that when it comes kind of feeling or attitude. And I don't like the thought of I'm now being pressured that I should get a job. Have all that security waiting for me. And I feel like I really ought to be because as I look at the funds between Don and I it's not going to be very pleasant in the fall if I don't have a job waiting. But I still can't get that excited about it. [36:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, it's just like it doesn't seem very real for you now. Maybe in the fall it will but right now it doesn't.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm sure it will be in the fall. It's liable to hit me in the face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, I know like I have to start teaching in the fall which means giving lectures and all that kind of stuff but it seems very distant. Because I have to write my dissertation this summer.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, God!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So it's hard for me to feel any -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, particularly with that in between time. What a horrible thing to spend your summer on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I don't think it will be] (ph) (inaudible@ 37:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What are you writing it on? What is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it's about how people describe emotions with words.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. And is it like just research experimental kinds of stuff?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's a book - there's a theoretical basis to it but then it got a little [operationalized ] (sp?) - you can test it.] (ph) (inaudible@ 37:29) which always makes the writing easier. It's very hard to write something (inaudible@ 37:32) [you're supposed to be able to say something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I always thought, "God!" That's just such an overwhelming undertaking to write a dissertation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I don't know. Like with research dissertations with numbers, I don't think that undertaking - the big one is writing it in things like English or possibly it's probably the writing of it. To me I think the big undertaking is planning it out and doing it. Writing and doing the analysis and stuff. Writing it up is just kind of like - ] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but the analysis is a pretty big part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, that's what I'm finishing up now. That's why I haven't had time to look ahead.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was my whole thing thinking about graduate school. I could never go anyplace where I'd have to write a thesis or into a school that would require that because writing is the biggest chore that I could face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's is for me - it's a big chore for me too, but only if I start to get tense about it. If I feel really relaxed about it and I can enjoy it I think - which I'm hoping will happen especially being in a new place.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [Are you going to be out East to work on it?] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [Yeah, I'll be moving in three weeks. Just not in the city.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where are you going to be?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll be [living in - I'll be teaching at Rutgers and the house is about ten miles away.] (ph) (inaudible@ 39:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, wow! That's really cool! That's great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 39:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I hope you'll be motivated to write and dictate in two acres of] (ph) wow! That's really nice. That's really nice. I guess I always let that tension take over me about writing. And it's really done that to me this year. Last spring I had a paper due in research and I found research was boring for me. And I wasn't carrying out anything that was really significant anyway. And in fact, the course I'd had on research before that didn't really help me understand what the hell research was anyway. So I put it off and I took an incomplete and I was going to do it last summer. Well, summer took over and I just couldn't deal with it. And it was the most difficult thing to write that. And it had to get written last fall. And that was a short twenty page paper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope this won't be more than 100. Two months is a long time [to write so many pages. Especially in thesis you have to write a proposal, which is the really hard thing to explain what you're going to do and why you're going to do it. So that's virtually the first half of it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then it's all done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. It has to be rewritten and everything.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even for me though doing those kinds of things - like this paper that I finally just finished that was due from last quarter. I had my material together in a very clear way that at least part of it was reporting what I had discovered in reading and stuff and my own experience. And that's the kind of thing that should be very easily - I should be spending more time on analyzing what that all meant to me. What it means in practice or whatever. And even writing down material from someone else and doing all that kind of stuff was a chore - was just an awful chore. I guess writing has become even more difficult for - the only thing I really enjoy writing is letters. [4:127]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hate writing letters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You hate writing them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I never write letters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I have - I'm in the mood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to be very motivated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have to be motivated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I enjoy it when I really get into it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I can get myself motivated easier for that kind of that than the other thing. Like Ana, the girl I wrote this morning, the girl that lived with me last year. And we became very, very close friends. I didn't know her before I came to Chicago. I guess that was a strange experience that I had never met her. And the man that kind of talked me into going to school here introduced me to her. And we decided to room together. And it was really strange how quickly we became friends. I certainly don't get close to people or let them get close to me in that short of time. And sitting down to write that letter I'd been working up to doing that for a week. And I sat down and wrote for over an hour. And that's the kind that I really enjoy writing but that's the kind I really have to be motivated for. [42:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You have to get yourself up for it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because I have a lot of things to say and I want to be really in the mood to say them all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [To say them right and how they are.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One thing I like about writing letters is I always sit down and write them as though I'm talking to someone. And I never finish sentences and I start out in the middle of a sentence and do all this kind of stuff. And I use to get comments back from some people. They didn't understand what I was saying at all because I was thinking and talking and just writing it down rather than thinking about it, completing it and then putting it down. But I find that a more fun way of doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's part of what's really hard to write papers is that if I felt really free to do that. And I can't. Nobody would understand what it was. They wouldn't know what was being said. I don't know if we should meet any longer today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Do you want to call it a day?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [That's okay. We can.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

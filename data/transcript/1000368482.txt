<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) I'm still thinking about being late or the idea of how I react to it is on my mind.  I was, I don't know, when I left yesterday, for the first time I think I, I felt what I've often read and, and believed was true.  But I was relieved — I expected that I'd leave at 10 of 6.  And I, uhm, — or was it the day before (musingly).  No, yesterday.  And I was relieved to, in a way, because somehow it, I didn't deserve any more, is what my thinking was almost.  And it would have upset me in some way if, if you had changed when I left at all because I had been late coming.  And it, I don't know, it was making me think about, just generally, children wanting certain limits so that they feel a certain security.  And, I don't know, I think it was making me feel secure in a way.  At least I could predict what would happen in this situation and having met the punishment of losing a certain amount of time, too, I suppose.</p>

<p>But then when I came in today and they were calling you, the woman was calling you and at some point somebody said that, I thought I heard somebody say that you were in a laboratory.  And the first thought that came to my mind was that you had decided I'd be late a lot (laughs) and you didn't want to waste your time waiting for me.  Not that you wouldn't come when I came but just that you weren't going to just sit, waiting. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was also thinking about the feeling that I had yesterday when I was here and just how it seemed like I just was feeling very angry.  And I came in late and I never really stopped and thought about what I was doing.  And I ended up letting out an angry feeling more than I ever do.  (Pause) And it just makes me wonder how much I'm angry at most people I come in contact with.  (2-minute silence) I was just thinking about my reaction of (clears throat) when things aren't quite the way I want them to be or, I don't know, I'm not handling things very happily, that my inclination is to think, what have I done that's wrong, especially if it's involving another person and somehow their reaction to me isn't, isn't making me feel comfortable.  And yet, underneath that I'm always finding reasons to blame them.  (Pause) And they seem to be such contradictory things that I, it makes me wonder which one is the real one that I'm doing in my mind.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What you leave out is the specific, eh, instance in which you were thinking of this, the person you were thinking of or whatever.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I might have been but, uhm, I was really thinking of lots of general things like of being with my assistant and reacting that way or my supervisor or friends or teachers or, you know.  I really was thinking of a lot of different occasions and ve—, being quite general.  (Silence) I think somehow I'm having trouble thinking about it in a specific way.  Because what I'm doing consciously is starting to think about one thing and then immediately I'll think, well, I wonder if the same things are involved in a different situation.  So I'll immediately flit to another one.  And it's almost as if it's too uncomfortable to think about very much.  (Pause) Because it's almost as if I'm feeling that I created the feeling in, in myself of being weak or foolish or frustrated or unhappy or whatever.  And, and then I am also creating the anger and that it's all from me and, which just puts more blame on me.  (Pause) Or just the feeling that I was, in the end result, so very angry at someone and there was no reason for it.  That's, maybe that's why, when I have any reason at all where it's justifiable to be angry, I just get angry way beyond a reasonable amount.  Almost like I'm finally can let out all the anger that's built up about all these things that I can't allow myself to recognize that I'm angry at.</p>

<p>And it's funny, when I think of that, I think more of my mother than myself.  Because she's very much this way and I've always seen what I do practically identical to how she's reacted and been horrified at it, in a way because I used to be horrified that she could be so passionate over things that didn't involve enough to be that angry about.  And now the images that come to my mind are of my mother, not me.  (Pause) And I suppose the reason they used to horrify me is because it usually involved expressing a feeling of wanting to kill something or somebody.  Or if she didn't actually express it, coming pretty close.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do any particular instances come to mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think of one, involved a dog that used to fight with our dog.  And he wasn't a particularly attractive dog to me, uhm, and I didn't like him very much.  But he still was somebody's animal.  And one day, after he did something to our dog my mother was just shaking and furious and she just started talking about how she could just kill him and sort of, "The next time he comes near our dog, I'll kill him."  Really wanting to, really feeling that there was nothing else to consider while she was saying it.  It just was horrifying to me because there was so much else to consider.  And then it's equally horrifying when I react the same way.  Or else, she'll — well, this is a type of reaction when she's not really angry because of something but it gives her an excuse to be sort of violent in her feelings.  And she'll hear of something that happened to a group of people, some people or a person and if they were sort of foolish in what they did, her attitude is they deserve what they get and nobody should consider anything else to help them out of their predicament.  So that if they were foolish and had an accident, it served them right if they were killed, or something like that.  And, I don't know, again, or she used to be a social worker.  And, and, I don't know, sometimes I think she just hated her job so much that she would have liked to have, well, not actually been violent to the people she was supposed to be helping but sort of see them meet the consequences of their foolish action, actions.  And she would just get so caught up in her emotions on these things or on people having children who weren't married and couldn't support the children and being on welfare and all this, and how people like that should just be sterilized.  There was just no na—, no answer and there should be no consideration of different types of cases.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, the way she, in discussions, will sort of dispense with people as if there's no humanity to consider and being sort of smug about it, I, I don't think I'm quite as bad as that.  But I think sometimes I'm inclined to think the same way.  And I kn—, and again I think of just when I was feeling angry at my brother the time I was a, I was saying, "I could kill you,"  or, "Want to kill you."  I don't recall exactly the words.  But anyway I was allowing myself to feel and admit that I felt that I wanted to kill him.  And I think it made me feel very afraid when I, when I did that.  Because I, and maybe in a way I felt I could have done it if something hadn't happened to stop me.  (Pause) And for both of us, it seems like so often, being angry at something or somebody, or exasperated, that was the kind, the only kind of emotion that we ever indulged ourselves in. (Pause)</p>

<p>And there was something horrible in that too, about it, that seems like that's the kind of thing you should be controlling, not indulging in.  And somehow she and I had things in reverse.  (Pause) Or just recently when there was a group of people who got out of the subway train and went down the tunnel holding up subway traffic during rush-hour, I wasn't involved in it but my reaction in a way was, although I don't think I seriously feel this or I wouldn't let myself seriously feel it, but in a way my reaction was that they were being very inconsiderate to, first of all, do something like that, which wasn't going to get them anywhere.  I guess they thought they were protesting that their train had broken down and they had to get out.  And here they were holding up traffic because the system had to turn off the electricity.  And so my feeling was, they knew the electricity was on when they got out and walked down, it should have been left on.  And if anybody was hurt that was their fault.  And this was a typical reaction of my mother's, that, or the type of thing she would have reacted at in the same way. (Pause)</p>

<p>It just seemed to me it was almost as if, for both of us, we want to do violent things and destructive things.  And the only way we can possibly even think about it is by working it around so it seems like it's a very just thing, as having these people meet what they deserve for being so stupid.  But still then we can think of violent things like having them being killed or killing something.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I went back to the thought that I must be angry practically all the time, or a lot of the time.  And sometimes when I feel so tired maybe it's because I'm fighting this, I don't know.  But anyway then I just couldn't, I started just thinking about my stomach making noise and I don't know what else, but anything but that.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just began thinking of how I feel I can't ask you a question.  And, I don't know, perhaps it makes me angry at you that I feel I can't.  But there's something about the fact that I don't think I can that bothers me because if I ever think of one and think of trying to ask you I just feel very afraid.  Or, whenever I have asked a question, even if it's like when I asked if I could change the time, or something, it was a ha—, very hard thing to do.  I had to make myself do it.  (Pause) And I think it goes just beyond, there might be something in particular that makes me feel I can't ask you a question but it doesn't really seem that I relate to people in terms of asking questions, and certainly not people that I don't know.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And sometimes when I've been that way, if it's like with my assistant and I, she's doing things or something and it would be showing an interest on my part if I asked a question, and I might think of it later when I've left school for the day, I'll realize that my self was on my mind so much that it cut out anything else.  So it's made me wonder if it's, again, just being so self-centered that leads to my not asking questions.  But that might be true in 1 case but then this fear of it I just don't understand.  I really don't know what I think will happen to me if I do.  (Pause) Unless it's just that I, by asking a question I've put myself in somebody's power.  So that they could do anything.  And it's not knowing what they could or might do that bothers me as well as the fact that I put myself in that vulnerable position. (Pause)</p>

<p>Or if it's a matter of just talking about a subject, I don't ask questions because I don't know enough about it to even ask a question (knocking sound) or else I think I'm too busy feeling that I want to reinforce what I do know about it or think or let other people know that I do know something about it.  So I tell rather than ask.  And it's true of my teaching too.  So often I find myself telling rather than asking which I think is probably a much better way to teach.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why do you think this occurred to you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, the first thought came to my mind was, well, there must be something I want to ask you.  But then, well, so far, anyway, I don't know what it is if there is.  And then I thought well, maybe it's because I feel angry at you since, indirectly, you make me feel afraid of asking you questions.  (Pause) And that would make me — well I was just thinking just not only asking questions but I've established in my mind what I'm supposed to do here and so I now feel afraid of you if I don't do it no matter what it is I'm doing instead.  And then I'd, I must feel angry at you for feeling that way.  (Pause) I was just wondering if that's why some days I get such strong feelings that it must be awful for you to have to come in here and listen to me while I'm here.  And it sort of makes me, punishes myself in return for feeling angry at you.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You don't sound angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't feel it now.  But then I don't know how often I've really felt it, how often I've let myself feel it.  (Pause) I must have felt angry at you yesterday.  I was certainly angry at something.  And I, I know I was angry at myself but I think I must have been angry at more than myself.  (Silence) And I can just feel myself when I'm trying to think about this, saying to myself, "Well, you're being ridiculous because there's no reason to have felt angry and so of course you didn't feel angry."  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>It just seemed to me, I was thinking about how I compared my angry feelings to my mother's and it seems I get some kind of satisfaction, anyway, out of seeing that I'm ex—, react exactly the same way as she does.  And I like to think I'm upset at it and so forth but I think in a way it's my shunning the responsibility for feeling this way.  I can say, well, I'm just like my mother.  It's her fault that I'm like this.  (Silence) There are other ways, too, I think I've avoided feeling responsibility.  I know in high school I used to feel the way I don't think I feel now but I was just sure everything had already been worked out and there was nothing I could do to change the way my life would go.  And now I'm aware that very often I'm thinking, if I just knew the formula on how other people do things, something I want to do, then I'll know how to do it too and I'll be able to do it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, one thing that, it's sort of a more recent thing on my mind, and it leads into uhm, I mean, I'm sure it's because of thinking about things that I have been here.  But uh, well the reason I, I think it must be connected with wo—, really worrying about other things, is that uhm, (sigh) I think every since we told FDO, the girl that we've hired, the woman that we've hired, that we wanted her to come, I, I didn't ever feel absolutely certain that everything would be just wonderful. </p>

<p>And then, when we finally decided to actually specifically say something to her, I always was thinking that she is the nicest person that interv—, that I interviewed for the job, or that I spoke to over the phone for the job, and I think she'd be good.  But that there might be things I wouldn't like.  And I don't know, I think I was having a fairly reasonable attitude. </p>

<p>But uh, then today, (sniff) FNI had called to ask if we could come over to dinner tomorrow night, and I'd already arranged that at some point tomorrow afternoon, FDO would come to see FSO again, and, so that I could talk to her a bit about things.  Uhm, because I won't have much time on Monday morning.  And uh, so when FNI called, to ask if we could go, I thought, well I better make it more clear when she's coming, or because, have her make it more clear, because she had left it sort of vague.  And find out whether she'd come in time, so that we could go out, or, or not.</p>

<p>And uhm, so when I called, she had to return the call.  But then, she was still vague.  And, so I just said, well would it be after this time — no; would it be before this time — no.  So then that gave me some idea.  But uhm, and, it sort of bothered me, I guess, that she was vague.  But I know she had somebody that is connected with the church that she is very much involved with, that she wanted to go see.  So I don't know, it still wouldn't disturb me too much. </p>

<p>But then she said, "Oh, you said something about sometime working on Saturday.  What time would it be?"  (Sniff) I had thought I'd been extremely clear about all the different possible jobs that this would, this position entails.  And I thought I'd been very clear, it would be, if it were, were on a Saturday, a Saturday evening.  And uhm, so that kind of disturbed me, that she had been unsure about what I'd said.  Because then I'd, I guess I'm wondering what else does she not understand, that I've counted her, on her understanding. </p>

<p>And uhm, and then she went on to say, the reason she was wondering, is because she has a class on Saturday, and she hadn't mentioned that before.  So I asked her what it was, and she said it was some, learning about IBM, punching IBM cards, or I don't know, it s, sounds like some, some high-skilled uhm, well, I don't know, I mean it isn't a job now, but that would prepare you for it.  And so then I began to get very worried about well, is she doing this because in another few months she's going to leave and do that.  And we had made it very clear, we did not want her to accept the job unless she'd stay through June.</p>

<p>So now I'm getting all worried about, uhm, about her, and is she going to just stay for awhile and leave.  And will she work out anyway, and uhm, I don't know, just that I had thought we'd established a certain uhm, I don't know how to, w, what word to use.  But uhm, that I was trying to be very honest with her, and she seemed to value that.  And, and seemed to express that she was being very honest with us, and wanted to be, and wanted us to be with her.  And that, so that there was in a mu—, there was in a mutual, uhm, desire for honesty.  And then, this makes me think, well maybe she's keeping an awful lot to herself.  And uh, what will she do, soon?</p>

<p>So, I don't know, then I, I'm just getting all worked up over it.  And I just feel, well, there's no way to know unless she does leave.  And then it's hard on FSO to keep having new people.  But uhm, having done this, I don't feel completely unsure that I could find somebody else.  In fact, uhm, a doorman of ours said he'd found somebody who might be interested.  Although I think she might want more money than we can offer.  And uhm, I mean, we'd already hired FDO, so I didn't pursue it, find out who it was, or how much she wanted.  But he claims she was very good, and he's usually right about people, when he's said they're good. </p>

<p>And uhm, then the CHN woman, FDC, that I sometimes take FSOZ to, said that she has a friend who would like to come in and do it.  And FDC is so good, and, and her whole family is so nice, that I would assume somebody that she approved of, would be good.  So that I don't, I don't know, I, I — except for the fact that FSO would be changing again uhm, which is kind of a major thing, but I don't know, I think FSO could probably do it, as long as MSCZ and I are being careful to give her what she needs — I don't see why I'd be getting so upset, except that I want something to get upset over. </p>

<p>And uhm, (sniff) well, I think I had the feeling yesterday when I left, I started wondering again why I'd talked about the last 2 things that I did.  And uhm, the thing that struck me was that both of those cases, what, one of the things that I had emphasized when I was thinking of it yesterday, was that the people were saying something, and they thought they were saying something else, to me.  Or, uhm, one was to MEINZ, but uhm, I, I don't know, I guess —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Well, what does that mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I, I guess I was wondering, well, what was I actually t—, saying to you that I really know I was, but that I was couching it in something else, so I was pretending I was saying something else. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Do you have anything in mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, I'm not sure if I did last night, I can't remember now, if I did, and, and now wh, what comes to my mind, but uhm — I mean, it isn't specifically answering what I think I might have been actually saying, but maybe it's just another part of it — is, I think of uhm, that whole thing of my thinking about being a psychiatrist, or my interest in it.  Or uhm, (sigh) thinking about helping people, and your asking.  And then the feelings I had about it.  And uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, well I think that's what it's about.  You told me about 4 people yesterday, all of whom could seen as, one of them has a patient, MEINZ.  But the other 3, uh, the way you describe them, you know, all sound as though they might need help.  And, you know, in some way you were interested in helping each one of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, uhm, well, well I'm, I guess I'm wondering, well then, how does that lead me into thinking I'm saying something else than what I'm really saying?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, because the question is, how come it should be right at this point, at a time when you're making some progress, and you've talked about the possibility, you're thinking about the possibility of sometimes stopping.  You would find yourself, at least this is a rather clear way of expressing your own wish that you could be a psychiatrist.  Now true, you've had it before.  But here it comes up, you know, giving me 4 illustrations of the kind of people you're interested in.  I think it's your way of kind of maybe trying to hold onto me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Or take part of me away with you.  And be like me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Uhm, yeah well, before you even said that, I was just thinking, well maybe it's some kind of a way not to lose you.  I mean, I wasn't thinking of it quite as, I mean it was almost like I was thinking, then, then I would be associating with you, only on that level, rather than coming here as your patient.  And uhm, and then I began thinking about two of the people that uhm, I'd talked about yesterday.  One being FNF, the girl who applied for the job.  And, a, and in both cases, things turned out slightly differently than certainly I was anticipating, yesterday when I was talking about them.  So I guess it makes me wonder how well I was really seeing them anyway.</p>

<p>Uhm, I mean FNF, I think was, has some strange qualities about her, or uhm, I don't think this is because I want to see something in her.  But when sh, she did call yesterday when I wasn't home.  And FMC told her that I'd already hired somebody, that that was what I was calling her about.  And I d—, I don't know whether she specifically said, but you can call back and speak to Mrs. QSE if you want to, or not.  But anyway, th—, FNF was not at all upset, because she'd found something else.  And she wanted to talk to FMC about it, and FMC didn't really want to talk, so I guess somehow she got off the phone. </p>

<p>But uhm, well I got kind of curious to know wh, what she'd found that was making her feel very happy.  And also hoping it would be something that would make her happy.  And uhm, but just the fact she was not upset, so if I had actually spoken to her, which I'd already decided I probably would have to, it would not have been what I was anticipating. </p>

<p>And uhm, and then I was just thinking about the boy, MJ.  Uhm, well I mean, in part, things are still the way they were.  Because it was a, he started out the day sort of trying to be really nice to me, really, essentially.  And I was trying also to make sure things weren't too difficult for him.  And uh, and then, oh, one point we went out, we took a trip to the store to buy some things.  We're going to do some cooking, and, uhm at first he didn't want, he h—, I gave the children a choice of going, knowing that they'd have to meet a certain behavior while we were out of the school, or staying.  And he first chose not to go, I don't think because of the behavior so much, as he always chooses not to be with the group, if there's a choice.  And then he changed his mind.  And he did that when we cut out the jack-o-lantern, too.  He said well he didn't think he'd stay.  And then when he saw what was happening, he wanted to come right back again. </p>

<p>And uhm, so he went and everything went fine.  Until we came back and uhm, they had their snack.  And then they had another time of — because they'd really missed it earlier in the morning — of sort of an activity period.  I gave them 1 thing that they could do if they wanted.  And then they could do their own choices.  Uh, and most of them do sort of, making things out of paper, and using paint, and all that kind of thing during this time.  And so he was quite involved in what he was doing. </p>

<p>And then I announced that we'd have to start cleaning up in a f—, in a few minutes we'd have to be cleaned up.  And that those who were not finished, should be finishing up now, whatever they were doing.  And then, and I told them, I showed them when on the clock, this would have to be all done.  And they understand that they don't start new things.  And so, just about a minute before the time was up, MJ takes out really big paper to make something, and usually, using really big paper they spend quite a bit of time on it.  And I said, "MJ, there's not enough time.  It's cleaning up time now, so please don't start anything new." </p>

<p>And he continued, and I said, "MJ, I've asked you please not to start anything new, because it's clean-up time.  It's not time to take anything up now."  And he said, "But I'm going to," and, and started frantically to do it.  So I stopped him, and again I felt that same anger that I felt yesterday.  And uhm, I just said, "No, MJ, you can't.  Not at clean-up time."  And uh, took the paper away from him and put it down somewhere.  And then he went off to be unhappy, to sulk. </p>

<p>And so then later, when I'd had a chance, after I'd helped some others clean up, I went over to him.  And, and I ta—, but this time I was much more calm.  And I'd, I suppose from having talked about it with you yesterday, I felt better in dealing with him.  Uhm, but I just talked about the fact that when I asked him to stop — I knew he had sometimes a problem stopping — but that when I asked him to specifically, I really meant for him to stop.  And that I didn't like getting angry at him, but it did make me angry when he did that.  And I knew it didn't make him feel good. </p>

<p>And then he began to really, well I suppose it was maybe he felt more comfortable with me, so then he could express being unhappy.  But then he started talking about not wanting to go up on the roof, which is where we're going next.  And that's where he has the most obvious social problems, because he can't get involved in his own projects, then.  Because it's pretty much, uhm, people play with other people up there.  And a few play alone, but uh, if others want to join them, they can.  Whereas, MJ really doesn't want anybody to join him. </p>

<p>And uh, one child spoke to him up there, one point he had uh, something another child wanted, and I said, well why don't you go ask MJ if you can have it.  And the child went and asked him, and MJ ran away and mumbled, and seemed very distraught that the other child had even gone to talk to him. </p>

<p>Uhm, and then MJ later began to cry a lot.  And, because of some—, he had made an obstruction upon the roof, so the children with riding toys couldn't go through, unless they crashed through.  And of course, they thought that was kind of fun, I had told, I, immediately when I saw this happening, I had told MJ, he would have to have an opening.  He could make it a gate, or a bridge, or he had to have some arrangement so that they could get through with the riding toys.  And uh, he was doing that for awhile, and then one boy came along and he wasn't really p, paying that much attention, and the boy crashed through somewhere else.  And that just threw MJ.  And uhm, he spent the rest of the time sitting on the side, and, and off and on crying.  And saying he wanted to go home, and he didn't like the school, and so forth. </p>

<p>And so then finally I decided, well, conferences are coming soon.  I might as well just have the one with his mother, right away.  And I said to MJ, that I thought I'd call his mother, because I thought maybe she and I together might be able to work out some way to help him with his problem.  And he seemed very eager for me to call her, and told his mother when he got home, that I was going to.  W, which I found out when I did call her.  And then I said, one thing that might help, is that he have some friends in the school that he could play with outside of the school, so he could get some kind of a feeling for the group.  Because it continued at home. </p>

<p>And uh, she said, well, he has mentioned 2 children, and those were the 2 I was going to suggest.  But the thing that, that I feel is different than I had felt yesterday about MJ, what I was getting to, is that uhm, th, the fact h, he remembered the 2 names.  That he had been impressed by these 2 children, because I'd been kind of assuming he's just so out of it that he di—, he hasn't generally, known names.  Or at least, he won't use them if he knows them.  He ref—, he says, "That kid."  Or, "That boy over there in that jacket."  Or some other way of referring to them.  And uh, he's rejected practically every child's attempt to be friendly with him.  So that these 2 children were just ones that are, are friendly boys, and big enough, big like him, and I just thought would be easy ones to start with. </p>

<p>And uhm, so now I feel as if well, maybe I've been really, I mean, he has a problem, but that I'd been seeing him all the wrong way.  Or that uhm, I don't know, anyway, there's something that's different from the way I was judging it yesterday.  (Sniff) Because I don't know why it's important to me to think about the 2 being somewhat different, unless it's as if I'm saying, I'm taking back uhm, thinking about (laughs) being a psychiatrist.  Saying, well, I really wouldn't be a good one, because I misjudged these 2 people. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   What you may misjudge is your own role in bringing this change about.  You may underestimate it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, you mean with MJ?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah well, I mean I've tried to encourage, or set up things so that children could be friendly.  But they've done it themselves, too, to an extent.  Uh, it's just I don't feel from yesterday to today, I've really done anything, except maybe to make MJ feel that if I worked with his mother — because he, he does consider the home very important — uhm, that I'm more on his side than maybe he's been feeling, otherwise.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Well, it's almost, I don't know if I really want to think I might have done more to change him, than I l—, than I've been thinking, or uhm, whether I really find that disturbing.  Uhm, but what I find my thoughts went to next, are things like, uhm, well th—, well I guess I was thinking, well maybe because of a certain atmosphere I have tried to create, that would have led the children to treat each other in such a way.  So that then MJ was changed. </p>

<p>But then I think, but I don't, I never feel the atmosphere I'm creating is good, because when I'm putting pressure on myself, as I have been at different points this fall, then in the end it gets reflected on the children.  And, so the atmosphere suffers, or the children.  And uhm, so then I immediately think, well that couldn't be it.  And then uhm, I think well maybe if I helped him get a greater group, a desire to be with others, be part of the group, partly because of things we're doing that are nice, as a group.  But then I immediately think, well the children have an awful attitude toward the circle, which is one time when we do things together, if we're doing, I don't know, word games, or discussions, or anything of that sort. </p>

<p>And, and I feel, because today one of the children said, "Oh no, not circle again.  We had circle 2 times," essentially, and w, we had it 1 time for story.  Uhm, but essentially, we had circle 2 times.  And so when they said that, I began to think — before they've not always rushed right up for it — I began to think, I really must be making it an unpleasant time.  Or uhm, on the one hand, I feel these children are just, have a very poor attitude, but then I think, well that's an easy thing to think.  And maybe I'm just not making it interesting, and I talk too much.  And uh, so immediately I think, well I'm not doing that right.</p>

<p>And then I started thinking about FLMZ, and how she said, several times she said recently, things that are complimentary to me.  Uhm, because she's saying she hasn't found, worked with somebody before who, well, one time she said something about, who knew so much about different things, because I just happened to use books as resource materials.  And MJ had asked one time why Halloween was called Halloween.  And I'd found a book that gave some information on it.  I sort of knew, but I wanted to check, because I wasn't absolutely sure.  And so I just sh, showed him the book, and read the part that told, and then had some other pictures in it that he was just looking at, for a minute. </p>

<p>And that was what she essentially was referring to, but just sort of generally too, different things we'd done that were I guess, for the intellectual part of the content of them, new for her.  And uh, but I, but I, b—, when I think of her today, I think immediately of uhm, my always having to fight her on every issue.  And that she just disapproves, or doesn't agree, and, and uhm, that she's very critical of me.  Which she may not be, I don't know, but I, sort of the way I feel about it today, or just now. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Oh, I think you're wondering how I feel about your ideas.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   You're thinking of being a psychiatrist, aren't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I guess that would be what it would come down to.  I, I'm sure I wondered what you thought of what I have been doing with MJ.  Uhm, but I suppose I've wondered what you'd thought of my being a psychiatrist, and I'm sure what I want you to think, is that I'd be a good one.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I'm not sure how this works into it.  But the next thing I started thinking of, was of another boy in my class.  And I don't know how much I've talked about him, but he, he's one of the one that I just instinctively enjoy the most.  He's just sort of an all-boy boy, and uhm, bright and uhm, always has questions, is curious, is, always does very, well, I don't know, sort of childlike, but sort of funny art things, and has good ideas for that.  And is, is quite warm in his feelings of others, although he can be quite rough.  I think, partly because I think he just doesn't realize how strong he is, or he needs to exercise his body, and he can't always control it. </p>

<p>And, but he never purposely, I don't think, hurts people.  And uh, I don't know, I mean, sometimes he's kind of difficult, when we're all, when we have to stay inside for a long time.  But, well anyway, I just enjoy him, and, and I've always thought of him as a fairly bright child who's just got the normal problems that any child has as he develops, of not having full control of his hands yet, and things like that.  And uhm, he'd already had the test that all the children will have that is used by any of the schools that they want to attend next year.  And uhm, I mean the results are used.  And uh, Mrs. BBF had his mother in yesterday, to talk about prospective schools for him next year, and she had his results that she told the mother.  I guess it's the policy to tell the parents. </p>

<p>And his mother was extremely upset, because he scored uhm, 4 points below the superior range.  And actually I was surprised, I would have expected him in the superior range.  Because he just seemed like, exactly like the boys I taught at LKC, who generally were in the superior range.  And uhm, there might, there were several things Mrs. BBF and I were talking about, that might have changed his score.  And, so it's hard to know how accurate that is.  But I wouldn't have thought it was an accurate judge of him.  It might point out problems I didn't realize he had, but in any case, my feeling is, I would not, as, as I feel right now, I am not worried about him.  And I wouldn't react that that score is accurate.</p>

<p>And I guess I'm sort of responding this way too, because uhm, my mother told me that I scored very low on n—, m—, not that IQ test, but I guess, whatever they used when I was small.  Maybe it's the same one, I don't know.  And she always felt that was unfair judge, and I don't know what she used to do about it, but she used to be very annoyed when people would sort of sit there and say, "Well, here's her IQ, what can you expect?"</p>

<p>And uh, I'm sure I've confused how I think about all this.  Because I also remember a time when I assumed she was referring to me when she said — or at least I remember her saying, although she says she never did — that the pediatrician said one of us was a lot brighter than the others.  And I assumed it was me.  And then I had this low IQ, and I don't know when I became aware of having tested low. </p>

<p>But uhm, anyway, so maybe I'm more sympathetic to MPK, because his mother was very upset and said, "Oh, I just have an average child."  And she doesn't want an average child, she wants a superior child, and uhm, it just seemed as if she has absolutely no appreciation of him, except if he can get into a good school, what she considers a good school. </p>

<p>And uh, so I guess, I, I just now was thinking about that, and how could I tell her she has, how could I change her attitude toward her child (laughs), I guess was it I was thinking about, so she'd like him. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, when you, when you were saying about your mother's attitude about this, you really do, you just said explicitly, that your mother was upset.  And everything you have indicated when you've mentioned this before, led me to the opposite idea.  You know, that you at least thought that your mother agreed.  It's the impression you've always given me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  Yeah, I'm wondering if that's because maybe I wondered, well maybe that really was a true score, and my mother just hoped it might not be so.  And also just now I started thinking something I must have thought earlier.  And that is that I must have heard something, I can't believe I completely made up this about the pediatrician, or some doctor saying one of us was brighter than the others. </p>

<p>But uhm, and in any case, thinking it did actually get said, who was he referring to.  And then I think, well maybe it could have been FNA.  FNA who was always believed by my parents as the least bright in the family.  Because she wouldn't, she did not conform to schools as well as the rest of us.  And uhm, sometimes, just a few things that have happened, I've sometimes wondered how bright she really might be.  And then how much her appearing not to be bright, might be just that was part of her whole way of handling the whole situation that she didn't like.  And uh, so that maybe she's the one he was referring to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Also, I remember something else about it.  And I just don't know whether it's some—, wishful thinking, because then — well, now I understand it would not be the best sign in the world, but it might indicate at least, I didn't have that IQ, which I don't want to think I had, I think it was a hundred and six.  Uhm, but it would still indicate problems, uhm, because it seems to me my mother told me that (sigh) one of the reasons why she didn't think it was a true test of my IQ, uhm, which the sch—, the schools weren't considering any sort of extraneous circumstances.  They were just taking, well here's the score, so here's what her whole future must be. </p>

<p>And uhm, my mother, I think, told me that I sort of well, it seems to me like that maybe one time I was asked to do something, and I scribbled instead.  Or that it was as if I wouldn't take the test seriously, or I didn't want to be, comply to it.  Or I don't actually know how she'd know, because I, I'm not sure if she were there, or not.  But it's as if what I'm remembering being told, is that when I took the test I did not take it seriously, so I wasn't performing up to my best ability.  And I think I've always liked to think that.  I mean, I've always wanted to think it, I guess. </p>

<p>But yet, the way I felt today when Mrs. BBF was talking about this boy MPK, and his IQ, and uh, his range from 106 to 116, so it's even higher, the mean is higher than, I guess, 106 would have been my mean.  Uhm, I, I, I don't know, it's as if I were hiding a secret, that I couldn't let anybody know.  Because I kept sort of thinking, well that's my IQ, and uhm, clearly it's not a very good one, (laughs) the attitude people have, so I better really keep if s—, hidden.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, it sounds like you're wondering, not only uh, as you said yesterday, are you patient enough, but are you knowledgeable enough, and are you smart enough to be a psychiatrist, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Interrupting) Umhmm.  Umhmm.  (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>Yeah, I guess that might be why I think of it now, except this IQ thing has always really bothered me.  And uhm, it's one of th—, it's, I think of it as probably having bothered me, because I've carried this on for so many years, this feeling.  And I, and it's something I've never wanted to talk with anybody about.  So that uhm, I mean, I've felt it's a very, it's something I better not talk about. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, I can't remember your mentioning any numbers before.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Interrupting) Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I mean, you know, it's as though you really are telling me that you really think about it, for the first time.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, so, well I think what I come down to feeling right now, is that maybe I'm wondering am I smart enough to be a psychiatrist, but it's more simply, this is some, this is a knowledge that, however true the knowledge is, I f—, I've always felt it's facts that I'm carrying, I've carried and have always bothered me.  And so now I'm wondering, just basically just what do you think of me having an IQ of 106 instead of something much higher.  Because it, clearly my mother wouldn't accept it, and even if it didn't upset her because she didn't believe it, still, i, it, what if it were true?  Uhm, then obviously it would be a very bad thing in my family.  And I think that, I always felt.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I started thinking back to MPK again, having again sort of felt as if I must be unacceptable, because of that IQ.  And thinking a—, just about him again, and meeting his mother and having to deal with this. And wondering if there's any way, not exactly save him from the same thing, because it's all still sort of vague, except this feeling of being unacceptable that — I mean, there are already signs of ways she's putting pressure on him from his behavior and his fears.  And uhm, so I guess, just wondering how can he be, sort of saved from that, anyway, or similar feelings that I have.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Hmm, well, m—, not sure exactly what this means, but I went from th—, a—, I start thinking again next, about well, I suppose I could feel angry at my parents, except that I, I really don't.  Uhm, it seems more like, well at least now as an adult, I feel, or a teacher, uh, I feel very angry at this kind of system, using a test that could be helpful as one way to know children, to — it's a mea—, it's an end now, really, and then this is practically, so that a lot of children I deal with, it does preclude what school they're going to get into, and sort of their whole future.  At least that's how MPK's mother's feeling, that h, his whole future is ruined now, because he can't get into all the right schools all along the line. </p>

<p>And uhm, whether or not they're really the right schools, still the fact that the test could be so important in making, as part of the decision, uhm, and, and it could be an inaccurate measure.  There are just so many factors that could change that from one time to the other.  And uhm, and so then I feel angry at that. </p>

<p>But then uhm, I began to think about FHYZ, who used to do the test — uhm, I'm not sure if this particular one, but one similar — for LKC when I first went there.  When they were, this was, I guess this was before there was a central testing service, and so each school tested their own children.  And uhm, so I was thinking about that and also FHYZ is interested now in going into th—, uhm, well, not exact—, it's not, it's uhm, working with children with learning disabilities uhm, through, she wants to join one of the women that we used to use at LKC and, and Mrs. BBF is now using, when children really have some problem. </p>

<p>And uhm, but then I, but then I guess I was just thinking, when FHYZ was testing, I used to be — that first year I worked with her — she tested in our room.  So when I had things to prepare, I had to leave and work somewhere else.  And I was trying to remember what I'd done, because I had a hard time remembering.  And I don't know why it was important, but it's just sort of this feeling of being kicked out of the room, not exactly kicked out of the room, but then, not having a place to go. </p>

<p>And then, I just thought of how neat FHYZ is, and where she tests now, if she has to, or she has a reading readiness test that's very quick, but that s—, I think she used to use.  I'm not sure she still does.  And made me think of her office, and how v—, it's very neat, and wondering well, maybe this is getting (laughs) back to well, having my own office, I'm not sure in exactly what capacity.  Whether as a psychiatrist, or what.  But anyway, wondering just how would I keep an office, and thinking about my room at school and the place where I have mainly my things, and how messy it is.  And how, what a hard time I have of sort of clearing the top off of this cabinet where I keep things.  Uhm (sniff, Pause).</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why do you think your thoughts turn to that from you know, feeling angry at the misuse of tests that indeed, can be inaccurate?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know, unless my room is a mess, my feelings (laughs) are a mess, is kind of a, uhm — but then, I also react this way, that you're saying tests that can be inaccurate, you didn't have to add, that can be inaccurate.  So then I think well, well maybe you're trying to say I might really be right in judging that the test was wrong about MPK.  Or you might be saying, well who knows what your IQ might be, and therefore trying to make me feel better. </p>

<p>And then my reaction to that is, the only way I, th—, th—, I don't know, I mean, I guess I want you to say it doesn't matter to you, or maybe it is wrong, or something.  But it, it's almost as if my feeling is but I have be tested again to know.  And maybe it really is the right score, and uhm, I mean it's as if, well people have to assume it is the right score, I guess, kind of thing.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Have no other way to judge you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  What?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, I'm sorry (laughs), I  misunderstood you.  I d—, uhm, I thought you said they would have no other way to —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   No, I'm saying I would have no other way to judge you than to have a number?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I mean I feel as if I do, so I'm s—, I guess I have to apply it to you, too, but I mean, because with MPK I'm feeling I do.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But it doesn't, it's not realistic to me in this, when I think about my IQ I feel as if that's the truth.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You're stuck with that number.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Hmm.  Well, our time's up. 
??</p>

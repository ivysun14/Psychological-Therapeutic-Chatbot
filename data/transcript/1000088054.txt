<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Board 1, Track 1 of Tape #105, Client #...

</p><p>PATIENT: Hi.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'd just like you to start wherever you feel you want to.

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm hmm. It's really - it's hard to be here and ask questions. It doesn't go that way, huh?

</p><p>COUNSELOR:...how you're feeling or what's on your mind.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it kind of depends on, you know, what mood I'm in. Today...my husband's...and I really don't have that many gripes. Now next week might be another story.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: It really - you know if he is - if he's all right then I won't have any complaints. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Which makes my life sort of uneven all the time. You know I don't know from day to day what he's going to be like.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT:...or not. Sometimes I think he's just sort of looking for something to gripe about. You know? He looks kind of cruel - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean that might be my own exaggeration.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but it sounds like - sometimes it seems like anything you do at all is just like the way he's feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so, really.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like the way - the way he's feeling has a...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And the way I feel - well, I don't know. You know like last week I had thought about all these things I was going to say and then I found out I was taking him...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like it's a heck of an anticlimax for you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes! 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because you know you really have to work yourself up to it...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It must have made you feel - I don't know what exactly - 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Cheated or -

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I thought well now I'll really have to build myself up again but I just - I took the children all day and I didn't have time. You know it's easier for me in the morning if I - if I think about it during the night. Can't sleep but I think about it. Well. But today I'm feeling all right. Tonight...But I - is there any answer for any questions...you know like what can I do...am I...solving my problems if they're solved?...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know. I don't know. I try to think we're going to do something together...coming into this sort of expecting the most minimal kind of response from me.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know - I really don't know what to expect. And I don't know, you know like -

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: If I'm supposed to sit and talk for an hour about anything that's on my mind, that's it? And then what happens then? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you don't see very much happening in that time span.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I don't know what to expect. I don't see that it can be that beneficial. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I could sit and talk for an hour or two with myself couldn't I?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure...You're saying if all I do is talk for an hour I might as well be talking to a blank wall. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Is that what's going to happen?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so. Kind of think things through...I'm not -

</p><p>PATIENT: Well - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're feeling apprehensive, you're - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I do. Because you know like I - I've been...and there's just you know people like, people will think it's utterly a shock. Well not everybody. But like my neighbors and my friends and you know...And I'm not really - and I don't, you know, I've just never told anybody that there's anything wrong with me...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like - like -

</p><p>PATIENT: It's a little embarrassing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's embarrassing and uncomfortable to be here and to say, "There's something wrong with me."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: No I don't. Well you work so - you know? For years you work to keep it covered over and then it starts kind of blowing apart. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like - it sounds like years of as actors trying to push it down and move it over and then have to come in and show all your ragged edges.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well really I've never really thought too much about what was wrong with me. Because I'm...in psychology I thought everything - well I didn't know what to expect out of a marriage. Who does?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And you know...doing okay.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I think when you get with - like, Chris in a college atmosphere, it really, the people are so much different than our friends in Springfield, who were, like - who really have nothing between the couples. The husbands are always out on the golf course or in the beer hall or someplace that - I thought that because my husband was home occasionally I was doing pretty good. Which - we still weren't doing anything at home. I mean there was...conversations. You know? I'm not interested in, in um, in what he's doing. Even though I see him...And I just, one of the things that - he's really kind of grown away from me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. You really lack contact with him. Like in some ways, a stranger?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well - no...You know you're so used to them being one way. It's like coming home to see a stranger.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know just about...about being my own husband. I could cry and get it all over with and just kind of...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wish you could get over your...

</p><p>PATIENT:...So I could talk normally.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's very stuffy...place. Can't talk and you can't cry. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I really feel like I'm going to have to change myself because I'm not going to change my husband. Wasn't worth it. I don't know what to - really what to do other than get outside interests, whatever they may be. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It kind of sounds like you've sort of given up on getting closer to him.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think I could be closer to him if I read his psychology books. But he doesn't - of course I don't read that much. I'm only interested in that much, you know, I like to read but I like to read novels, historical novels. And he doesn't. He really doesn't have the time. I think he's read one novel in 7 years. I mean he reads all the time but it's not the same thing that I read. You know I, like I try to take up his papers or you know...time. I don't know all of his history that's gone into the paper. I can't catch up...So...because I really don't know, you know if it's my opinion or what I read in that column. And then he says, "Well -"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you only knew - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Such and such - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He wouldn't think that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Ha ha. Well maybe he thinks I would think that anyway. It's all about being strong. I have to be part time boss...I was brought up with it...the mothers, they don't go out and work. Some...I don't hear that mess at home. I'm not that great a mother that I wouldn't see that...every morning.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They could do without you but the kinds of standards you carry around would start to say, "Don't do that. That's wrong."

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well I think - I don't know if I really thing it's wrong. I know that my parents think that it's wrong. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe it's that they don't know any better than I. Who are they living with?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: So....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hopefully you'll find working with this.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, really, like, you know the people that - the women I know are you know...the woman should have her own identity. And I really feel like I don't - I - I don't have the ambition to keep going to school. I'm not a student. I don't enjoy that kind of studying and - and doing that. But if I, no, but like surely they would think higher of you if I was doing something and having my own life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if that - I mean I know that's important to me, what other people think about me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: More so than what I do. It's, you know, like how are they going to feel about it...And I don't know if I'm...about getting a job. The money would certainly be nice...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The money would be nice and the girls can think boy, there goes someone who's having her own life.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But - we were talking about that last night. Um, and I wasn't real sure what Jim thought. You know - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT:...like, um, women's liberation or the division of labor?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know. So I don't know if that's - he doesn't want that because - he'd like me to work. He...find a job. He'd have to get the...school from me...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So, yeah I guess that would be - well, I...if I had a part time job. Maybe. You know if I had two. I depends on how I...my job.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean - I don't know what that means.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like if Jim was home - like if I worked in the afternoons if Jim was home to watch the children. Because they - because I'm not going to babysitter. And I wouldn't want my children with a babysitter. You know and that babysitter gets sick and then somebody else comes in and- it's too much of a mess. Although they would like a babysitter.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And...but Wes' mother's working, that would be - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's say it's not going to work. You've got kind of the practical considerations of the, the type things that matter about whether you get a job. You could get a job if the practical considerations - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: are worked out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, you know if it was like - like an ideal job where you, you had your hours, if you tell them you're sick you didn't go in. You could have somebody responsible to take care of your children. I mean every woman would do that, I'm sure. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm. And you'd jump on it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really would. Because I really did...especially in the wintertime. I mean - because like, you know the kids are in the house all the time. And you can't - you can't move without - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Tripping over a child. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well you can't go - you can't go to the bathroom. "What are you doing mom?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm.

</p><p>PATIENT: They're standing over the bed. It's like...You know there's a very small time that you can be alone. And it's while like they're outside playing all day. Well you try and do anything - even when you're polishing your fingernails somebody comes in and you have to leave.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So. I mean a woman's pride is really bad. They never ever have any privacy or any freedom. They say you don't need freedom.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what he says. But when you're sitting there with a full...in December and the children screaming, you have to get a moment for yourself. It feels like your head is going to explode.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just um, I just can't find a role like that...I've been trying to...And that's another thing. I never really argue with...so all I do is scream.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're yelling too much. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And trying -

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't, you know, really it's illogical...You know I'm right and he's wrong and why does he talk about it? But he never agrees with me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like, you know not only dos he never agree with you but he always - I'm not sure if he's...what it is he's saying.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes he does. And you know and you can see that, that he is really, he is right. And that really deflates your ego. You know after years, day after day.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you seem - 

</p><p>PATIENT: very stupid. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Second rate. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Even when it comes to disciplining the children, you know, they're - he's always read something that says you do it this way...I think the longer I live I'm getting stupider and...to feel.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. Sounds like day in and day out, year in and year out he sort of ruins the way...tends to...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're some days feeling like I'm afraid of these things.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean I think many days I feel like that. But if like, you know like I'm with my friends and they let me speak to things important...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel all right with them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I do. And I think you know he's a little jealous of that too. It's like...two friends that I'd rather be with than him. Yeah really I have more in common with my friends...or books...they read novels. And I always, you know...now that's really harder to see. I mean that I would rather be with my friends than my husband. I mean I wouldn't want a marriage that I'd, you know, we'd be following each other around because we live next door to that. And I think that they must - I mean they really do, they have a good marriage, I think. But I'd be awfully bored with the same person all the time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want that but it sounds like you're...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well...You know what marriage is all about, is it?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like that to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I haven't read that anyway.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem right.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. It really doesn't. I know my parents always talked about things to do...which was farming. I guess it was what my father did and that's what they talked about. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The sure thing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I really don't - you know some things in behavioral science are interesting but I'm not going to - I can't. You know I'd have to have a Ph.D. to be coaching the same classes he is. To be able to talk about it. And that's...you know? 'Cause I couldn't even get through college. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you couldn't even - couldn't even make it through something relatively simple as college how could you....case studies are far more difficult work than - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're saying I didn't even have the - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Gumption to study.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I still don't. I still would not study. You know? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't have any interest to go to class...I think if I could take my courses...educational psychology. But you all have to go through that before you get to anything that interests anybody. I could pick and choose my own courses without having a prerequisite...It's the same thing as it is with the Time and Newsweek...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that wouldn't work either.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I guess not. Might be something to do to pass the time but - I just wish that I had some sort of interesting hobby besides reading. You know? Even...you know that's sort of something that we could talk about especially, but he could, you know, at least compliment me if I put something together right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT:...real fond of that. And that's my real big problem is I don't have any interests, really. I'm a really superficial person. I guess that's probably why I don't sleep at all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When you say superficial it sounds like you feel like you don't have a core function...

</p><p>PATIENT: No...But I'm not really too deep. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No - nothing you can try.

</p><p>PATIENT: No....if you aren't doing something, isn't it? You know something constructive? Everybody else seems to be doing something constructive.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe this is marching along - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe nothing.

</p><p>PATIENT: And I think - yeah I don't - I don't think...anybody else is, you know, like...get involved in politics. I don't know that much about the candidate to really voice an opinion. I might be on the wrong side. You never know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you've finally found something that you're involved in or you - 

</p><p>PATIENT: I hang around the wrong people!

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Terrible person!

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah...I've asked to work over in the Central Park neighborhood class. You know as a, I don't know what they want me to do. Something volunteer, you know? But that would mean I'd have to get a babysitter for the children and that's something again, like they'll find tons to do but it costs me money to volunteer to do this. I mean what do you - what do you do...volunteer. I mean you're going to be outside the home paying a babysitter....money...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I might get a couple of chores...'Cause I really do feel like we're doing everything for my husband. You know, all these sacrifices.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. So that he can go to school.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah...Well and what am I getting? I'm not really getting anything out of the life or his school. You know...to be happy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: In his work.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's not going to change his home situation. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's just going to be the same toward you and you're, it's like you get adamant like...boredom...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you know until he started reading books on psychotherapy I was not, I mean I was just really content. I just kind of floated along daily looking forward to bridge games and you know, the house is clean, the children are all right. And he's the one that's really just disrupted my whole life. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Sounds like you were doing all right until he started dabbling in this and all of a sudden - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not right anymore.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Well, he messes up my life, I mean he thinks about really what he wants to do. I'm very bitter towards him because I...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he needs you to pay the consequences.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean he's - he's the one really pushing me to - to come here and go through this. Well, I don't know...put anything into it...You're just going to be the same, it's just going to be a waste of time. You know so I'm really not expecting very much out of this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Sounds like you're thinking I'm here because he wants me to be here, huh?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that's why I came in the beginning.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: But um I would like to improve myself just to prove to him that I could.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of as a challenge.

</p><p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Yeah it's like a dare...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'll show you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I will have that confidence that I can. You know because they think our problems in- in - in bed have been getting - well since he's been going here to school it really, it's gotten worse. Like I don't want anything to do with him. Because he - well he says it works both ways and I guess it does because if we have intercourse and I expect him to help me, and be nice to me - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But then I - I think that when he's nice to me then he expects me to get into bed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...sex.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like, you know, if he - if he does something, like he says a nice word - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, then he expect you to...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah! And that's - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's not how you operate. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's not my function, you know? Well, I guess it is. But I don't enjoy it. And I never have really enjoyed sex but it's been getting so much worse.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Since he started reading?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah! Well - yeah, I mean not because he reads - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: - but because he tells me all this and that we really don't have a good sexual relationship. You know and I know that. But if nobody misses it I think it...he can't. You know it doesn't mean that much, I mean I would like to climax, I think that would that I should.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But...you know you should but it would never - you know I guess maybe you know if it was time for me to die and we'd never ever - we'd been married so many years and you'd never climaxed you'd really think you were missing that. I mean I really think that I would really enjoy sex if only I got something out of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's getting so much worse, you know, it - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean when we were first married it was all right, you know - I didn't cry about it like you hear, you know, oh she's got a headache. She's tired. And it wasn't something I wanted to do. But I did it and I tried, I thought I tried.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I didn't want to try again. There's not, um, you know you can read a lot of books but - I mean they don't say exactly how you reach a climax. I don't know - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: - what you have to do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah...when you were first married you didn't like it especially but you tried. You...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well when we were - we had trouble because we were so ignorant. He didn't even know where his penis was supposed to go. I mean that is really stupid and we didn't know anything.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, and - and it hurt. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I didn't - I didn't even know - well my mother said it does but it's wonderful. But it might've been her.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All it was to you was sort of pain and difficulty.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it - you know I don't think it's all it's cracked up to be for me. I mean a man always gets their pleasure.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're left with - empty.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So you know you can- 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: - do it for him. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But my whole life is for him and the kids so, you know, why not intercourse, I guess. But I want to get something out of something sometime.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Instead of nothing out of anything...

</p><p>PATIENT: ...in the last week I just - really I just kind of get sick to my stomach when we were in bed. You know, I'd had it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not fun and - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: More than just fun.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And he's getting like, when we were first married he tried awfully hard and now it's like it's not going to be any good so might as well get it over with.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. So he's given up.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean you try to...

</p><p>PATIENT: ...And I'm, you know I used to even be in the frame of mind. And now I can't even get worked up to where I ever would've...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You could learn something there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Supposedly. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sure seems like you're not going to move it at all.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think that I'm going to have to...do something about him. You know we were talking about were we even in love when we got married. Like you know just convenient. My folks wanted me to marry him, his folks wanted me to marry him, he was in the service, he was lonely. I wasn't getting along in school, my grades...And so why not get married? And I don't - I don't know if I've ever really felt - you know? I don't know how you're supposed to feel - I mean he really doesn't turn me on that much. But he never - he never did. And then...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...is not sort of someone that makes you - 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, he really isn't. And I don't think I'm doing that for him anymore either. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Doing what thing?

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, kind of turning him on.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh!

</p><p>PATIENT: Just by, you know, being around. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes....mean all that much to him either. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It really should. We're just kind of used to living together. You know, we have children, we - we don't - we don't fight, but we don't have that much - we don't have anything together, really, except for the kids.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm....together out of inertia...

</p><p>PATIENT: ...pick up and move. You know, apart. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh....

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like I mean I couldn't while he's in school. He'd have to drop out of school. To support, you know, paying child support.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I wouldn't have the courage to leave him.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Unless he started beating me or - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Unless he throws you out of the house.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It would have to be...yeah. He'd be a pretty boring life. I mean even if he were working, there's nothing to come home to...you know without someone to help. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's even a....

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well apart I don't think he can do it. I mean the children would suffer. Because it's not like we, you know, could ... I mean in that case if you just really, you couldn't stay on the side of either person, if he couldn't stand me and I couldn't stand him, then I would.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That would be - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like if it were, like, overly negative between you two that would be a clear cut case of something where you could just pack up and leave.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And there's something about the fact that...and argue so much.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Well we get along. If he...you know I can get along generally with most anybody.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: If I get to know someone, like, you know, like a friend, and really get to know them. And I really don't accept all their shortcomings like I would his. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT:...he doesn't have any. (Laughs)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: From that laughter it sounds like he hasn't done such a good job. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, you know everything I say about Jim, you know, he will never show any warmth or affection to me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, he'll say he can't because there was never any warmth or affection in his house....and he can't change...that's why he's going to come here. To change his behavior. So that he can be a little more outgoing and warm. Well I, you know, I don't know that much about behavior but I don't, you know...but he just can't be a little more affectionate and warm. I'm not quite...on that, if he worked a little harder at it. Because he's very good with the girls. You know, he's a very good father, he's - I think he's affectionate and warm with them. You know, why can't he be to me? Well his father wasn't with his mother so...he can't. And I sometimes wonder if he isn't using just that, you know, that education.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: A woman's education is very dangerous...He reads something, he comes home, and now we're not supposed to do this with the girls, we're supposed to do this, this and this. You know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like all he can do is read a little thing and then he goes off changing everything to fit in with whatever theory it is he happens to be reading.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But he usually does think things through. And he usually is right except with the children you'll never know. I mean that's how like, say they're grown and they say listen folks, you really messed it up with us. If you'd have not done that we'd have turned out a lot better. You know. And so you're never really sure. And I'm - and I don't - you know it's a question of well they're using their old...saying, "I hate you." And the parents. And I don't think that really sounds good...such and such says you're supposed to let your children, you know, have their own feelings and say what they feel otherwise they'll become pent up and hostile like me. (Laughs) I, you know, I can't quite buy - it just - I don't see any other kids on the block saying, "I hate you, Mom." And I don't like my kids being quite that free.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean they can think that, I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. They're entitled to their own thoughts - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: - but they'd better keep them - they'd be happier if they keep them to themselves.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, how do you know what's right with children?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The payoff comes 20 years later.

</p><p>PATIENT: So that's really our - what we argue about, is how to raise kids. You know, and money...we don't have any now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't really have that much self-control. If there's a little bit of money around the house I might spend it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he doesn't like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't imagine why. (Laughs)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs) You sound so pleased with yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Well, he's not that severe, you know - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: - that I would ever - I don't think I ever will run us into bankruptcy but if he doesn't crack down I'm not - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: About to buckle under?

</p><p>PATIENT: ...period of time that if I see something I really - well even like I need shoes - well I can get by with these if we never go anyplace but he's got a new pair of shoes (laughs) why can't I? You know, but if you only have so much money and he's already spent it on his shoes. You know he would think well, then I shouldn't have them.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because that - because we all, it sounds like money-wise we've already spent the shoe allotment for the month.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The fact that they were for my shoes is irrelevant.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The point is that it's been spent.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. So you don't have any money to spend, you know - but I don't really listen that much to what he says about money because - I can write a check, I guess. I just don't...self some shoes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I beg your pardon?

</p><p>PATIENT: Can I get myself some shoes. And that's really a minor part, you know, of our being too. Because that's like once a month...wanting to spend the money. We don't really have any big expenses...He lets it go. He's not that strong.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT:...taken my checkbook away from me a month ago we'd be in much better shape. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he started...let you kind of get away with that out of not being sort of solid.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then - well we argued once about, it's the children after he got new...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Let's talk about this, the book makes him sound like an interior decorator who reads about a new theme, color scheme or...and comes home and redoes the whole house. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that regularly, every two weeks.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm sure he's not that bad but it sure seems like it. But I, you know, I would like...like I like the fact that he does help with the children and he knows that they're his. You know, like some husbands do like they're the woman's child.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, and they have no part in them at all. You know they're just kind of strangers who just happened by. But the woman has to take care of them. I think now that at least that they're...and he does help. But I kind of would like to set the, you know, how they behave.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. It sounds like on the one hand you're appreciative - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: - that he does take that responsibility - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you're right.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: - but on the other hand - 

</p><p>PATIENT: But sometimes I think he...Yeah, he kind of steps over into the mother role. And it might be because he's a student, too. And he's home so much more.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it doesn't leave you any authority or darn little authority.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: We should be stopping in a couple minutes. I wanted to check with you if this is the kind of thing you expected? Or what kinds of feelings may have?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think it's really a lot easier for me to talk to a guy...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't sound like it feels right.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think it will be much easier for me next Tuesday than it was for the first time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. It sounds like it feels less painful or - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It really is.

</p><p>COUNSELOR:...than you expected. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because even if I want to talk to Jim and, you know, like the last time I came home from you, I really - I was really - I, you know, so embarrassed that I cried. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Jim said well, maybe you...that would be one thing to get out of it. But you know, I think, I had a beer and then I could really talk to him....a lot of things that...you know, things that pop into your mind that you'd like to have someone to - to tell them to and he's not there. When I'm...he wants to talk. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And...he wants to talk to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well it gives him allowance as well. Less, you know, don't expect me to talk to you if you're not going to talk to me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right. It just sounds like you're...is one sided. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can't talk to him but he comes crashing in on your side. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or he gets a little bitter when I talk back. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think I want to, also before we talk I want to try to be clear...be clear about appointment times and stuff. I guess my secretary...

</p><p>PATIENT:...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If that's convenient for you. I'd like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And usually we're 50, 55 minutes...I think I want to check something out with you. I wondered if you were having feelings about all the tape recorders. Something I thought I noticed you noticed them when you came in. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I knew they were going to be on...(Laughs)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess we should stop. Let me know if you have an appointment to make. And what I'd like you to do with this is to drop it in the box by the receptionist's window.

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm hmm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I can't remember if it's her window or if it's the window that faces to the right of the other two windows. And Sally will have a record of your appointment...

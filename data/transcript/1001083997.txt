<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so with that we just set that there and ignore it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good afternoon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Actually you can, you can do that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, the synopsis of my [DEIDENTIFIED] vacation was very nice except for two horrific bad back days.  Really, I mean we went to a movie, we went to see [DEIDENTIFIED], my nephew is in it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With [NAME OTHER].  The one scene he's in, he's only got a few lines, but he's plastered on the screen, he was the brother of the star in the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, did I tell you that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mentioned the last time you were here about that film.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did I talk to you about [DEIDENTIFIED]?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've seen you after, oh God, I don't even remember.  Anyway so now we have another problem, I was at [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office.  The depression is fair.  I've been dealing with the pain the best I can, you know, from my fall.  I'm totally, totally depressed because I can't do anything with my grandson and um, I forget what I was going to say now - I, I lost it.  Oh, I'm at [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office and he's telling me how horrific my back, the bottom of my spine is, and I'll probably really need surgery.  Not even to put rods, just take the bone out because it's absolutely - still don't understand that, but I get a phone call, my daughter is calling me for a change.  I'm scared that something really bad has happened, I said, well her breast implant broke.  She's walking around now in agony, looking for doctors.  We come to find out today, the doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] who was arrested for tax evasion was not a licensed board certified surgeon like he said he was.  He practiced with his wife and did the surgery under false pretenses.  He lied about everything so we have to call the American Medical Association because I can't even find the name in the phone book.  And hopefully -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is she - has she called?  Has she looked for him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We both are, I'm helping her, and she does most of her research online.  Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there someone that's going to be able to fix it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's going to have to get financing and then [NAME OTHER] is going to have to use a card that he can't afford to use but she cannot, how can she walk around with the thing poking out.  I mean, that's just, it's not a question, like my son was being resentful, that's not a question of cosmetic surgery.  It's a necessity.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At this point there's hope.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She hasn't found out.  She has no insurance.  She has no credit.  She has no nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just lousy.  She's just been reading up and, although she did give us money last week because she's been giving us money every two weeks but I had a couple of [INAUDIBLE] days you know with depression, just everything piling up on me and physically so much has to do with the depression at this point, I think, because I'm so incapable of doing what I need to do, what I want to do, and then there is the real pain.  I'm on the medication, and so much medication that I should be stoned all the time and I'm not and it's not a question of, I didn't have the pills for two weeks, remember I told you when I didn't have my meds, my pain pills and there was no withdrawal at that point so it's not a question of being immune to the pills it's just cutting the edge but they're very strong.  The restaurant, [NAME OTHER] owns a restaurant when I talked to you I think I told you that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's sort of falling through.  I just, I'm lonely, I'm depressed, you know, I'm not, I'm trying, I'm really trying, really trying.  I've gotten in touch with a lot of my old friends on the computer -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> From high school because we're having a reunion. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And when's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In October.  So I told [NAME OTHER] in surgery [INAUDIBLE] after October I'll suffer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was fun, really fun.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I just, I just feel so worthless, I just feel like crap because I can't do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Although, just a moment ago you were explaining how you're helping [NAME OTHER] explore -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't mean that though, I mean for myself, I mean things that I can just do for myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like, what do you feel you're behind with - other stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It hurts, I'm not even relying so much but even for vacuuming, for cleaning the house, for pulling the wet clothes out of the washing machine, it hurts me.  Every, I'm in pain constantly.  And the arthritis, when the fibromyalgia kicks in, I'm done, I'm done for as long as that lasts.  On top of everything, but when my shoulders have been really been bothering me a lot now so I'm just miserable because I'm [AGE], I just had a birthday, happy birthday to me, and I just feel like crap because in my head I can still do it, and physically I just can't do it.  Other than that, things are fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. But I guess part or it -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean you do still do a lot [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but being in pain all the time is not fun.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME], did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] suggest anything different, or is he gonna plan a knee surgery or is [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, if I had agreed, he would plan it right away but I just want to see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With a morphine pump?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, no, I'm allergic to morphine so bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's the other, [INAUDIBLE] simulator?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had the um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had the um, I forgot what you call it, I've had the Cortisone shots but I've also had the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Epidural?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The epidural but I've had the, I can't remember what it is?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  He takes an x-ray right here and then he injects you, injects the different areas, the um, I can't remember, my memory, I can't remember.  And nothing is working, and so.  Even though he said I'm not a good candidate, it's either that or be on medication for the rest of my life so this is something that my family, you know, my husband and I have to talk about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what's the procedure he's - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He said he's not even putting rods in.  He's taking bones out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's like a fusion or a -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's probably more of a fusion.  I've already had a laminectomy in [DATE]. But the pain is so bad it just, I mean anything that, everything is connected to the spine and just, I can't remember the um, uh, I can't remember the name but I had one [INAUDIBLE] procedures, but I can't get the shots until probably the end of August because I just had them.  The first one worked, the second didn't, and the third [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I get very, very sad.  I just, I'm sad because it's an effort, everything I do is an effort, and let me, it's like breathing, you don't think about breathing, you know unless you're asthmatic which I am, I've had lung problems, but when you just do normal things like you want to do, you can't do them, and the baby will say to me, come on Ya Ya, take me here or there -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and [NAME OTHER] is just so good.  He helps me so much and I feel like I'm worthless.  I just feel like crap.  You know, I mean, I know it's good to cry and I've had a couple of good [INAUDIBLE], but I just have to thank God I'm alive and just go on as I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, changing the way you're thinking and realizing that, yeah, you've been through all these, you aren't the same as you were ten years ago.  You've been through these surgeries, you've been through the difficulty with the, your hips and the apparatus, and this and that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The colon was a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've been through quite a bit that it would affect how you're able to do what you're used to being able to do but not being able to do some of those things doesn't mean that you aren't able to do a lot of other things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But even just playing with my grandson, just even, you know, volunteering at the school, you know, I can't commit myself to anything.  I can't and it's lonely at home and even when people are there it's lonely -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know.  There was a movie, one time, the uh, I think it was something like the quietness of death thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The quiet -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The quiet of death thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just.  It's just, it's -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But there's nothing else you could do to get you out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I go out for breakfast, I'm able to, I take a pillow and I can sit for a little while but I can't go, I don't visit, I stay to myself most of the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well if you're working on your reunion, what does that mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it gives me something to look forward to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But are you working with the committee or working with the people that are planning it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, no, no, I'm just going.  I'm just going, but I mean, people are contacting me and um via the computer that I haven't heard from in forty years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there something that you can do to put your mind on that and help with it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't really want to help with it, but I don't know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'd be good at planning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.  I did -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'd be good at like, you know, doing - that doesn't mean, planning doesn't mean you actually have to do things.  You know, working with the people, figuring out the course of the evening or the catering or whatever would make it special.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My neighbor, my widowed neighbor who was unable to get any benefits, Social Security Disability, she had cancer plus her husband died, couldn't get any benefits from him, I took her to the congressman and I took her to Social Security and that really helped move with things and I wrote a letter to the editorial which is going in the paper, you know, thanking the congressman.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that just involved typing and driving places and then typing the letter, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean you were helping and using your mind.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which is good.  Maybe you're able to do those things and things like that versus -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Physical.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Doing a lot of the physical things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But sometimes it's, mentally I'm hurting and I'm thinking about the pain, I'm dwelling on the pain because it's just overbearing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean it's constant.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there's nothing else to get your mind off of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.  And when it does is like a welcome - because it's a relief for however, an hour, a minute, whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then it goes back to just where I'm thinking about it again because it's so overpowering.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think when you unload and there is nothing going on, that's all you're left with.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But even when I'm with people, I'm constantly moving myself and sitting in pain, you know, sitting and feeling the pain and I'm trying to concentrate.  That's why I can't remember.  I'd go into a meeting uh to the borough, and [NAME OTHER], my lawyer, happened to be the bank's lawyer, and it was all about learning to respond and everything and I did speak at the meeting but I was so uncomfortable and I'm trying to make my point through and trying to have a conversation.  Doctor, I can't even remember names, I saw your name five minutes later, I lose it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't even, I can't remember anything.  And it's scary because with my mother's Alzheimer's, I think about that but I just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I think that, you know, when you're depressed and you're focusing on the pain, you're not going to concentrate -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The negativity.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not going to concentrate as well too so, you know, you may remember certain things and maybe not remember others at certain times.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean right now, my whole, from my waist down -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just throbs, just absolutely throbs.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it raining outside too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but it doesn't matter, the weather and then I trip over things, the inability to be, I don't want to be twenty one years old, I don't want to be what I was ten years ago, I just want to be able to function properly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What does that mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That means not tripping over things, that means not stuttering, that means -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Functioning properly though, if you have issues with your back it's going to be different.  What is functioning properly with the x-rays and the physical findings of your back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a disability; I know it's a disability.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right but how, and when you have one, how will you adapt to it?  What are those changing expectations and when you say functioning properly, it's a very gray area.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I don't expect -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's properly?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to expect to trip over things when I'm walking.  I don't want to trip over my own feet.  I don't expect to be stuttering.  I don't expect to start crying for nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's not for nothing.  If you start crying, there's a reason.  There is a reason.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I feel that I just should be, it shouldn't be happening, I just should be - I'm smarter than that.  I mean I'm just, I should not, I just didn't, not giving myself enough credit for realizing the fact that I am ill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mentally and physically and I know it, and it angers me, I get really pissed off or all of the sudden I'm just standing there and I lose my balance, or I trip or I'm ending a sentence and I start to stutter and somebody will either mock [INAUDIBLE], or else they'll finish the sentence for me, or else they'll laugh and it's just watching like [INAUDIBLE] me anymore.  What I think I should be I could be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  I know what you're saying but part of that, what you think you should be and could be are things that you can control and things you can't and that if you could control the pain and the issues with your back, you would have already.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right and that's what's so frustrating because even with the medicine, I still have to deal with that pain.  The pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's where a lot of your anger comes up and I would imagine the thought was there and present and it cannot at this moment be changed. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My regular family doctor who I've had for years, you remember what I told you that happened with the Xanax and all that and he didn't trust me with the pills and then I went back and he saw my condition and he said to me I never thought I'd be saying this, you're not on enough pain meds and I know that and I'm taking them so correctly now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I just, it's I'm angry, angry because they're not working.  I expect miracles I guess.  I expect to be pain free.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're going to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] for the pain, he's your pain management doctor right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well actually, my doctor, my family doctor prescribes the medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but that in terms of new int - he prescribes it but new interventions and changes -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In terms of the pain medication are being [INAUDIBLE] [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, and you have an appointment with him and he is working with you for other interventions for the pain, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but I don't have to see him until maybe September.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Unless something comes up because we can't do the shots again, the radiofrequency, that's what it was that I was trying to remember.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, did he make any other suggestions for things you could do between now and September?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You don't think a TENS unit would help or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've had them.  I've done everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  In the last, since the shots?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't had a TENS unit since the fall, but I did have it previously and I can remember putting it on the highest [INAUDIBLE] and it didn't work, it just made me feel a little uncomfortable but it was there and I wore a back brace, the kind like you wear at Pep Boys but it does help and we have pillows, we have car pillows all over, the heating pads, I just wish I could just do more.  I'm not a happy camper.  You think?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yeah, but that's part of is just being able to feel secure with what's being done for your back.  And how your back is now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm petrified.  I'm petrified of surgery.  I know that I'll be okay without the morphine, that I won't go crazy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] met you, thank God for that though, but because they know that I'm allergic to morphine but I just think to myself, dear God, you've had like eleven surgeries, are you going to live through this one, you know, I'm scared.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's not until October?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If we decide.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If - yeah.  And he's not suggesting it right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, he did suggest it.  But he said, initially, he said surgery would not be an option because it was getting' so bad but then he said he didn't know what else to do but surgery. And I asked him, well what would you do and he said I'm not quite sure yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's still up in the air?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I think I worry about worrying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.  That's the issue that we talked about before where if you have one step in front of you, you're five steps ahead already.  But, okay, the appointment - keep up [INAUDIBLE] the appointment, it's not until September.  He hasn't suggested the surgery.  He said he's going to look into it but he's obviously not doing that now.  I'm sure that when you go back, they'll have ideas about [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He did suggest surgery but I said I wouldn't do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He didn't know what he would do though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Didn't know what kind.  He didn't know - usually if he's going to sit there and talk to you about surgery, he's going to say we need to do this procedure and you sign a consent form with the specific procedure put in the consent form.  You're not to that point yet, you didn't sign the consent form for that specific type of intervention.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Has it even been determined?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Right, but he's not -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're already under the knife.  That's what it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you're right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've done that before where you've had one level of stress and you've been 5 steps -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you know what -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Down the road already in the most negative way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I even had my husband last time, I told him my son is trying to fix up his house and sell it because they have no room.  He said here I am going, not thinking of our future because there's a rental upstairs and downstairs, that's how we pay the mortgage, I said why don't we sell the house to [NAME OTHER] and we'll live there for free in our unit and still collect the one rent and then [NAME OTHER] said to me, [PATIENT NAME] what's going to happen when we're seventy years old and we need the two rents to live you know and I'm thinking, I'm worrying for his family now, as well as I'm worrying for my daughter and [INAUDIBLE].  I'm making myself sick over it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but you know, he's an adult.  It sounds like he will come up with answers as well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  But you're -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't blame anybody but me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't try to take the responsibility away from him of coming up with a solution.  He always seems to come up with the right answers.  They're a two income household too, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And your daughter in law makes -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're both resourceful.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they're -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they've stopped spending [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they're young and have careers and they've got lessons to learn but they also have a lot of gifts.  They have resources that are theirs.  You know what I'm saying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they should be able to come up with an answer for themselves.  They've always been pretty independent, your son has, more so than your daughter, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So again, before you worry about him, give him credit for what you know about him already, you know what I mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you know that he's a, he's been independent and able to make good decisions.  Decisions that are right for him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I might as well tell you this that because he's got low credit, we've also enabled him sign for a credit card, more than what they have, so I mean I don't win either way, I'm screwing up all over the place and I feel guilty telling you that but I did it, it is what it is.  I just um, sometimes I could kill myself, you know what, only a senior citizen home wouldn't be so bad, just, you know, I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You and your husband both are not ready yet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just get, I'm involved when they want me involved then shut out when they don't want me there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where do you feel shut out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I do something and it's not what they want to hear or money or just - and yet when they need something, I'm the best thing since apple pie.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think, you know, they're responsible for their reactions.  You're giving them advice and making statements for telling it like it is as you observe it.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not allowed sometimes.  But it's some, like -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, if you're worried about their reaction, you know, then you have to kind of look -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I did tell my son, I don't care what you say anymore, I'm your mother and if you don't like it you can say screw you -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There you go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We can have an argument, I'm going to say it anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There you go.  Yeah, I kind of figured that's how you handled it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you're going to say what you're feeling because that in terms of your responsibility of whether he acts on it, yknow, follows the advice, doesn't follow the advice, whatever, that's on him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's very smart and she's very smart.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can take heed at least or credit that you said what you were feeling and you didn't hold back but what they do with your words is up to them.  You're not responsible for how they listen or don't listen, do you know what I'm saying?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the fact that you were able to speak up is, I can't imagine you not, if you know what I mean.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because, you know, you do, you don't hold back, that's good.  You know, if there's something there and you've been thinking about it, maybe in some circumstances where you find yourself in the position I told you so.  But sometimes, I imagine, you know -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> His anger has gotten a lot better and, in fact, I was watching television the other day and there was a thing on Men's Health magazine, there is a disease where the anger that men have and it was in this magazine and I called him up and I said [NAME OTHER], why don't you go to the store and buy this magazine? And he said mom would you believe I get it every month. But his wife said he's been a lot better. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, then when I see the baby come to me and go my daddy's mean, you know, that kills me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, how many kids -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At varying ages haven't said that one or the other or both parents have been mean.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Dad's mean because he didn't give me a new baseball, whatever, whatever the complaint is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just worry about worrying. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay.  You have to have some worry in your life. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want any worry, I don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you can let it go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know what though, it's like even with the business, like I told you before, I used to run, literally run the [DEIDENTIFIED] that we had years ago.  I don't want any, I don't even know how to turn the lights on at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't even know where they are in the one we have now.  I don't even know where the books are, nothing, nothing.  Anything that stresses me out, it's like I, it's like I go into panic mode.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, obviously, it might not be a bad thing if it's a family business for you to know some of the details.  You know -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean the waitresses have keys to the place. I lost mine and I don't even care. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I guess it's you and your husband's livelihood and you get involved in - because God forbid if something were to happen to your husband.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd be up shit's creek.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  It's more like just knowing who, the staff and knowing roughly where things are would be important for you to know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know nothing, nothing. Aand I can't sit anymore because of the pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need prescriptions today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You sure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All we need to do is set up another visit, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two weeks? Thank you very much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank you for this.  Let me turn this off. </p>

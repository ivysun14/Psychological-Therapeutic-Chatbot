<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how are you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  How's the summer going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Busy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did you go to the parade?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We skipped the parade, the kids had swim lessons, so decided to go to swim lessons and then went to the fireworks, we thought it would be too long of a day if we did both.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.  It's goofy, it's hilarious.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My mom went, she said it's huge again.  It's getting bigger.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thirty thousand.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Holy smokes, the whole town.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The county probably.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They had a real marching band that was coming for, I guess, [DEIDENTIFIED] was having some battle of the marching bands.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you could tell they were out of town because they were perfectly straight and did exactly what they were supposed to do.  You just don't belong here.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, no.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nice costumes, the whole nine yards.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.  That's cool.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I heard they had an elephant.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they did, they had elephants.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, that's amazing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> These huge big things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So did you have good seats where you could see?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we had friends here set up at like six thirty in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So we found them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's smart.  Well, good, good.  So how have you been feeling overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's something. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Synthroid has helped without the side effects you had with Cytomel?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No side effects at all</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No heart pounding?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.  So your mood has been pretty good most of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have more energy, yeah, that's the thing more than anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Is your energy level pretty good now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good and are you sleeping okay at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do pretty well, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Are you having trouble getting to sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like how often does that happen, like in an average week of seven nights?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, probably twice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and how long does it take you on those bad nights?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A while, like a couple of hours.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Couple hours.  What do you do, do you lay there and toss and turn?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get up and do stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER], he can't take medications for allergies so he's snoring.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no and does he fall asleep before you and then keep you awake?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's like, how do men do that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thirty seconds, are you like that?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Just laying there, [NAME OTHER] you're snoring again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know what that is.  There was an article in [DEIDENTIFIED], it was a cover story a few months back about why women can't sleep and they talked about how common it is for women, my allergies are starting to kick up, women, especially in their [AGE] and up, they just can't sleep and men for some reason don't have that problem, they just go out and then they stay out usually whereas women are lighter sleepers typically too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we used to have a waterbed and I was able to, I call it the kangaroo kick, I would lean back and just kick him so that his head was between the bed and the wood and he was snoring, he would sleep like a baby and so would I, it was awesome but then we changed beds and so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So once you get to sleep, you stay asleep or do you wake up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, most of the time, most of the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how many hours of sleep do you think you're averaging, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably six, between six and eight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does that feel like enough?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And your energy level is pretty good now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It really is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good, good, good, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What about your appetite and weight, are they stable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty stable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.   </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stable.  I wish it would drop.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I didn't know if the Synthroid would affect that or not, usually at this dose it doesn't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What dose does it affect it?  How many more do I have to take?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, unfortunately, that's difficult, I'd be taking it, everyone would be taking it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How many more do I need to take?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and unfortunately if you go up to get more beneficial effects, we also run the risk of increasing the risks of side effects though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What are the side effects of it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Kind of like you had before, heart racing, pounding, feeling kind of wired, keyed up, insomnia, weight loss, but also tremulousness, irritability, and if you keep going, you get osteoporosis, it can be hard on your heart, so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Unfortunately.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's the normal when they have low thyroid, what is the normal dose?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, it really varies because it depends on the severity of the thyroid condition.  Some people take a very small amount to be effective; some people take, you know, 100 mcg so it just varies in the individual how much their body is producing and how much more they need to keep it in balance.  How's your concentration and focus?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Worrying about things much these days, not too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Is he doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he seems to be doing better with the eating thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  I can't tell you how many kids I've seen or known about that had that same problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, the first one was the guy who actually built my first house here in [DEIDENTIFIED], his son in high school started being afraid that someone was poisoning his food and he would only eat his mother's cooking or at certain places and he was a bright sharp kid, it had nothing to do with intelligence, it had nothing to do, that was his presenting symptom, he was really losing a lot of weight and the parents were becoming concerned and he ended up, he outgrew it with time.  We tried medications to help him but I know several kids that have had, yknow, with your son, is it that he's afraid the medicine, or the food is not safe to eat?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, this little boy, well he wasn't a little boy, he was a teenager but I know of a few kids who have gone through phases like that where they just become afraid of the food.  I don't know where it comes from.  It seems like maybe it's a symptoms of kind of OCD type.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's an unusual one but it doesn't, in the old days we would have thought oh that's almost paranoid.  We think of, you know, something more serious but it's not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It seems like it may be an anxiety symptom and kids will sometimes grow out of it, sometimes medication helps them.  So is he taking medication now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just working with [NAME OTHER] on it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying to no do the medication.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.  That's her specialty so she's real good so if he can do it without medicine, she'll be able to help him.  Some kids can and some kids take medicine for a short period of time, maybe a year or so, which kind of helps them get out of that thought loop and then they're okay without it too, so whatever works but yeah, that's stressful.  Is he eating okay now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He goes in spurts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But yeah, the same thing, he wants me to cook which is really scary.  That is not my thing, I would rather die than cook and so he has, I make tuna surprise, it's the most pathetic thing, you know, tuna fish, noodles, vegetables, it's good, it's healthy but, you know, I wouldn't give it to any neighbors for dinner.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, he'll beg for tuna surprise, oh please make it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that's good.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Another interesting thing this last year in one of the research publications was that for years we've known that kids that have strep throat infections were more prone to OCD and they think they found out why, did I tell you this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You told [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What is the cause?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They found that when kids get strep throat, they make antibodies to the strep and sometimes those antibodies attach to a certain part of the brain for some reason, it's like a, it's a cross reaction, and they think that's what triggers the OCD symptoms in kids. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he had strep like monthly, did [NAME OTHER] tell you that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He just kind of nodded when I said to him strep, I didn't ask him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's a strong association, I see a lot of kids who develop OCD in childhood that have had recurrent strep, it's very common.  We've known that for years statistically, there was an association but we didn't know why, now they figured out why.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What do you do for it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I would still treat the symptoms just like you would otherwise but, hopefully, we can develop better treatments either to reverse this process, you know, maybe stop those antibodies from attaching to that part of the brain that's maybe triggering the OCD symptoms or, yknow, try to do better screening for strep or better treatment for strep.  Yeah, there's a strong association between recurrent strep throat and OCD symptoms, so that might have been what triggered it for him.  I can't tell you for sure but there's more and more evidence that that's a definite common trigger for OCD symptoms in kids, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not the ever controlling mother?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, it's not mom's fault.  You got off the hook for this one.  I'm sure we'll find something else to blame you for.  The psychiatrist always blames the moms for something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> His teacher, his, her husband is a therapist in town.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I came in to school a couple of times to sit with him during lunch because he wasn't eating anything, he wasn't eating at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I go down and hang out with him.  The best place to go, by the way, if you want to know what's going on at school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The cafeteria?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh my goodness and it's the boys, it's the little girls, they know everything that's going on.  I learned more and I'm going to do that once a month next year, but anyway, I told her, have you noticed he's eating a snack, some people bring in for birthdays or whatever, she said yeah, he's not eating I said and she asked what was going on.  I said well he thinks there's, and she said you know that OCD comes from over controlling moms.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She said that seriously.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I said okay and then I said something to [NAME OTHER] about it and she said well there is a segment of that and you know that [PATIENT NAME] and I said yeah, well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know that's not -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not the root though.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not the whole problem.  Genetics plays a big part, OCD often runs in families but now, especially in childhood, the strep piece I think is huge.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm going with strep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Again, there is more and more evidence for it.  I mean this was really, I remember I read this article about the connection, I think it was the anterior [INAUDIBLE] which is a specific part of the brain, that's where they found these antibodies attaching but that explains it.  I see some of these kids that are, you know, like elementary school or middle school, they have severe OCD symptoms, it's like where did this come from and almost ninety percent or more of those kids had recurrent strep throat which is not common, I mean not all kids get strep throat.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So there's something, so we knew there was an association, we just didn't know why.  I think in the next few years, you're going to see a lot more research coming out about it now that they know what to look for and they've identified the antibodies.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well they're not taking tonsils out with that, I mean it has to be, he had to have strep I don't know how many times before they finally said, okay, maybe we should take his tonsils out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So after that, no more strep, no more, I mean it was incredible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's one of those pendulums that's swinging back again.  When we were kids, everybody got their tonsils out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then nobody did and now it's starting to swing back again because there's another, I had an article on my bulletin for a while, there was a doctor who did cure ADHD by taking kids tonsils out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right because they're not breathing at night, hello.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.  Yeah, my niece had that problem.  She was about [AGE] and you could see a little slit between her tonsils and the back of her throat.  She could hardly breathe at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Now she's doing so much better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, total change.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Same with this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep, it may be, you know, because they took the tonsils out, that left them vulnerable to recurrent strep which might have triggered some of the OCD.  The question now is what's going to be the most effective treatment for him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Counseling may help, if not, a lot of times with low dose SSRIs with kids.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like a Zoloft?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Zoloft, Luvox, Lexapro, something like that, a low dose in kids sometimes will help them get over the hump in terms of their anxieties and fears and then once they break that cycle, a lot of times they don't need the medicine anymore or they can even decrease the dose and gradually wean off of it and they'll do fine.  If they don't get treated, I'm glad he's getting treated though because some of these kids if they don't get treatment, the behavior patterns can persist and they can really start to interfere like with their school work.  I had one little girl who was just really a bright girl but she was so compulsive about her school work, she'd like drop a drop of water on her assignment, she'd have to start the whole thing all over, it was taking her hours to get her work done and after a while she wasn't doing her homework anymore.  She's a bright girl, she's a straight A student, she was failing. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You figured, defeated.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly and got on some medication because counseling wasn't working for her enough.  She got over that and now she does her homework, you know, she's still doing great in school but she doesn't have the anxiety and worry anymore and it really works.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's if this would've happened, I feel when he was at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I would have said, you know, it's totally understandable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But this year, he had an awesome year, great teacher loves him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just really nice kids in the class, a good group of kids.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where did he go this last year?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh, that's right.  Yeah, so it's probably not the environment, you know, it's probably the biochemistry internally, so, well, so, what else, are you having some fun things this summer for yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're going to [NAME OTHER]'s sister's [AGE] birthday party.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, where's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that should be fun, hopefully.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you going to drive there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, we're flying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, we drove back to my in laws in [DEIDENTIFIED], that's a long drive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, with four kids, no way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And [NAME OTHER] is getting ready to do the triple bi pass.  I think it's next weekend, so we can't do anything until his training is over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you going to go up when he does that, are you going to stay home?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'll be home.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] I guess you can't really watch.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I won't be able to find him anyway.  Are you kidding?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, good.  And no side effects from the Synthroid that you can tell, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not that I can tell.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.  I wouldn't expect any at this dose, so any new stresses or changes in life?  Things are going pretty, relatively smoothly?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And are you going to go back to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a really sweet school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, my cousin's daughters went there.  They loved it and they all did very well.  It seems like a wonderful school.  In fact everybody I've talked to that's gone there, I haven't heard any bad things about it.  Well, it sounds like you're doing fine.  So just leave Synthroid the way it is?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, anything else that I didn't ask you about or concerns you've got?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, let's see, I wrote for sixty with two refills so that was a months worth and that was [DATE], so one refill [DATE], one you probably just got or about to get.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm about to get.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and then whenever you need more or actually I can even just call and tell them to add on refills.  Are you still getting it at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why don't I just call and leave a message so you can get what are called pier refills which means you can get them as needed for the next year.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that you don't have to worry about running out anytime.  Anything else you can think of before we set up a new appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I'm good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're doing well.  We can check back in three to six months if you want.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can always call.  Let's see, this is July, I'll check on the next person, so yeah, that's January and let me grab a pencil.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Scary how fast it's going.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They ought to check into a school, why is it so busy and then summer's here and school hasn't started yet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know, when [DATE] hits, I'm like oh my goodness, halfway over.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so do you want to do an eight o'clock on a Monday?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Actually, probably, January school is in so probably a little later, eight thirty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Eight thirty, okay.  Do you want to do like the [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, sounds good now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, if something changes, just call me if you want to reschedule.  Monday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You went to South America, right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We did.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How'd that go?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh it was wonderful.  It was a neat trip.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What did you learn?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh lots of things.  We went down with a group that were nursing professors at [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And some students and we went up into the [DEIDENTIFIED] first and visited some different places, went to a school, I didn't go to school because I was at the health clinic that day.  We went to this health clinic where they had different types of practitioners all working together.  They had a doctor, a nurse practitioner, a shaman and all of them working the same clinic so that was really fascinating to see how they were providing medicine in different ways to different people, so we spent a few days there and then we went down into the jungle and stayed with a family there where the man grows all kinds of plants that he uses for all kinds of things.  He actually wrote a book, I think I took it home, that's showing all these different plants and how to prepare them for different uses, treat everything from cancer to infections to contraceptives to blood disorders, all kinds of things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Successfully?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, he's got students coming down from [DEIDENTIFIED] to study with him and people come almost every week to come down and study with him because he's been doing this for years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now is he a doctor too?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well he doesn't have the training like we do.  He didn't go to medical school.  He just grew up there in the jungle and learned from the other people that lived there because they live in quite a ways, they don't have easy access to doctors like we have but they've been doing this for thousands of years so their treatments work just as well as ours, it's just a different way of doing things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Herbs?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's all different plants and he prepares them all different ways and some of them use the leaves or the roots or the stems and just different things and, yknow, it's probably like medicine was practiced, you know, three hundred years ago before western medicine developed.  They've been doing it for so long, they just know how to do it and also then we stayed with his family and they had, their kids were there, he had a [AGE] daughter who is my daughter's age, they would go swimming in the river every day and just, we went on hikes to the waterfall, just you know, we got to experience what it was like to be there.  Some of the group went out frog hunting one night, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh neat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, not hunting with guns, just to find them, take pictures.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so we just got to experience what it was like to live in the jungle for a few days so that was really neat too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How long were you there?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We were there, it was a ten day trip including the travel, so eight days total down there, so it was, it was fun, it was a real learning experience.  So, okay, so [DATE], oops, it's [DATE], I'm in the wrong month.  Monday the [DATE], is that okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you took two of your kids?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, the two youngest ones went, the two oldest ones had stuff going on here which was interesting because I didn't know how they'd do in the jungle especially because we had to hike in, it was about a four and a half hour hike in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In mud and hills but they just loved it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the youngest is how old?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's [AGE].  He loved the mud, it was his favorite part of the whole trip.  He was splash and splash all he wanted.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They don't have a lot of mud here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, not like that mud.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not, no, or any mud.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It doesn't rain a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And my [AGE] daughter, like I said, just loved, because there was a little girl her age, they really couldn't speak the same language at first.  They started playing, they'd go swimming and my daughter brought a jump rope so they'd jump rope together, do different things, it was good for her.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did you get your puppy?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh not yet.  The breeder we're going to get it from only had like four puppies and we were too far down the list.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She had a friend who just had puppies in Nebraska so we think we're going to get one in about four to five weeks if all goes well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're sweet dogs.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, we're looking forward to it.  I haven't had a dog for a few years so I'm looking forward to getting one. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We have a puppy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh what'd you get?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's a golden.  We got him in January.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he just is like a teenager now, chewing everything.  We had a Basset hound for ten years, she never chewed on anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This dog, I mean they have to have something in their mouth all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All the time, sweet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, uh-huh.   What's the name?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] named him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cool, well excellent.  He's always welcome to come in if you ever want to bring him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You want a dog in here?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have dog bones, I have dog treats in my closet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Are you serious?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, people bring their dogs in all the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.  Maybe you can do therapy with him and tell him to stop chewing. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think I'd be very successful there, they are chewers.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He got neutered and I asked the vet, so when you're done with this process, he's not going to chew anymore, right?  He said two years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They chew for two years.   Have you had a golden?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've never had one, our neighbors did in the past though and our neighbors now do, our next door neighbors have one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nice friendly dog.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're very sweet and I guess good around kids and all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's the chewing thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Getting through the first year and holding on to your furniture so it doesn't disappear.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he started on the baseboards.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, it's amazing isn't it, anything, anything, shoes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anything, have had one before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I never had one.  They're not supposed to be big chewers.  They're supposed to be really laid back kind of mellow dogs, big dogs but mellow dogs is what we hear and read so</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What did you have in the past?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My last dog was a Vizsla and before that I had labs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's a Vizsla?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A Vizsla is kind of like a Weimaraner</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They look kind of like that, they're Hungarian hunting dogs, real short hair, kind of reddish color and our was kind of hyper, he was kind of jittery, he was a good dog, he was just kind of nervous and skittish.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he was kind of a high energy dog, before that I just had labs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And labs are pretty high energy until -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When they're pups.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They get to a certain again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and they're chewers too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we're hoping this won't be much of a chore, not quite as high energy, they're supposed to be good indoor dogs but they like to be outdoors too so we'll see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll find out when we get one I guess.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're sweet, there was one in puppy school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We were in puppy school.  He and [NAME OTHER] were like buddies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're very calm, you're right, very sweet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what we hear, I'm hoping.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But big.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they can get big.  All right, well enjoy your summer while it lasts and anything before January, give me a call.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye bye.</p>

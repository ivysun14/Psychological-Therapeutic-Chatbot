<p>PATIENT:  (7-minute silence) I remember being surprised last night that I could so quickly get out of the feeling I had when I was here (clears throat) and not think about it.  And it sort of surprised me.  And in a way I'm doing the same thing now.  It's to keep myself from thinking about it, I suppose.  And somehow the feeling I had yesterday just doesn't really seem that realistic now.  And it's the same kind of thing that I did with the thoughts I had the day before: they seem a little bit too strong to me now, when I think about what I was saying.  And, and yet I know they aren't, that they are real but I can't, I can't feel how real they are right now.  (Pause) I suppose if I could admit how real it is to me all the time or many times then I would be unable to do anything to act or to resist giving up.  Because I'm quite sure if I went through today I'd find that many things I did or felt came from feeling guilty again, same way yesterday did.  But during the day, instead of realizing that, I would give other reasons and either get angry or be more determined to do something, I don't know. (Pause)</p>

<p>And there — I was just thinking of 2 different things and how in a way my reaction is exactly the same.  Today I, the children were reacting under having so much direction.  And I was feeling guilty because I first of all realized I was asking too much from them in that way and feeling guilty that if I were more imaginative I could think of other ways to do it.  Or if I were more confident maybe I wouldn't have to do it as much.  And because the children were reacting under this pressure, they were harder to handle and I was annoyed and so forth.  And I, anyway I just ended up getting angry at them for feelings of inadequacy in my own self.  And I was just thinking that I've done the same thing with my family.  Yesterday I remember thinking about, at the end about how I've often felt I don't really belong in my family and I'm guilty about the fact that they're stuck with me.  Since I was a natural blond child and I used to like to think, well, maybe I'm adopted and that would kind of be a way out.  But since it's not true I knew they just, no matter what I did, they had to take me as one of the family.  And I suppose it made me be more awful too.  But I would just feel angry at them.  (Pause) And I would feel guilty that I couldn't be, or that I wasn't being more pleasant or better company.  And then I would, and then my next reaction would be to feel anger.</p>

<p>(6-minute silence) What I'm doing in my mind right now I often do sometimes when I (clears throat) am trying to work out a problem and I don't know where to go with it or (clears throat) I've forgotten something that I'm trying to remember.  And today I'm, some reason I can't think about the feelings of guilt that I've had and anything else that might be associated with it.  And every time I start to and then my mind goes off, I won't let my mind just go to other things and I keep trying to pull it back.  And then it goes off again.  And I just seemed to get nowhere.  And this, I've often felt this way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you're, you're afraid on the one hand to let your thoughts go to something else because you feel you're leaving the subject, eh —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, what they go to are just, I don't know, they don't seem to go to anything to talk about.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you feel right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, frustrated, I guess and as, as if I'm holding myself up tight, somehow.  Because I (clears throat) I want to make my mind do what I want and it won't.  But then I don't know exactly what it is I want it to do, either.  (Clears throat, silence) And I think the thing that makes me feel most frustrated (clears throat) is that I can't just do something else until my mind will kind of start functioning again in another way.  And usually if I'm, I get to this point, then I, I know that there's no point in thinking about whatever it is I'm trying to think about anymore.  And I'll (clears throat) do something and that kind of breaks the tension.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What would you like to do right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Get up and leave.  (Silence) But I think (clears throat) even if I could leave right now, I wouldn't because then I wouldn't be seeing something through or completing a responsibility or testing myself.  I don't know exactly why I feel the way I do about things but I rarely leave something in the middle when it involves somebody else.  Of course, thinking about leaving things in the middle, if I'm doing some little project of my own I rarely finish it.  And I've never thought of the two things before but it does seem strange if I feel so strongly in one way, that I wouldn't feel, when it just involves myself, that I should finish.  (Clears throat) I suppose it's just the fear of what other people will think that makes me finish things that somehow would involve somebody else.  But the fact that I don't finish my own projects makes me think less of myself.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I had so much perseverance when I was a student and yet something like sewing, which I've always wanted to know how to do, I've just, (clears throat) I never had the perseverance to really learn so I could do it on my own or, unless I was working with somebody else, finish anything.  And it's the same with playing the piano, which I still want very much to know how to do.  And despite all the lessons I had, I never could really persevere and learn.  (Pause) And I don't quite understand what happened with the piano because I had gotten to the point where — I don't know how good I'd ever be but I was good enough so that I could begin enjoy doing it.  And the one problem was that I couldn't read music very well.  And then one year I was in a recital and, and I was playing something that I happened to like and (clears throat) knew well and I couldn't remember it.  I just had a complete blank right in the middle of it.  And so that was my excuse for never playing again, because I said that if I played again, took lessons again, that I'd have to be in another recital and I didn't want to go through the same thing.  And so I stopped.  And now I can't play anything.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I was in that recital?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Either 8th or 9th grade.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't remember which.  (Clears throat, pause) And when I think this I almost feel I'm making it up.  But I don't know, I (clears throat) sometimes, well, I've never felt as I have with the piano, of just letting my emotions out.  And sometimes when I've felt like that and used the piano then seems to me now that I wouldn't go near it again for a long time after I did that.  And yet it's because of wanting to let these emotions out, or these feelings, that I want to play the piano so much.  (Silence) And I think mixed in with whatever else was causing me to react as I was to lessons was a feeling that I really couldn't do it and wasn't very good.  (Pause) At least now when I, if I ever think about trying to learn again, it seems that the thing that would, that stops me each time is the feeling that there'd be just an awful lot of practice and I'll never really become very good.  (Clears throat)  (Pause)</p>

<p>And piano was also something that, well, I don't know how much my mother wished she played more than she did because she could pick out a few tunes and that was really about it but in any case, she would tell me and, I think, both my sisters too, that it was something that we might not appreciate knowing now but we'd want to someday.  And somehow that approach sort of made me feel I didn't want to.  Because I wasn't doing it for me then.  Somehow I was doing it for her.  (Pause) And this same attitude, I was just realizing, I apply when I teach, too, that instead of making the process of it enjoyable, I have in mind and I expect my students to have in mind some sense of a future goal, which children can't have because this is what my mother did.  And the person that she had us go to for lessons for several years was somebody that I couldn't stand.  And I don't know why I didn't like her but just somehow it was a drudgery and there was nothing nice about it.  And somehow she was always finding fault and never, things were never good.  And then I changed teachers.  And the change in teachers, I think, was more my initiation because a friend of mine was going to a man that she liked particularly.  And it seems to me it was, anyway, something more that I wanted to do.  And I just loved taking piano lessons at that point until that recital.  But even then, even liking it and with his being very gentle with me when I hadn't practiced as I should, I still didn't practice very much.  And I could spend hours on my homework for school doing something that could be equally tedious and yet when it came to the piano I couldn't somehow or, or I didn't, anyway, sit down and practice. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I have gotten sort of — well, I, I was just thinking of the period when I used to do a lot of knitting.  And I know I finished one sweater but then I came to having almost nothing to do to another one and I never finished it.  It would have taken just a little while to finish it and I just somehow never have gotten myself to.  And when I think of the things I've sewed too, I always have this feeling, even when I do finish, which is rare, that they're not right, they don't fit well and it's just a disappointment to me whenever I do finish.  I suppose that was part of my playing the piano, too, that the point I got to was still a disappointment to me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it used to puzzle me, too, when I was playing, why after — I think I took 2 or 3 years from this man that I liked — why I couldn't read music better.  Because I could never look at a note on a page and immediately have my fingers know where to go.  I always had to look at the note and then figure it out in my mind and then look down at the keyboard and then put my fingers there.  So it was about 4 steps and there was nothing quick about it.  And there was some—, there's something similar in how I have always reacted to directions for sewing.  Because I've always looked at the directions and just felt it was almost a foreign language.  And if I tried to figure it out I'd just feel frustrated and anxious and that I couldn't understand it.  And I might end up doing something very hasty which would have to be ripped out or else I would just give up.  And on—, the only things I finished are things that I worked on when I was with a friend of mine who sewed very well.  And I would go up to her house where she and her mother would both interpret directions for me. (Pause) But even then I'd be impatient.  (Pause) So I guess I just decided I couldn't do it because I knew I could persevere and that I'd had experience persevering in schoolwork (pause) or in learning how to play a sport, I suppose.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking that maybe I could persevere only where I felt confidence.  But I suppose the confidence was relative in that I did feel a relative confidence in my schoolwork but I know there are many times when I felt very uncertain there too.  Although I guess in my, within my family I knew I could achieve a certain amount in comparison to others of my family.  (Pause) But then that's all I'd ever do.  Not all, but it, it seemed as if that were about all and that was about the only area that I had any interest.  And this has often m—, not so much now but even now too, has bothered me and made me sort of disgusted with myself or, I don't know, just not like being myself, that, that that would be the only interest that I would have.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

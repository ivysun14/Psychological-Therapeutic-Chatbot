<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a little (inaudible at 0:05) out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's okay. I hope you had a good vacation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good. Good. I'm glad. Now maybe you'll pay attention. I'm kidding. (chuckles) I'm really glad you did. I was thinking about you. I thought, "Oh, God. Everybody needs some time. I hope that vacation..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good. You look good. Were you in the sun?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was in the sun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I missed you. What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I called you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I got your message. I guess I know what happened. I got your message.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got a patient in the hospital. They hired me to work for them full time. She was right there, so I couldn't break from the appointment, which was too bad. I thought, "I really want to focus on some stuff before you go away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And um... You know, it was odd. I had to decide. I spent all this time saying, "You know, I really want a job. I really want to do something." Okay, now here's a job. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so you're not going to work for that woman?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am going to work for that woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the same person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I talked to her daughter. When I was calling you, I was with her. In fact, I'm just here from there, as it were. I walked down. She's doing very well. I spent the last two weeks, almost completely with her, day and night. So I made some money, which was nice. The odd thing is, as soon as you make money you know it's not enough anyway. How long is it going to take to make $100,000? How many hours do you have to work to do that? But anyway, I felt good about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I need to charge you for that then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Of course. Of course. That's fine. Because now, the nice thing is I made some money, so I can pay you, which feels really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The good thing is that a lot of things happened in that time that I didn't expect. I came away both (chuckles)... I have a pain in my chest here from (inaudible at 2:20)... But I had some good stuff come out of it and some minor pain out of it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Out of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Out of being by myself. I'm with her, and I'm really focused on her because she was very, very sick and she is now (ph) better. But this is the first time I've had a patient that I know is going to get better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, your job is to take care of this elderly woman?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. My job is to take care of this elderly woman who has taught me a lot in a way. She has everything that money could buy and absolutely nothing that she wants. So that's very interesting to see. They're paying me, not a lot of money, but they're paying me $200 dollars a day. I spent the two weeks in the hospital with her as her nurse, kind of, person. And I stayed around the clock with her until she came home. So I have my own room, obviously, and there's a maid who comes in once a week and does the cleaning. There are doormen and all that sort of stuff. So really, I'm cooking and taking care of her needs. In the evening, really more in the morning... I wake up at 6:00, but she doesn't wake up until 9:00. I have this sort of space for myself. I mean, really, not only physical space. It's not unattractive, but it's not really... It's just like a little cell. Some good things have been happening in there. I've been doing a lot of reading. I've been doing a lot of reading in the (inaudible at:4:02), which was really interesting. A lot of stuff about something called The Labyrinth. Are you familiar with that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 4:10)</p>

<p>PATIENT: A labyrinth is a sacred space. It's from the medieval times. There is a group of people from California where it starts, but all over the world, who have made these labyrinths and they walk them. They're not big. They're kind of like a maze. There's a center and there's only one way in and one way out. So it's like a walking meditation, which is kind of interesting. The fact that I can't go anywhere or do anything is making me stop and pull back into myself. Then reading this is also kind of meditative, which has been good. In the midst of all of this, there are all of these things that are... I guess I'm weighing things. I'm weighing the... I don't feel so hopeless. I feel not happy. I feel unhappy with... I'm going to sound like one of your stupid are you undevious? I feel fun. I feel happy that I've got money, but I feel unhappy that it sort of measure the fact that I think I'm worth something. But, I'm getting exactly the same feedback from the people, whether they're paying me or not. The people that I worked for that didn't pay me, (I mean that I'd gone through (ph) for), all said exactly the same things that the people paying me do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they all say, "You changed my life. You've given me some sense that there's hope in the world. You make me feel like a real person. You listen to me." That sort of thing... So, the people that I was working with in the hospital felt that way and I wasn't getting any money, but I loved it. And this person is a one-person and her four kids and they're saying the same thing. She's saying the same thing. So I'm kind of saying, "Okay, I get money for doing this, but it's only one person. Here are 10 people and I'm not getting paid for it." But, it's still me doing it. So how do you evaluate that? There must be a way to do this professionally so that I can do it for more people and earn some money, because I really like doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, I'm going to focus us on one thing that you said a while ago, in contrast to what you're saying now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You joked when you came in. You said, "Okay, you've had a vacation. Now we've got to deal with some things."</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we were joking. But, you were saying that your patients are recording that their minds are being changed. We have three more sessions left. The last time you were here, which was three weeks ago, but it's still very vivid for me, you were very brave saying, "I felt very disappointed that you were late, Gavin."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I've been thinking about you maybe being a little disappointed... The importance of you articulating any disappointment that may be there from me in this process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember that, too. First of all, because it was a big breakthrough for me. And it was right in line with what we were working on before, which was, "Can you be disappointed and still live?" You know? "Can you be disappointed and still have whatever experience was okay?" That's part of what I've been thinking about since then. That sort of finally made its way into here. It's finally said, "You can be disappointed and it won't mean that the whole thing is no good." Because before, as we spent a long time saying, "Well if you're disappointed, that must mean that it wasn't any good." So what I'm seeing now, (and I'm feeling much braver) is that I'm seeing more of the fact that there can be the bad and the dark and the shitty, but that's somehow human. That's... I don't like it, but it doesn't... It makes me sad, but it's not the only thing there is. It doesn't mean that everything else doesn't have value. I can also say to you that I'm disappointed in some of this therapy. But what happened, was over the weekend, I found out there was something that really made me very angry about therapy. I thought, "Oh no. This isn't possible." And then I thought, "Wait a minute. Didn't you just work on this?" So, this is what made me really angry. And I wrote it down. (9:19)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: An image that I came to you with, and I went into with the other therapist, because it was an overriding image. There are two overriding things that started this therapy. One was this (it was so long ago you probably don't remember) image of a spider and the web and how important that was to me. I couldn't really figure it out. So while I'm reading over this three-week period, I read this. And the Eastern (ph) understanding is the spider is the symbol of the mother. "My mother is God within. The mother (meaning spiritual mother) is both within and without the phenomenal world. Giving birth to the world, she lives within it. She is the spider and world is the spider's web that she has woven. The spider brings the web out of herself and then lives within it." Part of the reason that I came to therapy was that image was so vivid, that I knew it had something to do with my life. People keep saying, "Well you must feel trapped in it." And I kept saying, "It doesn't feel like trapped." But since everyone said "trapped" to me, I began to think, "Okay. I'm an empty-nester and I'm trapped in my image as myself as a mother and here I am unable to get out of the web." I realized that I never said that. Because that's not what it felt like. It felt like it has a pattern. It felt like it has spaces. It felt like it expands. It felt like I'm leaving it and I didn't feel afraid of it. When you held it up to the light, it was very beautiful. When you weren't in the light and you walked into it, it scared you, because it was... You walk into a spider web and... And I kept thinking, this image has been in my mind for a year. Nobody ever said, "Let's talk about it." And it was the very first thing I said to the other therapist. It was somewhere in the beginning of what we were talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you felt mad. It sounds like you're saying...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought, why are we looking at such a narrow intellectual focus? Why doesn't somebody say... Part of what I said was, "Give me the questions." Because I'm afraid of the answers. But if somebody works with the question, maybe I won't be so afraid. And I'm saying, "Goddamn! I'm really angry." because it seems like everybody is in one, you know, analytical tradition and they're not saying, "If this keeps coming up to you, what is it?" The other thing was the Indian who came to tell me I had AIDS. I think I mentioned that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The dream where the Indian came and said, "You have AIDS." And I thought of how that has frightened me for so long. And then I suddenly thought that nobody said, "You know, you don't have to take this literally. This doesn't mean, Betsy, that somehow you've got AIDS. This means that you're diseased or you have a disease or something is wrong." But that sort of clicked off all the dying stuff. And I kept thinking, "It's true. I am dying. Even in my dreams, I'm dying."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Those things are like big things that happened in this three-week period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to kind of... Let me focus in on these two images. I think I want to encourage us to be brave here, and talk about it just in terms of us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Oh, I didn't think of it in terms of us, but go ahead. (13:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're saying, "Everybody." You're saying, "I came in with an image of a web and my first therapist said..." It sounds like she interpreted that you were trapped or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was trapped. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But are you saying to me, "Why couldn't you have done more with this?" Are you saying that to me? Am I part of "everybody"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're part of everybody. You're part of everybody. Because what I wanted was... Maybe I never stressed that it was such a cosmic... Well not cosmic. That sounds corny. Maybe I didn't express that it was a really overwhelming thing. This image would pass through my dreams. It would pass through my thinking. It was part of what made me know that there was some overriding pattern and I didn't know where or what it was. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to keep... When you came in and you made your joke and said, "Well now maybe you'll finally listen to me,"</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what? That's a real shrinky thing to do. The first thing (laughs) I do is say... But because we had talked about it before. We'd said, "Are we really listening to each other?" I think that's what we went out on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're right. It's a joke. You didn't come in here and say...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know I'm not allowed to ask you, "Did you have a great vacation? Where did you go?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you not allowed to ask me that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you're a shrinky-shrink. I'm not supposed to say, "Hey, did you have a great time?" "Well, I don't know." (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid I'm going to play that game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid you're going to play that game. And I don't want to get into feeling angry with you because I can't... We talked about this. How many times can you ask a person a personal question? You said, "Well, that's the nature of therapy. Whatever you're asking me couldn't possibly relate to me, Gavin. It has to relate to me, a therapist in a relationship. (15:09)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did I say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I don't know if you said that, but you implied that. Because remember we said... How did we ever get to the point where I didn't know what to call you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of that relationship. That's the part of that relationship where I give you all the authority. I say, "Oh, you must know." Remember when I said how I thought you were going to be magical and what kind of magical thinking that was to think that you had all the answer? I really did. But because I thought you had all the answers, I didn't know what to call you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we didn't really address whether (inaudible at 15:44) by name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you're saying we... What are you saying? Are you saying we never really figured out what to call each other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Isn't that what we said the last time? We said the last time we hadn't really figured out what to call each other. Not that either one of us had said, "What shall I call you?" I should have probably said that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So right now you still don't know what to call me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I call you Gavin. I know what to call you now. I think somewhere, like three or four weeks ago, we broke through that. It became clear that you are you and you're a helping person and you're not a magician.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, we did work through that. I'm going to keep us very small. See, you're saying it's a "shrinky" thing to do. But I'm going with whatever I have. And it might be a little shrinky. But, underneath your joke, it felt a little angry to me. It actually did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't angry? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm angry about this web thing and the dream thing. I'm angry about that. The good thing, the thing that I'm finding healthy to do is to say, "You have a feeling. What is it?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's slow ourselves down for a second. What...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tell my patients that. (inaudible at 17:09)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You have a sense of yourself? You're going fast.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I haven't got a lot of time. I want to talk to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other part of it, if I think about this, is that if I don't (inaudible at 17:28) because if I don't slow down, I won't hear what you're saying. And I have to make myself slow down a lot. Because the world that I'm living in is very slow. So when I get out in the other world, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but it's clarifying. You're saying, "We don't have a lot of time. I want to get a lot in." I'm saying, "We don't have a lot of time, I'm going to focus us on what I think is most essential."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll stay with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm going to try to stay with you, too. But it seems to me right now that you felt angry. When you told me the story, you told me the story about everybody, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a stupid word to use, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everybody. There is no such thing as everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, but that's how you seem to experience it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, to generalize. I didn't mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there was no one out there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. But there is. When I meant everybody, I meant everybody associated with the therapy, which is really only two people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what about half of it? What about the "me"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. What about you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean, do you wish I would've... I remember you talking about spiders in the beginning. Do you wish that somehow I would've been able to elucidate that metaphor a little more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I wish that you had helped me also with the Indian and also with the dream I told you about, about the tiger. You may not remember this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not remembering it right now. (18:57)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was in Queens and my car had been stolen and then hiked up. The front tires were taken off. I was looking around and I found out how to get it going. It seems like such an interesting metaphor. It was stolen by these guys who are construction workers in the basement of a big project. I lifted up the plywood and I could see them there. They had my tires. All of a sudden, this huge Bengal tigress jumped over the wall of the park where my kids had been playing. That's when I woke up, but I knew she was jumping to protect me and go get my... go take revenge on these men. I think I said to you at the time, that tiger is part of me. I've always related to that animal. I think it comes from the thing that women say. They become a tiger when their children are threatened or when their husband is threatened, they become a tiger. So that part of me is some sort of strong, protector part that I wasn't able to bring in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what? It feels to me now that you're kind of saying that there are these parts of you. I'll stay with young, but you came in and you spoke archetypes, I'd say. I'm trying to stay with where you're at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go ahead. Yes, yeah, go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like somehow I didn't grasp the important parts of you. You came in with glimmers of parts of your inner world and you wish it could've come to life for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I had parts of an answer - a hopeful answer. I got stuck in the old pain. I think, by the way, and I'm not trying to skip the subject, but I think that the parts of the old pain that I worked with, I didn't want to work with and it was very helpful (ph) that I did. A lot has been resolved about my parents. I think I've forgiven them and I've forgiven me. I don't really know how that happened, but I feel grateful that that has happened, because I feel different. I feel very emotional as I'm saying this, but it's a kind of grateful tears and emotion. A grateful response. But then, where do we go, you know... (21:37)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's welling up and you're still thinking and now it's going to well down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it wells up when I feel grateful. I always feel overwhelmed. But I feel grateful. Grateful is a word that... it does it now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes me feel loved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And loved, is that a kind of sad? It seems like a pure sadness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's not sad. It's overwhelming. It's overwhelming. But it's not sad. It's like, "Wow." You know? It's like... It's wonderful. But it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's right now, though? It's all those things right now inside of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm. It feels good. I mean, it feels horrible, but it feels good. It hurts like sadness, but it isn't. It isn't sadness. It hurts like that, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we should stay with it a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. It's like a chest being pulled open. It doesn't hurt. It's like standing (ph). It's like... I felt it for years. I felt it for years. I felt it since I was a kid. It's like, I'm so glad I'm alive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that it's probably like disappointment. I have a sense that this feeling you're talking about maybe has both sides of... If it's happy to be alive, it's maybe also whatever the flip side of that is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the flip side is sad to be alive? (chuckle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid to be dead?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely afraid to be dead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But we're talking now. It's going away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's here still.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's still there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's here. But before it was more afraid to be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we're doing two things. You're making sense of your life more and more as therapy ends. I also want to make sense of therapy more and more as therapy ends. Does any of this relate to me? Is that feeling of grateful, leading to being loved, leading to appealing your (inaudible at 24:41) but feeling light sadness... Does any of that have to do with the process of therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure that it sounds crazy, but not that much. Not that much. It feels like it's... It feels as if... It didn't before. I think your going away on vacation was really great for me, because it was like the end of therapy. And I realized that I can't tie up any strings and I can't put it in a package. It's a little bit like saying goodbye to somebody and then they come back and say, "Hi. I'm back for a couple days."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it kind of ended in some ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it kind of ended. And it ended in that I'm disappointed. Because for me, that was like, I feel really great. I'm really glad that you did that. I'm very grateful to you for letting me say, "I'm disappointed," and saying that's not... I'm disappointed that these things didn't happen in therapy, but it doesn't mean it wasn't a great experience, because I think it was. I wish we had done magic again. I wish we had done more early on. But on the other side, I think more was happening than I thought was happening. In fact, I'm sure of it. So it's a kind of funny process, therapy. Because more happens than you know is happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess I want to chime in and say I agree. In this therapy, in some ways, I don't know... I have a lot of ideas about what happened. And there's also a sense of... The person I see sitting across from me now is very different from the person 28 sessions ago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't feel that different. I don't feel depressed at least, but I don't feel that different. I know that there are some big weights off my back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're still saying that I'm still me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I don't see what you see. It's like what I'm saying about Millie. She would say, "People love this about me," but I wouldn't be able to replicate because I don't know what it is. I can't replicate...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me say specifically what I'm thinking right then, which is that when you came in it felt to me that you were often much more in your head and it was harder for me to understand what you meant and what you felt. It's quite easy for me now. And to me, I sometimes think that's because the experience is much more alive for you. Whatever you're talking about... Whatever you're feeling or talking about...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, the experience. Oh, I think so. I was thinking about when I used to come in and I... Let me just (inaudible at 28:12)... I took a taxi. (chuckles) I actually took a taxi. Like I'm making money. I didn't take a taxi here, but I did take a taxi today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I always ask you, "Why don't you catch a cab?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: You always ask me if I want to take a cab. No, I walked from 49th here, but I did take a taxi then. I left and I thought, how weird that I'm coming to see Gavin on a taxi. Jeepers, we were talking about what's different. I think when I used to come here, I used to feel like I was a pair of eyes observing the world, and that was a very strange... It had been going on for a year, so it wasn't that strange, but it wasn't the way I'd liked it. But I remember describing to you people that I saw were in the way and why I liked coming into the city and why I liked being in Chicago. It gave me a sense of all of these different people out there. It was like absorbing somebody else's experience. And then gradually, over time, my eyes turned inward. So I realized that I had been really disconnected. My sadness and my - whatever this thing called depression is... It's really an element of death. It's a terrible death that's going on. I haven't really experienced the end of that, but I'm not as afraid of it as I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That feeling of being lost and depressed that you came in with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (30:01)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, where are you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, Let's see. I'm in a room off 20th Street. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not what I meant... (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Really? I don't really know where I am. I'm in a pretty good place. I feel like I'm going back to something of the person that I used to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean right now, in this very second. Do you feel that way now that you're more the person...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm more that person. But I'm also braver as that person. I have more courage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see your husband?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is another part of the story. Not very much. This will come to an end, but I think that (inaudible at 31:10) should study George (inaudible at 31:11). He has been seeing this therapist about a month. When I started to work, my job took me over the weekend, which is really (inaudible at 31:24) tell me what I need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So intellectually, you know I'm not God.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Intellectually I know you're not God. And in fact, I think emotionally I know you're not God, too. And one of the things I was doing as we talked about this, right up until the last 7 sessions, I was like protecting you. Like protecting you the way I would protect my kids or my husband. And I realized, "Wait. We're at the last third of the therapy. This is my therapy. I have to not pay attention to protecting you. Somehow when I stopped protecting you, I don't know whether any more stuff came out. I really can't judge that. But what I think was also taking place in my world, not with my kids yet, but with other people, is, I don't have to protect people who are strong. I only have to protect people who are weak. And sometimes when I'm protecting people, I don't listen to them. I discovered partly in working with Stephanie, I realized that I don't... When I'm protecting people, I'm trying to make things easier for them and that's not necessarily the best thing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you say with me... I'm going to focus on us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You stopped protecting me. The last time we met, the last session when you said, "I feel disappointed that you were late," was that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was before that. It was a couple sessions before that when I said, "We're at the last third of the therapy. This is my..." And I said, "This is so typical of me. This is a pattern. I do everything for everybody first and I do something for myself last. But unless I do this, this is my last chance. I'm not going to be able to do therapy again for years. So I'd better pay attention to what I need." And I had to keep reminding myself of that. This isn't just two people sitting around shooting the breeze, but this is a listening exercise for both of us. That's why I said, "Maybe you could listen." But I've seen you put this in better... I was also thinking that maybe I could listen better. Because I caught myself listening to my daughter and thinking, "I'm not really listening." And I was shocked. Because I think I listen, but I don't. And I don't observe. I'm sitting on the 20th floor of this high-rise and I'm sitting at the window and looking and thinking, "This is what observation is." When you look down and you watch people closely and you watch to see what they do and what patterns they make without having to interconnect with them. Then you really see something. But somehow, I haven't been seeing a lot of things. And I haven't (inaudible at 34:32) been listening very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're talking right now, how in touch with yourself do you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very... I feel like, really me. I feel like I am me and this is something that's very important. I think somehow, having gotten rid of some of the garbage here, that a lot of things have happened. Part of getting rid of the garbage is, "I feel more assertive." And I used to be really pissed with you when I would be assertive and you would call me angry. I thought, "You fucking male. I'm being assertive and you think I'm being angry? I have enormous amounts of energy and I'm letting some of this energy out in a forceful way and you say angry?" I thought, "Screw you, punk."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anger meant something bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you were so misreading it. You were calling it anger. I was like no, this is not anger. This is energy coming at you. But I know that George responded the same way, so I'm kind of used to that now, but I don't like it. I like to say, "Can't I be assertive and not have you think I'm angry?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if I use the word "angry", what does that mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Angry usually means that... That's a good question. Anger usually means that I have a forceful emotion that is anti-you or anti- an idea and I have to make you feel something. I have to get something back from you - a response that will let you pay attention to what I'm saying. You see, I think anger and assertiveness sound like each other, but they're not. You can tell by what the person is saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying, assertive means to you that you're being a good, good strong...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) I have strong feelings that are good, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And anger means bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bad. Yeah. I think assertive feels like I'm important and anger feels like I'm not important. I think when you're angry, it's because you're afraid of something or at least what I've discovered over the few weeks is that when I'm angry, it's because I'm afraid of something or I scared myself or I'm scared for the other person. Or, I feel there's been a real injustice done. Somebody else has hurt someone, and thereby hurt me too. But assertiveness is saying, "I feel strongly about this." And a lot of people who are mild, listening people feel like whoa... And I'm saying, "No. This is an embracing emotion for me. If I care enough to make this point to you, I'm really making it for myself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when I said that, you who said it's hard for you to feel important, when I said, "You sound angry," it sounded like I was saying, "You're not important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not important. Right. Because, you see, the old mythology that even I bought into is you're not allowed to be angry because you're not worth anything. Women don't get angry. Don't be angry because that will upset the (inaudible at 37:57). And so, when I first got angry with you and we were talking about anger, you were cool. And I said, "Oh, that's really great! Okay." And then I tried it out on George and it worked with him, too. I said, "I'm going to try something and..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like there are a couple different things. The firs thing you said was that you were mad at me for calling assertiveness anger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. So I was angry because I feared that you didn't hear me. I thought, "He doesn't hear me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or I hear you and I think it's a bad thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or you hear me and you think it's a bad thing. And for me, it was a good thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels to me like... We're going to have to wrap up. It feels like... I just want to hand back to you that it seems like there's a lot going on. You're processing a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's a lot going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like 60 miles an hour of psychological processing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's funny. It happens here in a way... I remember when I used to tear my hair, like "Ugh!" Because I would come in here and I would have a... Remember I told you? I was like having a different feeling. That's why we had to close this blind, because I didn't want to be distracted from what was going on. What seemed so important was to say, "Keep it here." Even thought what I feel here, I don't feel any place else. That's the... I don't know why that happened to Kelly. Why, when you come into therapy do some things happen in the space of one hour and 45 minutes a week that don't happen anywhere else? I think they are happening, but I think that you're not really aware of it, or you don't feel it so intensely. And being with a person who's very sick and can't move, everything becomes internalized, so you're not moving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's wrong with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's had a double hip operation because she was crippled and she didn't want to be crippled anymore. She doesn't get around, but she's not dying. It's a very different thing to know that the whole time you spent in hospital for special surgery up there... You have all these fat cats getting all these replacement parts. They have lots of money and they can afford to do it and they have lots of care. It's very weird. In my hospital, there's nobody doing that. These people are dying and that's the end of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound assertive about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm a little angry about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of it is, I think anger is more often that not, a very good thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm beginning to feel that anger is not such a bad thing. If... I owe you some money. I'm beginning to feel that anger is not such a bad thing. That feels good. And I'm feeling that this appointment is not such a bad thing. So we've come a long way, baby (chuckles). Wanna be intriguing for a minute? How was your vacation?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh, my vacation was good. I went biking in Chicago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Fantastic! Where?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In Garfield Park.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So did my daughter. She loves it. She spent three weeks, and then she went down to the Columbus Park. She said it was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Long way (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said it was like nothing she had ever done in her life. She felt very excited. She too needed to feel independent, like me. That's why I took my vacation by myself. She said, "Wow. It's really odd to be by yourself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. She biked alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She biked alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can you believe a girl biking alone?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonderful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said it was very odd. She saw several people at night, (ph) but she loved it. I think it would be much more fun to bike, you know, with your husband your wife or a group and then have somebody to talk to. But she did it by herself. She's an explorer. Thank you. I'll see you...

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like part of the reason I'm so exhausted today is my old lady cat woke me up twice in the middle of the night. And she can't communicate very much beyond poking me in the face and meowing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know I'd be tired too. It's sort of a drowsy day, it seems to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, since yesterday. The whole weekend I felt kind of tired, and it possibly began with a ton of gardening did not help. But then yesterday a friend of mine came over to deliver manure for our garden. She said "I'll bring over some manure. We'll chat, go out to dinner." I don't know. I'm just so tired and I'm like "I need to cancel." You know, it's five p.m. but I want to go to sleep right now. Because I didn't go to sleep (inaudible).</p>

<p>[01:12.3]</p>

<p>Yeah, getting out of the house was really hard. It wasn't like "I don't want to go to work." It was more like "I can't move." (inaudible at 01:27.5) and I'm like, I'll have to charge it. I don't know. One of the things I was thinking about, though, which was sort of (inaudible at 1:42.9) before I go to bed around ten. I was g-chatting with one of my friends who is in comedy school. Like, you know, stand-up school. And she is getting very competitive about the skit that she needs to do this weekend. </p>

<p>[2:02.8]</p>

<p>She's like "It's terrible." I'm like "it's comedy school. Be cool. It's just comedy school." She's like "No, you don't understand." I mean, I told her I get it because I'm really terrible, and I also hate turning in papers that I know are crappy, or do presentations that I know are crappy. And then actually on Monday, I had one assignment left for my class. It was observing a teen program, like where teens actually are, and no libraries want you to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I think because everyone—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And a friend had driven me out there on Saturday. It was amazing. I had to haul myself there. It would have been two busses plus a walk. So I observed the teen room for like 15 minutes instead of the hour you are supposed to and left.</p>

<p>[03:08.2]</p>

<p>In part because—- I mean, the other thing, it wasn't just like it's kind of creepy to have an adult observing teens. The teens were just like "Who are you? Why are you here? What the fuck?" I'm like "Yeah, why—-" It just felt really—- I mean, especially to (inaudible at 03:29.1) [I talked to the teen librarian about it] and she's like "Yeah, it's really hard because (inaudible at 03:36.2) teen librarian, [and she got] a job doing one because (a) it's kind of weird to have just a random person hanging out or observing who's not related to the library, and (b) teens don't like adults in their space. So the first response was basically "What the fuck are you doing here?"</p>

<p>[04:04.1]</p>

<p>And then one of the teen boys tried to flirt with me briefly in an adorable 16-year-old geek boy way. I was like "Oh, a 16-year-old boy." (laughter) Like he had (inaudible at 04:20.4) boys do sometimes in high school, they discover—- they'll start wearing a hat to be cool. He had his little hat, and he came up to tell me that he had written a pun in French in one of the [roles]. So I wrote the paper for that in an hour, which I probably should have spent a little more time on it. But I had to leave to go to a dentist's appointment, type, type, type, save, send, and I was just like whatever, I don't care. I just need to not get a zero.</p>

<p>[05:01.8]</p>

<p>My professor was like "Oh, that's great. I'm going to give you four points." It was a terrible paper. Even though I got four points, I still feel bad about it. I was talking to a friend about how it's hard to just be like fuck you, whatever, I'm just going to roll up here and do nothing. While I was chatting with her and getting ready to go to bed, a friend of mine Jordan (sp?) called me. She does this thing I feel like you only do if someone is dying where you call four times in a row. Like she called, got my voice-mail, called, got my voice-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I remember Jordan (sp?). She was the one who was embezzling money, maybe, in med school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She graduated, actually. Is an alcoholic. And the pictures from her med school graduation—- she's my age and she looks 10 or 15 years older and has the burst blood vessels on her face. I'm just like, wow, you look like an alcoholic.</p>

<p>[06:14.0]</p>

<p>I hadn't seen her in like a year and a half or two. It was kind of shocking to see how bad she looks. [But she was telling me she got a job apparently, which is astounding]. But then Jordan (sp?) called and I'm just like, I'm not answering the phone. I want to go to bed. I know if I tell her that, she just won't—- she'll just keep on talking. And also her calling at night usually means she's already drunk. So there's no point, there again. </p>

<p>[06:57.6]</p>

<p>But what I was thinking about is I feel like—- I don't know. With Jordan (sp?) she someone I've known for a really long time. She's really crazy, but I've also known her so long it's kind of hard to not—- I don't know. There's not inertia in our relationship. I'm just kind of like well, you're crazy and really frustrating but I've also known you for a really long time, so it's kind of complicated. If I just met her, if this was the first time I met her, I probably wouldn't become close with her. But since I already am, it's complicated. But I also feel like—- I was thinking that I have a bunch of friends that are fixer-up friends, like a fixer-up house.</p>

<p>[08:03.8]</p>

<p>And I need to, I think, not do that. (pause) Because I end up feeling like somehow responsible for their problems or them dealing with their problems in ways that, you know—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And your therapist is not a—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was trying to figure out the difference between people who I feel like are sort of fixer-uppers where I'm stuck, and I'm always dumping all this energy in and getting nothing back, versus friends who have various problems, but it doesn't feel like I'm in this rehab. Well, not rehab, but like fixing the relationship.</p>

<p>[09:13.7]</p>

<p>But that was about as far as I got. It's kind of like yeah, I should have fewer friends that I feel are emotionally draining. I was like yeah, I should do that. (pause) But actually implementing that and however that would look like is a whole other thing. (pause) </p>

<p>[10:16.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, one is, I just feel bad. In a way I'm like wow, I don't personally have a lot of friends who are positive in this way or (pause)—- I don't know. It's kind of—- it's sort of the weirdness of being like, okay, well, let's say I decide to see you less. I also know that means that I think, in deciding the decision, I'm reducing the amount of feminism in your life by 25 percent.</p>

<p>[11:20.3]</p>

<p>I don't know. It doesn't feel very nice to do that. I would be sad if the amount of queer people in my life dropped by a quarter. Except this is more like—- the problem is that these friends of mine have only have one or two people satisfying the feminism quotient, while I have a lot of people that satisfy that in my life. So it somehow feels like both [more of a thing], and also I feel like—- I don't know. (pause) Like I'm taking something nice away from this person. (pause) I also feel like [in an individual case], like really how bad is it? It's just one night, it's just one afternoon. Is that so much to ask?</p>

<p>[12:51.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are rationalizations kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And then also, I'm not really the best at—- like you can't make someone change. You can make someone help themself. Like you can't make an alcoholic stop drinking. They have to stop drinking themselves. And I'm just having a hard time with that concept in general. (pause) You know, in the end, it's the other person who makes the decision to change or not change, and it's not really necessarily about me. And not in the way where it's all about me, but more like I'd really like to help. It would be really awesome if you were another awesome friend of mine who was as supportive and great, but I can't make you do that. </p>

<p>[14:11.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. I have a sense that it's not exactly a control thing, which it often is, like acknowledging one's helplessness in the face of somebody else's problem or personality or something. It seems to me like you don't want to see that or accept it or something. It seems more like you can't bear not being able to help, like it makes you sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does. I don't know. It's just really—- I do find it really sad and depressing when (inaudible at 15:18.7) I'm like "Wow, you don't know other queer people who aren't me. That's really horrible. I don't want you to feel so isolated." Being isolated is really bad, and I just really feel for the other person. (pause)</p>

<p>[15:44.9]</p>

<p>It's hard to say no. And part of it is also—- which I feel like it's sort of fixer-up friend category, are also people who are very kind of quick to take any rejection personally. So I'm like I feel like saying "So if I say I need to kind of back away from this friendship," is that person going to be "Oh, well, I'm just not going to try again because I always get hurt." Like, whatever. I don't know.</p>

<p>[16:30.5]</p>

<p>I feel like if I'm trying to say to someone "Hey, I would like to back off a little bit. It's not you, it's me, it's whatever," and that instead of this person being like "Okay, well that's really sucky and I feel sad, but there are other fish in the sea. There are other awesome people I know or could know." But they won't. It's kind of how I feel about my friend Jenna. There have definitely been moments where I'm like "You know, I don't want to talk to you about a certain issue because it's really exhausting, but I'm also really confident you're not talking to anyone else about it." So then I'm kind of like—- I feel sort of trapped. Like I don't want to talk about it, but I also don't want you to not talk about it.</p>

<p>[17:37.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think sort of what strikes me as sad in all of this, in that it means you're in a lot of relationships that you're not really in emotionally, in that it's not much about how you feel or what's going on with you or what you want or what matters to you, other than this kind of taking care of and sort of feeling sympathetic or empathetic for the other person. In other words, it seems to me there are important ways that these sorts of relationships leave you quite alone.</p>

<p>[18:49.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it also makes me think like I feel like yes, I'm not really emotionally engaged in this relationship, and the sort of sharing of equals, friends or intimates. I also feel like well, I had a sort of (inaudible at 09:14.8) if I knew that person X was not fully in the friendship, I would be like "Oh, I'm sorry." I wouldn't want to be someone's guilt friend. </p>

<p>[19:37.3]</p>

<p>But on the other hand, I don't know. I feel also kind of—- there's this part of me that hates to say this friendship, this relationship, it can't change, it can't go anywhere. Are you permanently my friend out of guilt, or am I your friend out of guilt permanently? If that makes sense.</p>

<p>[20:21.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Out of the belief that the relationship will change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or is it some denial that it won't because it's upsetting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of both. (pause) I would like the potential for the relationship to be able to change, and I feel like it could. Part of me is like yeah, people can change, people change a lot. Like I've changed a lot over my life, and I've seen friends of mine change usually over periods of time. But there's part of me that's also kind of like I really—- the idea of the friendship not being able to change, of being permanently stuck or broken, the other person not wanting it to change. Like being happy with this kind of unbalanced relationship. Those are scary and depressing. Make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>[21:42.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm really tired. Can you give me one minute? I apologize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>(pause from 21:45.3 to 23:08.1)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. Yeah, [you're talking about] the prospect of relationships being very scary and depressing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I'm also coming up at the conference where I have a handful of people who I see there and I go hmmmm. Those friends are just not really working for me. There's also this girl who lived here for several years, that I was friends with. And we had—- I didn't realize we had a really uneven relationship until the end of it, the end of her leaving town. </p>

<p>[24:22.3]</p>

<p>So one of the big things was that she left to go to grad school and go to Missoula. She really sucks with emotions, and didn't really know how to deal with—- so she's moving from here to Missoula, and her father had her when he was older, so she was in her mid-20s and he was in his late 70s. Her mother was developmentally disabled in a way that really hadn't been addressed when she was a kid or an adult.</p>

<p>[25:22.5]</p>

<p>She didn't know how to deal with problems with her father and leaving all these friends, moving to a new place. So she kind of burned all of her bridges with all of her friends. It was just kind of creepy, like lame-o, where she just—- I don't know. It was kind of like "Fuck you before you fuck me over." Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was just like "Okay, well, wow. I'm glad you're leaving town. I think I'm done with being your friend." She moved to Missoula then she also went up to New York several times, and we have mutual [tandem]. I gave a couple of them a little bit heads up like, you know, she's older, she's kind of mature, this is probably what's going to happen, and she had a burning flame-out with half of them. With most of the ones that I know.</p>

<p>[26:45.5]</p>

<p>After [a period of time] I de-friended her on Facebook and all that. She e-mailed me like "I don't understand what's happening. Why did you do that? We're so close," blah blah blah. I didn't really respond. [I actually did not respond]. I don't have a lot to say to her. "We haven't talked in years. You were a dick. You said a lot of really hurtful things to me at various times." She also kind of took me for—- I don't want to say she took me for money, but she did a period of unemployment. What I'd say was "If you want to come out, I'll always spot you a drink." Like if you want to go out to a bar and like I can't afford a drink.</p>

<p>[27:44.9]</p>

<p>And she would really push that. [Like, I did offer this but—-] And she would always say "Oh, but don't worry, I'll get you back. I'll buy you dinner once I get a new job." And she had a new job and really didn't at all. And also it became clear to me that—- like to me I was like "You're a friend. I want you to be able to do things." And she saw it in a way as getting free stuff from me. I don't think she ever intended to—- like she saw it very transactionally and thought she was getting away with something and it would be stupid to do the same. I don't know.</p>

<p>[28:40.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She seemed very self-absorbed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. She really is, and has a long history of financial—- like fucking up her own finances and being really self-absorbed around other people's finances, if that makes sense. Like, I don't know. Like visiting a friend, staying for a week, and never like taking her out for brunch or whatever. And she's going to be at the conference this year. She's met up with a couple of my local friends. When I saw her doing that, I had this moment like I wanted to say something to the chicks. But for all I know, she's had a complete life change. I have no idea.</p>

<p>[29:45.3]</p>

<p>And in terms of seeing her, I'm just kind of like, I really—- I feel comfortable being well, that ended, it's sad, I wish I had ended the relationship earlier. But I also know I'm completely capable of being polite to someone and don't think she has—- I don't know that she has the—- I don't know if she can pull herself out of her own narcissism long enough to do that. (pause) </p>

<p>[31:17.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm wondering about a few things that may be related to why it's difficult for you to extricate yourself from these sort of relationships. (pause) Involving two different things I think you do to distance yourself from being angry. The first one I think I've said before, which is what I think you do a bit with me which is—- I think it's this kind of subtle thing where I think you present things in such a way as to work a little bit to get me angry at the person. </p>

<p>[32:40.1]</p>

<p>Like you present them with a kind of low-key tone and a low-key emotionality, but in quite critical terms where you sort of present—- like to show me the movie of it in a way that without coming at it explicitly saying it, or saying you're having this reaction, puts them in the role of being a pretty bad actor. </p>

<p>[33:03.6]</p>

<p>Not that I'm disagreeing or think you're distorting what's going on. That's not so much my point. I'm not saying you're misrepresenting what's happening so much as that you're giving me the documentary version of what a bad actor they've been, which is in a way feels like a little bit to have that effect on me, the audience, of like "What the fuck is she doing? She's taking money away from you. She's being mean to all these people. She's so self-absorbed. You were just trying to help her." All of these kinds of things, which I think are precisely the things that are uncomfortable for you to feel. Like more angry, more stirred-up and explicitly critical of her in that way. </p>

<p>[34:11.1]</p>

<p>I'm not sure quite why, but I think those are very uncomfortable things for you to sort of be more absorbed with, though I think they're in there somewhere. I had another thing too, but let me put that to the side. It seems less central, so let me hold off on that for a minute. I'll say it, I don't mind saying it, but anyway that's one thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just really curious what the other—- (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay, sorry (inaudible at 34:48.6). The other one is I think—- this is not something I think you do with me but when you're thinking about one of these people—well, you do do it here in a way—- I think the more frustrated with the person you get, sometimes the more you identify with them and their pain in a way that keeps you at more of a distance from the anger you're increasingly feeling towards them for how they're continuing to act. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>[35:38.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. (pause) Yeah, I don't know. (pause) I guess you can say I hold onto it. I have a hard time expressing anger towards my friends. I just feel bad about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you feel—- maybe feeling angry evokes a whole lot of guilt for you.</p>

<p>[36:28.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or feels like it would be really destructive or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's a mix. Generally I feel guilty about it. Like I shouldn't be mad at my friends. (pause) And that, you know, I feel like I should be mad at them, and part of why I think I should be mad at them is because I feel like, well, you know, they're probably not trying to be malicious or like whatever thing it was. I'm sure the intent was not to make me upset or angry.</p>

<p>[37:25.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess part of what I'm saying is I think there are ways, and this is I guess what I was sort of trying to point out, that I think you do express it actually and/or react to it, though they may be subtle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I think sometimes I return to kind of a nuance why something frustrated me as opposed to—- or a nuance of all the details of what happened as opposed to being like wow, that was upsetting. (pause) </p>

<p>[38:23.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also want to ask you whether these are upsetting things that I've said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. (pause) I think the part I find upsetting is that it's sort of like I can see sometimes, sometimes not, well there's this thing that I'm doing that I've done before, and that I know ends poorly or can, but I keep on doing it. (pause) Last weekend or a week ago, Ashby asked me if—- I can't remember which friend it was of mine—- like some friend of mine, she's like "Oh, (inaudible at 39:31.2) the OG of incredibly needy, manipulative friends in your life." I'm like, "Nope."</p>

<p>[39:43.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, what's OG?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Original Gangster. Like is she like the original ultimate, all others pale before her. (laughter) I'm like no, she's not the first. I'm very confident about that. (pause) And while it was funny, it was also like damn it, it would be a little—- I don't want to say nicer or easier. I don't like that I can easily say no, I have people I've known longer or (inaudible). (pause)</p>

<p>[40:34.1]</p>

<p>And I also find it upsetting that I'm sort of like (inaudible at 40:42.7) on days to myself. And sometimes I think like—- in the moment I'm not always thinking about it. Sometimes I do sort of sit there and think "How bad could that really be?" Like thinking about how I'm rationalizing it, and then sort of still go forward. The thing I was thinking about also is that I'm taking time and energy away from people, from friends of mine who aren't energy sucks, because I'm so tired from doing. And that's like super uncomfortable to think about. (pause) Because I'd obviously rather spend time talking to friends that make me feel happy and energized, rather than sad. But I find myself not. (pause) </p>

<p>[42:22.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if I follow, thinking about the scope, like what this problem has cost you in your life, historically and in terms of [negative] effects, makes you I guess sad to an extent that's difficult to contain? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And there's also this way where I'm sort of like, why don't I just spend less time with these certain people and spend more time with other people. It's such an easy fix. And then I think it's never that easy, but then I think well no, in theory I could just only call people—- just stop calling certain people and stop even answering people and be just like nope, I'm just going to call these other people. But it actually isn't that easy. But part of me is like I think it should be that easy, therefore why aren't I just doing that? And then I feel bad about that as well. (pause) </p>

<p>[44:28.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, especially I guess kind of like with the way I think you present things to me. Your focus is more on the action what you could do differently or how you want to be able to do things, more so than on the overwhelming feelings that I think are what actually get in the way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll talk more on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully I will have slept some more by then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

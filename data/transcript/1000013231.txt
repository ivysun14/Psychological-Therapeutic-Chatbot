<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 2 (audio break) has been concluded.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Shouldn't have heard the steps. I feel kind of good today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Go ahead. I decided I don't have anything to win, but sometimes it's - the past few days that I'm going to say - decided things for myself and that I'm tired of screwing around all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're ready to decide things for yourself as opposed to what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rather than being kind of fatalistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fine. Rather than a lot of other things you've decided  - </p>

<p>RP: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - as being really cruel (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like the situation with my girl is getting intolerable. For instance, when I called her up and told her that - we had a date planned and then I cancelled it, and then she called back pretty upset and wondered why. I just told her that I wasn't enjoying the dates anymore, because I wasn't, because she was getting very bitchy; that's the only word I can think. </p>

<p>And so we had a good long talk and everything turned out for Edwahr (ph). I was kind of disappointed a little bit because I thought she would sit at home and figure it out for herself, but instead she calls me and asks me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were disappointed in respect that that would have - say it would benefit her to this kind of thing? [2:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because that's a power between us. She almost always relies on me to do her thinking for her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I seriously (ph) decided that I was going to stop doing that. And then - I still - I really didn't tell her too much. I just told her that the situation was getting so that it would be better for me to stay home than go out on a date, I would feel better, and she had no idea why that would be. Maybe it's just that I don't understand the way she feels about it, which I think it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe what is it that you don't understand how she feels about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like on the phone she - I didn't think it would affect her like this and she started crying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were taken by surprise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I felt like I hurt her and I didn't want to. I just wanted her to know that it wasn't - everything wasn't coming up roses. So it still might not be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Still might not what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It still might not be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound a little worried that you had to take some kind of responsibility for telling her how things were that you didn't really want to take.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it was a responsibility, it's more she would just go back to being like she was if she doesn't see herself. If I just tell her, she'll say, "Oh, okay." Two days later it's back to the same way. Because unless she wanted it herself, she's not going to see it. [3:59]</p>

<p>And I've been thinking a lot about coming here, getting stressed out a little bit, hesitant. Because I mean I had a psychiatrist who was a little bit more directive and was almost like a sparring partner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a dual, a tearing me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like that was a little exciting for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fun, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I've read a little bit about psychology and I'm prejudiced because you're very pretty, so I think that's a waste.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p> PATIENT: And so I always kind of - I'm what you call - let me think this a minute. I was trying to pick the way I would be helped, you know? Like say I want to be helped in this way and this way and this way, and I wonder if I'm still doing that but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think maybe you still are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm coming to see that I'm in no position to even think about doing that because it's not like I'm on the outside and can look in objectively and see things. They're not really things that see what I really need, because if I really knew what I needed I wouldn't be here. So I'm sorry that I am really kind of in-excited and that whatever happens isn't really going to be planned, like I planned for some kind of change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just going to be what happens to come out of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And so with that it seems kind of useless. It's like picking methods, because when you start picking methods you start picking results, and you can't do that. I don't know, sometimes I think - maybe it's because your blind. Sometimes I think that you're almost defenseless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I'm defenseless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I can overwhelm you with my intellect. It's ridiculous because  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what did I do to you to feel that way, like that? [6:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That kind of holding back a little bit, because I - sometimes I feel like I could start - instead of talking and saying how I really feel or even just spouting off meaningless things, I would get all caught up in trying to confirm my opinion of you by cutting you down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you try to put something over on me; is that the kind of thing you're talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you keep trying it to see if you can do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not that I keep trying, it's just I'm afraid to keep trying it because I know it's useless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something in you that's pulling you towards doing that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know it's so easy with the other psychiatrist. Not the one I was seeing and then in person [ph] that I was seeing, but the one I originally had, and his name was Kibler; [it was an associative course for investors] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was so easy to pull things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, at the very start I was very honest with him. I told him exactly what I felt, and I found he wouldn't accept that. He would listen to what I'd say and then he'd go off on a completely different subject and almost ignore me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really know if that's his method or if it's going to work or whatever, but I didn't like it and so I stopped being cooperative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's how you sort of started feeling like you gave that out of necessity or out of - what you tried first didn't work. [8:43]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I had - before this whole mess I had gone into Rogerian theory a little bit. Well, not really a little bit, it was like a cure-all, you know. Anything happens, expect [40 call arounders and you'll be all-around] (ph) It wasn't like that really. I mean I can see that now. It was - I see how senseless it was. I mean who would have thought that guy came out for Rogerian theory. I don't know. It was like I was expecting that kind of a relationship when I met this guy, and it turned out to be so completely different that I couldn't take it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It turned you off I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not clear what it is that you're - like when you say you're afraid you could - it was intellectually overwhelming I think, I was wondering what kind of thing you're talking about. [9:56]</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. I have to watch this - maybe it's just a carryover from my girl. I have to watch that I don't kind of do everything for her in my mind. Like she's a human and she has to start learning that life isn't all roses and all that, and she's got to make it on her own. She can't be relying on me all the time. And I know it is so easy to snow her that I have to consciously keep myself from even trying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Snow her by doing what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like if I wanted to manipulate her into a certain situation it would be simple.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you're kind of afraid that you can do that to me, that you manipulate what I'm feeling  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I don't want to do that. I would much rather have an equal than an inferior partner  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you afraid of? What might I get manipulated into?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just - all right, like your role as a therapist. I think I would try to con you out of that, make you make mistakes, and then point them out to you and make you look like a fool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. Trying to make me look silly and to feel silly, to - yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I would prove my superiority and say, oh, that isn't going to help you, you know. Obviously it's that she's such an inferior therapist, and then I would be justified in saying, well, I don't want there anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there some way in which you aren't sure if you want to come and that's a way of figuring out whether you do or not, by testing me out? [11:54]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is, I know that, because I have quite a few relationships with other people and I find that it's very easy to put the plug in or snow them or overpower them. And sometimes I feel I can - people are pacifying me sometimes and then I can dominate them or something like that, and I don't like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that's so easy to do, to snow them and dominate them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're really looking - you're really hoping that there's someone, and maybe that I won't be able to do that to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I kind of develop my intellect by reading and doing a lot of heavy thinking, and if I'm going to snow someone, I just start throwing ideas at them and they can't handle them fast.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can throw them faster than they can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because a lot of the stuff is - some of it's meaningless and some of it has meaning like for me, or maybe it's something that they've never thought about yet and something that might take a week of heavy concentration, and I've already done the concentration which means all the homework has been eliminated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You already have, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I just pop off this idea. And unless they've done their heavy concentration and homework, it's completely - it will snow them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're very impressive when you want to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't really like it because  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do that kind of as satisfaction at the time, but afterwards I figure, well, why did I blow it again? It always seems senseless to even do to other people when I needed it. [13:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Senseless in that that just turns into the same old kind of relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, they're all identical, every one, because the way they would turn out, unless I just kind of shut up and let something else happen. I used to have this friend, Matt. He would do almost the same thing. And so we would sit there and do it to each other and have a ball, and no one else would understand what was going on. And the guy was kind of an idiot really, because he had no self confidence at all. Like he wouldn't let himself feel depressed because that would show that he was inferior. So he was all caught up in feeling superior to everyone, and that was the only release he had was kind of rapping with me and me to him. Usually it would start out as something meaningless, and we would go and intertwine ideas back and forth and throw in new ideas and throw in meaningless things for the other person to separate out of the true fact, you know, and it was all abstract fun. I wouldn't even know where to start to tell you what it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's what it was, it was all abstract, and we're sitting there playing with all these  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Games, right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Philosophical manipulation. Big word.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so part of it, it sounds like is where part of the game is to see whether the other person can pick out what's meaningful and what's meaningless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I could never really talk to this guy; that was the fun part of it. We could play intellectual exercises for hours and take a few minutes' break for a Coke and listen to the stereo and then go back again and do it some more, but that was really a very shallow relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was the only level you could relate on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because we enjoyed some of the same things, like working on cars or talking about how great we were, and looking at girls, but that was it. Nothing. I feel pity for him because he still is that way and he always will be that way as long as he's got some new genre. [16:36]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whereas you feel like you have this possibility that you won't that way if you change that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sort of. I've had my fill of it and I'm going to move on to something else, and that's one of the few things he gets satisfaction in so he can never get his fill of it, not as he's seeking more, and finding what. I mean I'm back to deciding things. I had this - this might be kind of complicated for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I knew you'd say that  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I was wondering. That's what it sounded like, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. All right. I had this - I had, I had - I had this mag type wheel on my car, just one; I broke the other one and I got a flat tire so I just threw it out. But I originally had them on there because they kept the front brakes cool, and they also provided better cornering and handling and stopping and they were lighter and they made the car ride smoother a little bit. And so when the one broke I just left the other one on there, thinking, well, I didn't have anything to replace it with so I left it. </p>

<p>And I finally got a tire to replace it, tire and the rim, about three months ago. And I've been putting it off and putting it off, because I had to get the tire fixed and then mounted on the rim and then change it and so I've been kind of tolerating it. And what has happened is the tire has gone completely bald on the main wheel. And I was riding along on these three good tires and then this one baldy. And then whenever the car would get hot, like after running for a while, the brake on the car, on the side with the standard rail would get hot, would adjust tight, and then the brake on the side with the mag wheel would stay cool, which was really better for the braking, but it would stay cool and it wouldn't adjust tight with the self-injectors, and so my car pulled to one side every time you stepped on the brakes just because of this stupid wheel. [19:02] </p>

<p>And I knew it was a hazard because it was bald, because the mag was starting to crack. It was a pain because I had to keep putting air in it all the time, and it was really senseless to have it on there but it looked nice, so I left it on there like an idiot and I decided today that I was going to change it and I changed it, the bald one gone. It cost me a whole $2.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After all this time you went and changed it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was so stupid. Now I have decent tread on the car and I can stop again. But it's really kind of symbolic of how I do things sometimes. I can think of something in my mind. I'll think, I should do this, and then completely ignore what I just thought and kind of make myself to do the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say, "Yeah, I should do this," but then you just don't do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I want to talk about something new. I'm still hanging in a rut in my mind. My thoughts are still coming out the same, the same way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the sameness is what's bothering you, but it's such a rut.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Everything seems - it's like when I got new places, it all seems the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep hoping that  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I expect my attitude towards the place to change just by changing the place, and it doesn't work. [20:59]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep hoping that if you go new places, that will do something to change what's inside of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've kind of given up hoping that, because I've gone so many places that are new to me that it's very obviously not as good as a cancel tonight. I'll just call it mental anguish. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the trouble is you don't know how else to do it, sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I can come up - I said this last week again - I can come up with answers in my mind, my intellect, but my behavior and my feelings don't follow through on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like they're separated from the way you think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and kind of victory, and there's no way of tying them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of victory; you mean like even opposite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like the tire. [22:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is out of kilter with each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There, I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I started to drag you into a meaningless thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel really stupid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm sitting here and I'm trying to get something out of this thing and then sidetracking myself. Funny though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really like doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds partly too like you have some ideas that part of my job is not to let you get sidetracked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you were thinking if she knew I was getting sidetracked, she'd stop me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you keep encouraging me on useless thought and it seems automatic to me. I hope that doesn't discourage you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't discourage me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you think it might do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it doesn't discourage me. See, I have feeling that I'm supposed to keep you from getting sidetracked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can sidetrack myself all I want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's the  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Fit and poetic [24:06]. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that do to you when you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It confirms my opinion that you're really a very good therapist after all. You know, I'm not punishing today, that's not what I mean. I'm up on all this kind of - I don't know what you call it - liberal thinking in psychology. Too Freudian is the real thinking. And I know the answers in my mind, but I haven't really followed them up in doing it, and this is kind of doing it. So I entered into this thing with the knowledge that, well, Rogerian Theory, you've got 20 sessions, come out like this, you know, such and such has logged an inch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter) Trade in your stuff if neutral for a new one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I would go through the sessions and I would come out the robot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Come out what? A robot?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not a robot, but it would be mechanical, it would seem so mechanical, because it was expected that I would react in such a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were a client and going through this treatment, you'd end up this way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. And I think that's why I was kind of questioning on whether I should really come in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you told me about it being so mechanical, automatic, something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I used to really enjoy reading the Rogerian Theory because it was so beautiful, and at times I would almost fool myself into thinking that I had that kind of relationship with people around me and that I could be accepted. And I actually fooled myself into some - I call it progress because my attitude completely changed. And then after a while I saw that I had been fooling myself into thinking some of these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you're afraid that anything that happens here, that might even look like progress, you would just be fooling yourself too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was funny. It really was a change for about two months. I stopped driving wild, I started driving completely sane, completely relaxed. I was relaxed working. I was relaxed doing nothing. I was comfortable with people and I had a very positive outlook on just about everything, and then I started reading. I almost felt a kind of satisfaction in reading, especially in psychology. And so when something happened to kind of throw that off  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something happened to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, when something happened  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: - I would kind of run to my psychology books and start reading again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, um-hmm, you wouldn't let it get to you [27:58].</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know, after a while I would stop connecting. I shouldn't really really be enjoying this because I enjoyed it when I read something similar to it, but I'm not enjoying it now. But I didn't have the courage to just toss the books away and start thinking on my own. I kept reading in the books and then my attitude started changing back all over again with [Two Rounds Before]. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the books had a lot of meaning for you and that that was really helpful, but then something happened that somehow reading the books shut off your own thinking about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really shut off. It was like I was looking for satisfaction by reading the books instead of looking to myself for the satisfaction, and I find I do the same thing with records. I hear a really good record that I like and I keep playing it whenever I feel </p>

<p> -  oh man, stomach disorder. Maybe it's because I'm relaxed. Whenever I feel depressed or anything, I would play the record and feel happy, because I knew that at one time I felt happy when I was listening to it and I thought maybe it had something to do with the record. So I'd keep playing the same record over and over, and I completely ruined my taste for this one record, and it's really beautiful, but I can't stand it anymore because I get so disappointed by the results that happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you get onto something like the book, say, or the record, and it seems really great and that it can pull you out of this, but then there's something about keeping and losing it that loses that magic and that's very disappointing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep thinking of my friend that had a slight drug problem, that I can kind of see that I do the same thing that they do. When they get up and they feel good, then they want to keep hitting up more and more and more, and they have to keep doing it more or else it doesn't satisfy them. So I try the same thing with books or records or anything; working on my car I do the same thing. And I start doing it more and more and I find absolutely no satisfaction by doing it more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like something that you can find that makes you happy, you kind of grab on to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something to strangle at.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then it sounds like you're lying, you're sort of taking it lightly, but like you really do that; like you're really pleased to find something that will make you happy, and you just keep hoping and keep hoping. [30:57]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I used to enjoy going to the dunes last year before I had travel restrictions. No more dunes; I blew that one. So now I go to the beach around Myrtle. I love the beach. I love the sand and the trees and the grass, green grass, and - but it's so different. I'm looking to the place again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that worries you because you're afraid that something will happen to that, something about it being  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid of overindulging and ruining what little enjoyment I do get out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You'll kind of ration it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do the same thing with people. Like if I hit upon a real good friendship I kind of put so much emphasis on it that it breaks down. It's kind of loving something so much that you strangle it. [32:30]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's a lot of feeling in there. Like when you find that, like you just can't keep your - well, it's not quite like you can't keep yourself away from it, but there's a great - it has a great appeal to keep coming back to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. I don't mind. When I was really feeling rotten for a while I would have given my entire bank account, which is nothing really, but what money I have, my car, anything, just if someone could give me a few moments a day of enjoyment. It was almost like a desperation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things were so bleak that there just wasn't any enjoyment there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I felt really funny sitting down in the lobby, reading this advertisement for an Lexus, that's a car. And the main part of the advertisement was centered around these bucket seats which folded down and were contoured and everything with headrests. And they built the whole article around these bucket seats, and the whole advertisement was about how good the Audi was because it had these seats. And I had just put a set of fold-down bucket seats in my car with headrests - complete, comfortable, nice, convenient - and I thought, you know, that's stealing my idea. But it really made me feel good to know that a brand new 3 or $4,000 car would come with the same thing that I wanted in my car and I got for $20. It's like I was ahead of the game; I already had them before I even saw the advertisements. [34:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that was your own idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This neighbor of mine is a divorcee and she now has another boyfriend. She was having a few problems I guess. She's known him for about eight months now, and they really love each other, which is good, I'm glad for her, but she gets so worried about losing him, and I guess she has a right to because he was acting very weird for a while. He was kind of cold and non-communicative. And so we sat discussing; our problems are very similar between my girl and me and her boyfriend and her. </p>

<p>So we kind of both decided to kind of play it cool and ease off and thought whatever happens happens and maybe let the other person see that if they wanted to be cool, kind of aloof, that they should expect the same thing back. And I don't know, maybe I let her talk me into it. I didn't really want to call off the date with my girl. [36:46]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're not sure now whether you did it just because she wanted you to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't really want me to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it seemed to her to be an answer to her problem, and I somehow got the idea that maybe it would an answer to my problem which was similar. And I almost think that I would have been better, instead of canceling a date and getting her all worried and everything, which I really don't think she was worried that much, but instead of doing that I should have gotten mad like I really wanted to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you really wanted to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Originally wanted to do. I didn't really want to do anything. I wanted her to improve all that stuff. I don't know why I wanted to improve it so much but she does get really bitchy sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you really wanted her to do was stop being bitchy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and to at least consider that I wanted to enjoy the date too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To realize that you wouldn't enjoy it if she was bitchy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to do something so that you would. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I was thinking of getting mad at her, because that affects her very much too; she doesn't like that, and I do it very subtle. So when I do get mad it gets a greater impact, but just talking to her seems useless, because we've done it so many times before. We come upon a problem or we talk about it, and as we come up with a solution nothing happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you can talk it until it sounds like it's talked through at the time, feels like it, but it just isn't working to really change it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if we get mad it changes for a little while, according to how mad I get. [38:42]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The love of madness goes the length of time. But it sounds like a problem that still remains to be something that you're not being able to mix these in the relationship with a change permanently but that's  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what it is, is that I don't want to make a change like that you know, because to me that seems like I'm manipulating again and as if I'm constantly on-guard not to do that. And even if it's a manipulation for the better, it still seems kind of fake to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what I meant was that what is disappointing to you is that things don't change, nothing over a long haul. Like you're really dissatisfied with the way things are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like yeah, there's nothing that I can really do about it, and there's nothing that she is going to do about it, and it looks like kind of a dead-end. I hope it isn't. [39:53]</p>

<p>A while ago, a few, what, days ago, I guess, when I was [longing her] (ph) I was congry (ph) about how touchy I was with my girl, how I appeared affected by the least little thing. Like if she doesn't sit in the middle of the seat next to me I become very offended and she doesn't really realize what's going on. And then I become even more offended because she doesn't realize it and </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you said you don't like it that she doesn't do it and you don't like it that she doesn't realize how you feel about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what really bugs me is that I don't want to be like that. It seems so petty, and I would like to have the kind of an attitude where it really wouldn't matter sometimes what she did because anything would be all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the problem is that it really does matter, the little things that she does.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And at the time the things she does bug me, and then afterwards the fact that they bug me - not the things any more - but the fact that they bug me starts to bug me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What really bugs you then is that you're so - you're some kind of person who is so easily irritated by those things. Got a feeling that sort of like, well, I should be looser about these things? </p>

<p>[42:28]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought of something. That's the same way I felt when my other psychiatrist asked me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like you were interested in something that was meaningless to me after I had already thought about it and kind of put it away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were finished with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I swung back to it so you didn't want to answer the question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Until then don't side (ph) with me if you say that if you don't want to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you ever read a book called Sundown?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I haven't. I've heard about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of liked it because it was so different from what I always read. But I kind of became a firm believer in there. Just that book kind of convinced me, because everything in there seemed like it struck a chord in my mind. And it was hey, now, and that kind of clears up the thought that I had but couldn't say. And from that book I kind of had the effect on me of making you want to give people the freedom to be the way they wanted to be and trusting that the way they wanted to be would not only be beneficial for them but for me too. [44:34] </p>

<p>And for a while I guess I did that in my relationships with people, and it usually turned out that things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to be. Not all of them, some of them, but most of them, not all of them. And so I kind of got soured on that deal, and now I kind of see that it has been like it wasn't the reason that freedom didn't work, it was because the freedom didn't provide the reaction that I expected, the results, and I think anyways I was expecting the wrong thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were expecting  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it wasn't the idea that was wrong, it was me, because I used to do that with my girl. If she wanted to be completely rotten the whole day, I would typically smile through the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you were letting her be free.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was enjoying it, and because she would never stay that way when I was like that. She couldn't stand it, you know, I was too nice to her. It's impossible. And it worked then. And then when a few other friends were around it seemed that letting them be free was like - not trying to manipulate them or anything, just letting them be, was very unsatisfying, because I found that I needed more out of being with people than they would give in the short period of time that I would have this relationship with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More than you could get by just allowing them to be free and do what they want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I needed more. I was a question of whether he's going to be happy or I'm going to be happy and it's going to be me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It almost sounds like you let them be free but you weren't letting yourself be free. [46:59]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also they would not return it. It's almost like I was expecting miracles. Plug in the magic formula when you come over here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should be nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My engine works now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stick in a key and out comes the whatever it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The door opens, but you have to watch because it opens very, very slowly. Even if you're not patient and if you need what's on the other side, it's still there, and if you can't wait you blow it; effect in strangling relationships, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't need it too much  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like to be so close to a person in - I would do it by allowing the person to be whoever they wanted to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be whoever he wanted to be, the freedom there. And then it would turn out not really bad, but it wasn't satisfying, and so I would forget the freedom bit and start manipulating, and then it would become even more unsatisfying. I think that's how it strangles relationships. [48:58]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You take the freedom bit as long as you can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you shift over to the manipulation bit. But neither of them is really satisfying to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Instead of the manipulation I become very stubborn and hot-headed and I decide that, well, I'm going to want what I really want and you have to think a little bit about me, and becoming so hard-headed that if the other person doesn't comply with my supreme demands I just closed them off and say you've not once thought of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really need these people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then you reach a point where you get the feeling you're disappointed in what you're getting from the relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you get kind of hardened, feel like you're demanding things, and then I guess then say they're not living up to it and then say, well, you won't do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm almost afraid to be like that. In fact, I'm very seldom like that, because, more than that, I start demanding things. I know I'm going to want to even more and I know I'm not going to get them then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that there's so many demands that if you just start them (inaudible at 50:34) that you're afraid to start. [50:34]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then if I did start demanding and didn't get it I would have to start facing something, that maybe what I'm asking for isn't really what I need or maybe what I'm asking for is very unfeasible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what is very hard to face that, because you need to learn those things from match. (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like living - the only word I can think of is ideally with - living with perfect ideals, and it's impossible because the more perfect you expect things the more intra-supportive you are, but they don't turn out that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know that, but still there's something in you which wants that perfection so much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're going to have to stop at 11:30.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like that's - it's sad in a way, it's like you know it, like you know good and well that, you know, those things are really going to be impossible, but you can't stop wanting it so much. [52:08]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, you know, what time does your watch say? This one here says 11:27.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this one says 11:28.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like your two minutes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I don't know. I don't know if I would feel gypped or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, actually, see I made a mistake. I thought it was a little later than it was, and it was after (inaudible at 52:42), and actually you came a few minutes late, so why don't you stay about three or four more minutes if you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't have to worry about that. I don't know why I do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why you do what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worry about that car. To the end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're worried that something will happen to it right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like it's a combination of a toy, a brother, a house and a hobby all put together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it means a lot to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But what I don't really realize is when I'm sitting at work is that it can be replaced. I used to have an old beat up [Skinner Noles] (ph) that I used to really - I loved that car literally. Then I had this girl at the time who also loved it, and if it would have come up to a choice, the girl or the car, I would have taken the car, because it always seemed to me like I could do anything with the car and it would always be there. And if I blew it up all I'd have to do is do a little bit of work and it would be fixed. [54:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could count on it to always be there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it would take anything I gave it. Whenever I abused it, it would go to its maximum, and if it broke I would fix it and keep doing it. What was so amazing about it was that the car had 120,000 miles on it, it was all rusted out, and I used to go out looking for drag races and beat up new cars. The people in these new cars, they'd sit there with their fancy transmissions and heaps of tires I would come with this old beat-up piece of garbage, absolutely stock, no work done on the engine, a really crummy automatic transmission, a bad rear-end on it and bald tires  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it would do great. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'd sit there and walk all over them, and then they'd sit there and look at the thing in amazement, and it really felt good because it was my car. I really loved that car.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you love this one too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not the same though. It's always the first car, you know, like first car, it's beautiful. It was always more comfortable than this one is too, really soft, it really went faster. Mostly at night it went faster.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we are going to have to stop now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Okay, when can I see you again? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about Tuesday at 10:30? How is 2:30 Friday for you for later?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Up until now, it was beautiful. I start working Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm on third shift so it won't be any problem with the times. But I usually go to bed when I work third shift.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When is third shift?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Midnight to 8. And then I come home to my grandmother's house and sleep until 3 or 4 or 5 or 6, whenever I get up. And then I still have the evenings free. I'll have to do some switching if I'm going to keep coming to the morning appointments.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we can do it in the afternoon. Would that be better? [56:53]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's kind of when in the afternoon you can do it. Late in the afternoon would be beautiful, but I don't think most people like to be on  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, that's all right. Not on Tuesday I can't do it. Really I can. I'll have to really see. How would 4:30 be on Tuesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'll have to change the Friday one too because I don't want to come in - I don't want to be here Friday afternoon that night.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, nobody does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But let's do it Tuesday afternoon and we'll set the next one after that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At 4:30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What am I going to do about paying for this? Do I pay you whenever I want to or what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They bill you, or you can pay each time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But at the end of the month they send you a bill.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, I'll do it then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of job did you get?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, factory, just garbage work, lazy. People running all over and bossing us, it's a bad thing but it's work. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tuesday 4:30.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, good luck.</p>

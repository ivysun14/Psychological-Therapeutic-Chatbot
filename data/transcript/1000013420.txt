<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, here we are again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yeah. Another week. It went well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, where should we start? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's see. I was thinking about it before. Where do we start? I feel like in some ways we've hit a brick wall. But then, I was thinking about how I'd rather not come here today. And I was thinking, I guess, because it's before a long weekend and I've been pretty busy. We've got all this stuff going on with the house. In fact, we were up until two o'clock last night, drawing floor plans. Well, Karen was doing most of it. I was getting kind of irritated then. I think I've been in kind of a bad mood the last few days. I don't know exactly why. Maybe it's just all of these things happening, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, can you say a little bit more about the feeling of not wanting to come today? What was on your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just that I would rather have gone home early. Probably I wouldn't have. What I would have done, actually was just stay at work until 5:00 or later. But I'm just feeling not very motivated. I'm not feeling like I want to do much in particular. I think that's been kind of a theme (chuckles) for the week. I just haven't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feels like there's a lot of demands on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just feel like I have no time and I would just like to kind of veg out, but I haven't been able to do it. There's always been something, even when I get home from work. I have to work at the Salvation Army on Tuesday. I was already pretty tired, because I worked really late Friday and never really made it up as far as sleep went.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is kind of a dilemma in a way, because you're coming to a therapy session, which of course, you're supposed to think hard or work at or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Yeah. Definitely coming in here was like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we've sort of been talking, even if the last few meetings, about trying to focus on what is it that we really want to talk about now, and how things are going in here, and what makes sense. So maybe it also feels like it's unclear what we're even doing in here right now a little bit. (3:28)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to some extent. Although, I know that there are still things that I'm grappling with. Even precisely, the fact that I don't know... I was wondering if it is like a certain kind of resistance, or I feel like, "Oh, I've done enough." But I know there's more at the same time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels like there are two different parts of you. Part of you sort of is like, "Oh, it would just be a relief to not have to struggle with this anymore."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other half is like, "But I know there's more."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not that simple. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was it like to share with me that you didn't want to be here today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a little hard. (chuckles) And it was something that I was tossing around in my mind before I walked in the door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you tossing around in your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just the sharing of that feeling and would I just dismiss it or not. But it was something I was feeling. I was thinking, well, maybe I'm afraid to go on further. Maybe that's part of it. I don't know. Although, I think a lot of it has to do with feeling a little burned out. It's like, over the weekend I was working on the house. So in getting it ready, I had to fix tiles and regrout the bathroom and do all of this stuff. Karen is like really motivated. I'd just like to spend an evening not doing anything in particular. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say a little bit more about what was hard about sharing that with me, that you're sort of feeling mixed about being here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I'm afraid that I'm going to offend you in some way. I want to be the good patient or whatever. That goes against the grain. I know that, of course, there's a side of me that feels like... Doesn't want to expend the thought energy, or the psychic energy or whatever. (6:46)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that feels like it's worked, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. To some level it has worked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To share that with me is pushing yourself and oh, I'm thinking this and now I've got to tell him. He won't like it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) Right. Right. Yeah. Sort of like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Rather than other times I walk in here and sometimes it's just like I want to... I have so much I feel like I'm busting out. But then other times, like now, it's like pulling teeth. To some extent I feel like maybe I'm going to a dentist to get some extractions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh boy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just say that because I had (inaudible at 7:22) teeth extracted recently, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a vivid memory.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I think that's a very interesting experience that you just shared with me in a way. It puts a little more feeling into what you had said before. You said, part of you feels like maybe you could stop the therapy now. You've already made progress a little bit. Why keep struggling with it? But another part of you says, "Well I know there's more stuff there and maybe it would be helpful to keep going." But then, there's the feeling of, "Well, it might be like tooth extraction." It might be painful or hurtful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Sure. And it goes back to what I've said in the past, too. To some extent, I expect it to be like that. There's this notion of therapy being something that has to be painful. No gain without pain, right? But there's something... It has to be difficult if it's going to be valid, or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does it feel like maybe in some ways that I'm not living up to my responsibility as a therapist because I'm not making this painful enough for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) No. Certainly not. It's not something that... It's all mixed up, undoubtedly. Because there's definitely a part of me that would like to be able to cruise through and almost feel like I was getting away with something. That I was saying all the right things, but basically just being kind of automatic about it and not have it really touch me on some level. (9:17) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's felt like some of the time do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At times. At times. To a lesser or greater degree. Sometimes it's all so mixed up, because sometimes I walk away and I do feel... I wonder also if it's some kind of mechanism for repudiating any progress I do make, by saying, well if I walk away feeling good, then somehow, there's something wrong with that. And that gee, I must have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... not really shown everything...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. But at the same time, I know that there is more to it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know how it struck me the last time we talked or the time before. You'd said that one thing you felt was really helpful was when we used the two chairs. I had you go back and forth and try to get deeper into a conflict of some kind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm thinking if you were willing to try that again today, that's something we could try. You could in one chair speak to the part of you that wants to stop the therapy. The part of you that's struggled enough, that doesn't want to do it anymore and feels you've done enough. The other part of you can say what it is that there's more of. The part of you that wants to be pushed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that's okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why don't you start by saying everything that you can about wanting to stop the therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's a pain in the ass to get over here. It's an interruption in my week. It adds more stress. Why should I add that much more stress to my life? I don't even know what I should be talking about... I can't even identify... It seems like I have difficulty identifying what the problems are or what the things are, so how am I ever going to get at it? How are we going to get at it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I stop you? As you're saying that, what are you feeling right now as you're saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling like I started off better than I did... I kind of got away from the feeling. The original feeling was like, "Yeah." It was more genuine somehow. Then I started thinking too much about it. (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you say what that feeling was that you started with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a feeling of... Well, when I said things like, "Well it's a pain in the ass to get over here." Yeah, it's a pain in the ass to get over here, you know? But then I started to intellectualize about it a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's hard to stay with that feeling of being annoyed or angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. I was even anticipating to some extent what I was going to do. I think it's part of performing. I was anticipating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So here's maybe an example of the exact thing that's so elusive, that we together are struggling with. You say that it's hard for you to experience or feel what you're feeling. It seems like this is maybe some of what happens. A feeling starts to come up and then sort of like this intellectual analyzation starts happening. The feeling doesn't have a lot of freedom or space to hang around very long. It very quickly...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right it's kind of explained away or displaced in some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that feel like that's something that happens to you a lot? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think it is true. But it's like I'm not even aware of it. I think it just becomes like... How would you put it? Just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Automatic?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's sort of like... Well, think of it as a graph. You know, the feeling's there and then it sort of starts to (makes a puff sound) as the gears start turning. That gets suppressed and then, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So I think we're learning a little piece of the puzzle, then. You have this automatic system in a way. A feeling starts to come out and very quickly there comes a lot of analyzation and rationalization. A lot of intellectual work... And then the feeling gets quickly dissolved in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think there's some kind of fear in there that I'm going to say something that's somehow bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or not okay...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or not okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if it's okay, let's keep going and see. It might be hard to do it, but see if you can let that go a little bit. So continue to talk about wanting to stop the therapy, but try to stay with the feeling more and not try to understand what you're saying or predict what you're going to say next or analyze it or try to say it in the right way so I won't be offended. See if you can let it flow a little more. And if you can't, that's fine. But let's just see what happens. So go ahead. You can keep going or start over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well, let's see. I just feel like I'm all over the place and this is one other place I have to be and a certain time that I have to say everything that I'm doing now. It's really hard for me. I don't like it. Sometimes I'd just rather be relaxing by myself, just being myself. Why can't the world understand that? Why can't I just be okay the way I am?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me stop you right there. What are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that feel different? Did you feel you were sticking with a feeling...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It did feel different. It's... It was a little unexpected. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say more about that. How was it unexpected?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just like at the beginning, I thought, "Oh gee. How can I just start off and get into something?" But, it didn't take too long. So probably...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've just been feeling angry and put upon.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more put upon by me in a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or just put upon by a network of obligations that I feel are hemming me in somehow. The kind of feeling that I always have to answer to someone and that I have to follow new rules. I have to be at work. I have to be here. I have to be at home. I have to be doing X,Y and Z and... (18:15)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... enough already.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd like to just get the hell out for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it feel like it would make sense to keep going in this chair or do you think it would be helpful to voice the other side now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be interesting to voice the other side. I don't know. I sort of look at the other side as being that analytical side for some reason. It's just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you want to stick with this side a little longer and see if anything else emerges or comes up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I could do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I did a switch on you there. I asked you, and then I didn't do what you said. (chuckle) Okay. So let's see if you can pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's hard for me to be here. Sometimes it's really hard for me to say the things that I feel. I feel like I'm digging at myself sometimes. It's just like trying to bang things out. It makes me think of when I was in high school. I wrote this paper about what it was to be like a Mexican-American. I wrote it for like a religion class. I thought that I'd put a lot of thought into it. Then it came back. My teacher's comment was very critical. It was like, I don't think you've really thought about... I felt very indignant. I was pissed off. I was like, who the hell is he? The implication was that I had just given this kind of shallow treatment of a cursory... I was really pissed off. I was even more pissed off, because I saw a paper somebody else had written. They'd gotten a really high grade, which was a comparison between Christianity and Judaism. It was like pointing out the similarities. I thought, "There's a similarity between every freaking religion." So you're criticizing me about not being... And it made me think. I think I thought before then and after then, how deep is my life. How deep is my inner life? Do I have a real inner life? How dee is that inner life? What is there to grab on to? Sometimes I feel like there's nothing much to grab onto. Why try? (21:11)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me stop you there. What are you feeling now? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Anger also, but tinged with a certain kind of helplessness, I guess, or sadness. It's like a wish that I... I think the feeling is there that there is that thing more or less, that there is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something deeper?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... deeper that I would like to get to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's some sadness that you can't</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like maybe also, some sadness that other people can't understand, then. You write this paper where you thought you were sharing something about how you felt. And instead, somebody said, "No. This is nothing. This is not how you feel. This is shallow." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's doubt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's a lot of doubt, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If other people can't see that there's depth to me, maybe there isn't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounded like you were going to start to say something but then...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah there's a wanting of that acceptance. I think a certain feeling of being solitary, of being un-understood... Of not being... I sometimes feel like I'm the guy everybody likes but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... doesn't really know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Doesn't really know or there's no compelling...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it feel that way with me at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, with you it's harder for... There's always a feeling because we have a professional relationship. And I think I use that both ways. As a way to kind of... I feel of course, that it's... I guess there are times that I've had feelings of resentment that you know a lot about me, or more about me than I know about you. So it's a one-way street in that respect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels like it's unfair and especially...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And as far as... You've said things that were supportive, and on some levels they've meant a lot to me. But on other levels, it's different because I take it as a... Sometimes, it surprises me because sometimes I don't expect you to be able to say those things, because of how my picture is of how therapy has worked for my prior experience with it. (24:50)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I think there's actually a lot to what you just said. There are a lot of themes in there. It seems like one of them is a little resentment at... Here you are coming to me saying, "You know, the one thing that's really hard for me to do is tell you how I feel, and yet you keep asking me to tell you how I feel. And on top of it, you don't tell me how you feel."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's a little bit of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm exposing myself in some ways and you're not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially because that's the exact thing you're struggling with and it feels like the spotlight's on you that much more intensely because it's all about you, not about me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I don't, you know, really feel like I have the right to address my feelings of curiosity about your personal life or what you do. I think there are definitely limits to that. I accept that on the one hand, but also, there's a feeling like, "Yeah, well, it's not a level playing field in a sense." And that's that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a funny sort of way, that may be one way in which it makes it harder for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Harder and easier, though at the same time. Because of that, also I think it enables me to say things that I wouldn't say to anyone else, because it's a unique kind of relationship. It's not like, a drinking buddy or something like that, or people I work with or Karen. So it's not all negative, but it's a different framework, certainly. The feeling is like... I feel like, yeah, I definitely let things out here that not a lot of other people are exposed to. So in that sense, there's a kind of personal tie. But it's all kind of synthesized with this professional relationship. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you said that, the thought that came into my mind was somehow, while it makes it maybe easier, like you said, and that it's safer and it's a special relationship that's maybe separate from other relationships in your life so that way you can try things out or say things that you might not say to other people in your life. In a way, even when I do say something that's supportive or feels good, or seems helpful in some way, maybe because it's a professional relationship, that spoils it a little.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it blunts it on some level. But at the same time, I don't know that that's necessarily the case. On some level, it actually is more meaningful for me. It's hard for me to actually take criticism. It's also hard for me to take support or praise from other people as well. I usually just kind of dismiss it, but I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I definitely do. And in some ways when it comes from you... I do think to myself, "Gee is he just saying that to make me feel good?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Is he just being a good therapist?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of tucked that part of... Your dilemma is feeling you've got to be the good patient. So sometimes you wonder, does he really feel that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I think, "Oui, the stuff (ph) I'm coming in here is like so... I don't know. Sometimes it seems so mundane or so not terribly interesting. I feel like my life is not so interesting. So how can you be that interested? (chuckles) Sometimes I think we do have, you know... But on the other hand, I walk away from here sometimes feeling like we have very interesting discourses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I noticed when you were talking, the thing that popped into my mind, and I realize that maybe this is putting a little bit of pressure on you maybe... I would really welcome it if I said something, or if at any time you wonder, "Does he really think that?" or, "Does he really feel that way?" that you could ask me. When that comes up, if you could say, "Are you just saying that or do you really feel that? What is it that makes you think that?" I would really welcome that. Maybe sometimes I'm not aware of when you feel that way. I say something and I think I've said something meaning a certain thing or having a certain feeling about it. Maybe you have some doubt about it. (30:14)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could ask me about that... I know that's hard for you. So I'm asking you to do a hard thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I rationalize it. I think to myself, it's so hard. I don't imagine that... Your relationship with me, as opposed to other people who come to see you... I think you're generally supportive pretty much across the board on some levels, so it's not like if somebody's antagonistic, that doesn't mean you're going to be antagonistic. But your role is somehow laid out. The professional, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think there's some truth to that. This is a professional relationship. So there are things about it that are different. That's absolutely true. Maybe that affects both of us. Maybe sometimes that makes you... You're sort of pigeon-holed into feeling you've got to do what you're supposed to do when you're the patient. Maybe there are things that I do, because I'm the therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So it doesn't necessarily obviate those points when there is something genuine there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's certainly how it feels to me. I think that... I certainly believe that even though the therapy relationship is different, you and I are still people. We still have feelings about each other, feelings about what's happening in the moment, and those are real feelings. If I didn't like you and I didn't genuinely feel supportive of you, I think you'd probably be able to tell if I was just sort of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't believe that you would make those statements if you weren't feeling... I do believe that you wouldn't make those statements if you weren't really feeling them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, even though it's a hard thing to do, if you can, if you have a sense of like, "What does he mean? Why is he saying that? Does he really believe that? Does that mean he thinks something else?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could ask me, I think that would help us a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sometimes I just feel like I could pick and pick and ask you a million questions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'll make a deal with you. If it starts feeling like you're asking me a million questions, I'll tell you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that fair enough?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. I mean, I want to know more about what... I'm curious about the therapy itself and your training and what words brought you... What kind of approaches you use... I'm sure what you do is an amalgam of really different things. I think with most therapists that is the case. There are different influences. They take a little from different places.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you. If I spent a minute or two now, telling you about my training, how would that be helpful? What do you think... (34:08)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would somehow... It would be something that I think you were telling me about yourself that would be within the limits, I guess. I couldn't ask you about your family or things like that, or whatever. But this is something that I feel that you could give to me, I guess, in that sense. It's relevant, something I'm curious about. I'm curious to know something more about you. Does that sound fair?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean, I do think that's fair. And I think...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that in a minute it's not quite that easy to encapsulate, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but in a way, it sounds like it's not so much the exact details of what I tell you, but that I'm sharing something with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah. And then have you say sort of how you do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean, you're actually, I think, fairly insightful in your comment that my approach is a combination of a lot of different things. I think that's pretty accurate. I don't really label myself as a blank, blank kind of therapist. As far as my training, I got my Ph.D. at Stanford After Stanford, I did a post-doctoral fellowship at Princeton University before I came to Chicago. And I've tried lots of different therapy approaches.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm also wondering if the fact of being part of this study and being in this study, do you see that as constraining in any way as far as your approach?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's an interesting question. Do you have a sense in which that might have been happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just know that the study has certain parameters, right? As soon as that kind of situation occurs, there are certain...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of funny in a way. You've shared with me before today and today, also, that part of the struggle for you is that you feel constrained in what you share with me sometimes. So now, it's kind of funny, because you're asking me if maybe there are things that I think of or feel that I don't tell you. I'm in this study and I'm only supposed to be a certain kind of therapist in the study and I can only do certain things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) Right. Right. In some ways. In some way. I wouldn't feel, really, like I was losing if you were to say, "Yes." Because I know that just because you may be using a slightly different approach than you might normally, it doesn't invalidate it. But I don't know... I guess I'm just curious. I don't know. (chuckles). So, it' in that respect...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Also, there's another element to it, I think. There is a feeling of what am I doing to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, and also curiosity and just feeling like we've discussed before. It's perfectly possible. We're at the 19th or 20th...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's our 20th session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there are 10 more. Is it just going to end there? I'm not sure that I'm going to want it that way. It may well be that I'll want to continue in some way. (38:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me sort of address that question then. Actually, if it's okay, I want to answer that, but I also want to ask you... I just shared with you this little teeny bit about my training - that I went to Stanford, that I did some training at Princeton. How did it feel for me to share that with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt good. It was good. I mean, I felt... I thought that was... I felt rather pleased, I guess. I knew about Princeton. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you knew about Princeton already?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I went to Princeton and I think that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think actually, in our first phone conversation, you told me that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Okay. It could be. I don't even remember.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was a while ago. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, so it was hard for you to ask, but you asked. And since I told you, it felt good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It did feel good. I think there is definitely a side of me that would love... All the things that I say, of course, there's some part of me that would like it to be fully reciprocal on the one hand. But then it would be different. It would be different and not necessarily in a better way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, since we just have a couple of minutes, let me sort of answer the other question, since that's important, too. Um, as far as whether being in this research project puts on certain constraints, you know, I think there's probably some truth to that. And certainly, the biggest constraint is the one, sort of just mentioned. It's like, well, there are 30 sessions. What happens after 30 sessions? And the policy of the project is that when the 30 sessions are over, the therapy is over. They ask the participants in the study to not have anymore therapy for the next 6 months. When 6 months is over, someone from the project will contact you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And do like a post-debriefing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping)... check in with you. Right, of some kind... We'll check in with you. "How have things been going since the therapy has ended on the issues that you identified as being important for you?" So as part of the project, it's sort of important for people to not continue immediately after for 6 months. At tat time, when the 6 month-period comes, you could certainly ask the person who's going to call you if you would like for me to give you a call and check in with you also. I would be able to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Alright. I don't know if I had been made clear about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how do you... As I say that, how do you feel about that? (41:34)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, first it felt, I don't know... I felt both things. The first feeling was, Well, gee. That seems hardly fair." It's such an artificial way to close up. It's like you've got to write your term paper by the end of... And after that, you can't read anything about the subject anymore, even if you like it. But, I also... Having worked in the sciences too, I know, of course, it makes sense. It makes good sense from the design of a study and all that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's good for the study may not necessarily be good for what...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Because they have to see what the least short term benefit's going to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we need to stop for today because we're out of time. But let's talk more about this next time, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how did the session feel after coming here and not really wanting to be here? How are you feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think a lot came out. I sort of suspected, actually the times when I'm feeling the most resistance sometimes...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Surprisingly work out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's both things being true again. Great. (43:22)</p>

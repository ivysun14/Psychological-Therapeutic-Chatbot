<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well&mdash;known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>The following transcripts are from two sessions featuring Carl Rogers, PhD and a client, Mr.VAC.</p>

<p>Dr. Carl Rogers (1902&mdash;1987) was one of America's most prominent psychologists. Rather than identifying persons as "sick" or mainly flawed from childhood experiences as the Freudians did, Rogers was interested in how he and other mental health professionals could recognize the strength in people. 
Rogers is the acknowledged creator of the "client&mdash;centered" approach to psychotherapy. It has also been called "person&mdash;centered therapy." His studies resulted in the creation of several totally new mental health therapy techniques. Client&mdash;centered therapy is based on the principle of talking therapy and is a non&mdash;directive approach. The basic elements involve the therapist creating a supportive, non&mdash;judgmental atmosphere in which the client is encouraged to reach his or her full potential. The therapist encourages the patient to express his or her feelings and does not suggest how the person might wish to change. By listening and then repeating back what the patient reveals, the therapist helps them to explore and understand their feelings for themselves. In client&mdash;centered therapy the therapist's role is mainly to act as a facilitator and to provide a comfortable environment and NOT to direct therapy outcomes.
Called "the quiet revolutionary," Rogers also accomplished what no mental health professional had done before. His 1942 innovation of the tape&mdash;recording of psychotherapeutic interviews was far ahead of its time. Many of his taped interviews were donated to the American Academy of Psychotherapists' tape library, and those tapes have now been transcribed for this database.				</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: This is an interview with Mr. Vac. V&mdash;A&mdash;C. Therapist C. R. Rogers.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Looks like there's some cigarettes here in the drawer over here.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: (inaudible at 0:00:11.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Yeah. It is (inaudible at 0:00:18.0)</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:00:18.6 to 0:00:36.9)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Do look kind of angry this morning or is that my imagination? Not angry? (Short pause) Feel like letting me in on whatever is going on? [0:00:59.6]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:00:59.6 to 0:01:13.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I kind of feel like saying if it would be of any help at all, I'd like to come in. On the other hand if it's something you'd rather - if you just feel more like being within yourself and feeling whatever you're feeling within yourself well that's okay too.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:01:39.9 to 0:01:54.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess the (inaudible at 0:01:54.5) thing I'm saying really in saying that is, I do care. I'm not just sitting here like a stick. [0:02:02.5]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:02:02.5 to 0:02:18.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And I guess your silence is saying to me that either you don't wish to or can't come out right now. And that's okay.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:02:26.9 to 0:02:40.4)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: So I won't pester you but I just want you to know that I'm here.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:02:44.8 to 0:03:00.9)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I see I'm going to have to stop in a few minutes. [0:03:03.7]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:03:03.7 to 0:03:19.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: It's hard for me to know how you've been feeling but it looks as though part of the time that maybe I rather didn't know how you're feeling. In a way it looks as though, part of the time it just feels very good to let down. Relax the tension. That is I say I don't really know how you're feeling. That's just the way it looks to me. [0:03:56.8]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:03:57.0 to 0:04:12.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Have things been pretty bad lately?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:04:13.9 to 0:04:28.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Maybe this morning you just wish I'd shut up.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:04:30.9 to 0:04:48.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And maybe I should but I just keep feeling I'd like to - I don't know - be in touch with you in some way. [0:04:56.4]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:04:56.5 to 0:05:14.9)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: It sounds discouraged or tired.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:05:17.8 to 0:05:35.4)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: (inaudible at 0:05:35.1) lousy.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Everything's lousy. Do you feel lousy?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:05:46.1 to 0:06:04.4)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Do you want to come in ready at 12:00 p.m. at the usual time? [0:06:06.9]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:06:06.9 to 0:06:26.3)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I don't know.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:06:26.9 to 0:06:41.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: This kind of feels sunk way down deep in these lousy, lousy feelings?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:06:46.6 to 0:07:01.2)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Is that something like it? [0:07:02.2]</p>

<p>MR. VAC: No.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: No.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:07:07.5 to 0:07:23.3)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: No. I just ain't no good to nobody and never was and never will be.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Since you're feeling that (inaudible at 0:07:30.2) no good to yourself, no good to anybody, never will be any good to anybody. Just that you're completely worthless?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:07:48.7 to 0:08:01.8)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Those really are lousy feelings. [0:08:03.8]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:08:03.8 to 0:08:15.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You just feel that you're no good at all.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:08:19.5 to 0:08:28.7)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah. That's what this guy I went to town with, he told me last night.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: This guy that you went to town with really told you that you were no good. Is that what you're saying? Did I get that right?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Um&mdash;hum.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And I guess the meaning of that, if I get it right, is that here's somebody that meant something to you. And what does he think of you? Why he's told you that he thinks you're no good at all. [0:09:05.2]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:09:05.2 to 0:09:18.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And that just really knocks the props (ph) up from and just brings the tears.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:09:27.8 to 0:09:42.5)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I don't care though.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You tell yourself you don't care at all. But somehow, I guess some part of you cares because some part of you weeps over it. [0:10:01.4]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:10:01.4 to 0:10:23.2)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess some part of you just feels here I am hit with another blow. As if I hadn't had enough blows like this during my life when I feel that people don't like me, here's someone I've begun to feel attached to. And now, he doesn't like me. And I'll say I don't care. I won't let it make any difference to me. (Pause) But just the same, the tears run down my cheeks. [0:11:06.8]</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah. I guess always knew it. I guess I always knew it.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: If I'm getting that right, it is that what makes it hurt worst of all is that when he tells you you're no good, well shucks, that's what you've always felt about yourself. Is that the meaning of what you're saying?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Um&mdash;hum.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: So you feel as though he's just confirming what Â… you've already known. [0:12:04.4]</p>

<p>(Silence 0:12:04.3 to 0:12:13.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And he's confirming what you've already felt in some way.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:12:17.4 to 0:12:31.7)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: So between his saying so and you're perhaps feeling it underneath, you just feel about as no good as anybody could feel.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:12:44.1 to 0:13:01.4)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Sort of let it soak in and try to feel what you must be feeling. It comes up sort of this way to me and I don't know but as though here is someone you had made a contact with, somebody you'd really done things for and done things with. Somebody that had some meaning to you and now, wow, he slaps you in the face by telling you you're just no good. And that really cuts so deep you can hardly stand it.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:13:43.8 to 0:14:01.7)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I've got to call it quits for today. [0:14:03.2]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:14:03.4 to 0:14:23.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And it really hurts, doesn't it?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:14:25.3 to 0:14:50.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess if feeling came out, you'd just weep and weep and weep.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:14:54.1 to 0:15:08.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Help yourself to another Kleenex if you want. [0:15:10.5]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:15:10.5 to 0:15:23.0)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Can you go now?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:15:24.1 to 0:15:34.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess you really hate to but I've got to see somebody else.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:15:37.6 to 0:16:00.9)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: It's really bad, isn't it? [0:16:01.9]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:16:01.8 to 0:16:14.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Let me ask you one question and say one thing. Do you still have that piece of paper with my phone numbers on it and instructions and so on?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Okay. And if things get bad to which you just feel real down, you have them call me. Because that's what I'm here for is to try to be of some help when you need it. And if you need it you have them call me.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I think I'm beyond help.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You feel as though you're beyond help. (inaudible at 0:16:57.1) feel just completely hopeless about yourself. And I can understand that. I don't feel hopeless but I can realize that you do. Just feel as though nobody could help you and you're really beyond help. [0:17:18.2]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:17:18.3 to 0:17:35.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess you just feel so down. It's just awful. I just have one other thing and then I'm going to be busy here this afternoon till 4:00 p.m. maybe a little after. But if you should want to see me again this afternoon, drop around about 4:00 p.m. {0:18:05.0]</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Okay? Otherwise I'll see you Friday noon unless I get a call from you.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:18:24.9 to 0:18:37.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You could, if you're kind of concerned for fear anybody would see that you've been weeping a little, you can go out and sit for a while where you waited for me. (inaudible at 0:18:51.4) sit down in the waiting room there and read magazines it's okay.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:18:55.2 to 0:19:12.4)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess you really hate to go. [0:19:14.3]</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I don't want to go back to work.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You don't want to go back to work.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:19:23.3 to 0:19:35.4)</p>

<p>END OF SESSION</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S COMMENTARY:</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: This is the end of the interview. Later in the day, the therapist saw Mr. Vac on the hospital grounds. He seemed much more cheerful. And he said that he thought he could get a ride into town that afternoon. The next time the therapist saw Mr. Vac was three days later on Friday at the time of the regular appointment. This interview follows.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I brought a few magazines you can take with you if you want. [0:20:06.4]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:20:06.5 to 0:20:53.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I didn't hear from you since this time. Were you able to go to town that day?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah. I went in, came back in the (inaudible at 0:21:09.8) [0:21:10.4]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:21:11.0 to 0:21:46.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Let's get (inaudible at 0:21:46.3)</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:21:47.5 to 0:22:07.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I don't know what but I realize it somehow makes me feel good that today you don't have your hand up to your face so that I can somehow kind of see you more. I was wondering why I felt as though you were a little more here than you are sometimes. And I realized well it's because you - I don't feel as though you're hiding behind your hand or something.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:22:37.7 to 0:22:57.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And I think I sense, though I could be mistaken, I think I do sense that today just like some other days, when you come in here, it's just as though you let yourself sink down into feelings that run very deep in you. Sometimes they're very bad feelings like last time and sometimes probably they're not so bad. But I just kind of I think I understand that somehow when you come in here, it's as though you do let yourself down into those feelings. Now -</p>

<p>MR. VAC: (inaudible at 0:23:43.4) take off.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Hmm?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I'm going to take off. [0:23:47.3]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You're going to take off. And really, run away from here? Is that what you mean? There must be some - what's the background of that? Can you tell me? Or I guess what I mean more accurately is, I know you don't like the place but it must be that something special came up recently.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I just want to run away and die.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum. Okay. Um&mdash;hum. It isn't even that you want to get away from here to something. You're just willing to leave here and go away and die in a corner. [0:24:51.5]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:24:51.6 to 0:25:08.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess as I let that soak in, I really do sense how how deep that feeling sounds that you ... I guess that imagine that comes to my mind is sort of a wounded animal that wants to crawl away and die. It sounds as though that's kind of the way you feel that you just want to get away from here and vanish - perish and not exist.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:25:50.1 to 0:26:02.9)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Well all day yesterday and all morning I wished I would die. I even prayed last night that I could die. [0:26:08.8]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I think I got all of that but for a couple of days now; you just wished you could be dead. And you even prayed for that.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:26:27.4 to 0:26:42.4)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess that the one way this strikes me is that to live is such an awful thing to you that you just wish you could die. And not live. [0:27:01.1]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:27:01.2 to 0:27:20.2)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: It's that you've just been wishing and wishing that you were not living. You wish that life would pass away from you.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:27:37.0 to 0:27:56.7)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Wishing it more than anything else I ever wished around it. [0:27:59.2]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum. Um&mdash;hum. As you wished for lots of things but boy, it seems as though this wish to not live is deeper and stronger than anything you've ever wished before.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:28:18.7 to 0:28:34.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I can't help but wonder really it's still true that some things that's friends said to you are those still part of the thing that makes you feel so awful?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Generally yeah.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:28:55.3 to 0:29:08.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: The way I'm understanding that is that in a general way, the fact that he felt you were no good has just set off a whole flood of feeling in you which makes you really wish, wish, wish you weren't alive. Is that somewhere near it?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Well I'm no good to nobody and I ain't no good for nothing so what's the use of living? [0:29:42.1]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum. Um&mdash;hum. You feel I'm not any good to another living person. So, why should I go on living? (Pause) And I guess a part of that is that, here I'm kind of guessing and you can set me straight. I guess a part of that is you felt I tried to be good for something as far as he was concerned. I really tried. And now, if I'm no good to him - if he feels I'm no good then that sure proves that I'm just no good to anybody. Is that anywhere near it?</p>

<p>MR. VAC: No, other people have told me that too. [0:30:51.0]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Yeah. I see. But you feel if you go away what others several others have said then then you are no good. No good to anybody.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:31:16.5 to 0:31:32.1)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I don't know whether this will help or not. But, I would just like to say that I think I can understand pretty well what it's like to feel that you're just no damn good to anybody because there was a time when I felt that way about myself. (Pause) And I know it can be really rough. [0:32:11.0]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:32:11.2 to 0:32:26.7)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I see we've only got a few more minutes left.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:32:29.3 to 0:32:44.9)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Should we make it next Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. the usual time?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:32:47.8 to 0:33:05.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: If you gave me any answer on that, I really didn't get it. Do you want to see me next Tuesday at 11:00 a.m.? [0:33:11.4]</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah, I want to &mdash;</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You just don't know.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:33:18.1 to 0:33:31.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Right at this point, you just don't know whether you want to say yes to that or not.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:33:39.4 to 0:34:02.0)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess you just feel so down and so awful that you just don't know whether you can see that far ahead. [0:34:18.6]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:34:18.7 to 0:34:35.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I'm going to give you that appointment at that time because I'd sure like to see you then.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:34:39.6 to 0:34:58.9)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Another thing I would say is that if things continue to stay so rough for you, don't hesitate to have them call me. (Pause) And if you should decide to take off, I would very much appreciate it if you would have them call me and  so I could see you first. I wouldn't try to dissuade you; I'd just want to see you.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I might go today. (Pause) I really don't know but I don't care. [0:35:54.9]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You just feel that your mind is made up and that you're going to leave. You're not going to anywhere. You're just just going to leave.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:36:10.8 to 0:36:28.6)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: And that's why I want to go because I don't care what happens.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: And that's why I want to go because I don't care what happens.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Um&mdash;hum. That's why you wanted to (inaudible at 0:36:41.4) because you really don't care about yourself. You just don't care what happens. And I guess I'd just like to say I care about you. And I care what happens. [0:36:57.5]</p>

<p>(Silence 0:36:57.4 to 0:37:31.8)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: Somehow that just makes all the feeling pour out.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:37:39.9 to 0:37:59.5)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You could just weep and weep and weep. And feel so badly. [0:38:08.3]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:38:08.4 to 0:38:23.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And I do get some sense of how awful you feel inside.</p>

<p>(Silence 0:38:27.9 to 0:39:12.6)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And just so sob. [0:39:14.7]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:39:14.7 to 0:39:31.2)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: I guess all the pent up feeling you've been feeling the last few days just come rolling out.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:39:43.9 to 0:39:58.7)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: (inaudible at 0:39:58.3) Kleenex there if you'd like it. [0:40:00.8]</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:40:00.9 to 0:40:18.4)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: And just feel kind of torn to pieces inside.</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:40:22.2 to 0:40:41.3)</p>

<p>MR. VAC: I wish I could die. I wish I could die.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You just wish you could die, don't you? Um&mdash;hum. It feels so (inaudible at 0:40:53.3) you wish you could perish.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah. [0:41:04.5]</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You just feel so awful and so torn apart inside that it just makes you wish you could pass out. (Pause) I guess life is so tough, isn't it?</p>

<p>(Silence from 0:41:36.2 to 0:42:01.3)</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: That you just feel (inaudible at 0:42:02.2) and sob your hurt away and wish you could die. (Pause) I don't want to rush you. And I'll stay as long as you really need me. I do have another appointment (inaudible at 0:42:30.8) be late for.</p>

<p>MR. VAC: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. ROGERS: You've certainly been through some things, haven't you? [0:42:50.3]</p>

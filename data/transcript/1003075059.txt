<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now, we just put that right there.  So what's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I, I, I'm feeling a little better.  I mean each time I, since switching to you, I think I incrementally feel better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and I, I, and I think that I, it's funny I, it, um, I notice it most in my own behavior than feeling inside necessarily.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, you know, I find myself, um, you know, before I came here I was just, um, uh, sitting, you know, at work, at home.  I wasn't doing anything.  I couldn't get myself to do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, uh, you know, I just find myself doing things.  Um, and at work I myself participating and start getting project going that should have been going a while ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so, you know, in a way, uh, I wish it, like, felt better inside, but, um, I, I'm certainly functioning, uh, like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have more interest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're more motivated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't feel, you don't, you're not experiencing, uh, your mood lifting up [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Uh, it's more an absence of the bad rather than —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A presence of good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, do you still have the suicidal feelings?  Are they still —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that's good.  Um, and your wife has noticed —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, uh, uh, in fact she said my snoring has, uh, sort of, h, I haven't been doing it lately.  So there wasn't really much to observe.  She didn't, uh, she didn't notice anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, because we were wondering the sleep [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that what you meant?  Oh, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I, I was, first I was going to ask about, uh, has she noticed any further [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I should have asked her.  I, I meant to, but we had sort of a small crisis last night, and we, uh, you know, couldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't.  Um, but I meant to ask her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I do, I am still sleeping kind of poorly, and I think, I, I, and I, I don't know if that's the, uh, Wellbutrin, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or that I, I seem, seem to sleep very shallowly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, you know, and, uh, I'm just, just below the surface.  Um, and there's no change in libido, still.  You know, um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well now, I think it's time to drop the Prozac a little bit.  That would be my hunch.  Let's, let's just go over, retrace our steps for a second.  So the first thing we did, was we switched you to branded Prozac.  Then we added the Wellbutrin, then we went up on the Wellbutrin.  So one thing is that Prozac tends to help with mood and anxiety.  But if you push it too far, people can feel a little bit apathetic.  Wellbutrin tends to help with mood and energy and motivation.  So if you're on just unopposed Prozac and s, similar problem with Lexapro and Zoloft, and some of the others ones you've been on, um, uh, unopposed, often people complain of, kind of a blah, apathetic [INAUDIBLE].  So adding the Wellbutrin can often offset it.  But sometimes you can need to actually back off on the Prozac a little bit.  So I'm going to try doing that.  I might try having you drop it down 40, and uh, and leave the Wellbutrin where it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have you on the twice a day Wellbutrin, specifically because I said occasionally —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It outperforms the once a day Wellbutrin.  Um, you're taking it breakfast, dinner?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking it w, uh, when I get up, and then uh, six hours or more after that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, like early afternoon, like one or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two sounds right.  So that's pretty far away from dinner.  So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it better to take it with food?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, it, I, I don't, uh, if it's not bothering your stomach, then I'd say it probably does not matter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Either of these medications, it doesn't matter?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, generally we have people take Prozac with food, but if they're not bothering your stomach, you probably don't have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so you could take the Prozac and Wellbutrin both together first thing in the morning, and then the Wellbutrin six or so hours later.  We're trying to keep it away from bedtime, so it doesn't bother your sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're doing all that.  Um, my next thought would be to back off slightly on the Prozac and see if that shifts things a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and, uh, you're still taking the diazepam.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  But not, not as much.  Um, it, uh, I'm not even sure how much I'm taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, so that, and, and that is usually, I haven't been taking during the day at all.  Sometimes at night I will take that.  I, I'm not quite sure which strategy to use with sleeping aids.  You know, um, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I'll take that, you know, if I'm feeling a little anxious and think that will help me sleep through the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what else have you taken for sleep in the past?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, occasionally I take Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe a half of one, because I don't know, I think we discussed, I don't really need, uh, to, help getting asleep.  It's staying asleep —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Staying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my problem.  And I have, uh, temazepam —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is pretty effective.  I took it last night, in fact.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The problem, I mean, temazepam is generally very effective, but it, it's habit forming if you take it every night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So is Ambien, to a lesser extent, but it still is, kind of, sort of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, did you every take Benadryl or Trazodone, or any of these nonsedating, [INAUDIBLE] sedating —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Benadryl I, I remember years ago trying it, and, and once in a while it would work, and then it would st, stop when they started making the, uh, um, sort of, um, uh, oh, what's the word?  Uh, oh gee, now I can't think of the word.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?  Trazodone, have you tried that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I don't remember that one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trazodone is a sedating anti—depressant that we n, never used all that much, because it was so sedating, and now has a new life, in smaller doses, for insomnia.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's an antidepressant at 450 a day.  For fif, at 50 or 100, we just use it for, uh, sleep.  And it doesn't have as much habit forming potential —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As, uh, Restoril, temazepam, or even Ambien.  You can, uh, it's not habit forming at all, but, I mean, all these things are a little bit, you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because if you're used to that, then you suddenly stop them, you're not going to sleep as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's one of the reasons I try to take it, not on a regular —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With regularity.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  There's one wrinkle about Trazodone that you always have to worn males about, and that is, as a rare side effect it's been reported of causing an erection that won't go down.  Which sounds like a good thing, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Only after, after a while it's not a good thing.  So it is a potentially, you know, very serious side effect, although very rare.  Okay.  So we usually don't refrain from prescribing it, but we caution you that if there's any hint of that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That you should not take it again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because the worst—case scenario would be, you know, it doesn't go down, which could happen, even with a single dose, you know, that you'd have to go to the emergency and get treated, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could be a serious thing, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's the thing to do if it does happen?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's, it's unusual.  So, we don't, you know, there's no, there's been no discussion of taking it off the market or anything like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well do you think it would be better for me to try to just tough it out to see if, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, the usual first, usually the first thing that you try is, you know, making sure that all your habits are, are arguing in favor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we look at the nonsedating, I mean, the sedating, uh, medicines that are not habit forming like Trazodone or Benadryl or, you know, whatever.  And then we start looking at the Ambiens and temazepam.  So, um, you, you fall asleep, but then you wake up in the middle of the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's the pattern?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Many times, three to four times a night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that to urinate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I end up urinating.  Uh, and sometime, and sometimes it's very slight, but I just figure I go anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Uh, but then you have trouble falling back to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Um, so it takes how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long does it take to fall back to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Boy it, it varies.  Sometimes, uh, and, you know, and it, it's hard to say, because I try not to look at the clock —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that would drive me crazy.  But, uh, well used to, um it can be anywhere, I think, from, you know, 10 or 15 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I tell you, you know, I never, um, I used to sleep like a log, but the last, maybe, dozen years, it's crept in where —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now I feel like I'm up a lot.  And I think it's, you know, your sleep does get more fractured as you get older.  So I think the, the key is to try and, um, develop the right strategies.  If, if, if you wake up, and you pee, and you go back to bed, you have to not, first, worry about if this is going to be an issue or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you have to just say, "Well I got up and now we'll go back to sleep."  People would say if you can't fall back to sleep in 20 or 30 minutes that you should actually get out of bed —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And do something boring, because then you're getting into this thing where you're, you're kind of battling.  It's probably go and, you know, go sit up and watch some TV until you're kind of drowsy again, or read until you're kind of drowsy again, and then go back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Sometimes I do put the light on, uh, you know, to read.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That's true.  If you read, you have to put the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that, uh, can be effective.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't like disturbing my wife.  She used to sleep like a real log.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now she —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She doesn't either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People would say that you should, the, your, your bed should only be, you shouldn't watch, read or watch TV in bed.  You should just, if you're going to read, you should actually go sit in a chair, maybe, even in a different room, and just read for a few minutes until you're d, drowsy, and then go back to bed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're trying to condition yourself that, you know, if you're in bed you're sleeping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, if you can't fall back asleep quickly, you go do something to distract yourself a little while.  And then when you're kind of nodding off, and then you go back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're trying to condition yourself to have as, a short amount of time from the time you lie down until you fall back asleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  That makes sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, why don't we try that, um, because I think a lot of what people experience, I mean, people do s, sleep lighter and have more breaks as they get older, for a variety of reasons.  But I think, if you don't sweat it, it may not be a b, a big issue.  I think if, when people get up, and they're worried and know, now it's going to happen, and blah, blah.  You know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then it becomes, compounds it.  So, um, we could try that.  Um, if you get up in the middle of the night and you take an Ambien or Restoril, don't you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you take it before you go to bed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, if, if I'm going to take it, I take before I go to bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're anticipating it might be a night that you're going to have trouble?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.  There actually is one medicine that is most appropriate to take in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it mentioned it the last —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sonata.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You could use it, taking it after —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but, well what we could do, is we could give you that one, um, but encourage you to only take it if you're really having a rough night.  And otherwise, just use those behavioral strategies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I'm afraid otherwise you're just going to wake up every night in the middle of the night to take it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  So we could give you that one, which would be probably better than giving you Ambien or Restoril at night.  You'd have it there, so you knew you had it if you needed it, but you could try and do the behavioral strategies, so, you'd, hopefully, only end up taking it once in a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That might be worth trying.  Um, because it's light, and it only works for about four hours or so.  So in the middle of the night you w, you don't want to take one of those eight—hour kind [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> See the difficulty is, too, I, I usually go, I go to sleep very early, because I get up so early.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm, I'm asleep between 8:30 and 9:00 in the evening.  And I usually sleep pretty solidly to about midnight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, and that's when I start waking up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So, um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I guess that, you know, if I'm getting up at 4:30 that would be the time to take it, but not at, not at 1:00 or 2:00.  Right?  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what time do you get up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 4:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you go to bed at 8:30, so you should look, you're shooting for seven and a half, eight hours of sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and I always been a lousy sleeper.  I, I should have said, well I slept like a log when I was younger —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Much younger.  But, uh, since my adult, most of my adult life has been pretty poor sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I'm amazed how it's changed for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  It has, it was always bad, but now it's just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, do one of those appeal to you more?  Trying the Trazodone at bed, or trying the Sonata in the middle of the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, and the Trazodone is the, uh, uh, is an antidepressant at a low dose?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, for some reason that appeals to me more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sonata is like Ambien</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's like a little lighter one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's why it's, you know, works, uh, for fewer hours.  You want to try the Trazodone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well yeah, I think, but what do you feel, I, have any opinion?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Not really strong feeling.  You could really make case for either one.  I guess the question will be with the Trazodone, will it keep you asleep longer?  Will it make you, uh, it easier for you to fall back asleep if you get up?  I guess the, that has the virtue of trying to have one solid block of sleep, where the other one, again, we might, I'm worried it might be self—fulfilling a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So let's try that one first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  And I have to write this down, because I'll forget.  So, um, so let's do the Trazodone, and I'll write Sonata if, you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Optional, too.  And then, that, that would be the other thing I do, is I'd leave the Wellbutrin where it is, but I'd actually drop the Prozac slightly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are we giving you three 20s right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And you need a script for that one, I, I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I need it.  I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So let's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure about the, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin, you're probably just running out of —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Both of them it seems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, you have another month of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, uh, I'll give you both, just so we have, but, uh, and I'll write the Prozac, I'll say two to three a day, but take two.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they'll still give you 90 of them, but, uh, let's see if that's actually, w, what I'm is the Prozac on it's own wasn't doing it, so you, obviously, you know, you went up.  And now you're on the Wellbutrin, it's possible that, uh, the Prozac did all it was going to do for depression at 40 —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now it's just adding a little bit of a blur.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might actually be a little better at 40 than at the 60.  Let's try it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we have the options of, of trying one of the other ones in combination with Wellbutrin, but we'll cross that bridge if we have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And the diazepam you don't need because you have, you have some of those.  Uh, what else is due?  I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you know, one thing that I did want to mention, that I don't know that I did, [INAUDIBLE], but I've never had any kind of a drinking problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've, um, always been healthy with that, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, you know, about a year and half or so ago, you know, I had a bout, you know, where I was, I think probably, drinking too much and, and, and, sort of, um, having urges —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, to drink?  Which was not really the way I ever drank.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, that's, that had lessened before I came to you, but it hadn't totally gone away.  Um, now it's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have any, uh, I'm where I used to be, you know, as far as, uh, you know, drinking socially and, um, so on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just thought I'd mention that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  That's good.  You didn't elaborate that the first time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I, I forgot, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it is okay to drink moderately with these medications?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All the medicines carry the warning to not.  That's kind of a medical/legal thing.  People can get more easily intoxicated.  I have had people feel that normally they could have a bunch of drinks, and on one or two drinks with Prozac [INAUDIBLE] much more, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it varies from person to person, but clearly the medicines can exaggerate response.  So I'd say really one or two.  I want you to be someplace —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not driving —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And maybe eating, and, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> True careful moderation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, so the, the concern is that it, uh, that it contributes —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exaggerates the, the intoxication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that there's any kind of a, a, a —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not a dangerous —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  It's, it's really more a safety kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never drink and drive anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and then, you know, we were talking about, you know, your, um, your life story last time, I mean, and I was throwing out whether there was a role for you going back into therapy.  An I, uh, and I can't remember what we, what we talked about last.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I, I think my feeling at this point is that intellectually, I, I really know, uh, uh, why I am who I am now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and as far as understanding goes, I, I don't think I need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I had a very good, uh, talk therapist, and, uh, I worked with him for a very long time, and, um, so I don't see that really getting me, getting me anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and in fact, one thing I do want to mention, too, this, this, when I started, I, I, in discussions with him I, there was, um, this mechanism that seemed to occur.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, uh, when I would begin to feel better, um, and recognize that I was feeling a little bit better, I , that would a, a trigger for sabotage.  And I, I'd, I'd start to, and it, it really did happen in a day —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I felt, I think it did, you know, at least it added up that way.  I was, realized at work that I was feeling, you know, I was doing [INAUDIBLE] and feeling better, and by the afternoon, I was feeling very anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I have been mindful of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I think, uh, I think maybe we said this last time, I think when people have long—standing depression, uh, it is unnerving to feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't trust it, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And, uh, it brings up all kinds of things, like are g, people going to expect more of me, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So on and so forth.  So, uh, it's not like you're going to embrace it right away.  It's going to be a gradual, gradual process.  [INAUDIBLE].  So I think I'm going to shut this thing off because I'm going to just write the scripts.</p>

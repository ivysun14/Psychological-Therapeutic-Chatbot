<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And uh, what's today's date again?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE].  Just sign them and date them and I can fiddle with the rest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right thank you.  Okay, so when you were here last you had your Lamictal was 200 mg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you said at the time you though it was, it was helpful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are things now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um pretty good, uh, I've been actually, I basically have a six day weekend because Thursday and Friday we just had senior meetings and so we went to school for like an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't go to school until Wednesday but, I noticed, I think it was yesterday, or actually the night before yesterday so,</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Saturday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Saturday night and Friday night I forgot to take my Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I noticed a huge change, like definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess, I guess it was kind of like, when I do that it's kind of like a chemical roller coaster and my body is like, doesn't know what to do.  And I notice I'm a lot more sensitive to things and like uh I don't know, like um I don't know, I'm just a lot more sensitive as far as um, for example I was going to have my girlfriend but she went and hung out with her friends instead and I kind of like I guess you could say it pissed me off a little bit.  Um, which once I thought about it I was like, why did I get mad about that?  And uh, I don't know I can notice a huge difference as far as when I am taking it and when I'm not taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, when you, when you missed the two doses, did you miss them because you simply forgot to take them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um yeah I was spending the night at a friend's house and I just totally spaced it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so when you got, when did you realize that you had missed the dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um probably the next day, uh, like I realized—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You missed it Friday night and Saturday morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you, did you know on Sunday that you forgot to take it or did you had you,</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um I knew, well, yeah, I knew.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause I guess, I guess, what I'm thinking about is I'm wondering how long it took your body to register so that your brain figured out that you had forgotten the medicine.  And do you recognize how the medicine can be really helpful, I mean you knew it was helpful but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I really, I really don't notice it until like an issue comes up or something just like going somewhere, doing something um, I'm probably a little more lazy, and I don't take it um, just because I guess my body's not used to it and it uh, I just take things, like if someone were to say something uh I would take it like a lot more seriously or I'd take it.  I over analyze things like when I'm not on it.  And as far as like over analyzing I'm kind of like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, so I guess by Sunday then you figured out that you had missed two doses?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so you took it again Sunday night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I took it Sunday night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how quickly did it produces some kind of, [INAUDIBLE], how long did it take you before you recognized, before it began to work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know since [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, some of the same things were happening to me today, I took it last night and as far as like me not taking it, I kind of felt that way today.  And cause uh something else happened to my girlfriend later, and I got mad again, but uh I noticed it started to work probably, I woke up at 1, it probably kicked in around 3, maybe 4.  So I don't know if that's uh how long I'd been awake or just how long after the fact I'd taken it.  Whether it takes time after I wake up and get going and stuff so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now you also are still taking the Metadate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and that's the 30 mg size?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um I believe it was,</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you take 30 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, cause I know that's not, that's not one that I wrote for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I still have Synthroid; I'm taking levathroxin, which is basically the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, um, so how are the senior activities this year, pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.  Prom's this Saturday so, it'll probably go pretty good, pretty good.  I don't know why, but we decided to have it up in uh [NAME OTHER] this year.  Up at [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh well okay.  That makes sense.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were going to do it over in [NAME OTHER] but I guess some parents petitioned cause they thought it was horrible like, a horrible part of town you know we're going to get mugged or something.  So they petitioned and they had to change it so now we have to drive like an hour and a half so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's the theme?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, hot cabana nights.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  That sounds like fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that's great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay so, now, during the time that you didn't take the Lamictal, for the couple nights did you still take your Metadate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh,</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or did you miss taking it also?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I missed it along, probably Friday or Saturday morning, but I took it um I took it yesterday morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you also notice a difference in the um, the missing of the Metadate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Definitely.  Um not only was I not on Lamictal, not only was I emotional to what was going on but I was hyper at the same time.  So when my mind got to going I was, I don't know, definitely over analyzing things a lot faster then I could think.  So I was reacting more then I could, reacting to things faster then I could process.  I don't know if that makes sense or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that makes perfect sense.  That's, that's right on, I mean that's exactly what I would have expected it, because, I mean it does, the combination of the Lamictal and Metadate you know probably brings you to a more focused and also stable, you won't have the swings of extreme mood, like you said.  That you weren't as, you were more sensitive.  You over analyze and may have reacted to some things that you wouldn't have.  So what, what's the, what are you going to do this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'll be working again.  I uh, basically pick up trash in parking lots and stuff like that, and do maintenance, um basically driving around the metroplex wherever I'm told to go and stuff um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you work for a company that, that manages parking lots?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, uh actually my mom works for [NAME OTHER] as a department manager, so on all of her properties she hires my company to come in and uh basically make the center look nice.  And uh during the summer I go anymore if they need maintenance, fix it up if they need extra things like that, if uh, if, uh, well, it's commercial real estate, um, like strip centers and such, like a company were to up and leave, because they couldn't pay for their rent or whatever in a uh center, then I can go in and clean all that stuff out, take down shelves you know?  Trash whatever, so,</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And in the fall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um I'll be going to [NAME OTHER].  So, I don't know how that's going to work cause I probably will have 8 o'clock classes and I don't wake up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you going to live on campus up there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Eight o'clock classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm not sure what time because I'll probably, freshman don't usually get the earlier classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it sort of depends.  If you enroll early and you have a choice and you put your schedule together and 8 o'clock sections are open—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you can, you can have 8 o'clocks.  Uh I think 8 o'clocks for freshman probably's not going to happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think 9 o'clock is probably about as early as you can get started.  I mean just for your first semester give yourself,</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm really hoping I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, what will you be taking, general subjects?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably, I've already taken semester one and two college English at my school through [NAME OTHER] so I'll probably uh transfer those credits over and have those out of the way.  Um, usually you just need two years of English for basics so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Depends on your major.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm going to go into business and real estate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See it used to be, now this is ten years ago so, you had to take what was called freshman English which was a five hour course, five days a week.  And my freshman year was, my second semester of my freshman year was at 8 o'clock in the morning.  And it was just awful, cause I was up in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't, I can't wake up in the morning to get to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Apparently I was, I guess I was an early riser, anyway, so you, it usually depends on the school.  But if you have, and one major, because if you're, if you already did basic English and the other [INAUDIBLE] secondary composition and all that reading and writing and stuff, it depends.  Business?  Probably won't, you know basic English, so two if you've got two semesters, and if it is a credit hours or quarterly hours or however they do, but uh so you'll be taking some kind of history, some kind of math, some kind of government or political science or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But uh, do you know how many?  All right, will they say what number of hours there; I guess for basics to get done a little, we don't need that much English for business and real estate but uh.  How many semesters?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most, most schools when you think about um a coll, a course of college study, most bachelor's degrees are about 120 hours.  So it's about 30 hours per year, so 15 hours per ordinary semester and these are semester hours.  So 120, some of the engineering courses are 150 hours so it's a five year course.  But depending on what you're actually, architecture's higher, it was.  So if you think about taking 15 hours per semester or you take 14 one semester, 16 another.  But you're working and you take 12 and 12 and get a summer course, then you end up kind of keeping up with the pace of your class.  The basics usually are just two years, um by the end of your sophomore year you can declare a major, if you don't know what you want already.  If you know business and real estate, and finance and accounting.  You need accounting, you know basic business, your economics courses, you need the basic political science and history.  Some schools will have a course where I know when I was a freshman we had a course called social sciences which is a combination of government, local science and history all taught together, the course was taught on a historical basis, and you develop a concept of how the government developed and how the [INAUDIBLE] historical events were and so on.  That's, that's kind of our, but it depends on the school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just trying to figure out how much more English I'm going to have to take because I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well if you've had two courses in freshman English you probably won't have any more unless it's a [INAUDIBLE] requirement unless your credit doesn't transfer.  When do you see a counselor now about your coursework?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we have to go for uh orientation which is like three days, I have to sign up for that, then I guess that's when we're going to pick all our classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and your [INAUDIBLE] will guide you through the requirements.  You can get the catalog or, it's probably online I guess.  See back when I was a college freshman you didn't even have computers.  Well they had four tran and the card sorters you know?  Some of the engineer guys would be carrying around these big boxes of cards.  Now it's [INAUDIBLE] but the uh, the requirements will vary according to your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Also something else I've noticed about the Lamictal is, I don't know why or how or if I'm just imagining it but it's easier to focus at school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not surprised.  I think it probably helps, you mean when you think about taking the Lamictal plus Metadate?  Yeah.  Oh I think that's probably reasonable.  Yeah.  Good.  Okay well continue taking your meds.  Uh, probably see you in another, well let's see, this is May, probably another couple of months.  You'll be through orientation by then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um yeah.  I was also going to ask, I don't know how much it would make uh as far as maybe upping my dose of the Lamictal because uh you know as far as my being able to focus, cause I guess that was one of the main things that I saw was my sporadic behavior [INAUDIBLE] how do you know that 50 mg is helpful or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, the easiest way to do is it to just increase your dose to 300, cause you can go directly from, from um, um 200 to 300.  And so you just take one and half tablets and see how you do, if it seems to help then just let me know and we'll do a script.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Well yeah I was, I, so do you just want me to give you a call?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, just, just give me a call and let me know or just call.  Or when you, when you go to fill your prescription and you call your pharmacy they'll say well it's too early and you say, well we increased my dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then they'll call me and then I will you know take care of the details.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.  Yeah I recently had a sonogram of my thyroid, it was kind of weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.  Great.  That's all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.  And when did you say you want to see me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A few months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A few months.</p>

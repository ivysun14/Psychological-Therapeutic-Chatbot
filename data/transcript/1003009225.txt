<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good and bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  What's the good and what's the bad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, let's see.  I haven't seen you in a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's been 6 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, the good part, um, I guess most, mostly not great then.  Not bad -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But not great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, this menopausal stuff that's really just, put the screws to me in the last year -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And combined with my mom's death and my back and so forth and so on, it's just been a tough road -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not sleeping well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you having trouble getting to sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're just waking up during the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, yes, and I go to sleep at like 5:00, 6:00 at night now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Because you're so exhausted?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you go to sleep at 5:00 or 6:00, then what time do you wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eleven and I feel fully rested.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, you're getting 5 or 6 hours.  It's just way early.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it, and it's not, right, it's way early and it's not real, I sleep pretty good for like 3, 4 hours and then, you know, 10:00 or so I start wrestling and, you know, need to move to change positions so forth and get up and walk because of my back and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, what do you do when you wake up at 11:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I do chores around the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you get up and do things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mm, probably until about 1:00, 1:00 or 2:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And then you go back to bed -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Until about 5:30, 6:00, 6:30.  You know, I tried taking, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You should go over my notes and stuff.  I tried taking that, um, did I grab that?  That last, um, um, sleeping med that you gave me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's not work, when I got to, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Sonata?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it wasn't that.  Oh, darn it.  I brought the wrong med.  Oh, here it is.  Is that it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see.  Yes, that's a generic, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because they said that was, um, Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's zolpidem.  That's a little different.  They're similar sounding generic names, but they're different.  This 1 is Sonata.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Um, I don't, it's not, let's see, it doesn't make me groggy and go to sleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But when I do go to sleep, I stay asleep and then I'm not easy to wrestle up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With this, with the Sonata?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, it's supposed to wear off in about 4 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's lasting longer than that for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, maybe because I don't go to sleep right away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And I'm sorry, just tell me again, what time do you typically get up in the morning did you say?  Or wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Between, I like to be up around 6:00, 6:30 to feed the horses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Especially when it's cold out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, I was going to add up the chunks of time.  So, you're getting maybe, maybe 5 or 6 hours initially and then maybe another 5 hours later, so you're getting another 4 or 5.  So, maybe you're getting -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm not going to sleep every night at 5:00, 6:00 at night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But let's say 3 or 4, 3, definitely 3 nights a week I'll, I'll fall asleep -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like during the week -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Days and on the weekends I won't because we'll be busy with friends or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Family or what have you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, on those nights where you're busy with family, like on the weekends, how late will you stay up then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, elevenish, 10:00, 11:00, 10:00, 11:00 is pushing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And if you stay up until 10:00 or 11:00, then how long do you sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just a couple hours, just 2, 3 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And wake up again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I always get up between 1:00 and 2:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm always up at a certain, if I go sleep early, I'm up between 11:00 and 1:00.  If I go to sleep later, I'm up between like 1:00 and 2:00.  There's always that, you know, that 3, 4 hour window of sleep that I can get.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I'll wake up.  I don't know if it's pain or what's waking me up.  I really, when I wake up, it's, um, I definitely have to get out of bed and move, so maybe it's pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, um, I should probably start keeping a journal of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, it could be the pain waking you up, the pain in your back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Back, hips -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, lower, down the leg there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, and then when you do wake up in the morning, do you feel rested or do you feel tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It depends if I took that sleeping medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it depends upon what I, what medicine I took the night before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, if you did take the sleep medicine, then you do or don't feel rested?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I feel so groggy for most of the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  If you take that Sonata?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could probably sleep until 11:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have once or twice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  But you don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Figured I might as well go with it, you know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Didn't have anything going on anyhow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, if you don't take the Sonata, then you don't feel groggy in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, I feel pretty normal and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I do feel it during the day, so it's not when I wake up.  I, you know, I'll take cat naps during the day, like, um, I'll do a lot of chores between early morning until about 10:00 and then I'll sit down and like have some water and maybe a snack and then I'll doze off for a bit, like an hour or so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, maybe an hour?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, maybe an hour nap and how many of those do you take a day usually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The cat naps?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, just probably 1 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just 1?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I get 1 in the morning, like 1 in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, maybe 1 hour in the morning, maybe 1 hour in the afternoon about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I, if I sleep in the morning, I don't sleep in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's either or.  It's not both.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm looking at the clock trying to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Figure it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Look over your head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, so, about an hour a day of the cat nap then, sleep at night, and how, how many hours a night do you think you're averaging?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, if you add up the bits and pieces.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe 4 or 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Total?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Five is a good night, yeah.  So, I'll go back to bed at, you know, that 2:00 area and not go to sleep right away.  I'll read a bit and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't turn the television on, that's, I've, you know, taken good, um, heat from whatever sleep doctor that was.  Don't turn the television on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about, um, how about your appetite?  Has it been stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty much, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how has your mood, your spirits been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am very, um, moody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, moody as in sad or irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Irritable, grouchy, frustrated.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How is your ability to concentrate during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you having any anxiety?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Are you getting some enjoyment out of the things you're doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, any suicidal thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't think so.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's just like this hormonal imbalance.  I can just feel that I'm not right -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And are you on any hormones right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, and, you know, as soon as I figured out, you know, I've been reading, um, figuring out that this in not grief -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe, maybe it's combined or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] leaves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  So, do you have a new doctor yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a new pain guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Who's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] over on, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] in that spinal surgery -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Next to the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'm trying to think.  Oh, yes, yes, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, I saw him, her, I saw his physician assistant Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, great office.  She spent an hour and a half with us.  Um, and they want to start a whole new battery of tests and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cortisone shots and new medicines and I have, and I wanted to talk to you about some of the medicines since I think you know me better than they do on medicines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She wanted me to go on that Lyrica, Lyrical -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lyrica, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Lyrica, but that's more weight gain.  I can't do anymore weight gain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can be, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've gained weight this m, this year as it was, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, she put, she's going, I'm going to start, I want to talk to you first, I filled a Topamax -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  That's 1 actually that can decrease appetite more sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's usually pretty safe.  The only side effects that are a little more common, some people get tingling, like in their fingers, like when your arm falls asleep and wakes up, that tingling -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not that bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That severe or intense, but some people get some tingling, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She said nausea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Occasionally if it's, I haven't had a lot of people get nauseous, unless they go up on the dose too fast.  It's more just, sort of, a, it's lack of appetite almost.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not like people feel like they're going to throw up.  They just kind of aren't hungry -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that could happen.  Um, rarely some people get some, um, speech fluency issues, like they can think of the word, they just can't quite spit it out as fast they like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have that anyway.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, a lot of things can do that.  Um, but that usually isn't a terrible problem.  Not bad enough that people stop the medicine, but it's pretty well tolerated usually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So between that and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I'll start that tonight.  She gave me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Between that and Lyrica, I think that's the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A titration chart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she said, "Use my chart, not the bottle, because what they say on the bottle is completely different.  Then it's really a nice slow" -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Going up slowly reduces the risk of side effects, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, that's what she said too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, between that and Lyrica it might, and I don't prescribe Lyrica, I do prescribe Topamax for some people for other reasons -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I've had pretty good success with Topamax.  Most people tolerate it really well, but I've had a lot of people that were prescribed Lyrica that didn't do so well on that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So, you want to go through meds right now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since we're talking about them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were they starting the Topamax for pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, nerve pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That runs down my leg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I take, you know I take a, a Synthroid -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For hyp, hypothyroidism -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's, um, 88 mcg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eighty-eight, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I take trazodone.  I take 1 50 mg at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One 50 mg -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One 50 mg, yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At night.  Um, 2 blood pressure medicines, Cozaar and it's 100 mg and Caduet, which is like a cholesterol -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How do you spell Caduet, I'm not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> C A D U E T.  It's, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a cholesterol and water pill combined.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's 10 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too many medicines if you ask me.  Um, the clonazepam, the Klonopin -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take, um, depends on the night, usually it's 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Five mg.  No, 0.5 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Point 5, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> OxyContin, of course, 20 mg.  I take, um, 100 total a day.  Um, she filled an IR for me, an OxyContin, oxycodone IR which is instant for breakthrough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I rarely take it.  It's 5 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't taken it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just for when I overdo.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Topamax I'll start tonight and that's, um, 25 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And this is the end of the, oh, the, um, Sonata.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sonata, okay.  Are you still taking it or have you stopped it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't take it very regularly -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, you just prescribed that 6 months ago and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's not very much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have my 800 mg of ibuprofen -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For all the other issues that create from this other back stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, [INAUDIBLE] affecting the sleep, it's probably a combination of several things.  It sounds like you've got something called phase shifting, which means, instead of getting tired around 10:00 or 11:00 at night, you're getting tired around 5:00 or 6:00 at night and what that does, it, it shifts our sleep cycle into the earlier evening hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, the dilemma with that is that then we tend to wake up early and we can't sleep, like you're going through, and so we don't get a good continuous night's sleep.  Um, the recommended strategy for that is to kind of force ourselves to stay -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fight it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To stay, to do whatever we've got to do to try to stay awake -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it means getting up and walking around, anything short of using caffeine or stimulants -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.  I won't drink caffeine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yeah, because that, that gets into another vicious cycle, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you can kind of, if you can kind of do it slowly, like maybe an hour at night, like instead of 5:00 or 6:00, maybe stay up until 6:00 or 7:00 for a week and then 7:00 or 8:00 and you're not, that sometimes makes it a little bit easier.  But if you can push that back, you're more likely to have the good continuous night's sleep.  The other factors are probably the pain like you mentioned.  I mean, when we're hurting it's hard to sleep -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And second, the medications used to treat pain often interfere with sleep, which is a catch 22.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, if you don't take the medicine, then the pain wakes up.  If you do, then the medicine sometimes wakes you up.  So, it's a, it's a real tricky situation.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Combined with a hormone imbalance -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the thyroid and yeah, I'm a mess.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING]  Well, considering, I'd say you're doing pretty darn well.  So, um, the question is what can we do about it, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think we're working on the pain part.  She seems to be pretty hopeful.  I'm skeptical, been through all this before.  She's, you know, I told her that I have this nerve, um, uh, nerve damage and she seems like that's not right.  That doesn't sound right to her -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, she's going to look at my old MRIs, have, you know, show the doc, probably schedule a new MRI, certainly a new, a cortisone shot in about a week.  She was hoping to get it, a week or a week and a half because we're going to go out of town to Florida.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and then get like 4 of those in the next few months.  I guess you can have 4 a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're going to do that on your back or lower back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She thinks there's some sort of compression and that's going to, um, reduce the inflammation and things like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, if that works that'd be wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've had it before and it didn't.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  And did they ever come up with an explanation before of why you were having the pain?  Was it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was a car accident.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but I mean, was there like, um, did they think it was a compressed nerve or did they, disk -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, yeah, the disk.  I had, I had back surgery in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In '97 and they did a diskectomy and a laminectomy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that should've relieved the pressure on the nerve.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did it go away ever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The surgery was successful in that, you know, they took the disk and let it out and pushed the breast back in, but from what I was told by the, um, neuro guy, the neurosurgeon that did the surgery, um, that the nerve was just pinched off to the [INAUDIBLE] and it was never going to, it was a more of a chemical, um, reaction -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In addition to the compression -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he thought -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So when it was relieved, the nerve was still just damaged.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he thought it would continue using these signals, the pain signals.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it does, it, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Um, well, I'm thinking, the other challenge we have before us is that the more we increase your medicine to sleep at night, the more groggy you're going to be the next day, which we don't want.  Well, with some of them, especially the longer acting ones.  Now that's why it's kind of strange the Sonata is doing this because it's suppose to be out of your system in 4 hours -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I suspect since you're still tired in the morning, for some reason it's not getting metabolized, [PATIENT NAME], the way it normally would and other medicines sometimes can interfere with metabolism of other medicines.  So, it may be that's part of the reason.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus my metabolism is so messed up anyways and I have a very sensitive metabolism to boot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so the question is, what do we do?  I mean, we, we probably don't want to go up on the Klonopin because it stays around your system so long anyway -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That that'll definitely make you tired the next day.  Trazodone isn't as bad usually.  We could go a little bit up on the trazodone.  Um, you said you're taking 50 most nights?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the maximum is 400 if you can imagine that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most of us, if we took that much, we'd be sleeping 24/7, but we certainly could try 75 or 100 if you want to, because it's a good one for helping people stay asleep and it doesn't usually carry over to the morning hours.  Have you ever tried going higher on the trazodone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think initially.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was a few years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  If you want to try again, we sure could.  That'd be a safe thing to do and the trazodone, there's no tolerance that develops over time.  So, if it works now, it'll keep working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It won't stop working.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then with combined some of this pain relief -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That they're going to try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So maybe a phase shift, relief pain, and maybe a little more trazodone, maybe we'll get you sleeping through the night, which will also help with healing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and, and well, I'm going to go find a deal this week.  That's my project for, well, this week is over almost, but certainly ASAP and get this under control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a good idea.  Any ideas who you're going to see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  I have a list of people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I called [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  He's not accepting new patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he's filled up.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, the trick is to find someone that accepts, picks up my insurance and new patients -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's kind of a double whammy there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's really a problem as far as your doctors I guess -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard to get in, so, okay.  Well, do you want to try going up on the trazodone to see if that would help?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to, um, what, what, what will this Topamax do?  Anything with that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It probably won't affect your sleep directly.  It's not sedating typically -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But yeah, with, uh, that's a good point.  If you're going to be starting that, you may not want to adjust another medicine at the same time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it reduces your pain though, you might be able to sleep better.  So, indirectly it may help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, do you want to just try that first and see how it goes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's reasonable.  And then if you decide you want to between now and whenever we meet again, you certainly can go up a little bit on the trazodone if you want, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Um, is that, and, um, oh, shoot, it just flew right out of my head.  Oh, geez.  [LAUGHING]  Oh, she wanted to also, and I can't remember the name of it and it sounded like America, it's, um, a muscle relaxer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, am, begins with A, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It sounds like it's got America in it.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'm not sure what that is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's, um, a, it's a time release -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so that I would take it at 6:00 in the morn, something that it would kick in again at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning and help my legs relax and things of that nature to keep me asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So she's kicking that around too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wish I could remember that name of the medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, she said she may start you on that or she did give you a prescription for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she might.  We're -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We're thinking about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I said, "Well, it's not, you know, I mean, geez."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you got a lot already.  If anything, it'd be nice to be able to back off some, so you're not on so many.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we're hoping to get me off the OxyContin -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That'll be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my hope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That'll be great in the long run, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went in there just to get someone, you know, I didn't expect all this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To be honest with you, I'm kind of a little taken back by it all and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I was very, I didn't sleep the first couple nights after I got back from seeing them because I wasn't expecting to go through all that again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was quite a rigmarole to be up and down, you know, pain wise, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, you get an injection and then it, that hurts, I mean, that's just a painful little dude there and then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A couple 3 days and you're supposed to get better and then it doesn't and then I'm down and so then I get back again and they want to try it again.  [LAUGHING]  You know, it's just this rollercoaster ride.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I understand.  Um, yeah, we, so we want to be careful not to overdo either -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you're going to be going through plenty, it sounds like, with that office and I hope they get your pain under control.  Because, yeah, the OxyContin long term has just awful side effects so it'll be great -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my hearing's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hearing goes, uh, teeth go -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Teeth are hanging in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Uh, what else?  I've seen people have kidney problems over time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's just, it's scary over time.  So, yeah, if they can find an alternative that's safe in the long run that'd be great.  Well, good.  Okay.  Anything else going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other than my son keeps getting in car accidents.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, no.  Is he okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, he's fine.  He just gets in these bumper thingies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fender bender kind of things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's had 2 tickets and 2 fender benders in, since September.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so he's, every time he goes out and the phone rings, I mean sends me sailing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [PATIENT NAME], one other thought I just had is right now we don't have you on an, on an antidepressant -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not that we have to put you on one.  Um, the Topamax, in some people, has some mood stabilizing properties.  It's not an antidepressant.  Some people find their mood is a little more level with it though.  So, again, we might reevaluate.  I'm not excited about putting you on an antidepressant with everything else going on right now -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if you feel strongly you need 1, we can talk about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel the need for an antidepressant right now or do you want to wait and see how the Topamax does?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I want to wait and, and see what happens with, when, once I finally get into a doc and get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All the testing, you know, the hormones and so forth and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Figure that all out and see if there's a, I think there's a pretty good correlation with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, I think that's a wise choice rather than just adding in more to the mix.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which could just confuse things even more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll end up overdosing on something.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's, it's just, and also there's the, the increased risk of interactions or side effects the more medicines you're on.  You're on a slew of them, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, let's wait and see.  Get, you can get in to see a primary care DO and get some tests done and see if you maybe you need hormone replacement therapy.  That can help with mood too -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that can also help with sleep sometimes and if not, if they can get the pain under control and if those things are better and you're still feeling depressed, then at that point we could -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At least consider -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What else we can do to get you feeling better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I was thinking too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's sounds reasonable to me too.  Okay.  Anything else going on that we haven't talked about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Shew, that's plenty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING]  The economy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, oh, boy.  That's enough to stress someone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My, my poor husband retires and the economy tanks and there goes half our, our retirement -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A lot of our travel plans just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's it.  I know a lot of people had to cancel trips.  I know people that have actually had to come out of retirement because they had -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's thinking about going back to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, a lot of people, you know, had counted on a certain income -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All of a sudden it's, some of that's gone now and they just can't, you know, can't live on what they'd expected they were going to have -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or what they, they thought that had, were going to have was enough and what they have now is not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We'll be to able to buy groceries and things of that nature, but, you know, we're not going to go to Greece or anything like that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The stuff that we had -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is too bad.  So, you said he was thinking about going back to work possibly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What would he do?  Does he know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He'll go back to, um, contracting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Government contracting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He liked it and he was, he was pretty good at it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Well, for a lot of men, they're, sometimes men are happier working anyway than being retired.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think he will be because I'm tired of him managing the manure.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING]  Literally, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Putting it from here to over there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  Let's see.  Let's check on refills too.  The Klonopin, did 6 months worth in December so we're good there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'm good, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The trazodone, I think [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I think was -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Prescribing that.  Do you still see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't and do you think I should go see him or wait until a lot of this gets sorted out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it was me, I'd, I'd wait until this got sorted out because I think otherwise you're going to have somebody else changing more medicines -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And doing more things that's just going to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be, to me it would feel like it'll be a little confusing and overwhelming.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think reasonable to attack 1 thing at a time.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good.  Anything else then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lastly then I'm thinking, when should we check back again?  We went 6 months this time.  Did that feel okay or did it feel too long or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It did feel a little too long, only because of, you know, what all I'm going through and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's been kind of abnormal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Do you want set something in 2 or 3 months this time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, 3 months.  Let's try 3 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can always call -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you need something sooner than that even.  So, so, let's see, that'll put us in April.  Uh, is there a day of the week that works best for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's when, [INAUDIBLE] April.  Oh let's see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, there's a lot of options.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I took a big chunk and volunteered to chair this ride in May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I've been pretty busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know what kind of busy I'm going to be yet, so middle of the week would probably be the best.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And morning or afternoon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Morning is good.  I'm an early bird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about something like, we could do Wednesday [DATE] like at, uh, I've got 11:00 or we could do something earlier than that if you'd prefer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, earlier is better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see.  Well, we can do that morning.  I've got, actually, it's wide open, so you can pick your time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What time do you start?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eight is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, 8:00 on the [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want a card too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't need it unless you've already written it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  No, not yet.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Save some paper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So, [PATIENT NAME], again, if you're not sleeping better and things, other things aren't getting sorted out, feel free to call me.  Okay?  Or if you feel, start feeling more depressed, I don't want you to slip backwards in terms of depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, and I do, I do, you know, sometimes feel I am depressed but then, you know, the next day I'm bouncing around and things like that.  I do feel that it's a lot of hormonal imbalance -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From what I've been reading and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Researching on the internet and stuff and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, if a bad day here or there, that's okay.  If you start stringing a bunch of them together or then weeks, then let me know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we don't want you to go back into that depression.  That's just awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, as you know better than anyone.  So, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  You're welcome.  Take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.  Did you have a good holiday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was okay, thanks.  How was yours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  All right.  See you later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bye.</p>

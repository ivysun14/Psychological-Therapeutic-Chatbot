<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh gosh. So my in-law visit wasn't as bad as it could've been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the very end, I kind of had to coach Mike into doing something that seemed kind of manipulative and wrong but needed to be done. Which was to tell them, more or less — because I could tell that whenever Mike isn't acting completely catatonically depressed, they think that everything is fine. Explain that I really appreciated them coming and visiting, it really cheered me up, but I've been very depressed. They're like "Oh, you're still depressed. You seemed okay." It's like yeah, you kind of put a good face on things when people are coming to visit, but that's really about it.</p>

<p>[00.55.8]</p>

<p>I always felt awkward telling him that he needs to do this. Not that he should do this because (inaudible at 1:01.3) you know, that kind of thing. Like I said, it's just an awkward thing. But they're weird, to say the least. In terms of they — I just don't get them sometimes. But they had been somewhat nice to me, which was good. For the most part ignored me, but thus far, they were somewhat nice to me.</p>

<p>[01:48.8]</p>

<p>As expected, there was not enough time for them to do what they wanted to do, but that's okay. In the end, we were supposed to get back together just before they left that night because we sort of left each other at 4 p.m. When we called [after a nap] they were like "Yeah, we're really too tired to get back together at 7 or 8." So that was really hard for Mike. So that was less than 24 hours visiting, but whatever. That was kind of, like I said, sort of a little bit of a downer. But at least we got our house clean for it.</p>

<p>They mentioned in passing that they hadn't been to Mike's sister's house for more than a year, possibly longer than that, because of the fact that she is not tidy. I guess they had made some sort of comment and therefore they got disinvited from coming over. But at the same time, that's perfectly okay because they put in a pool for the grandchildren, so you know.</p>

<p>[03:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So their grandchildren are always going there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's just such a darn bizarre awkward world to talk to them. Like trying to pick a place to go to dinner, not knowing — like, they are so, their finances are very weird. I mean, they will do things like have an actual honest-to-God saltwater pool, a boat, horses which are very expensive to care for. But yet $55 a person for dinner on Mother's Day was kind of like — they were really hesitant on that. But yet at the same time, even though they did, they still ordered lots of wine. But it went on our credit card, so I don't know whether or not Mike is ever going to have the balls to actually ask them for the money. You know what I mean? They do this strange card of affordability, yet not, you know? So I don't know. We'll see.</p>

<p>[04:06.5]</p>

<p>I haven't been down there in years, so I had no idea they put an addition on the house. They're like "Oh yeah, a pool of saltwater, so you should come out." I'm like "Saltwater? You're kidding me. Don't people just go to the ocean for that?" They're like "You'll like it. It will be much more buoyant." I'm like "That's great." Who knows.</p>

<p>But they're done, they're gone, which is good. His littlest brother apparently met someone who they think is going to redeem him. They kept insisting on how they're trying not to tell him how much they really like her so he doesn't get rid of her. They've been together for two years. I don't get this. So he's going to meet her family this summer. I mean, they're serious but they don't want to talk about being serious. I don't get that.</p>

<p>[05:02.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, you mean Mike is going this summer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, his little brother is going to go to be with his girlfriend's family. But the way they keep saying it, it's such a bizarre thing like they're afraid of scaring him off or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. After they've been together for two years.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So who knows. But at least they're gone and it's done, and that means that the physical drain will be done. I was pretty good about the fact that there was a point at which I was trying to go out with them somewhere, and halfway through getting ready I was exhausted. I said "Guys, I can't do this. I will see you when you're done going out or whatever." I didn't want to strand Mike too much, because he gets really awkward sometimes. But yet, I really needed the rest.</p>

<p>[06:03.9]</p>

<p>So that was sort of at least a little bit of a compromise. So that's pretty much my week in a nutshell. I think I'm going to try to transfer into a position closer to the city and see. I know of one that's open which is actually harder to get to than you'd think. It sounds strange because if there's one open that's actually closer because I'm on the other side of it. So I would have to take a bus into the city to swap for the other Line to come back to get there. So it's actually easier. That's strange. But I figure that I might be able to do that, we'll see.</p>

<p>[07:04.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either one is easier than that one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. At the very least — I just don't do suburbs very well. I've been very good about it, but I'm just not into the suburbs. I like being in the city. It energizes me. So there's that and just in general, I'm probably going to try and put some feelers out for some other work-related things that aren't so physically hard on me. We'll see. I need to see whether I'm feeling up for it right now, but I think I might. I will probably always work for Microsoft, at least a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think you want to try something else as well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it would be nice to just get out of it for a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have in mind?</p>

<p>[07:55.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing yet. Just thinking about it. I mean, I work 12 hours a week now, so moving it down to less than that isn't all that much harder. So we'll see. But that's been pretty much it. My energy is really really low lately. I haven't been feeling too great. And I find a lot of stress sort of all around me. I'm sort of being easily frustrated in situations, and I kind of feel bad because I kind of lost my temper over things that make no sense at all. I can't think of any particular ones, just little things like "Oh my God, I thought you would get stuff out of the dryer" kind of stuff.</p>

<p>[08:53.7]</p>

<p>I can't believe this is actually a concern of ours, but we were worried that our landlords might not want us any longer, so therefore we didn't want to lose our place. But we do now have our lease waiting to renew, so that's good. I don't think I can handle another move. I have had situations where I have had landlords, due to the fact that they wanted to get somebody else in there, someone they knew or something like that, and they're just terminating the lease. Or that it's so expensive that it's not possible. So it's nice to be able to have that. One less thing to have to deal with.</p>

<p>Yeah, like I said, most of it is just exhaustion and life, you know? I wish I had — I don't even know what to talk about because my energy is so low. I don't even know what to say. But I'm here.</p>

<p>[10:03.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what pops into your head about whatever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a very good question. I've sort of been thinking about that, and I've pretty much talked about the things that popped into my head, really. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That pretty much sums it up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm pretty vacant right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you in a lot of pain at the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like how much on a scale of one to 10?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm somewhere in the eights right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Can you concentrate on much else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Sometimes. It varies. Not very well. It does make me really flakey in terms of that. I sort of only have two modes. I'm either flakey or I'm mean. Luckily I'm not mean right now. I haven't been mean in a while.</p>

<p>[11:02.1]</p>

<p>At my old store when I was having a lot of chronic pain and I was walking with my cane — I don't know whether I mentioned this or not — but I had the nickname Dr. House. (chuckles) And the thing that was even weirder was when the customers started calling me that. I'm like "Great. Now my internal kind of snarky nickname — I mean, I'm now being called that by customers." I wasn't angry about it, I was just like "Oh my gosh, this has gone so pervasive."</p>

<p>But that's been pretty much the big thing. (pause) Yeah. I'm not very good at coming up with things so much. Usually this would be the end of my workweek, but I actually have stuff going on all the rest of this week.</p>

<p>[12:07.1]</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm assisting with — somebody I have been informally mentoring is doing her own custom workshop. I'm going to be there to assist in the event of all the ridiculous and silly emergencies that never really, you know. That way she doesn't have to leave to do this. If the sound system goes down. She's never used it before. That kind of stuff. So I'll be in for that.</p>

<p>And then Thursday and Friday, I think I'm in the city. I have a training thing for (inaudible at 12:42.3), so I think I'm going to be in the city for that. Most people don't know this, but across from the store, there's a secret Microsoft training center right above. So I should be there both days, which — I mean, yes it's tiring, but it's not that bad because it's more sedentary.</p>

<p>[13:02.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You don't have to deal with customers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Customers too. But also, I'm not moving around a lot. Even right now when I had a couple of people doting on me today — not everybody, but there are a couple of people who go out of their way like "You stay there. I'll get this for you." Even above and beyond that, I was all over the place. I always am, and so it becomes really painful. Whereas if we're going to be in a training conference room kind of thing, it will be a lot easier, which is nice. So, that's really been —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what hurts today?</p>

<p>[13:47.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's my leg. The joint in my hip, the ball joint, gets inflamed. It swells up, and then there's a whole cascade of other things because there's no room for anything else. So other things get pinched, and other things get pinched, so it gets very — the more I can stay off — now most of the time with rheumatoid arthritis, moving around is good for you, for the most part. First thing in the morning, you're not supposed to because you still don't have whatever acid is inside your body —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lactic acid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not lactic acid, but one similar to that. But you're not supposed to move around too much until it gets in your circulatory system. But it just becomes this giant cascading process. So they went and they gave me a steroid shot which I wasn't really thrilled about. This is the first time I've actually had it where they didn't use a fluoroscope, which made me extremely nervous, which meant that I tighten my muscles and hurt myself. Well, not really hurt myself, but it could have been a lot less painful later on. Normally they use a fluoroscope which is like an x-ray that's live. You know how in cartoons they always show x-rays and you can see things moving through that?</p>

<p>[15:09.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Don't they use a dye for a fluoroscope?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't always have to, but they can. But usually they do that. The dye is so they can see if certain nerves are already active or not. At least they can see where they're injecting it. But this doctor did not, and so I've never — I'm like "I'm just going to trust that you get this into the joint in the right way," which made me more nervous. If you tense things up, you're more likely to have soft tissue damage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And they were putting the steroids in your hip?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have they helped much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not yet, but it could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It takes longer than a few days to —</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. Every doctor is different. My old one back home, what he would do, because he used to work in sports medicine and he himself was an athlete, he mixed a combination of a long-dose steroid with a short-dose steroid with lidocaine also in it so when it went in, the muscle didn't burn.</p>

<p>[16:13.0]</p>

<p>This particular doctor did not. He's just a straight-up orthopedic. I didn't realize until just now that his clientele is mostly the elderly, that kind of thing. So it's all long-dose, and I just need to stay off of it and wait for a little bit and see how it goes. To be honest, it's all about technique, and it's all about how different doctors have different ways they do it, what they're comfortable with. So this guy told me he's been doing this for 40 years, he doesn't need a fluoroscope, and that's fine. I'm sure he got it in the right place. [They flooded it], you know. I'd be more freaked out if they were doing it in my back, because that's where the spinal cord (inaudible).</p>

<p>[17:03.3]</p>

<p>So I get to make the joke about the fact that there is more than one pain in my back end, with my in-laws and with getting the shot. (pause) Pretty much after I leave this, I'm going to go to sleep because I need to be super happy and perky and give the right amount of — I'm already getting a lot of push-back from the wrong people in my life right now. I spend a lot of time really trying to make people that I work with believe in themselves, such that when there's push-back from other people, they actually think "Oh, well, Debra helped me do this." As opposed to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to not being more confident that they know what they're doing?</p>

<p>[18:01.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but also they go back and they tell the powers that be that "I couldn't have done this without her." So I spend a long time getting people on their own feet, which is important. (pause) But it can be rough. But, you know, one person at a time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like there are people around looking out for you? I mean, you're talking about having to deal with your in-laws, having to help Mike, having to sort of do for yourself in terms of —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that there's a couple of people in my life who want to, and they are not very helpful. But not that there is anybody who is now. (pause) I feel like I'm the only person who is looking out for me right now.</p>

<p>[19:05.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that's quite lonely in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's my impression that you don't tend to ask for, or aren't necessarily always so easy about, people looking out for you. You could really use it right about now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could. To be honest, you know, sometimes when you ask for help, you have to take it on their terms. And sometimes their terms are less than what I can really handle, you know? And so I just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That also means it's not ideal help.</p>

<p>[20:00.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, if it's really going to be help as in "help," it should be on your terms I would think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or at least somewhere in the middle. (pause) That's pretty much — yeah. I mean — (pause) Oh gosh. It depends. Mike helps me out a lot with a lot of the mundane things in life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like day-to-day kind of stuff?</p>

<p>[20:45.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Day-to-day stuff, yeah. It's more the bigger things, you know. (pause) I'm not really sure if I know enough about what I need to be able to ask for help, you know? The problem is I don't really know. To be able to ask for help, I don't know what I need. (pause) I'm not really sure I can outsource most of my life day-to-day. But maybe. I just need to be able to quantify the things I need help with, that kind of stuff. (pause) But in terms of taking care of pets, being able to make sure we have groceries, that kind of thing, day-to-day stuff like that, he definitely does a lot.</p>

<p>[22:05.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have to be the same tasks that are mundane that have been done over and over again, because he's not very good at picking up new tasks. But for the most part, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about talking about how things are going?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We do talk. (pause) The problem is, he's really depressed. (pause) We've talked about this a lot. Many times when we have situations where we're just — (pause) There's nothing that can be done, but sure enough you want to talk about it. Outside of each other, neither one of us can — we don't have very many people in our lives that we can just do that. They don't know how to handle "There's nothing you can do, but I just need to talk to you about this."</p>

<p>[23:04.4]</p>

<p>They want to say "Oh, have you tried this? Have you tried that?" It's like "Yeah, I have. I appreciate this but I'm not looking for problem solving. I'm looking to dump this on somebody." (pause) Another skill that neither one of our mothers is especially good at. But also, just other people in our lives. My mom would love for me to turn my life over to her to run, and it would really drive me up — I mean, I get along with her just fine. It's just that they're very different worlds. Our priorities are very different. (pause)</p>

<p>[24:04.2]</p>

<p>But that's been pretty much the big thing, I guess. I don't know. I just feel — I'm just exhausted with life. I really am. I need some downtime. (pause) Hopefully I will soon. I need something happy and fun to do, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have anything in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been thinking about — now this is the problem. A lot of the things I would like to try and do this summer are kind of things I'm a glutton for punishment about. I'd like to try and take some sort of a class. I would like to because I want to be able to move abroad. Like picking up another language would be nice. I think I told you that I suck at languages, though I keep trying, going back and back to it.</p>

<p>[25:07.7]</p>

<p>I would like to learn how to draw better. I'm extremely bad at artistic endeavors when it comes to actual drawing and sculpting, that kind of thing. Especially drawing. So I would like that, but I'm not sure if I am just going to be really frustrated with it. I'm a perfectionist on many things. These are things though that I've actually realized I'm terrible at, so even if I am able to just be okay —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The bar is not super high.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (chuckles) I'm trying to decide whether or not to try — the problem is, I keep going back to the same three languages that I suck at. So I was thinking about one or two other ones. I'm trying to pick up perhaps French, which might be helpful. The only problem is that I really sucked at Latin, so it might be kind of harder.</p>

<p>[26:20.8]</p>

<p>And then the other one is Japanese, which is going to sound like "Wow, that's totally a glutton for punishment" but when they teach Japanese, you learn it in different stages. Unlike when I learned Russian. The first thing I needed to do was learn the Cyrillic alphabet, which I actually knew before I even started taking it. In Japanese, you don't start reading kanji until years in. You learn phonetic Japanese first. So it might be helpful, we'll see. Everything is pronounced as it is. It is a neural (ph) language. There is no hard "i", there's only soft "i," that kind of stuff. So it might be okay, I don't know.</p>

<p>I try to decide whether or not something is super — the problem is, I'm concerned because everyone says it's daunting, that it might be hard. I don't know. I don't necessarily know unless I try at least a little bit. We'll see. I would like to try to take something artsy or different as a concept, because I really don't feel like I have enough of a creative outlet.</p>

<p>[27:48.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you miss that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never really had much of one. I had play (ph) amounts of them, but not that much. I would like to have at least a little bit. (pause) It would at least be a distraction. (pause) So it's been, like I said, just trying to think about ways to make summer be more pleasurable. (pause) But aside from that — I'm sorry I seem really all over the place. I really just have an empty mind for a lot of this today.</p>

<p>[28:44.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why you sound pretty worn down. It's like you're in a lot of pain. Somewhat despairing. (pause) [And just sorting this on your own.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you said not in terms of the day-to-day stuff, which it sounds like Mike helps out with a lot, but in terms of what this is actually like for you, and having people to talk with about that.</p>

<p>[29:43.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the things that actually is really hard for me, being the mechanically-adept person — we're both research orientated and both of us can talk about turbulent flow, that kind of stuff. But when it comes to like "Okay, so if we're going to make a table, what do we need to know and where do we need to have joints?" and things like that. That stuff. Or rewiring the house or something like that. Being the only mechanically-adept person in our family, who is slowly losing their physical ability, is really frustrating.</p>

<p>I've been teaching him some electrical wiring, which is good. It's just things like — there are projects that seem like they never actually happen. They never actualize because sometimes it's hard for him to visualize how to do something. (pause)</p>

<p>[30:52.0]</p>

<p>I don't want it to be a matter of strife. I don't want to be the person directing and saying "No, no, no. You have to do this or that." And so it feels like I have a very limited amount of time to be able to help him. And I know he feels bad because he didn't learn this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>And even on that level, when we were at dinner and Mike's father mentioned something just off-the-cuff about — oh, that's right. We have some candlesticks that are made from copper piping that we've done, and he had mentioned something about pipe-fitting and how it's used, instead of soldering it, which is what we did because I solder. But what they actually do is, plumbers heat the one pipe that much hotter, put the other one in, and let it cool down. Now, that's great. We were asking a question about sweating it, I think that's what they called it.</p>

<p>[31:53.6]</p>

<p>Anyway, Mike's father said that Mike's grandfather knew much more about that and how he regrets that he never learned anything. It's like "You know, you didn't exactly pass down any family lore to Mike since he's never actually run a lawnmower, and he doesn't know the difference between ground and neutral until I met him." (chuckles) So much for that. I didn't say that because it would've been wrong. (pause)</p>

<p>But I feel like I have this double standard because I say to Mike things like "It's a shame that you didn't have a father to teach you to do these kinds of things." But then I didn't either. But I learned a lot of them, or at least I thought through some of them. I'm not sure if I'm being unfair in saying that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>[32:50.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is that you had a lot of other prerequisite things for being able to go out and learn on your own such as parents who, in other ways, were very interested and supportive and excited about what you were doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except for the fact that neither one of them —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm well aware they couldn't wire their way out of a —</p>

<p>CLIENT: God gave me to them so they could put together IKEA furniture. That's the only reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess my point is they were excited about you. They were excited about you being able to do this for them. They were focused on you. You know what I mean? You know, all that kind of stuff that makes you feel like "Okay, I'm interested and I'm going to do it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: And quite frankly, when I was doing all this stuff, my dad would talk about Tesla. Like he may not know how to do anything like the DC versus the AC stuff, but he would talk about in terms of historical stuff. So he was very supportive on that level. So at least on some level, that's true.</p>

<p>[33:52.5]</p>

<p>There's something they really didn't like me to do because they were worried about me getting hurt. But mostly I just didn't tell them until it was done, and they were impressed. I was never really in that much trouble over it. I knew if I gave them time to think about it, they would have said no. But yeah, that's true. Maybe they didn't know how to do anything at all in terms of that, but they were supportive in letting me. [Do you think this goes to how I learned these things?]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just imagine how it felt to be a child in your house, just very —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Empowering.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, very empowering and very different than what it felt like to be a kid in Mike's house. And that accounts much more so than — I mean, it sounds like he potentially had the aptitude, he sounds really smart and he's good at figuring things out, when he had a mind to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was ignored.</p>

<p>[34:46.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. He just wasn't in the kind of setting that helped him do that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing that also sort of makes me have pangs about that kind of thing is the fact that whenever I talk — I don't feel like I had a lonely childhood as an only child. But whenever I talk to them about just very random things, I always come out of the conversation making it seem like my childhood was really lonely and kind of sad, which makes me feel sad about things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I never get that impression when you describe your childhood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No, that's the thing. I was talking about the fact that the place I buy Mike's shirts from is actually on [inaudible] Street which is part of the Row. Whenever I go down there, I tell them stories about being a child on the Row where my dad went to get suits every year or two.</p>

<p>It was not anything in any way pretentious, but it was fun because you're a small child and you're in this tailor's area and the fascinating world around that. Or talking about the fact that I knew how to get from the courthouse to certain buildings in the city because of this or that. Or like the fact that I occasionally (inaudible at 36:15.9) my homework. Somehow, coming out of these conversations, they made it seem like "Oh, that's so sad that it was just you and that your parents put you through this kind of stuff. How lonely to be a child in a different country hanging around the Row."</p>

<p>I had to teach one of the people down at [inaudible]. But I was just mentioning this in passing when we were there, and they thought it was really amusing to hear the stories about a little kid going there. Not that particular store, but in that area and how it's very much not like what people think of when they think of high-end retail.</p>

<p>[36:54.3]</p>

<p>It's really salt-of-the-earthy because, quite frankly, they're — the shirts don't have cuffs or collars on them when you get them. You pick your cuff and collar when you get them, and they put them on you because you might have a different length sleeve, stuff like that. And to me, that was fascinating as a kid, just watching that and watching this grown-up world. But I guess I sort of get talked into thinking that having to watch this grown-up world was often isolating and very alone. And I never feel that way except when I'm with them. It's kind of weird.</p>

<p>[37:38.9]</p>

<p>I do know that although my stepmother-in-law — these are so confusing, this terminology they seem to make these days — although she is an only child, she does believe that only children have stunted growth socially. It's not her fault. Before she was born, her dad died in war so there was no choice on her part. But she is of this belief of birth order, that only children grow up emotionally strange. I don't know. I don't even know how to begin to describe it because it's so uncomfortable to talk about.</p>

<p>I do believe that we are different types of people. We have confidence in doing things that other people do not. Like I talked to most of the board of Microsoft. Why? Because they're just people. Those boundaries are not noticeable to me. That kind of stuff. But I never really thought about my life as being lonely, because of that.</p>

<p>[38:50.2]</p>

<p>But at the same time — I don't know. The differences in the way each of us grew up is just really confusing sometimes. They did tell us some things that are really kind of disturbing in general, like there's a mini Mike in the making back home. Mike's sister's kids, the middle child is a boy, and he apparently can't make any decisions for himself. He actually has to turn to one of his sisters to ask them what he wants. Amongst other invisible rules. Like "I can't write about this because the teacher doesn't know this friend," that kind of thing. So that's kind of disturbing. They think it's kind of cute and quaint. I don't think it's quaint at all.</p>

<p>[39:44.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gosh, it sounds like they have such completely different reads on the significance or the emotional tone of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess they have to because they have to deal with it on a regular basis, and you have to find some sort of — because they keep insisting how sweet it is that he's so close to his sisters. He's got one older, one younger. Because he's so tight with them, and that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That may be nice, but if he's doing this concerning stuff like —</p>

<p>CLIENT: He will not be separated from them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and they don't have to like it. There are ways of worrying about your grandkids.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is, each one of us sees the other person's family as being not strange but deeply dysfunctional, and that's where the conflict happens. What do you do when each one thinks — not that there are different ways of raising children and things like that, but each one of us sees the other person's family as so screwed up.</p>

<p>[41:03.2]</p>

<p>And I can't help but feel I'm in the right, but not completely in the right, you know? I'm sure I had an unusual upbringing, but it was the right thing for me. If I had been a different type of kid, maybe they would have done things differently, but they knew it was the right thing for me. (pause) I don't know how to — I mean, I can't even begin to explain the rest of my feelings about my nieces and nephews because I haven't seen them in a long time. A really really long time.</p>

<p>Though, like I said, I am distressed about hearing about this, that Aiden (ph) is not like — I'm very distressed that he feels like he can't be separated from them, and that he doesn't have any free will, and that he has all kinds of invisible rules about things that he must do. That sounds an awful lot like Mike.</p>

<p>[42:14.1]</p>

<p>And Mike actually said something along the lines of "I wouldn't know anything about having two women telling me what to do all the time while I was growing up." They made that joke about it, but still.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They had, you said, really no sense at all about Mike's depression —</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't have any sense at all, ever, about Mike. They don't realize that Mike puts on a good face for everything. Quite frankly, when you have guests coming to town, you kind of do that. It's not an unnatural feeling to do that. And maybe he isn't depressed that very second, but that doesn't mean that overall he isn't. I just don't understand, first of all, how she's supposedly a clinician and at the same time, has such a blind eye to her own family.</p>

<p>[43:23.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now, but we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, we are on again for tomorrow. I forgot about that. Thank you. I know I would be reminded in my phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Need a hand with the door?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you get that alright?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Luckily old skills.</p>

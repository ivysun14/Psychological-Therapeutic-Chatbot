<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I had sort of a strange reaction when I saw that you were out telephoning when I came in.  Because on the one hand, I wanted to see what you were doing and on the other hand I didn't, I wanted to pretend you weren't there, or not pay any attention because it upset me that you were there.  To s—, again, I suppose to see you in another context.  And I had had something I wanted to do when I came up but I almost used it, or turned to it so that I could sort of shut out the fact that you were out there.  And, and then in a way I was curious.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you stifled your curiosity?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, because it upset me too much just still to uhm see you in any other context, really, except right here.  And I don't know whether it's a feeling that if I know more about what you do when I'm not here, then it will make me feel somewhat envious because you're sharing your time with other people or whether it's simply that I can't handle thinking of your being anything except the way you are right here with me.  (Pause) Or if you'll do something that then I will bring to here, I don't —  (Silence)</p>

<p>And something that just occurred to me like this afternoon when I was surprised that I wasn't aware of it right when you asked the question, since I realize now I often react this way when you ask a question but, when I was talking about my parents' probable reaction to knowing I was having analysis and you said, oh you haven't told them yet.  Uhm.  It just occurred to me that in a way my reaction was uh, sort of underneath everything else, that you expected that I would have told them, and that in a, that suggested to me that I should have told them or that you expected that I will and that I should.  And it wasn't tha—, I didn't realize it at the time and when it occurred to me later it was just because it was just kind of a vague thing underlying my thinking and that's all I could figure out that it was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That was last evening, or today?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yesterday I think.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yest—, no that it occurred to you, I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh today.  And I can't think now why.  I wasn't thinking about that particular thing so I don't know why it did.  I think I just felt some kind of a, uhm uncomfortable feeling in a way.  So that it made me go back to the question you asked, and ho—, and what I said and what I was thinking and what more I should think.  And that's often the way I might, I react to questions that you ask.  That I'll say one thing and then I'll start thinking in a different way; or have some kind of an uncomfortable feeling that I haven't realized something, I haven't seen something that I should.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As though I'm again telling you something you ought to be doing different.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Or that you think it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And I'm merely hinting at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And that your question suggests it, even if you're not telling me.  It's more an expectation I think, that I feel.  And that really just occurred to me, is a way how may parents approached bringing us up.  As though they tried to leave us free to make the choices but that they had definite expectations and so our job was to figure out their expectations so we could meet them.  Because they wouldn't tell us, you do this or you do that, I mean they would set certain limits but on the vaguer things they would pretend that we were completely free to choose.  But really, they had extremely definite feelings themselves about what they expected that we do.  Even to the point that FNA being the way she was, was very hard for them to accept.  But she was so strongly that way, they finally had to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And my brother went through a brief period when he was at TXV when he well, I, I'm sure he was smoking and he was just kind of acting like a gay fellow, and he would smoke in my parents presence every once in a while in kind of a loud, show-off way.  Sh— cigar or something like that and that was he first started, well he let his hair grow really long for a while and I don't know, he just was experimenting with being something a little bit different than he had been and my parents were just terribly upset at this, and, and they thought it was the end of the world.  And they didn't know how to act to him or relate to him and then it just seemed like he was lost.  (Pause) And it just made me think that in anything we ever did or even now, do, they have to, or especially my father, has to turn it around so that it has some reason or purpose.  And you just, I was thinking in terms of my maybe taking different courses and you just don't take something because you just feel like it or gives you pleasure.  It has to have some meaning beyond that.  It has to be going somewhere, getting you to go somewhere and —</p>

<p>And I can remember really wanting to rebel against the thing of planning ahead that they have always held up so much as being so important.  For instance, every summer or every winter, it was practically like clockwork, you reach a certain point in the year and then you'd have to start planning ahead what were you going to do the next summer.  And often times there was nothing I really wanted to do and so therefore I really didn't want to make a choice.  But they would insist on it and although I think I wanted to see what would happen if I didn't make a choice and let it sort of happen, I was afraid of that too.  And so in the end I'd give in and make a choice.  But then I'd hate the thought of the summer coming.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I'm not sure, I don't know if I've mentioned this, I know I talked about it recently with MSCZ.  That my mother's need to have people sit down, well, when we're eating breakfast, she'll suddenly say, alright now everybody stay here for a minute, what are our plans?  What are your plans for today?  And you'd have to kind of go through all of them, and it'd end up, when we were younger, there'd always be some kind of a huge fight because people would get impatient sitting there or else somebody didn't exactly know what they wanted to do and my mother would insist that we had to tell what our plans were.  And, I don't know, just generally anyway, it was a very unpleasant time.</p>

<p>(Pause) Or at one point my sister wanted to, FYC wanted to go to europe after college and my parents wouldn't let her unless she had a definite job before she went.  And I could see their point to some extent but they wouldn't even let her try it out and if she didn't get a job come back after the summer or I don't know, there was, there was just to be no freedom at all to it.  And when I went, since I had already enrolled in graduate school, I think well my mother had a, mixed feelings about my going.  At first she thought it was really a good idea and then, then she changed her mind.  I don't know whether my father really influenced her, but my father was most concerned that then I wouldn't carry out my plans for going to graduate school.  And anyway, he felt very strongly about his daughters going to graduate school.  And, and having some kind of a thing that they could do, a jo—, being trained for some kind of a job.  I mean, it was a real obsession with him and I don't know how he feels about FNA, except that they sort of assume now that she is different and accept that.  But at one point when I was talking about, or when I had decided to spend the year in PEC, he wanted me to promise that I'd come back to go to graduate school.  And when he was asking us, one reason I wanted to go to PEC fo—, and take that particular job, was because I didn't want to go right into graduate school.  I was really sick of school.  Again, I had a sense that what I did at school was not what I really wanted to do and I didn't know how I could get out of the pattern I was already in.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Because I think I had that sense all along.  Because I was just thinking that in a way I'd go in cycles and I'd try to get out of the pattern that I had of the kind of student I was and it wouldn't work and so then I'd end up being right back again the way I used to be.  Because I tried at freshman year at college and then I probably tried it at sophomore year in high school and then I tried it again when I started at RZG.  But somehow I always felt that that wasn't right either and the only thing I knew was to go back to being a type of student that overdid any assignment and therefore never did any really well, and sort of got snowed under with work again and, and I don't know, just, I could just tell anyway, I was making the same mistakes that I felt were mistakes and — (Pause)</p>

<p>I suppose in a way the same thing has been happening since I started teaching younger children.  Because I could see when I taught high school that again I was creating work for myself and yet, the type of situation that it was would incline me to create work for myself.  And I thought in a way that teaching younger children would be different, and I would, I wouldn't be able to so much.  And it has been better but I can still see how I will start creating little jobs for myself if I don't have them.  And before I was taking courses I was doing a lot of reading on my own.  And I might as well have been taking a course for all the work I did sometime.  And I don't have this problem this year, but sometimes, because I'm, I'm busier, but I know sometimes when I found that things were going smoothly at school and I didn't really have to think about it at all once I left, and I could leave early, that after a while I would feel that I wasn't doing something that I should or I would just feel very uncomfortable with all that free time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And yet then there are other things that I have already set aside that I want to do and that I should do too.  I mean if it's, even if it's just keeping up correspondence.  And I won't.  I just keep thinking well, tomorrow I'll have a little more time or tomorrow I won't be so tired and I can do it then.  Or calling somebody up on the telephone that I should call.  And I'll put that off as long as I can.  And occasionally now, because I know well, this year I've had to be a little bit quicker about doing things when I think of them because I'm home less often, but even now if I'm home and it's let's say 8 o'clock and I think I should be telephoning somebody, I'll say, well, it's getting late enough now and I'm tired so tomorrow I'll be home earlier and I can do it.  And then of course, I never do it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And something, I suppose it's just a carry over what I do with myself but a few days ago I was thinking of the fact that when I had conferences last year and also when I taught high school, and generally probably even the way I approach what more work children should be doing than I'm teaching now, I approach it negatively and I always concentrate on where they're weak.  And in conferences last year I'm sure I stressed their problems rather than things that they were strong in.  If they're doing a project or a directed work, I, I will concentrate again on where they're being weak, the things they're doing wrong.  And my thinking doesn't naturally go to what's right and what's good.  I have to sort of keep, keep telling myself to do it if I do do it.  But I suppose that's because that's how I'm so used to thinking about myself and my own life and what things I'm doing.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking too that when I get angry at the children it's not situations when maybe because of what happened I really should be angry at them for their own good, but it's only times where either something's fallen on me so I'm, I hurt, if we're outside and they do something that they're being careless about or if uhm I'm feeling particularly harassed or upset about something else.  And then other times the same situation can occur and I w—, I'll be in a better state so I'll be understanding and, and be able to help them, if it's a matter if they're not realizing something but then it bothers me when I just lash out and get angry at them when I know really it's because of me that I'm angry or, or that it's my own situation that I'm angry at and not them.  And I hadn't, just a boy knocked a huge board on me today when he wasn't doing what he'd been asked to do and anyway, it was my fault because he was, he had been standing there for a while and I hadn't really noticed him.  And I could have helped him earlier by just ask—, reminding him to do whatever I'd asked him to do.  But it just made me think too that yesterday at one of the conferences the mother of the boy who has so much trouble keeping his, control of his body and his movement, knowing where he is and what's near him, what he could bump into and uhm, he's always spilling things and knocking things down.  And she said that she was giving me an example of how he is at home and how just seems to be absent minded about it.  And how once he spilled something all over the place and his father said what did you do that for?  And then they found out he didn't even know he'd spilled it.  And my reaction to the question what did you do that for, was of, I had a very strong feeling that, well, what a stupid question to ask.  Because he certainly wouldn't have spilled the mi—, the soup if he had known he was going to, therefore, how could you say what did you do that for to him?  And I think I felt this way because well, partly because I was thinking it through now, what rational was there, but my father always used to ask that too.  What did you do that stupid thing for?  And of course, at the time my reaction was simply, oh I must have done something wrong.  But I didn't, I wasn't aware then that well, if I'd known it was going to be wrong I wouldn't have done it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think also because of my own feelings about types of pressure that I must have felt when I was growing up, I haven't known exactly how I feel about what to do with this boy who's I think part of his problem is simply that he's terribly interested in so many things around him, that he gets involved in thinking about something else, and if it happens that's he's also moving or eating, he won't really look what he's doing and that it's coming out of this great curiosity that he has and he's almost overstimulated by his environment.  But it's in a way such a wonderful thing to see and, and I hate to see it just kind of killed because everybody keeps saying look at what you're doing and watch what you're going and why did you do this?  And yet I know he has to have some control because he's around other people.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I had another reaction today.  I'm not quite sure what my reaction was in a conference today a mother who had indicated earlier that her son was having some kind of a problem, that, she kind of referred to it as, well he has problems, and it was evident from his behavior in class that he had some emotional problem.  So I happen to, I think, have done pretty much the right thing with him, but today she sta—, I asked her to be a little more specific and she said well, don't you know he's seeing a doctor.  And I imagine it's a child psychologist.  And she was very surprised because she'd spoken to the headmaster about it and had assumed he'd told me.  And I couldn't tell what my reaction was except, I me—, I felt indignant that he hadn't told me because it seemed like something I should have known.  And but then I felt very embarrassed that I hadn't known, with the mother.  And I felt as if I had to kind of gloss over the fact that I didn't know.  And I couldn't tell exactly why I felt that way.  I—, if I felt a certain loyalty to the school and that I was trying to protect the school or the headmaster or if I felt underneath it all that even though there was no way I could have known, that I should have known and therefore I, I was feeling that it was my fault.  I just couldn't tell.  But I know my reaction was to kind of smooth over the fact that I didn't know and act like well, it wasn't really so serious.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know why I suppose it was similar to an, I hadn't been told about the boy's father being so very ill until he died.  Although there I can see that I was upset because I had been on the wrong track with the boy and I would have made probably a very serious mistake with him if I hadn't known, and so I was feeling kind of guilty over what I had done with the boy.  But I can see what I'm annoyed at is the fact that there isn't communication that there should be between me and the headmaster.  Although I can see rationally that it's information that he has so he's the one to bring it to me.  I somehow feel responsible that I'm not getting it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's funny too, the mother whose son is probably getting some kind of uhm psychiatric help, uhm when I had known he had some kind of a problem, even though I, in a way I have liked his parents.  I wanted to think that they were responsible for the problem in a way, so that they should blame themselves.  And I can't quite figure out why I wanted to feel that way.  I wanted to feel that although the mother expressed concern for the boy, she really didn't feel it.  But I think she really does feel it and I can't figure out why I wanted to have her be somebody that really didn't feel it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Whose attitude would that be?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Not caring, you mean?</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, I mean in your view.  Sounds like someone you've already described, you feel has that sort of attitude toward you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, she seemed so different that I don't, I mean she's such a different type of person from my mother.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you've described your feelings about certain times at least when you felt, uhm, you'd talked about it in much the same way.  As though she really didn't know what you were feeling or that there was something wrong and she should have known.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But even when I say things that bother me about my mother's lack of reaction or lack of understanding, I always have in my mind now that I should keep, I should keep thinking that perhaps I was asking too much at the time from my mother, that she was doing what she could.  So, although I know I still feel very resentful.  But I don't feel this way, well, I suppose it's because the boy has a problem that I reacted this way to his mother.  But I also, any time I feel this way, and I'm sure this is not the only mother I've felt this way toward, when I have them not being concerned the way they should be about their own child, it is because they're much more concerned about themselves.  Either they're trying to have a certain social position or they're very busy with their own life.  I just realized that I used to always think my mother was too busy with her outside activities, too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But it's funny, maybe it's a defense, that I never can recall feeling this way about a mother who wasn't extremely well groomed and very attractive, and therefore very different from my own mother.  It's almost like, how could she, how could she be so well groomed and attractive and social and so forth and still be interested in her own child?  So she must not be interested too.  Because I think this is something my mother has done to defend herself against wanting to be better groomed and all, but I have gotten the feeling from home that a person who cares about their appearance it means they're shallow because they're spending their time caring about their appearance.  And they don't therefore have time for other things that are more important.  And I can't now accept that you could be doing that plus other things.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking of another mother who, whose husband has left her and uhm, I don't know exactly the arrangement but they're separated and may be getting a divorce.  But uhm, she has struck me as a very insecure person and a very unhappy one and in a way I sort of like the feeling of being stronger than she or having better control over my life.  And in another way I'm very angry at her because somehow I blame her for the situation that I think has made her son very unhappy, because he's not a very happy little boy.  And in every other way he's a very attractive little boy.  I like him very much but he's just so unhappy and it, I tie into the fact that he's lost his father's being around.  Although he sees him on weekends.  And therefore my inclination is to blame her and sort of be angry at her.  And it bothers me too because in a way I don't think she is in the position as far as I can sense it, to really be able to help her boy that much right now.  But on the other hand, because I feel angry at her, I can just see that I might if I'm not careful and if she annoys me tomorrow, really go into every single little thing that is too bad about her son and really kind of make her feel awful.  And I can't tell if my reaction to her is because of her situation and the way her son is, or whether, and the way she's been with me just sort of generally, or whether it's because every time we've had a discussion of any sort, she's always turned it around to personal questions to me in a way, starting with, for how long have you been at LKC and almost as if she's saying, well I know you haven't taught there very long and therefore you can't be that good a teacher yet either, so don't feel superior to me.  And of course, that makes me feel very defensive.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Client number 0735-103; client 0735-103, session number 15.1970; session number 15, 1970. This, is the 15th of the 20 sessions. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Is that good or bad? [It's in the zipper] (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know (laughter). I don't know what to say.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it's good. I mean that we're getting through it. It's good from another standpoint I was thinking coming over here. And well it was just the last week or so, I've noticed that I can - oh, to me it's sort of an accomplishment from the last six months or so to be able to walk right past a girl without visually undressing her. I was making extra effort to see her; just all kinds of things like this. To me, that's always progress. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So like the 15th session is like well, yeah, almost through; almost finished the project. I got it wrong. 

</p><p>PATIENT: The numbers don't mean anything, but it's the progress of it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's the progress that counts.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, the progress really counts, and being able to do things now that I wasn't able to do. And this, is added into the fact that my wife and I haven't done anything in three or four days, and usually by the time I've been three or four days without anything, I'm kind of between the girl scope. 

</p><p>If there's a maid straight down the hall, I'll break my neck to get to the door and make sure I see; things like this, and maybe this, is progress. The last few days I've been concentrating my effort more on my job. Friday I had to get a truck to take a piece of equipment down to Missouri and bring a piece of equipment back Saturday morning and things like this; working overtime and not getting paid for it. [2:09]

</p><p>But it didn't really bug me because, I don't know, I just assume do that is some other things I can think of. Of course I had my lawn mower that needed to be fixed, and I wanted to fix it. It didn't get fixed until yesterday, and it just seems like I've been able to move my train of thought from sex to work and not lose any sleep over it, you might say.

</p><p>I don't know, it seems like maybe there was a time whenever I'd (inaudible at 2:45) really want work to occupy my mind as much. And then it still, I don't want it to get to a point where I start at seven and I quit at seven, and I go home and I sit and worry about my job or things like this. But I want it to occupy my time eight hours a day or eight and half, whatever I'm supposed to be there. 

</p><p>And then no increase in pay in the last six months, it seems like an accomplishment to be able to put more of your mind to your work than to extra curricular activities, I guess you can call it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel good about yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel like I got more control over myself. But if nothing else, that's progress. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like you can do what you decide to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There are a lot of things that haven't changed like, I don't know why, but last night I said, "Look, when I get my mind set on something, don't try to change me." I said, "It's going to have to be that way, or I'm going to be unhappy about it." And we weren't talking about anything in particular; it's just that I had my mind set of something. 

</p><p>Oh, I know what it was. I was going to go yesterday - was going out to the service station to get some cigarettes, and then I was going on down the street a little ways to get the newspaper. And in the meantime, I had my mind on this bulb that I had to pick up at the hardware shop to get that television working, which was a pretty high priority it seemed, so I went to get the cigarettes and turn right around and head towards the hardware store. [4:16]

</p><p>She says, "What about the paper?" I said, "Look don't bother me. I got my mind of the bulb." I said, "When I get that in my hand, then I'll start thinking about something else." And we had a little hassle the last couple of days. I gave her the riot act about the things that I felt she should do that she didn't do, and it really didn't accomplish anything. It didn't make me feel any better. It didn't change any of her ways, but maybe she'll stop and think about it a while. Eventually she'll see things my way or something. I don't know. 

</p><p>I told her she was very disorganized. She couldn't arrange her schedule, so she could accomplish things that needed to be accomplished. Last night when she came home from work, I took her over to the window ledge, and took her finger and ran it across the window ledge. And when you open the window between the window and the screen, there's a little area there. It's just filthy dirty all through the house, see. I've been trying to get her to clean these things up. 

</p><p>So I made sure that she understood what the point was. But she hit me this morning at the breakfast table with her ability to organize things. She's says, "I'm a receptionist. I have to learn to organize things. Whenever I have an phone call that's all, you know, six different people want six different things and six different directions from each caller." I said, "I have to be organized." I said, "Yeah well that's well and good, but still there are some ways that you need to improve and all this." And so we had a little hassle, but I don't think that any love was lost over it though. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was just thinking as you were talking about it, there's some kind of pleasure in it. I don't now. I ... [6:03]

</p><p>PATIENT: In a way. I told her that she needed to be more of a person who would do some of things that I ask. And that would tend to make me want to do some of the things that she asked more freely rather than her doing it just because it - I don't know, like going to the fair a week ago. 

</p><p>I didn't really want to, but I went because I knew she wanted to, and if I declined, I'd here about it and, "You didn't let me go to the fair. I'm unhappy" and all this for a week, so I went. 

</p><p>But to me this was sort of rewarding her for maybe a little bit of something she might have done in the past, or maybe something she might do in the future. So I guess I haven't felt there was any progress, and so I, over the past weekend, came to chew her out a little myself for lack of better term. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Getting your point across.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Last night and the last few days and when I really want to, I can set my mind to being busy working; just be busy, busy, busy. And from eight to five, I'm going in and when I get - if I had a, if I felt like I had some motivation on her part, you see, well I would be able to do more at home also. But I just don't think it's ever going to work out that way. She just doesn't see things the way I see them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Were just do distinct individuals; a little too distinct at times. This morning I was pointing out something at the breakfast table about - oh, I said, "I was brought up in a house where the floor was swept everyday, and things were kept in sort of tidy state and organized. And you had a place for it." Last night she was looking for some shoe laces, and I said, "If you had a place where you could put shoe laces and keep them there, then you might have some idea of where there would be some in this house." But, the house is very disorganized. [8:35]

</p><p>Stuff that wants to be stored, like shoe laces, get thrown on top of the refrigerator. And up there it falls off, and then the kids carry it off, and you never know where it is when you get to looking for it. I've often talked about taking one of the bedrooms, fixing it up like I want it, putting a lock on the door and carrying the key in my pocket. And this way I could have my room all tidy up. I can tidy up myself in the morning if necessary. 

</p><p>Put everything in the drawers where I want them, and have them stacked just like I wanted. I've been in the service, and this, is something, I guess, I picked up partially from the service as well as at home. And have an organized room where I could at least feel sane. All the time, it seems like things around that house are sort of verging on the insane. Just get clean clothes; you throw them on the table downstairs. When you need something, you go downstairs on the table, and you rummage through and find what you need and put it on. Once in a while ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So much clutter and disorganization. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason around there. Of course you got two kids running around disorganizing as fast as you can organize. Like if you have to teach them how to respect the fact that things should be in their place. I told her the other day that the kids are going to grow up in a disorganized state all because of the fact that she didn't even try to keep an organized house. Of course, this didn't sit too well as you can image. Like I said, I've been riding her kind of hard here the last few days. 

</p><p>But she's in a - she starts her period tomorrow, somehow or another. Well for six days or so before her period, she's always kind of grouchy and hard to get along with anyhow. So I've been kind of using it to my advantage. I've been grouchy too just to kind of take advantage of the situation, I guess you can say.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Probably feels good to be grouchy back instead of just sitting there being grouched at. [10:36]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is. The thing that I like now that I wasn't able to foresee before this was the fact that whenever I was grouchy at her, she'd just get twice as grouchy at me. And I'd be - it seemed like a wasted effort. But now she seems to be able to take it to a certain extent, and maybe every once in a while there's a sight, just a slight bit of improvement. Not a hell of a lot, but just a slight hit; that's progress.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah must make you feel like well, you have a little bit of affect on her.

</p><p>PATIENT: At least it's scratching the surface. I guess not getting through, but scratching the surface. Actually I feel like I got better control of myself now a days, which is progress; disregard the session number. 

</p><p>She came up to me, or she came up with a line (ph). [Well wait] (ph) for ten days ago, she said, "Well what are you going to do when you quit going to these sessions." "Just quit going to sessions. Why?" "Well who are you going to have to tell all your problems to and all this?" "I don't know. I'll just have to wait and see when the time comes who I can find to tell all my problems too (chuckle)." 

</p><p>Maybe I'll get me a tape recorder to talk to if nothing else (chuckle). I can sit down and record for an hour. She can sit down and listen to it and find out what all my problems are. Maybe we can communicate through the tape recorder. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Got to tell you that you'll handle things when the time comes. [12:23]

</p><p>PATIENT: I'll handle them a lot sooner if she'll handle things as I think she ought to. I think I've gotten this point across to my boss, and maybe I can get it across to her too. That "you scratch my back, I'll scratch your back" type of situation is what we're going to have. And I'm trying to scratch his back, and if he'll come up with a little scratch to my back why then we'll get along fine.

</p><p>He has kind of, in the last few days, seems like given me more credit for what I'm able to do. It's probably not being able to get the machine down there. I told him that even I heard this through the grapevine that this guy that didn't pay (ph) me wasn't going to crate that machine. So Friday morning he calls from Missouri and says, "Get a truck. Get that thing in it, and bring it down here." Fine that's what was going to have to be done eventually, and I wanted him to make the decision - now do it. 

</p><p>So if I was to just jump up and do it six months from now and he says, "Well you wasted all that money taking that machine down there." And I'll say, "Well it wasn't my doing, it was your doing." I'm also able to observe him squirming a little more now a days. He has a - I think he's the gotten the word from the front office in Chicago that he's not doing his job like he should. 

</p><p>And they've been riding him, and his been turning around and kind of keeping a tight reign on things so to speak. And so I'm going to let him make the decisions, and I'll follow him. If anybody gets whipped for it, it's going to be him. It's all in the way you perceive things, I guess. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're perceiving him being at some kind of disadvantage. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well not necessarily disadvantage. It's the fact that he's the boss. He's got to make the decisions. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he's responsible. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel like some of the decisions I have made haven't sit with him. And so I'm going to let him be the decider, and I'll do it. And if it's wrong, it comes back to him. Is this a bad way to be?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. It doesn't strike me bad just off hand. Were you having some doubts about it?

</p><p>PATIENT: I have some doubts, yeah. Maybe I should go back to the old system where I just take all the reigns at certain projects that I had, and just kind of plow them through. If they fall, then I say, "Woops, I made a mistake back here." [14:40]

</p><p>But, like I said, I rather have him be the responsible party. There at lunch today we were sitting across the table from each other, and I told him what I had scheduled for the next few days. And I asked him if there was any reason why I shouldn't carry through with this schedule. He said, "No, [I don't see] (ph)" So I'm proceeding to do what I thought was the best with his approval I feel, see. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You kind of get yourself covered and like you know he's not going to bran (ph) it at you, yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: A little insurance there. I'm not going to stay. He said it's coming back to him. He said I should do it this way where, like I said, I'm trying to put my problems where I can lay the blame on somebody else if it comes back to that. But I hit him with a new idea this morning, and he was very happy with the idea. And it just - it was something so simple, but it was just something that really he should have come up with.

</p><p>We've got this isotope compound thing that I've been working on, and he was worried about how we're going to run these through these ovens that run real slow, so you need to run these protective covers through the oven in about five minutes. And we've got these ovens that it takes an hour to go from one end of the oven to the other, and there only about 15 feet long, see. 

</p><p>I said, "Well we'll just make a conveyor belt that will sit right above the conveyor belt. Put our own power source on it. I think I can take these protective covers off this turn table, put them right on this high-speed belt that will go through the oven that can drop off into a tray on their own." [16:25]

</p><p>"Hey" he said, "That's a good idea." He said, "I've haven't thought about that yet." And to me, this, is what my job is. I'm getting paid to come up with unusual ideas because this, is research. We've got to come up with the unusual in research sometimes, and I feel like well now this, is proven that I can be worth more than I actually am getting paid. So I've been telling him all along that if he pays me more, I can come up with more ideas and do more work and all this stuff. And I think every once in a while I prove it to him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's good to get some proof across. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You see, you fight to build up a few points and then it comes raise time. If he just ignores the points that you've feel you've got in the bank, then you're batting your head against the wall. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like you weren't convinced that he's going to take you seriously, but we'll see.

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't [believe that] (ph). If he comes up with any better raise this year than he did last year, it'll surprise the hell out of me because the budget's down. They keep cutting his budget, and to me it's his own fault. Special projects like does he feel boy, we should have had a special account for. But no, he's been putting it in his minimal (ph) fund, which is going to be depleted long before the year is up. 

</p><p>To me, he should have had a special project for this; a special budget for this project. He's the umpire; we'll let him call the shots. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something strikes me about that. Like you're telling me that he's not going to be able to give you a raise because he's not going to have the budget, and yet, or also ...

</p><p>PATIENT: What have I've got to be so [dead blame] (ph) happy about when I see that things aren't going through? [18:34]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that wasn't what I meant, but that's a ...

</p><p>PATIENT: That's the way it hits me. I'm sitting here, what have I got to be so [dead blame] (ph) happy about when I can see that he's not going to be any different when it comes raise time next year than was last year because, like I said, their riding him hard in Chicago. If he's lucky, he'll get the same budget this year he got last year, which will mean nothing new. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well what are you so happy about?

</p><p>PATIENT: [I'll play a game] (ph), what the hell am I so happy about. I don't know. Coming over from where I parked the car, there's a bunch of little kids out there playing ball. And I walked past, and the ball rolled to me. And I kind of made a pretext to try and get it and this other little girl - this little colored girl, there's a bunch of little colored kids out there - she got a hold of the ball. And they saw that I was interested see, so they turned around, and they threw it to me. So I sit there and play ball for a couple minutes. Finally I said, "I got to go. I'll see you." I just assume (ph) to sit right there and play ball with them. I didn't do anything else the rest of the day. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of indication of how sort of good and outgoing you're feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: There's people around you, and life is for living; have fun and all this and all this. Maybe that's why I'm so optimistic [to reason] (ph). I think I just got in such a shell that I couldn't see the world around me, except the bad. And depressing when, like I said, [bad be at bad] (ph), so on and so forth. So, I'm getting out of this shell, and I can see that there are optimistic things to look at. All the cloud castle, which is going to float away someday. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe also you're like kind of tenuous, like you don't expect it to last. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not really. [20:28]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I stop and think and I say, "Well now, this, is all temporal. It's going to fly away. Tomorrow you're going to wake up, and it's going to be the same world it was six months ago. And you're going to be back in the shell and all this." I don't know I can keep fighting it and say, "Well let me see. There's a little something over there I can be optimistic about." I'll look at that and maybe the rest of the world will go on by. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe partly like even if you're boss isn't going to give you a raise, like you're given yourself some appreciation now. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I just - I've raised my opinion of myself, and that in a way tends to, like I said, built this cloud castle that I live in and the heck with the rest of the world. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I get the feeling like maybe it's the cloud castle, and that bothers you sometimes. But meanwhile you're enjoying the cloud castle.

</p><p>PATIENT: One of these days a big thunder cloud is going to come along and wash it all away. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would (ph) but maybe fragile. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I think that's in the back of my mind that it's all too temporal; all fragile. It can go away in five minutes. I don't know, I think this carpe diem idea has more validity than anybody wants to give it credit for.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The day by day.

</p><p>PATIENT: Fifteenth session, huh? That's another thing. I stopped and paid some more money on my bill down there, and I got to thinking, "You know, you don't really have that money spend. But oh well, I got some expense money in my pocket." See, that's what I'm paying it out of, is this expense reports. And I figure well, I'll be able to budget that much here and there because I told my boss there that he probably realized as well as I did that I was stifling off a little bit of that expense money to pay bills and things like this. [22:50]

</p><p>And he didn't seem to get too upset about it, so it's not going to bother me either. He does not that it costs more to send me out than it does anybody else in that section, and that's why I don't go as much, and I just assume it be that way. I don't like travel that much. I mean once in a while, fine. But there for a while I was on the road a hell of a lot of time, and I didn't really have to be, I don't' think. 

</p><p>Some things can be accomplished over the phone, other things can't. I took this truck down to Missouri the other day, and I came back, and I got a receipt for it and everything. And this morning I started sitting down sorting out my receipts, and I couldn't find the receipt for this truck. Well six months ago this would have driven me up the wall. (Inaudible at 23:54) been in a complete dither about it, you know, where in the world is that receipt. 

</p><p>I called home asked my wife if she'd look around to see if she could find it. And all the time I thought well if I can't find it, I'll just go back down there and get him to give me a new one. I called him, and they said yeah they can give me a duplicate receipt if I needed it, and so I'm not really worried about it. And this, is just another thing I feel like I've accomplished since I've started here. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Been able to take things more calmly. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Take them, take them as they - roll with the punches. Not let the little things like that get you down.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Figuring out what you have to do to get around it instead of just getting flattened. [24:40] 

</p><p>PATIENT: Don't let the little thing that you stubbed your toe on trip you up. Just kind of lift your foot a little higher and go on over them. There's a girl. Don't you know? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter).

</p><p>PATIENT: When I pain my neck like that, you know it's a girl. I glanced at her; she looked like she didn't have any blouse on. But then I noticed it was, not quite skin color, but it was not quite obvious at first. 

</p><p>I still am highly motivated by females; you can say it that way. Like a said, I don't drive clear around the block just to see one standing on the street [in my car again] (ph). Even if you have got on an extra short skirt. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like you're still enjoying it, but it's not - you're not quite as driven. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm still in the ballgame even if I'm not carrying the ball.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not carrying the ball?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well you don't have to really be in there pitching and carrying the ball and all this just to be in the game. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like even though you're not meeting someone to have an affair with them, it's just like eeh. You're still keeping an eye on the score. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's still in the back of my mind. At least I'll be interested if anything ever comes along. Let's put it this way. Maybe I'm not actively pursuing the situation, but I still would be interested if anything came along. I'm sitting here organizing what I'm going to do after I leave here and for the next 24 hours. [27:02]

</p><p>I guess I better get my mind back on the business at hand. Kind of looks like we might have to have that next session on Friday since I'll probably be in the lab the rest of the week after this until about Friday maybe; looks like I might have to be down there until Thursday sometime and come back Thursday and be in town maybe for Friday session if I need to - if we can set one up then. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But don't you think that's progress being able to not let problems control you? You try to look at life in its whole perspective and say, "Now I got a problem here and a problem here, but I'll work on this one a while and maybe I'll get a chance to work on this one." Just taking things as they come instead of letting your problems seem like a wall that's completely surrounding you and you don't know which way is out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I really do. It's a big change.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think that's the major thing that I've accomplished. I mean here, sitting in here and putting things in perspective maybe, and seeing that the problems don't have a solution. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Having some specific problems and not being walled in like you were talking about.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah you can see the problems more as trees through the - or trees in the forest and there's a path through there. And you have to walk down the path, and you take the problems as they come instead of saying, "Well now it seems like all of a sudden you've dropped in a forest, or all of a sudden you realize that you're in the middle of a forest and there's no path and the trees seem to surround you." [29:15]

</p><p>Like the director walking through the park; walked into the tree and he turned around 180, or 360 degrees, and ran right at the same tree again. You've heard that one?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No (laughter). 

</p><p>PATIENT: And he turns around 360 degrees and runs [right into] (ph) the same tree; tries once more. He turns around, and runs right into that same tree and says, "Boy I told you. Here I am in the forest, and I'm completely surrounded by trees" and it's the same tree all the time. 

</p><p>But you're able to see that their over there. You can tackle them one at a time. You don't have this feeling that your problems are a locked wall 12 feet high all the way around you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's like you said before to about being open to the world somehow. Once you do this, you can see things. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh you're going to see that - you back off and say, "Well now, you don't have any more problems than that poor guy over there." That poor guy over there - it's just that you thought you did, and you can now see that your problems are capable of being solved just like he's solving his or something like that. So this to me is progress. I think I said that 15 times. That ought to be sufficient for that (chuckle).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter).

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh boy. That's sometimes why I might be a good teacher; I repeat things over and over. And I might get like this guy next door and repeat things too many times, and have the people under me that wouldn't be so, "Here he comes. Whoops run; he's going to tell us that same story of how he started out in the shop." 

</p><p>We got a guy at work. He's a specialist, but he started out as an intern in the lab. He actually started out as an apprentice researcher or something, you know, way down there. Now he's some sort of a specialist and he like to tell the same story over and over how he started back in the lab, and has worked his way to a specialist status. After about the fourth or fifth time, you get to the point where, "Here he comes, let's run." [31:19] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to get like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Nobody is going tell you before he ever gets there. And I think this idea that I said that I was able to come up here and talk about one thing for one minute and then completely switch to another subject. 

</p><p>It also helps in work. I've got several different projects. I may have to check on all of them or do a little bit of progress on one, and then jump around to another and check to see what the progress is on it. And this, in a way, I think this idea of being able to jump around from one subject to another has kind of helped there too. Because like this morning I spent half the morning on the phone checking this and checking that and going there; just trying to accomplish bits and pieces, which maybe in the long run will come out to a complete picture. 

</p><p>And then the last I can say I worked on one project ten, fifteen minutes and then jumped to a completely different project. And I think this being able to change has been accomplished by being able to sit here and think things, you know what I mean, and turn around and talk about something entirely different. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kind of different because when you mentioned it before you're saying that you didn't think it was a good thing. And yet here, like your saying, at work it really helps. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, [I'm awfully thankful] (ph). Maybe that's what you call the disadvantage and then the advantage in the long run. I took my little boy with me down to Missouri the other day. He kind of bugged me a little bit. He, "When are we going to get there" every five minutes. "How much further is it?" all this stuff. [33:08]

</p><p>But yet yesterday, we were sitting in church yesterday morning, and he showed that he really cared I guess you might say in his own little way. He - every chance he gets now, in the last day or so, he's come up to me and gives me a big kiss because I think that he really appreciated me taking him with me on this business trip, and it really made him feel important. 

</p><p>[It didn't take long though] (ph), and we got down there, and we unloaded the thing and I said, "All right, where do you want to go eat." He sees a little hamburger joint over here. He wanted to go over there, so we went over there and ate, and we really didn't get to do everything we wanted to. 

</p><p>I wanted him to be able to go swimming in the motel pool while we there, but we got back to the motel late and got up too early the next morning and all this. But, like I said, there in church yesterday he leans over, and he just gives me a big kiss. It kind of makes you feel good because that's his way of showing his appreciation. I mean, it gets you right here (chuckle).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really warms you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It makes you think maybe you're not a failure after all as much as you thought you were at least.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you've been able to do something that somebody really appreciates.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I said, I was worried about the fact that I wasn't being the proper kind of father, and you bend a little with the wind, and it comes back to you. But it's, I mean, I didn't much want to take him. 

</p><p>My wife - but I came home Friday afternoon there, middle of the afternoon. He said something about he wanted to go, and she says, "Well do you want him to go with you?" And I said, "Well OK." I didn't really stop and think about what all the consequences would be but figured well in the long run it might be worth it, so and I think it was, yeah. Because, like I said, he really appreciates it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because at the time, you were doing something you weren't all that enthusiastic about, but ...

</p><p>PATIENT: No and I told my wife that the next time that we, she and I, go down there. We're not going to take those kids with us because they have a way of driving you up the wall, especially on a long trip and 200 miles is a long trip to me. [35:17]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But like bending as the wind does, does get you something in the end.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I would say that he appreciated, and so it was worth it all even if I didn't get to have my $8 steak dinner. That's what I would have ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, right. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Had it been me, I'd gone out and find me a place where I'd have me a nice big thick steak just to kind of, I don't know, to reward myself should we say. But I'll eat hamburgers with him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's OK. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm at a loss; can't think of anything to talk about. [37:05]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's just like that some days. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you thinking you should have something to talk about?

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel like, it's like I said before, sitting here just staring at the wall, or letting my mind just kind of idly wonder around and not really thinking about anything; kind of waste time or tape or whatever you want to call.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Waste an hour.

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said, I sit here and I think about one thing for a minute, and I'll switch over and think about something else. Not really anything that could be relevant, important. I'm sitting here trying to engineer that idea that I came up with this morning. [39:30]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Was that your conveyor belt?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I've never had any statistic courses, but I'm expected a lot of times to do some statistics. And, to me, this, is above and beyond the call of duty you might say. Because I understood when I hired on down here that I'd be doing some sort of, you know, some statistics, but my background is in Biology. And I figured well that will be my major preoccupation, but it seems like my major preoccupation is statistics. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: statistics.

</p><p>PATIENT: And Biology is a secondary, and this, is another reason why I feel well if I'm going to be expected to do the job, I ought to get paid for it because researchers get paid more than biologist generally speaking. I was over next door there this morning, and these guys that are specialists over there are really, you know, if they progress in their job, then they have a - their rewarded at their little offices with a secretary sitting outside. 

</p><p>And it seems like over where I work, if you progress [I think] (ph), like you been with the company for 25 years and the opportunity comes around, you might get a little office. Whereas these guys have may - have only been with the company two or three years, and they get into a little office with a secretary and all this. It seems like that even within the company, the rewards aren't even. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it isn't fair. [41:32]

</p><p>PATIENT: In some places that get rewarded fast, other places it takes years. And me, I think, my age - the type of thinking I do is that you should be rewarded, well maybe not quite instantaneous, maybe rewards should come a lot faster than ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Than they do.

</p><p>PATIENT: Than they do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem right to ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Not really because ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Put yourself out and have nothing come your way for it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: From one division to the next is a - once they got all the divisions working side by side like this where they can compare notes, their going to have to carry out the same programs for all of the them; the metal division is a very high paid division. However, the one I work in is a low paid position, and it just doesn't seem fair when the two of you are more or less working side by side that one group should get paid much more than the other one. I wish that argument has its pros and cons too. 

</p><p>The mental division makes a lot of money and the division I'm in doesn't so, thereby hangs the tail. It looks like you're going to have all this [content wrapped up] (ph). You get out of school and to be able to set up your own business on your own (chuckle).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds kind of envious (chuckle). [43:31]

</p><p>PATIENT: One day I'll be a psychiatrist somehow; set my own prices, right? That's one thing I have to do is to keep kind of fighting myself to - I like to know the whole picture. And yet, like I said to you one time, I don't really want to know what your background is or anything like this because I feel like I can make a more objective stance, you might say, if I don't know the whole situation. Am I coming through?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of. Like I don't - do you mean something like you can have more confidence in me if you just assume ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, if I just assume that you made your Ph.D, and you have studied this for years, and then I have all the confidence in you. Whereas if I were to find out that maybe you were an undergraduate and still taking sophomore psychology courses then I wouldn't have as much confidence, right.

</p><p>Like this guy that I work with. He's a high school graduate. He should be allowed to do certain things. I mean, other things he should not, you know, that shouldn't be his job because it would be really beyond his realm in my books, maybe it's not. But I think for a person's educational background, they should be allowed to do certain things. And if it's, well like say more researching involved, they should have an specialist or someone with more background or education. [45:35]

</p><p>And this kind of bugs me in a way because he's doing the same job I am more or less and, of course, the next you know, he'll be wanting to make the same pay as I am. And the next thing you know, he may be making the same pay I am and this won't drive to well with me. And then I'll say, "But it all started back there on your first day when you knew those researching process (ph)." It's hard to get away from that classless the system, like I said, once you've gotten firmly grounded in it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you don't want to be on that bottom rung.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't mind the bottom rung as long as all those people above me are more qualified. If everybody around me got a master's degree, and I've only got a bachelor's degree - fine they can all be above me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If it fair, it's all right.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'll work for them if that's the situation, but the day they start letting the high school graduates tell me what to do then that doesn't sit well with me. And this, is what I perceive it may be someday. He may be the boss, and I'm the one that works under him, and I just can't comprehend working in that situation. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A guy telling you what to do who has no business telling you what to do.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not really if any. This idea of having 20 years experience on the job just doesn't, at my age, stand up too well as an argument. It may get you a little something in my books but not much. [47:31]

</p><p>I mean, it's sort of like the service. If you're going to be an officer, you at least have to have some qualifications for being an officer even if it is just (inaudible at 47:53), which is another three months of basic training all it amounts to. But nonetheless, it is some kind of a deciding factor on who's an officer and who isn't to a great extent. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something about having regular criteria that apply to everyone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You got to play ball by the rules. That's all there is to it. It seems like there's a lot of places where there not holding to the rules. This guy - well in fact all of us were in the boss's office this morning kind of putting out our flowers and showing what we've been doing for the last few days while he was away and all this. 

</p><p>And this intern was trying to get certain things accomplished, and he was going about it in his own type of way you might say. And the boss was trying to get him to do things a little bit different. I was sitting over there saying, "When I - you see, if you were doing that job, why you might be able to organize it better." I don't know. It's just my own selfish way of looking at things, like I say. [49:25]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Selfish?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah because he may be doing it, well the best job possible at the time, and I wouldn't probably want to give him credit for it because I'm sort of halfway prejudice, halfway. Kind of prejudice against the fact that he's doing the job, which he really shouldn't be doing in my books; like this researching job the intern's doing. 

</p><p>Like I said, it goes back to the point that he's got these certain jobs that he's supposed to be doing, which he's not. He's devoting these full efforts to this little engineering project, which he's been assigned. And, of course, these intern's jobs are just kind of getting pushed aside, building up. And I know good and well that one of these days the boss is going to come to me and say, "Now would you kind of help him catch up on this interns [wood beam] (ph)" that he's supposed to be doing all this time. 

</p><p>I think the next time around I'm going to tell him no because he's supposed to be doing these jobs everyday. And when he doesn't do them, then I'm sure as hell not going to come up and help him do them every three months to get caught up. 

</p><p>I'm just sick and tired of having to do the interns job because the intern won't do it, and it may not sit too well with the boss, but nonetheless I think that's just about what's going to happen next time around. About two years now, it's been the same thing all over. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you don't intend to keep on picking up his slack. [51:26]

</p><p>PATIENT: At first I didn't mind it because I felt when he had too much work to do that he needed another intern to kind of ease out the work load. But then it got through to me that it wasn't the fact that they had too much work, it's just the fact that the intern wasn't doing the work like he should be. 

</p><p>And maybe the boss sees it this way, and he just doesn't want to do anything about it. Or maybe he doesn't see it that way, but I just have had it up to here with the fact that every two or three or five months or whatever it is, I'm going to have to stop and go help him do all his work. 

</p><p>Like I said, the next time around I'm just going to say no. If he wants to run me off, fine. I think maybe the next situation I get into will be one where I'll be the boss, and I'll be able to say, "Now here's the way we're going to do it. No deviations." Which I think is the way it ought to be. 

</p><p>Assign a guy to do six jobs, and if you can't do them, you determine why. If it's too much, then you get somebody else to do them with him or get somebody else to do one or two of the jobs. But if you can do all the six of them, has the time to do them and everything, then there's no reason why he shouldn't be doing them; thereby he earns his pay.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you resent it when somebody doesn't.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I mean there's certain jobs that need to be done, and he should be doing his part of the certain jobs that need to be done all the time. But like I said, he was hired to do these jobs, and now he's got to a point where he feels he's above them. And for no reason, he hasn't - he's gone to one little course that he took down at a technical college or something but other than that, the only reason that he should not be doing these jobs is just because he felt that he's outgrowing them. At least that's the way that I understand the situation. Like I said, if I ever got to be boss of this job, I think I would institute a few new plans. [53:35]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I guess it would be especially golden to be helping him out with a job that he feels like he's above. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's too - he's too good for the jobs. Well your certainly too good for the jobs. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well now you had to say that didn't you (chuckle)? That's exactly how I feel, but I won't admit it to anybody. [I would never] (ph) say that I'm too good for it, but if I was hired to do those jobs, I would try to be doing them. Of course I'd probably be just like him. I would want to do something that was a little more intriguing or however you want to say it. Such is life. You got to take the poison ivy with the forest. See what I mean, I keep going back to this grade school training that I've had, well not grade school, but as [mother's knee] (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feel kind of caught out when you come to that light there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah whenever I try to put everything in this little storybook form, I guess it can be a kind of perversion. Instead of calling everything a spade, that it's supposed to be a spade, I try to say, "Well now this, is a club with a point on its head. Not necessarily a spade." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You look kind of thoughtful.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I was just thinking five more sessions. That means in two weeks we'll be through, and I was thinking well now who are you going to start trying to call and get a hold of to talk to after this. I think the first month after these sessions are over is going to be a very telling time. [55:48]

</p><p>Whether I try to pervert - try to revert back to old habits, or whether I try to maintain the ones that I might have built up. Like I said, I think I might have to get me a tape recorder to lean on. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Miss being able to talk to someone.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I always said that if people need somebody that they can sit down and talk to. A lot of married people sit down and talk to their mates. But, I don't know, I just never have been able to accomplish that. And it seems like whenever I accomplish it, it doesn't - whenever I do it, it doesn't accomplish anything; let's put it that way. So I've just written it off as useless, and have gone looking for somebody else and you know the rest of the story. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean like you go looking for women and then their husbands get angry, and ...

</p><p>PATIENT: No, well yeah. But it seems like most of my contact is with married women, and so then I have to worry about what the husband will say and so on and so forth. This guy at work came up with a picture of me and my wife at this party. He's a part-time professional photographer, and he was at this party that we were at one night. [57:12]

</p><p>He took a picture of me and my wife, so he gave it to me. I took it home and showed it to my wife and everything, and I got to thinking, you know, well this other couple was with us. They live down the street from us, and she's this real short, cute body. Her and her husband were with us, and so I went up to him and said, "Hey did you get one with me with that blond that was with us." He said," No, I didn't get one." I said, "Heck" (chuckle). It would have been a good blackmail material, but ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you still kind of would like to have that picture.

</p><p>PATIENT: I would have kind of liked to have that, yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A picture of you with a cute little blond.

</p><p>PATIENT: I could say it still back in the back of my mind even though I'm not pursuing it actively. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Still it's kind of like something.

</p><p>PATIENT: A sauce for the goose could be sauce for the gander. Nonetheless, I'd still like to try the sauce even if I found out it was bitter. [I'm not going] (ph) to eat without trying. You know that case were psychoanalysis seemed to fail; came to not accomplish anything?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess so.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well maybe it accomplished something in the wrong direction. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you worried about that, or?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I'm just kind of curious. We have these friends of ours who - this guy about, oh I'd say about 28, and his wife's about 26, and he had a little girl about two, three somewhere in there. She had a nervous breakdown as I understand it, and then after being in the hospital for quite a while, she went through therapy for quite a while. And so I keep kind of sometimes comparing myself to her, but what drove her up the wall isn't what drives me up the wall, see, so thereby is the difference. [59:35]

</p><p>Her problem was that she couldn't take - this two year old drove her up the wall, and I don't know how she adjusted to it and everything. She seems to be all right now, but a lot of times I stop and compare myself to her. I was talking to her on the phone last night. She seems to really have - well she seems stable now as anyone else, but as I understood it before though, she was very high strung and nervous and all that. Maybe that was what made me think of this idea of analysis failing, or at least failing accomplishment much. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Actually I don't quite see the connection.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know, maybe there isn't any.

</p><p>Like I said, I jump from one subject to another. And all of sudden it just dawned on me, I wonder, you know, I wonder if you could go through complete psychoanalysis, or whatever you want to call it, and not make any progress or not accomplish anything or maybe even go the wrong direction.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What confused me was like you were saying when you could not accomplish much, you'll fail or something. And like this, but this woman your thinking of like seemed to be successful. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah that's - her and I are the only cases that I know of see, and it just seems like if both of us have accomplished what was desired. And I just wondered if it ever didn't. I could turn out the other way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I've never ...

</p><p>PATIENT: Sorry.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: OK, go ahead.

</p><p>PATIENT: Go ahead.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I've never known anyone to go the wrong direction, but I certainly know people who've stayed the same. [61:44]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah something came up the other day about mental institutions. I think I got a little article in the paper that I read brought it up, and I was discussing it with a guy. Something about I had worked in a mental institution at one time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Some of the sights you see in there are just pathetic. People that not only can't care for themselves, but they seem to try want to do themselves harm all the time. These - it seemed like there's always this group that they can't seem to keep clothes on, and they have to put - they can close the yards for them to play in. The pathetic lack of progress, I guess you might say. 

</p><p>Day after day you see some of them sitting in the same place under the same tree just kind of watching the world go by, and that seems to by the hype of their ambition, knowledge, whatever you want to call it. I worked as a draftsman one summer at this mental - I think they called it a hospital or state school or whatever it was there in Ithaca, and, of course, I had to be out among the wards making reports. And you had to go out and measure the reports and see, you know, make sure the results were right.

</p><p>And you'd work on project where you'd want to change something, and then I'd have to go out and measure and make sure you had room to change it and all this. Go out a check and see what the progress on the projects that are in progress; whether their going according to order (ph) and all this. [63:34] 

</p><p>You get to wonder around and see all these people. Like I said, it's kind of a - you go home with the, "I'm sure glad I'm not that way" attitude or "I wish there was something that I could do." But you realize that there's not much you can do because they have people that are trained to do it, and their doing all they can. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you wish could though.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you look at these volunteer groups that are there, and you don't really see too much progress; maybe they have a little dance for the people or something like this. Little party and things, but that doesn't really seem to do them any good, it seem like what their doing is so temporal. They have fun at the party, but an hour after the party ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Back to the same. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Back to the same moody condition they were in before maybe. In a way you're kind of afraid to work for that kind of people because of the fact you feel, well, it might rub off. It's like working with malaria; who knows, it might rub off. I think I'll stay away from it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you'd get into that state.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you might get the thought where you were needing to be locked up behind those bars too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's a pretty freighting thought.

</p><p>PATIENT: I keep wondering why these doctors that work on these people that have these contagious diseases don't all of a sudden come up with this disease and ...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do something about it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Have to be quarantined and all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: Just like the people their working with. That's what always bothered me about it, anyhow. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because if you were around them too much, you might ... [65:34]

</p><p>PATIENT: You might find yourself picking up some of their habits (chuckle). Some of those people though you can look at and they seem perfectly normal to you, and some of them you even get to envy them. These old women who'd make these, what do you call them, shag rugs. Rugs where they start out with a little circle and before long they've got a 12 foot diameter, and they sell those things for $50 a piece. You wish boy I'd wish I could have a hobby at least that could do something like that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess we should be going.

</p><p>PATIENT: Okidokie

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Friday you say.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah kind of - if we could set it up for Friday. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure. OK five o'clock maybe, or? 

</p><p>PATIENT: OK.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You probably have to come up because I think the secretary has gone home by then. 

</p><p>PATIENT: OK. I'll just come up and wait across the hall. How's that? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Fine, fine, fine.

</p><p>PATIENT: And when you get relieved (ph). That way if you got someone in here I won't be bothering you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. As of now, I don't think I have another appointment that would cause that anyone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, you may be then though.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter) right, so you never know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: [You never can tell] (ph). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, goodbye now. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Bye. [67:16]

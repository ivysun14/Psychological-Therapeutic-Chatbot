<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 11. Interview 11. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How're you doing? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm doing fine, you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm tired. I'm feeling ok I guess. Sort of..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been wearing? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Got through the day. I'll say, it actually it's really like after I left here you know I just sort of felt kinda numb. The only time when I didn't cry anymore. I did, and I had intended to before, call the guy the guy that I work with. He was very close to me. And I asked him if I could see him before class and got him to cancel something else. And even talking to him, you know it was so, you know like I don't know if I felt any better when I left here, except that things were, you know like I was able say some things, you know just verbalize some stuff. 0:01:19.2</p>

<p>And some of the same things came out when we were talking. A couple of different things and I guess the different kind of feeling there is that I know him very well and like we have a very close friendship relationship. And so it was like there was a person to hug me and hold me you know. Which was really also kinda something I discovered I really needed or wanted. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Needed and wanted. It was good to have. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. It was really great. And I got to the car sorta like really mechanically but it was all right. 0:02:03.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you got through it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was extremely exhausted afterwards but I was physically tired a lot anyway. And then I got a hold of Don when I got home Wednesday night and he figured what the situation was because he'd been to the doctor and they told him that, you know, he was perfectly normal. And the strange thing and the thing I, I guess I don't, I don't know what it means at all is he kept saying he was sorry. He was sorry that he made me pregnant. And it was a reaction from him like, I guess it was unexpected, completely unexpected. And I don't know if I wanted him to feel sorry about, you know like it was really strange. 0:03:02.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Well how did it hit you when he felt sorry. Did it make you feel good or just..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't understand it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It didn't make me feel good. It was sort of, I guess it was like "Is that all you care about is that you're sorry you made me pregnant or the fact that I'm pregnant like making some other, anybody pregnant, you know?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see. It was kinda, it was like, I'm sorry I did this to you but like the person of you wasn't so important in all that or what you're going through. Kinda like that I'm sorry I made a person pregnant, is it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that's what I read, even though he was concerned about where I was at, you know. And likewise and after talking to Gary and I'd realized that I really hadn't considered where he was going to be. You know how he was going to feel about the situation. 0:03:57.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember you had said you had, that he might think it's kinda nice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. But I wasn't sure, no I guess it was I didn't know how I was going to be responding to him, you know. And so I was very conscious of that. And then when he said he was sorry it was sorta like a, I guess it was kinda almost like a rejection. I don't know. It was like really weird. I thought he, I didn't say anything you know but I was thinking "What do you mean you're sorry?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Yeah I guess I'm still trying to understand how it felt like a rejection. Is it because he just should have responded, oh my God, at how upset you were? Rather than he was responding from himself and his feeling of sorry and responsibility rather than responding to you in the moment? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of how you were feeling then? 0:04:59.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you don't, can't quite put your hand on it either. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can't. It just occurred to me to that I guess one of the things I wanted to hear was that he felt stupid too, you know? And I began to think that maybe that was a way of saying he felt stupid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It certainly could be. Like I'm sorry I went on this bad information. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it was really, I guess I didn't feel like either of us had to be sorry toward another. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that you were close enough..</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that seemed to create a distance. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's like you don't have to apologize to each other because you're close enough that that's not needed or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kinda like that's something when people further apart. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it occurs to me now maybe he anticipated my being extremely angry with him you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More angry, you know like I guess I'd worked through a lot of the anger I'd felt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And you were angry with him? 0:06:01.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I had some feelings of anger at him but I, you know I guess I had the feeling he expected me to be a lot more angry. He was worried about where I was. And I was worried about how he was, that I didn't want him to go around talking to a lot of people about it. But I wanted him to be able to talk to somebody so that he got some support. Because I felt pretty good about the kinds of support I feel like I've been getting. And he, you know like I guess it's really funny, he was worried about where I was at, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at that point of course I was so tired, just exhausted. I couldn't, you know I was, "Fine, all I want to do is go to bed and get some sleep." And then I couldn't sleep anyway, but you know like that's where I was. I was just wanting to sleep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had had enough for the day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too much to let you go to sleep. 0:06:53.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Anyway that's what I was, he's coming into town tonight. And we're going to see what comes of it. Gary had suggested like, he's worked with this woman who I have met, who's done a lot of counseling in terms of, I suppose just marriage counseling, pregnancy kind of thing, abortion, whatever it is. And so I kind of expect to get in touch with her this weekend and see her. Either by myself or with Don. And I guess I began as I thought I'd like the two of us. I was sort of scared. I didn't know what, you know where the two of us were. I'm sort of scared about that, you know. I'm not sure where we are, what this is doing. 0:07:57.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What it means, doesn't mean, in terms of your relationship. Is that true? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like all of a sudden it occurs to me that you know, perhaps just one part of it is that it's like a real test of our love. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. I see that. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't, I'm a little worried to discover that it isn't as strong as I have come to feel it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Kind of like this really puts a strain, it's really a test. But you're kinda scared that it, you're going to see it not as high or strong in meeting the test or something like getting through it, as you kinda thought it was when times were happier. When this big strain or test wasn't there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think both of us are independent. Like I like to be able, you know even anticipating getting married I still have a lot of feelings about doing things I want to do by myself sometimes, you know. And I see this as necessitating really togetherness, perhaps even more than we've ever given ourselves. 0:09:20.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's kinda like you could be together but each of you does have a life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the kind of togetherness that this is going to require to get through it, it's like going to be a new thing. Like that's not the way your relationship has quite been. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're kinda, your closeness is a closeness but it's not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well we've always been separated by distance and that almost encourages our independency. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kinda like hearing you're two spheres or something. Your life may overlap but they still have a whole, each of them separate (inaudible at 0:09:53.0)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah right. So like I had thought of seeing this woman on Sunday and feeling like I think it's a really good idea for both of us to be there. And then having lots of fears about what it's going to bring out. Though I still feel like it's a good thing, you know. And I, and I feel strong about it, helpful in terms of what kind of decision to be made.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know since Wednesday, it's really kinda strange. Probably part of it is talking to Gary. He's married and he has a child. And he has sort of an aversion to abortion in terms of very long lasting after effects on a person. But it was so funny that by Thursday morning, you know while Wednesday the more fearful thing was to go ahead and remain pregnant and have a child that it's almost reversed itself. And now I'm almost more frightened about the decision to have an abortion than the other. 0:11:08.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms of frightened that those effects will always kinda be looming in your head in some future time, that's more scary, you know, that it might be that way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that. As well as, you know I began to feel, I don't know. And I used the word noble when I had spoken, you know when I was talking to Gary about it. I almost feel very much stronger in terms of dealing with the situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure yet that I want it. That it's appropriate for the time, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but it's kinda like it just, the thought of having a baby doesn't seem as scary and overwhelming to you as it did Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you feel stronger. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound stronger. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you sound much more, you know. Like I wouldn't know what the word would be. You know, thinking about it but not overwhelmed by the emotions about it. 0:12:04.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, I don't think I am. And I guess I feel that I have enough yet time to contemplate a lot of different alternatives. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I find myself thinking I have time for my decision and excluding at least verbally Don from that decision. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is I think why I'm kinda worried I guess about where it places us in relation to one another. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's like interesting. It's kinda like, the way you're saying it is kinda like you have time for your decision but the decision is yours and not ours. When I say ours, yours and Don. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except that when you say that it is my decision. I'm the one that's got to go through nine months of being pregnant.0:13:02.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm the one that, I guess I feel like I'm the one that takes a hell of a lot more embarrassment of..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're damn straight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I know his, it's that, it's not an uncommon thing in his family. I'll be even doubly embarrassed with his family because they've always, some members of his family, not just his parents but aunts and uncles and you know, have I felt seen me as an outsider in the sense of coming in very well educated and white and more mature, more responsible than a lot of the kids. And you know, and like for me to be pregnant and it's not accepted more, you know like regardless of how common it is it's still not a religious accepted thing to be pregnant and not married there. 0:13:59.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah, so I can kinda see what you're saying. "Well I really do feel like it's my decision. It does effect me more." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess I, you know in saying that I distracted you from the kind of thing you said like you did feel that it was your decision and what, I guess you were saying what kind of effect that, what did that mean in terms of you and Don or (inaudible at 0:14:25.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. If I, like I consider him in it very much. But I, I guess just part of the way our relationship has been is I still have to make a decision on my own. I feel independent from him in a lot of ways. And it was strange that, you know one of the things Gary had said is like a person, or a woman can be very much alone with this kind of a situation. And I don't know how alone I feel. I guess I feel like I've been getting a lot of support, a lot of closeness, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:15:18.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't feel as alone, I'm sure as alone as I could be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That you might not have people to talk to. You might not have Don. It sure could be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, really. I wanted to, a thing that happened last night which has nothing to do with this. And I, it's just the situation is, well let me explain badly. I, our class went over to this professor's house last night and they, had I mentioned it? Anyway they had a guy come in and talk on this thing.0:16:07.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:06.0) talked sometimes about the intimidating professor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Well this isn't, well I got out of work and I thought I'd be real late getting up there. Well I wasn't and I was early. And I couldn't go to his house right away. I wasn't that early that it would have been embarrassing to be so early. But I thought of he being there and I thought that the other man who was speaking was going to be there too. </p>

<p>I don't know a whole lot about, they were presenting, he was making a presentation about behavior modification and I have a very limited knowledge of that. And it was like I was really intimidated by thinking that I would go there early and having to sit and talk to these two professors and not ever feeling I had anything to say to the guy who takes my class. I like him. He's an ok person. 0:17:08.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The guy that what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The guy that takes, that has our class. The guy that's the professor of the class. But it was like, I didn't feel like I would have anything to say and I just, I couldn't deal with going over there and feeling like I'd be the first one there and have to sit there with those two guys and..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talk about something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, particularly you know, I've been going through all this crap and I really didn't feel like having to be placed in a situation to be nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Probably kind of like be nice and maybe make intellectual chit chat. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. So I drove around and I finally went by the house and saw that there was another student there. But I drove around for a little while longer before I went. I must have driven around for about 15 minutes. Fifteen or 20 minutes. And I finally stopped and went in but the visiting man wasn't there yet. And the other, there was another student there who is a very quiet person. And his wife was with him. And it turned out to be rather comfortable and not forced and I didn't have to feel like I had to say something intelligent or anything. But I really was afraid I'd have to sit, you know.0:18:14.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah was it kinda like the feeling like you would be sitting in the chair, looked at and forced to produce. You know, say something smart. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah, right. And I didn't feel like saying anything smart. And I didn't have anything smart to say. I certainly didn't feel confident enough about behavior mod that I could,,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talk about it to someone who is very skillful and knows very much about it. I'm like, it was, you know like I was very uncomfortable and I just avoided it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't like the feeling, you know, that I was intimidated. You know I wanted to be able to say, "Well hell, ok. I haven't done enough for me to know enough about it. So what? So that's where I am." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:18:58.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's no reason why I can't just say that and not have to prove that I'm some sort of an intellectual about behavioral modification when I'm not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's like I couldn't even admit that I didn't know anything about it, or enough about it to intelligently talk about it. And I couldn't go there. And the other funny thing was that after I got there, this is really strange. I was dressed in a very nice dress and I looked very nice and the professor and this guy couldn't get over the fact that I had a dress on because they'd never seen me in a dress. And I said, "Well you know, I was working today." And some comment was made about my jeans and stuff. And I said, "Well they're more comfortable. This is uncomfortable." Then I said, "Well it isn't uncomfortable anymore." You know I've lost some weight and I can be more comfortable wearing a dress. And he said, "Well, just wait until you're pregnant to be uncomfortable." (laughing) And I thought, "Jesus Christ!" (laughing) It was so, I'm the most paranoid person. 0:20:01.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's like kind of here you've been thinking about nothing else..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Can I have a cigarette?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. And here, you know, he of course, and you know you were so kinda sensitive and vulnerable that you thought he knew.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, Jesus. And I said, I guess for a couple of seconds I didn't say anything. I just sorta looked. And then I said, "Well, I guess I don't anticipate that right now." (laughing) And I was so glad my roommates weren't there because they'd have just been (blows raspberry).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh it was really strange. But I, that was just a humorous thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really ironic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just really, it was just too much. (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but in trying to you know, it's like I guess you kinda felt bad because you were so paranoid but it's also like you could really laugh at the whole thing, couldn't you? 0:21:01.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could. It was funny. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean kinda that you had a distance enough from it or something to..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I almost sort of thought there I wish you could know how funny that is you saying that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's kinda like to share the joke with them. 0:21:16.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. But I get, you know back to not going over there because I really was sort of, maybe it was just not intimidation it was a, maybe I was afraid to admit that I didn't know anything about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. Kinda like, do you think, do you think, I mean was it? Yeah, I'm kinda trying to kinda separate it out. It wasn't because like you had been kinda so set all day and like you couldn't just bear the thought of that. Or was it more that you know here it was kinda with people like with regarding to the professors kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably part of both. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you had to feel kinda like it could make you feel unconfident or you know if you couldn't carry on a what do you call it, a stimulating, interesting. 0:22:09.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even, this recalls to me even. There's a professor I had last year who, we became, well as close I've become to professors except for a very few at Ryder But you know, we were over to his house a lot of times for dinner working with him last spring and in his community. Even he, you know I was even afraid to be placed in a room alone with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I never really had anything to say. I always thought like I should have to say something, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bright, intelligent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's somehow kinda like being with faculty brings out kind of your unsure feelings like, "Well here's where I'm expected to produce. To say something bright. To impress, impress them."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kinda being afraid that you know, get intense about it that you won't. Or maybe that (inaudible at 0:23:09.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suspect part of it's impressing them but part of it's even you know that I don't have anything to say and you know like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how does that make you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dumb.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Like, "Gee whiz I don't have anything to say. Maybe I'm just not so smart. I'm not so competent."</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know you go through school and you're supposed to ask questions all the time, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like raise your hand and you ask a question. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not all the time. It gets obnoxious. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Well but you know my school that's what, you know, and I and, you know, that was it you know. So last night, this guy was good. I'm not sure I agree with all the kinds of things he does. But he was good and he wanted us to ask questions that would help him bring out things, you know things that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:23:58.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I couldn't even ask a question about it. And I, I didn't feel bad about that. There were other people who knew enough about it that they could ask intelligent questions and it would be helpful to me through them, you know. But there were a couple of moments of silence where no one had anything to say and I felt uncomfortable as though,,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should be..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I should be able to make an input.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fill it in. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know like other people have said something, you know, and you kinda felt pressured in those moments. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And what's funny is there are a couple of people in the class who haven't said a thing. They haven't said a word all year. In all the classes I've been in I've never heard them say anything. Now one of the guys that was there last night who never says anything does practice some behavior modification stuff you know. Well, anybody who would be practicing a certain would, must, I'd have some questions about it. About ways of improving. And he, and I asked him, "Do you have any questions?" And no, he didn't have anything to say. And I'm sure if I had a better understanding of it I probably would have had something that I wanted to know more about. And wouldn't have been, you know. But I felt, I did, I felt dumb. Because I couldn't..0:25:19.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you didn't have, I mean nothing really occurred to you, that made sense or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that doesn't have to mean I'm dumb. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it doesn't have to mean I'm dumb because I don't have anything to say at that particular time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. I guess the point is you feel that you should. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Part of it is also feeling as though, "Well here's a perfect opportunity. Someone who's an expert on it. Take advantage of it." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can't because I'm scared to. I guess it's scared of sounding dumb to him and not being impressive. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah, it's kinda like someone knowledgeable you know you want to impress.0:25:57.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kinda like the thing whenever you talk to someone who's famous it's kinda like you're scared. (inaudible at 0:26:08.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I mean I don't know it this person is famous but it's you know, the same kind of phenomena. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he's a well known person, you know. And the thing is that he was very informal and comfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean he wasn't the kind who was all pompous and strutting around. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No not at all. No and that, you know. Which is perhaps the best conditions under which to ask. You know you feel a little more comfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm,. because you probably, you're not going to be put down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. You know and, but I was just by being there. And late in the evening, you know like this extended quite late. I get really, really tired very easily. And I was saying, this was about 10 o'clock and I was just wanted to go home and go to bed. And all I wanted to do was go sit in a corner where I wouldn't have to be bothered or have to even look bright, look awake. I could just sit there and wait until it was time to go home and go home. </p>

<p>And I couldn't you know. I had to sit there. I had nothing to say. I didn't want to talk to anybody. I was too tired to talk to anybody. And I just sat there at least a good 10, 15 minutes. I finally decided oh hell, this is really stupid. I'm going home. And the only people that noticed was my roommate because she knows how I feel and she knows I get really tired. And that was uncomfortable at the end because I couldn't have, at that time I couldn't have said anything even if I had wanted to. But I'm still feeling sorta dumb. As though I wasted an evening on it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's well, I guess it's not just wasting an evening but it's kinda like you know what happened in the evening was kinda like you're feeling pressure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But yet kinda like feeling so (inaudible at 0:27:59.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it went back to, you know, and as I even sat there I was thinking of, or as I was driving around I was thinking of how I talked, you know we had talked about lack of confidence and feeling dumb and all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I felt, "I really should just go over there and just be comfortable with who I am." And I couldn't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't do it. Just kinda feel comfortable with you, who you are, you who has no question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just couldn't do it. You felt damn uncomfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I suspect I also used as an excuse the fact that I'm going through sort of a crisis you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was easier. And part of it probably was true. It's even more difficult to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. To you know kinda get involved intellectually about something. 0:28:59.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or even be strong enough to accept myself and not care whether I had anything to say. And if I sat there in silence, I sat there in silence, you know. I guess I'm uncomfortable, like the guy that was there when I came in, this other student. He's a very quiet person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like he can sit being very comfortable with being quiet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. He can, or he seems to you know be able to accept the him who is quiet. Where you just can't find it in yourself to accept you know, "I don't have any questions. I'm not going to say anything impressive. I'm not going to show my intellectual prowess." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's you know, makes me think that I've, I sorta feel as though I've always you know like I begin to think like all through life I've always felt like I've always been, I've always felt like I've been under pressure to have to say something. To have to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Prove. 0:29:57.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Prove myself. Sound intelligent, you know. High school, in classes I had to raise my hand and say things. And I look on some of, a lot of the times when I say anything in classes now, it's sorta comic relief kinds of things. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well who pressures you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Myself probably more than anybody else, you know. And like I know where it comes from. I don't know where the expectation of myself comes from that I have to be that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I guess it kinda you know comes in a way from proving to yourself something you're not so sure about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not being very sure of how intelligent I am or how capable I am. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kinda every time you open your mouth and say something..</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you see it's good effect like you can talk to these people in uptown.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it's, you feel better. Feel more comfortable. 0:31:02.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So that the expectation is just built in on the feelings of not being competent enough to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess that's..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then it kinda makes it all the more harder too because it's not like, like saying something has a lot at steak. It's not just saying something, you know, because it's interesting and you want to know. But it has much more implications for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, fear that it isn't interesting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right and fear that you're going to be put down. Or fear that it'll appear dumb.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it makes it all the more harder to say something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know because it's not just being able to think just about the thing and say something. It's thinking " I should say something. Will this sound impressive? What would sound?" Do you see what I mean? 0:31:58.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I do and I was thinking that even when I sit and am quiet and if I don't have something to make an input on, I get bored and I don't even listen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that wasn't the case last night. I was really interested in what he was saying. But rather often, even in like peer group discussions where it's not as likely to be put, my being put down for something I say. You know my roommates will be talking about something that I'm not sure I know enough about. And I really don't have anything to say. And I'll just get bored with it and don't listen any more. Just turn off to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm no longer interested in it. And one time I'm like, that bothers me. And sometimes it doesn't. But sometimes it bothers me that I'm not interested. You know that they're talking about something that I could probably learn something out of it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:33:04.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that I can't listen to it. That I get bored with it. I don't know it's sort of a reinforcement for being incompetent in it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not, that's why I'm not sure I understand. You mean because you're not interested in it, what does that have to do with incompetent in it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know. That I'm kinda thinking aloud and saying that I sit there and they're talking about something..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you turn off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just turn off because I don't have something to say. I get uninterested in it. And I just go off someplace else .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and you put yourself where, you know, you feel uncomfortable to me. It's like or you feel like this way you're certainly doing nothing to kinda help yourself feel any better about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can't even listen to it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And certainly can't say something. 0:33:59.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and like I always feel like the reason I turn off is because I can't make any input. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that so, is the reason you turn off because you can't make any input or because you're just bored at what they're saying? I mean I guess it's not (inaudible at 0:34:13.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That and, yeah, sometimes I don't understand exactly what they're saying. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. And kinda like you feel intellectually out of it. It's above you. You turn yourself off and don't listen. And then kinda feel like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get really torn between, you know like this morning in unit meeting in uptown and last night some of the things that they were saying were very labeled intellectualizations. Very social work professional terminology and words and all that crap. And I, ok and I can listen to that. And sometimes I don't understand the words they're using because I haven't taken the time to know what they mean. And then I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes they may be meaningless. 0:34:56.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, you know. And I'm drawn from that. And like there's this one woman who's a professional to the, you know, nth degree. And I'm drawn to another and where it says why is it so important to have to know all that shitty language and that, those terminology, you know. And where's the line between sensitivity to people and an understanding of working with people and just communicating on that level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Working with yourself. You know your mind and your common sense and your sensitivity as opposed to, you got to work with people because you know your words. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Theories. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I get really drawn between the two because I don't, sometimes because I don't always understand what they're saying. And I'm not always understanding where it's, how it's really applicable. And also because what sense does that really make to the person I'm going to deal with in treatment or in community organizing or whatever, you know? 0:36:03.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm afraid that I get, I'm afraid of being drawn into this label crap..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The world of labels and away from the world of people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And won't be able to talk to them because all I can talk in are these (chuckles) these things that don't mean anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I know the thing well [in that I've known] (ph)social workers all my life and a lot of them are notorious that way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. I think it gives them a sense that they understand what they're dealing with. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it's all just social workers either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Psychologists (inaudible at 0:36:35.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like just doctors, everybody. you know. They use these, they get, professionals you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's sort of scary. I sorta vowed when I came to school I didn't want to do that though I could easily do that. And it's part of needing to impress. Needing to prove myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's kinda like, I mean you know, it's probably partly why those people do it too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.0:37:01.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's kinda like on the one hand you could see yourself, "Well I could get into that because it would make me feel confident but then on the other hand it can kinda feel like heck what does it all mean?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like to have all those words and not understanding them, talk about (inaudible at 0:37:21.1) might make you feel like you knew what you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know, but I guess you kinda said you wouldn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I wouldn't in terms of really doing something. And I find myself, you know, back with kids that I used to work with and finding a gap developing because I've picked up some of the jargon. And I'm above them in terms of my vocabulary where I don't want to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'd rather communicate with them, at least I like to communicate with people where I'm at. But I'm finding out it becomes harder and harder to communicate with people who are at a lower level of education, lower level of vocabulary and stuff and I don't like that. 0:38:10.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kinda feel like you're to them what those super professionals are to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I have a real fear of being that. And I know that even sometimes I will do that because then I'm placed above. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and there it is. The "I don't like doing it but it sure can make me feel good and confident when I see myself above those people (inaudible at 0:38:35.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they see me as an educated person. A person that really knows what they're talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so you know I was thinking how I really am, in some of those..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like in two places. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In some of the problem is where I want to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and sometimes I want to be there. And then I was thinking of what we were just saying before about the expectations and the pressure I've placed on myself begin to force me more that direction than it does allow me to be able to relate to people as people. 0:39:11.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Relate to people as the way you are as a person to the way they are kinda in the way you would kinda naturally choose to do it yourself rather than because you needed to feel super competent or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like to do it kinda as it comes naturally to you instead as just an answer to your need to feel competent or proficient. 0:39:33.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that suggests to me a need to, you know, sorta begin being comfortable with myself wherever I am. And kinda just letting things happen without feeling the need to impress or, you know, or anything like that. That that's the only way I'm going to be able to be natural in both situations is not feel the need that I have to impress them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just kinda you know, be able to feel like "This is me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was thinking..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I don't need to have an effect or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Calculate out the effect and plan everything accordingly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it occurs to me..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, put on this face.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Part of it is, you know, part of it occurs to me that, you know, I've always had a need to talk or be dramatic or be the center, you know, be..0:40:29.8 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want a cigarette?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, please. You know, the dramatic thing and it's getting, I guess it's getting over that need too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Kinda to be on stage or something like that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feeling (ph) for what you do and appreciate you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When you say be on stage, first time you said it you sorta said beyond, and it's like yeah it is getting beyond that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, uh huh. That's not how I meant it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's, I guess, true too. Is to get beyond that need. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. To get beyond that need like with, "I don't have to feel the people looking at me and saying oh my God, is she smart."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And as I consider the situation I'm in presently of being pregnant, you know, it's sort of a test of being comfortable with myself too. And not being so concerned about what the hell you think of me. 0:41:33.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what decision I make, being comfortable with that decision myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's kinda like, "I'm pregnant. You know it's been hard for me to accept but I feel like I've come to grips with it and I'll make a decision and I'll accept it." It's kinda like that's a test whether you can kinda be your own source or something. Or, you know like, what you feel about it is the most important, more important than other people think about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And as I say that, you know, I discover that, I think at least right this moment, the only person who I'd feel uncomfortable making the decision to have an abortion would be Gary. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm, because he doesn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Necessarily buy into that, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kinda feel like he won't approve or..</p>

<p>CLIENT: He'll accept it, you know. But I value, you know I..0:42:32.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's an important person to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he really is an important person to me. He has a lot of influence, you know. And I began to feel that influence. I guess I began to feel that influence as I talked to him, you know. And it's funny I considered not talking to him about it and I decided that he's been sharing a great deal of himself with me. And I've never really had to present any kind of a problem that was almost to the point of not being able to deal with it, not coping with it, you know. And I began to feel I had to do that, part of to built our relationship, you know as part of a trust, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kinda like he's kinda related to you in an intimate way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know kinda like you felt, well you know, when you're really going through something you know, that the sharing of that would really be good for your relationship. 0:43:35.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like you know, we have a love relationship. And it's, I guess I find it really a really neat, neat thing. Because of difficulties and really getting close to men, you know. And I feel very comfortable with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And it's kinda important to see there's a man that you've found that you can really be close to like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, you know, I had thought, was it Wednesday or Thursday? That it was strange that I'd been, spent time Wednesday, more time Wednesday relating to two men about my situation. And it's probably the first time I've ever done that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It was, yeah. It's kinda like when you did relate it wasn't to men. 0:44:29.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I never, you know, I'd never talked to men about things that bother me. Except Don, you know, really. And it's kind of a nice feeling. It's sorta like a feeling that I'm, maybe I'm beginning to, rather than, that I am equal and unintimidated and not feeling like I have to be there, you know I just am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like they're people to and I'm a person and sex isn't a variable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. You know it's really, you know as I, and I thought of that and it was weird. And the very, the very weight of what I was relating, you know, probably one of the most serious things I've come in contact with in my life, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. The most serious thing but yet, you know, you found you just could do it and it kinda gave you a good feeling about yourself that, you know like I, you know, I can relate like..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. 0:45:31.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't, didn't feel intimidated and anxious. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, very comfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of a more well rounded feeling when you sit here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. It was like, I went home Wednesday. I'd left a note. I think I told you I'd left a note and said that including Juniper who's the puppy, including Juniper there are now six of us living here. (chuckles)That's the note I left. And I came back home and both my roommates, Jill and Daisy were home. Kevin's been out of town. They were both home and sitting at the kitchen table. And I came home and I was just very numb. I didn't have anything to say to anybody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Drained. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't have anything to say. And I, I knew they had a lot of expectations, you know. They really wanted to hear. And I went in and I sat down and kinda felt sympathy in a lot of ways. And also other things, you know, concern and all. And I sat there for a few minutes. And I didn't have anything to say. So all of a sudden I got up and I said, "Well, I don't see any need to sit around here like a mortuary." (chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:46:35.0</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was all I had. You know it was, and I couldn't say anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was kinda like you know, kinda the outpouring that they might have expected you couldn't see for yourself. You know it wasn't there. In some place it might have been there but it kinda wasn't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd done it and I didn't need to talk the whole thing through again, you know. And I guess they're accepting of it. I guess they lived through part of the outpouring before I even knew, you know. Just in terms of anticipating..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Worrying about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I, I didn't feel bad about it. It was just sorta funny. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I guess it was kinda funny to the other side that, you know, that you know, when you did talk about it, you were able to talk about it with men.0:47:27.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Was it Thursday morning? I guess Daisy and I were talking, and this is kinda unrelated to what we've been talking about so far, but we were talking about, I guess I mentioned, I was saying something about coming over here and talking to you about it. And she's been going over to the student mental health clinic and I think I'd mentioned it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was saying something about, you know one of the thing's we've been talking about, you know. how I can act very well. And it was about being pregnant. And I said well, I don't know, I guess I felt like, maybe it was about the, I don't know what it was. But I felt like I could deal with it all right. That I could go through it mechanically and all. And out of it she came with something that she felt like I, you know when I really feel down I really show it. 0:48:30.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just commented and I just said yeah sometimes that's overdone to get a response. And it was really strange that, you know and sometimes I felt like I'm overdramatic. She had no, it had never rung a bell for her at all that I was over being down or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just, that just occurred to me now in terms of they're sitting there waiting for something to come out and I didn't have anything..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. You didn't come through. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I didn't come through with all the emotions that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With all the emotions in the script. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of like, you know I felt like they were sitting there waiting for me to start crying and really pour out. And I didn't have to do that, you know, at all. You know it was really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that kinda give you a kinda good feeling too? Because well you know, you don't need everybody or every ear. You know and you know, I guess..</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I even thought about it that way. Hmm. I guess, you know, that may be part of it. I sorta came in and felt like I had to say something to them because they needed it. And decided after sitting there for several minutes..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More for them than for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and after sitting there several minutes I decided I was too tired, too numb to even do that, you know. And I you know, maybe I was letting them down. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And later Daisy said, "If you need anything, if you need me or anything, let me know." And she got the message that, otherwise I'll just make myself, you know, inconspicuous. 0:50:42.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like I'm there if you want me but otherwise, don't feel any, she wasn't clutching and saying, you know it was kinda like telling..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and like she got the message when we were sitting at the table that I just didn't need to do that. To talk about it or anything like that and it was ok. It really was. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Time's up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, Monday? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. 0:51:14.4</p>

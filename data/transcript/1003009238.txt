<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I guess you saw, what, November?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, how have things been, um, you know, how have things been going?  I know we talked a little about your significant other and I think you were going to work on that in therapy, perhaps with [NAME OTHER] or at least bring it up or something.  See if he was trainable, re-trainable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I don't want another kid to have to train.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, oh well, he's informed me that he doesn't have a problem and, uh,  so I'm just, uh, I'm just working on myself basically.  And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what he told you?  That he doesn't have a problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but he has, he doesn't have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A concept of what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is or anything else.  He's normal and, and, you know, he's just like his friends and where it's just a guy thing, and whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so.  He has an unhappy significant other.  That is in itself, should tell him something, but as you say, that's the problem.  So, um, I mean there's still things more subtly that you can do to kind of, you know, figure out what he wants and likes and kind of manipulate him, however you want to say it, or reward him for, you know, behavior that you're aiming for.  In some way if you can find something to reward him with.  Unfortunately, it is like a child that, I mean, uh, you know, you can, I mean, everything kind of involves some reward, you know.  If I didn't get paid, would I be working here?  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well not today anyway.  Not with the snow.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, not today.  I mean, you know, maybe I would do a little work, but I wouldn't be as motivated I guess.  Um, and I like what I do so that's, uh, [LAUGHING], you know what I'm saying, I mean.  But, so that must not have felt very positive, that's for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, not very positive at all.  Uh, he is behaving better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just, uh, you know, trying to be nicer and not agitated, um, you know, basically I've given him a list of things that I needed and he had no, it's like I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, this was a while back.  He went down and was just defensive and argued every single one like [INAUDIBLE].  And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he would tell you what you needed and didn't need?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was like, this is ridiculous, you know, whatever.  I'm sorry, unconditional love was one of them.  [LAUGHING].  Not just, you know, "Like me when I, when I, uh, when the house is clean like your mother cleans it," -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, or "I do what you expect me to do", or something, you know.  And when I brought that up the other day -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Magically -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He just said, "Well I don't know what you want."  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He just doesn't, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.  That's, but that's different.  That's a little different.  And he can't read your mind and, in fact, he can't get subtle clues or you have to smack him over the head with it, or stick it in his face, um, or he can't get it.  But that's actually, I don't know, did you, was that a positive thing in your mind when he said, " I don't know what you want."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yes, but I guess I've just been, uh, so frustrated with it that, um, he's, now I don't know what I want.  [LAUGHING].  I can't, like, if I wanted -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do I even want to go to all this effort or if I, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well one thing you can't have is spontaneously getting, you know, what you want, because that doesn't, that hasn't happened.  He doesn't have any clue.  I mean, and I know you've mentioned last time, "Well, you know, it's different.  It doesn't feel the same if you have to ask", you know, and that's, you know, that is true of course, but, um, but, you know, but he's like the opposite of a mind reader.  You know, clues aren't good enough.  You know, you gave him this list in writing.  That's what he needs.  You know, and then, um, I, I don't know, I mean, I guess it's, uh, you know, like in any, I guess, new relationship, you know, whatever.  How do you know what the other person likes?  What feels good to them?  I mean, we can just use an analogy physically.  I mean, you know, "No, that doesn't feel good," or "That, that's, let's do this over here," whatever it is, you know.  Um, you know, it's better, it feels better if you don't say that and you're waiting for them to guess, it doesn't, you don't get what you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I understand that.  I guess there's, I don't know how to handle the, um, like I'm a very feeling-oriented person -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm pretty much the opposite of him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I mean, I'm emotionally driven, emotionally sensitive, you know, I'll take up pretty well around other people's emotions -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, feelings, I mean, so, you know, empathy scale, we're polar opposites.  A lot of things, we're polar opposites.  Um, so I really don't know how to bridge that gap because there's always going to be, um, that disconnect with him.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess if I teach him what I, you know, contribute to this earth is of some value, like the things I do are not of value.  You know, I spend all this time working at church and, um, doing music, and, um, artistic -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And all he has to do is think about work, okay?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, no, I know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All he has to do is think about work.  I pay the bills at home.  I make sure the kids get everywhere.  I figure out what is for dinner.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Run the business.  Okay, so I do all the paperwork for the business.  Um, you know, anything that has to do with the family, I do it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All he has to do is show up and eat and go to bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eat and yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, occasionally I ask him to do something, but then that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, that's, you know, if I can't take the kids to something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but maybe he'd like [INAUDIBLE], you know, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then he tells me, I don't do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And see, all these things that I do, I'm not necessarily that good at either, that I'm forced to do, because I'm like, ADD, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like, I have to work hard at it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You don't have to be the one to train him completely.  But, I mean, he has to at some point have some reason to want things to be more peaceful to be, to be able to understand you and what you want.  Um, so he does, he'll do better with regular tasks.  Does he come home early any night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But not, not the same night ever, whatever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's inconsistent when he comes home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he can work overtime, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he's a hour away.  He works in [DEIDENTIFIED], so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Does he have any, does he ever cook?  Never.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Rarely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he can?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I've, I have been sick for the past month.  I've had, uh, that bad cough that went down into my chest and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, so he actually cooked something when I was gone on Sunday.  He made Ra, he made Ramen noodles and opened a can of chicken and put it in it.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [COUGHING].  When he does cook, it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He rarely cooks on the grill anymore.  But anyway, that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe if, if you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well not really.  I mean, maybe if one night, I think it might be easier if you pull, you know, you pull him in to the family and make him feel more -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well he's working on improving his kids, I mean, his relationship with his kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, if you could say, you know, Wednesday night is his night to cook.  He can grill something, I mean, whatever, whatever you do with it, you're grilling something, you know.  But, you know, that's, he needs, so he needs to be home by this, whatever time and, uh, I don't know, I mean, do you talk to [NAME OTHER] about this stuff at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, not so much, not so much recently, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because this is, because this is something to live with.  It's, it's like, you know, I mean either, you know, you, I don't know, whatever, you got, uh, you know, something that's, um, ripe on the verge of being rotten, but not quite.  You can either cook it and make something with it like applesauce if it's apples.  I mean, you got that, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or throw it at him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or throw it at him, right.  So, but it shouldn't be up to you to do everything.  I mean, you might have to initiate a lot of the things, but, you know, uh, he may feel more part of things if he knows that every Wednesday he's going to be grilling something.  You know, it's his night to cook and whatever it is he, you know, just give it to him when he gets home, "Here, grill."  [LAUGHING].  I mean, I don't know if he would balk at that at first.  Eventually he would probably do it, but, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, these are, these are little things.  I mean, the big thing is that we don't even talk about our relationship at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well there's nothing wrong with him, so what would you talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so that's just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just find that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you could -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It irritates me that he irritates me and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> His, well I'm sure the thought of him, looking at him, anything irritates you about him because it's like he's not like a normal human like you thought he might be at first, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, he has his moments, but that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you got, yeah, I mean, it's like, you got to start someplace and if you can give him things, he's probably better at structure and routine, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, he gets up every morning, 4:00 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, goes through a little routine, has coffee -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever, out the door.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Comes home and then, our home business he does a lot of work for.  He'll work until 8:00 and then off to bed pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, um, or, you know, I don't know.  Saturday, how many kids do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE], [AGE] and [AGE] until Friday, one's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  It sounds better at [AGE], [AGE], and [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever age like, they were like 18 months apart, but, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds better like you were really out of your mind.  I'm -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am, I'm, you know, I'm getting a little of that too, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What if, you know, if Saturday morning you went out to breakfast or something?  Either he took them out to breakfast.  I mean, if they want to go, they wouldn't be up, I don't know, something.  Whatever.  How often do you see [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I do see her, um, once a week and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now with Christmas break and being sick, I, uh, I hadn't scheduled any appointments.  I kind of wanted to get into, um, family assistance [INAUDIBLE] and try to work on that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because that seems to be, um, it offers a more direct solution for me.  You know, I'm just sort of trying to break patterns of behavior that are nonproductive, um, you know.  For example, I, I guess it was comfortable with [NAME OTHER], um, you know, I've talked about [NAME OTHER], keep talking to my mom about my relationship and she's ended up with palpitations in the hospital and both times and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you talk to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and so we really don't talk about, you know, the hard stuff.  And I get a little, one of those little wooden angels [INAUDIBLE], you know, with the wire, you know, thinking about [INAUDIBLE] she gave me for Christmas.  So, we don't, we don't talk about, you know.  We don't talk about the hard stuff.  And so, you know, we don't talk about the hard stuff.  [NAME OTHER] is like that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I just don't, I don't function well like that, so.  At any rate, we haven't talked about my medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We haven't, are you still taking it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking the Pristiq, and I'm taking, um, I ran out of Adderall.  I don't have Adderall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking 2 Pristiq?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, just one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think 2 is too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're just taking 1.  All right.  That's why you had enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now remind me what this does?  The Pristiq, it has a little bit of serotonin -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and norepinephrine, and it's, it's good for anxiety, depression -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, I, I am concerned about my memory.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like Sunday, I was trying to, uh, it took me a half an hour or more or longer to remember what an apostrophe was called.  I mean, it just wasn't coming to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's new or that's not new?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, new?  That would be new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like the word-finding stuff is new?  The word-finding problems?  I mean, I don't, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know that it's new, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, are you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just that there were this, there was this thing on Friday that's called, P'Raising the Roof, but it's P, apostrophe, Raising the Roof.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was like, "Comma, no.  What is it?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, were you on, did you take Adderall that day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Either you're, you might be more aware of having this happen because you can focus better maybe, or maybe it's getting, it's not, it's worse than it was because of all this stuff that's going on in your mind and thinking about things and how things, uh, didn't exactly, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, turn out like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have been, I've been trying to focus on, uh, being at peace actually the last few weeks -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, you know, just kind of working on that with myself and with the kids and, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am sleeping.  My only question was that I don't, I think, I would like to try to get off the sleeping medication because I take that every night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Lunesta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, they gave me Bactrim to get rid of my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bronchitis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had an allergic reaction to that and, um, I really wasn't sleeping well when I was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of reaction?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, severe headache, um, eventually I had a rash on my chest, um, blurry vision, felt dizzy-headed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I had taken it for almost a week -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, when the rash showed up.  So I didn't know if sulfa drug.  At any rate, it just seemed like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's something, are you allergic to sulfa drugs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm really, really, I think so?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, there's some, from what I understand there might be some -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that's the fear of reaction [INAUDIBLE] that the reaction?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there might be some cross reactivity with Bactrim.  I don't know.  I had an allergic reaction.  I had, like, weird sores -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mother was really -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All in my soft palate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well she had done, when I told her that, it was a sulfa drug that she took -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she had bleeding in her, uh, urine, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Geez.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was her reaction.  She had scarlet fever and they gave her that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They gave her Bactrim for scarlet fever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not Bactrim but a similar drug, whatever, whatever it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Now, what, the Lunesta, I don't, I have a few, but you didn't have a script, right?  You just had samples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I think so.  You know, I've had a script -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they'll fill it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you taking 3s, because I have like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I ended up taking a 3 instead of a half, like when I was taking the other medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I have like a handful of 2s, that's all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I usually cut them in half.  I mean, they also put me on prednisone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is this the script?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's something else.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was looking for it but I picked up the wrong thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Will your insurance cover it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I went past my deductible, at least for now, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so you want me to write for the 3s and you can cut them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  All right.  Here's this.  Here's the Adderall.  Do you need regular Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, um, occasionally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need anymore or do you have some?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't have any.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have any, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where's the date on this.  "Expires [DATE]," so I do have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lunesta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, something else.  I just put -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You what?  Oh, no that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I put them all in here.  I just put them all in one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three milligrams.  You have refills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does it say refills?  One refill, I guess, it says.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  When did we give this to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DATE].  No but they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It expires [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, all right.  So they gave you the script on [DATE]?  Yeah, that's still good, but, I mean, if it's not, here's another one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  And I'll give you the Adderall.  So you don't, it's 5 mg, you take it occasionally?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, what?  The 4-hour stuff?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  All right.</p>

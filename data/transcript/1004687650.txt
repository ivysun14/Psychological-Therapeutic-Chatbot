<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm so out of it today (laughs). It may not be my most coherent day ever (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if we start with scheduling. I'm trying to remember...right. And we figured out that last time, you're gonna let me know around when you get back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'll let you know in August. Cuz I'll have my return ticket, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll let you know. Uh (laughs)...oh man. Yeah I'm so sleepy and I have no good reason to be sleepy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But for some reason for the last week or so it's been like I have mono again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've just been like freakishly tired. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and yeah I'm not quite sure what it is, but I worry that I have another food allergy which would be a huge hassle cuz I seem to get more tired when I eat or drink alcohol. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which (inaudible at 00:01:24].3) always get more tired when you drink alcohol, but like it's been sort of like...I haven't been reacting so well, so it's really (pause) um, so yeah it's sort of irritating. I think I had a week after getting back from the retreat where I felt really like (inaudible at 00:01:46].4)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...reading fiction every day and really like, ya know, feeling pretty good. [0:01:51.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah you were feeling pretty great last time we talked. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, and then I started focusing on other things and got to feeling a little bit more like negative ways I felt in the past (laughs) which was disappointing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to have more than a week of feeling (inaudible at 00:02:21].9). Again I don't know how much of it is just some physical thing that I haven't figured out yet. Like maybe I need to stop eating soy and then I won't be so tired all the time and everything will be easy, but, uh...I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, me either. (pause) What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, oh! I guess it's funny because ya know when I was starting to feel worse and worse last time like, it was like I'm like I wasn't sure how much of it was physical and how much of it was mental and you know I still don't really know because just so many different things are going on and like the proportions of it are sort of (inaudible at 00:03:15].1) serious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I think this time it's like I can tell that I feel worse every time after I eat or have...or drink something other than water, and sometimes that, which is a clue, um, but I also 3 nights in a row this week had dreams that seemed sort of like the dreams I used to have that were trying to tell me thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. [0:03:46.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...just because certain scenes in the dream would be emphasized with my memory in a way that said like you are supposed to remember this scene. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to talk about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sure. Um, the first night I remember sort of a large sequence but one particular scene seemed foremost in importance, even though I remember it of, ya know, a larger sequence pretty well. Um, but the part that was important was my mom called me home to say there was a problem with my pet hamster. I've never had a pet hamster but I always sort of felt sorry for people that had hamsters when I would see them because people always keep them in such small cages. Like even the sort of big hamsters? Ya know they're in the same size cages like the little mouse hamsters and they're always like pretty bored (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so yeah in my dream I like went home and saw this, like really like beautiful like big glossy hamster in a sort of large fish tank-looking thing and took it out to see what was up and it like jumped out of my hand and started ya know hiding under the furniture and I would like lift different pieces of furniture and it would just zoom under something else before I could catch it. Um, and something about the speed and intensity with which it was running away was bothering me, but like my pet hamster didn't want to be around me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. [0:05:26.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I got really determined to catch it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, and took a sort of bisected fruit box that, so ya know it was like there was open space on the two sides but then the line in the middle where they joined and I was trying to catch the hamster...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, so I don't get it about the fruit box. So...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there were two halves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess...it was like an orange crate but like a cardboard box...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but you could open like a jewelry box or a music box...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or something. Um, and it was the concept of putting a jar over a spider. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Except, ya know, the hamster was a Ball jar. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I get it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Um, and so like the hamster ran out and I had this box and I like slammed the box down and then I freaked out because I was like what if I slammed the center line on top of the hamster and like I could have like just killed my hamster. I can't believe I just did that. And I lifted the box a little and the hamster zoomed out again (laughs) but at that point I felt really shitty cuz like I had (inaudible at 00:06:34].3) it's life. Um, and then it ran into this like...you know the dream took place in my house in Texas which has some doorways without doors in them...and they're not supposed to have doors and they're just like, ya know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it like laid down in the middle of one of those doors and like played dead really convincingly and I recognized that it was playing dead but I was sort of like fascinated by why I thought that I was a good idea, and like my dog that I had as a child came over and started sniffing and I like shooed her away cuz I was worried she might bite it, and...and I realized it would be like a really good time to catch the hamster since it was like immobile so I kept wondering how close I could get to it without it moving. I'm like what it was thinking. Um, and then it like ran away again, and then I finally managed to catch it with my hands and I was really afraid it was going to bite my hands. Um, and then...but it didn't and then I put it in a neat house which was like this weird thing that looked sort of like a doll house or like, ya know, My Little Pony house, ya know? Something more like plastic with sort of humanoid like table and chair things that I thought the hamster would probably (laughs) enjoy (laughs) (inaudible at 00:08:05].8). And I asked my mom if we were going to get a hamster wheel to put in there and she said like no, like a hamster of that size is too smart to be entertained by like running in place on a hamster wheel, and that's where it ends (laughs). I don't know (laughs). And it's sort of rare to remember a sequence like that in such clear detail. Um, and just like the sensation of feeling (A) like sorry for the hamster and like worrying that it would starve if it just ran loose in the house, so feeling like I ought to catch it but also feeling very bad about catching it and putting it in a small house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:08:53.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and just being alarmed at like the person that made me as I was running around trying to catch it. Um (pause) yeah, so there was that one. Uh, and then the next night there was another long sequence of which I remember parts. But the part that stood out very vividly was um going on a drive to a lake that I had enjoyed as a child with driving in a nice convertible with Seth and I was driving and like showing him this place he'd never seen. And I remembered that there were like starfish you could see under the water, um, which so (yawns) I went canoeing with Seth at a lake that was sort of like this...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, when I was a child, but...so driving there the road was like strangely windy and you couldn't really see what was ahead and since I was a child the starfish had grown extremely large and more like fast and flexible and they could also live out of the water, so there were trees full of starfish, really large starfish, and um I started to get nervous because we were in a convertible and we couldn't close the top and the starfish in the trees were sort of threatening...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and they were starting to sort of like wave their arms and show interest in us, and it seems that one of them communicated to me somehow through just a telepathic message that it like was thinking about, ya know, jumping into the car and like covering my face and like eating me and suffocating me, which was pretty terrifying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And at that point like the road looked like it might be in danger of going into the water or something or, ya know, becoming very dangerous (laughs). Um, so there was that one. And then the next night, ya know, it was another long narrative, but um the scary part was I was going back and forth between being myself and this character. Did you ever watch the TV show Battlestar Galatica?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The recent one? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I haven't seen it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's so good. You should watch it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) But, um (laughs) and there's, there's like the character I relate to the most, her name is Sharon and um...so at first you think she is just like a normal crew member and then she finds out, like I think in the second season or something, that she's actually a Cylon, and the Cylons are this sort of like mechanized android-like species that um, so like the humans created to help them with practical matters.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And they got more and more intelligent...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and eventually created ones that looked just like humans and they're like pretty impossible to tell apart from a human, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. At least through the first season anyway. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I mean she didn't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she found out. Um, and like that particular Sharon dies but then another Sharon model comes back who always knew she was a Cylon and is like much better adjusted. [0:12:40.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and lives among the humans and like marries a human. Um, so here I tell you to watch it and then I go spoiling everything for you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I feel terrible. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of a professional hazard. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) The whole thing just gets ruined for you (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so yeah it's kind of funny but um and then like ya know Seth when I told him that like that was my favorite character he was like oh, of course, like you're not actually human. Of course you can relate to her. (laughs) Um (laughs), so in the dream somehow I was going back and forth between being myself and being Sharon and somehow we...I mean were like the same person sort of but just at different point. Um, and there was some child that had come into our care somehow, I think through the sort of things that happen inside my situation (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Children show up for me to care for them...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...because you're on some sort of mission. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I mean it was one of those dreams where things kept changing. It wasn't like the other two...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:13:59.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...where it was like I was one person and the situation, the narrative continued. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like this one, but I (inaudible at 00:14:09].9) a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but the child was sometimes a child and sometimes a doll that was alive and could walk, much like the horror movie dolls that come to life. Um, and like I remember I had, ya know, like given it a name since it doesn't seem to have one, and it was clearly a very troubled child and it would play with knives a lot when it wasn't being watched carefully. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So there'd be a lot of moments of like losing track of it and then coming back to find that it was, ya know, setting things on fire or playing with knives. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But even still feeling sort of obligated to watch it cuz like, you know, I couldn't let it starve...much like the hamster (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and it became clearer that it was like a doll and somehow there were like flashbacks to child slash doll's past in which it looked a lot like me when I was a child and was having its hair burnt somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did that happen to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I did catch my hair on fire by accident once. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I was just lighting candles to put in Halloween Jack-O-Lanterns and I had the hair down to my waist so I didn't always know what I was doing and it was getting in the candles (laughs) at that time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you get burned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but my hair did get burned such that there was like a gradation of um like frizzy hair I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and you know it took a while to like to get the burned parts out. Um, so, so it was very strange. Feeling like I was like a strange child and sort of my past self a little bit and this doll. Um, and so during the mission we were escaping from alien forces that were trying to kill us all (laughs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Naturally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and we had found like this small like cluster of humans who were living in like a science experiment facility of some sort and they could lock themselves underground and be safe from the invading forces and um, so we got to their compound. Just barely got in with the aliens on our tail of course because it was a sci-fi story so of course they were like right there before the door closed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right down the hall with the doors closing, there they are. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. (laughs) But once we got to like the people who were sort of letting us in through the turnstile, um, we saw that they were making some of these, ya know, walking/talking doll creatures and there was like a model of the one we had who had somehow developed like 5 eyes over the course of things and it had like the model's name on it. It was sort of similar to the name that I had given it, but different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so the child/doll like saw itself and like totally freaked out at me, which I was Sharon at the time and like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and like got furious for like having the wrong name. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like not being told who she was, and although you know I had no idea that there were these doll experiments being created (laughs). Um, and at that point I was like really started fearing for my safety and that the child/doll was going to like freak out and kill me with some knives she might have stored on her person. Um, then I don't remember what happened next, but...so it was all like these like threatening interactions (laughs) with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...these things that I still caused to be subservient. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. Um, (pause) uh (pause) I guess I thought about it a bit differently. Um, the fear struck me but (pause) I guess I had you cast as the hamster as well yourself...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...or as sort of child/doll as well as yourself. I mean...as well as yourself and Sharon. Um, in that...like that hamster seems very frightened (pause) of being caught or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the kid too I guess? The playing with knives or somehow seems to be quite vulnerable and something, I'm just entirely sure. But he's in danger anyway. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And has to be watched carefully. Um (pause), um (pause). I don't know. I guess I think about or wonder about, ya know, your fear of feeling so unsafe and so kind of vulnerable or exposed being back here. I mean it sounded like you felt so much safer and more confident in addition to like well treated and among your people in a way. I guess safety was kind of part of it and was so different from how things have felt here where you really, ya know, needed to avoid so much in order to feel at all comfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:22:37.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One might say to zoom away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I wonder if you worry that won't come back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:57].3) moments coming back or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I hope I'm (inaudible at 00:23:05].4) but ya know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I do worry about it and um I feel like even sort of bad worrying about it because it seems like worrying about it is almost like inviting it back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I wish I could just like keep riding that wave from the retreat. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, cuz once you're living an extremely clean world in a certain way, you sort of wonder why you have to stop that. Like maybe if you just don't let yourself slip back for a moment you can just keep going and (laughs) um...and it sort of felt like coming back and sort of like dragging me down into old mental patterns and I don't really know why. Um, cuz I would like to fix it. I'm the main driver behind my feelings and experiences and...but just going into the same rooms and seeing the same people doesn't have to just drag me back to completely different phase of my life (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:24:22.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't like to think that my environment has so much power over me. And it's like stupid why...cuz it's not like anything has happened while I've been back that would like (inaudible at 00:24:36].2). Um except like you know I've been trying not to write fiction because I have so many other things to do right now that should be a higher priority. Um, it's the only thing I've been doing that seems risky (inaudible at 00:24:59].5). Um, and you know instead of (inaudible at 00:25:05].2) things since I came back that, um, just having...I mean writing really puts me in touch I think with a lot of different like layers of my experience and ya know I know I feel like I'm in touch with like a deeper more whole self, like on a regular basis when I'm writing regularly...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I think there...yeah, yeah. When I'm, ya know, when that's a big part of my life it's, it's great and so uh not having that in the last week it's been a little bit strange and it's hard to know whether it's because like I do have some (inaudible at 00:25:50].9) or I'm sick or sort of would rather not think, which is maybe (inaudible at 00:26:00].4) or whatever still does have more power than I would really like to think, and it's sort of time to like screw things up since I'm not giving it what it wants and it's like making me sick. But I really hope that without sort of the Wellbutrin to destabilize things and give it like an entrée into...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...my nervous system, without like the birth control it's just like screwing up my hormones.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But everything would be more stable and not so easy to just unsettle um for very small reasons like taking a week off from fiction writing which doesn't seem like a change still (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (pause) But is the mechanisms concern. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's what it wants you to be doing is writing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And when I was at the retreat and writing a lot here in the week after...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like I didn't really feel like there was some mechanism that like this other thing that was trying to push an agenda in mysterious ways that I couldn't fathom like...and it was, ya know, when I was like working with the textbook writing, um, I didn't feel that as much, but then at The retreat like I really felt pretty normal again. Um, and ya know it really would be nice to think that everything is totally like reintegrated and stable and I don't want to sort of give it another avenue just by like being paranoid and questioning things and sort of like call it up again almost. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it almost seems like one of those horror movie demons where you shouldn't say his name 3 times or it will come back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...what to think, um, and how much sort of like credit to give it for things that have gone wrong in the past. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and ya know having had experiences in the past 2 months where my mind really was working normally um sort of puts in relief how...like the degree to which my mind just was not working in the past and um, ya know, when that was the status quo I think it was a lot easier to think oh, everyone...everyone's mind feels like this and I'm just really bad at getting past it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:29:59.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I mean now I'm able to really feel like, ya know, her mind doesn't work like that. Like even mine doesn't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) And that was not at all like something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that makes me think of the Battlestar Galatica scene, ya know. The sort of you slash Sharon and child slash doll characters, that kind of fluidity...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...between something or someone like that's human and someone that's not quite...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and with both like Sharon and the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...when it was like definitely a doll, I mean part of the tension in the show is that I mean they seem so human but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that it seems sort of unethical to deny them...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that designation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I think in thinking about the mechanism I'm always really uncomfortable saying it's either, ya know, like an authentic part of me that I tried to stifle or it's not...it's just the sort of like negative formation of reactions that was more like a sickness or something. Maybe it's a lot of resistance of thinking of it as that because in the past when I tried to agree with that way like it would seem like it was getting angry and I could feel like sort of like flares of energy in my brain that were negative reactions to those thoughts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it (pause) possible that it's the opposite? That it's (pause), uh, a very authentic part of yourself, the one that wants things the rest of you can find pretty questionable. I guess here's why I'm thinking that way. It...I mean there are a lot of examples like this but to take the most recent one you mentioned, it wants you to write fiction which is something that you love it sounds like pretty much above anything else to do and that feels the most genuine and the most sort of, I don't know, whole. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things you can be doing. And (pause) I guess the problem in a way seems to be like how devoted the mechanism is to what feels most crucially you and the way that it like comes into conflict with other things in life. I know it feels...or I have the impression it feels like something other as you hear from it. So what it wants sort of could be more you in a way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's sort of the like the uncanny thing about it is that it seems other but it's so familiar and deep at the same time that I can never quite like disown it. I...I think you know that's obvious to me as a lie. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it's also very strange because it seems like there are certain things that it is just totally unaware of, like getting practical sometimes for instance. I mean like when it was...when it still had like a channel with the Wellbutrin and everything and could like communicate better formed ideas...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like they were just like so full of logical holes (laughs). We'd be like what is this thing that is somehow like part of myself but hasn't really been paying attention to how the world work (laughs). They're like it doesn't know all of these things that I know, and ya know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like emotional life to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ya know what I mean? Like not necessarily taking any kind of reality, any kind of reality and ya know having kind of obvious logical flaws or inconsistencies. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's so. (pause) I guess it's strange to see an emotional life coming up with like plans for how I'm supposed to live my life and just seeing how sort of impossible they are. And getting punished for not acting on them. Like it wanting me to go live in a cabin in the woods and eat roots and berries and stop talking to people. Like I don't even know what like berries are poisonous and which ones aren't. Like thinking that that would be somehow safer than normal life (laughs). [0:35:48.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but I mean is that where a dream...it wouldn't be that hard to figure out isn't the right word, but at least like get the gist of. I mean at one level living in a cabin and eating roots and berries would be safer. I mean you wouldn't have to worry about food allergies and you wouldn't have to worry about scaring other people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I understand that in reality (chuckles) that has problems, yeah. But I don't know, I guess I sort of thought about it as a dream or a fantasy. It doesn't seem (pause) like that strange or opaque to me. I don't know. Maybe sometimes that it feels like also literal, ya know, just like that's the way it feels in your head. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ya know maybe I'm talking like...maybe it's marked by more than mentalist than denial in a way, ya know what I mean? Like (pause) no, either it's a metaphor like get in the fuckin' cabin and like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it seems like something I was actually supposed to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I'm literal minded. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which (inaudible at 00:37:32].2) sort of like threatening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And as we've talked about this I'm getting some slight visual disturbances. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, thanks for letting me know. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we reviewed the opposite plan too which was to give away all my possessions and go to New York and start like, ya know, in the anti-capitalist collective to try to, ya know, overcome capitalist government. (laughs). Sort of. Not like...I mean at least it didn't want me to assemble an army or something. That would have been worse. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like getting a group of like guerilla artists and activists together was like a little unpractical than like getting a bunch of guns or something (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it's still not very practical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And not very safe. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) I guess it's kind of paranoid. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) You know I mean in both situations you don't have to trust people that much cuz like in the cabin there are no other people and when you're trying to sort of overturn the government like in a situation in which you like (inaudible at 00:39:16].9) and you don't know who you can trust. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I might even go a bit further than to say like being in a cabin by yourself in the woods you don't have to trust that many people. I mean it kind of suggest you don't. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Overthrowing the government is not just about eh not trusting people so much...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but like feeling that the regimen is terribly dangerous and problematic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like (inaudible at 00:39:42].8) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). Um, yeah it was just so strange to be genuinely expected to do one of those two things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And for something inside me not to understand why I wouldn't want to. Or just say oh, well that's just laziness. You don't really care about your ideals or the truths you know. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so dictatorial too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and so judgmental. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: With my choices and the compromises that I make because I think they are probably the safest...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...thing I actually could be doing in practical terms. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I mean having had like a month or so of normalcy, it's, ya know, it's weird thinking about those times. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm, I'm sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's definitely a desire to sort of like whitewash that period of my life and say oh, those things weren't really happening and sort of exaggerating the memory or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but then ya know that also seems very dangerous and like it would be like the way not to learn the lesson for many of us. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. The more I thought about it, like the dreams actually seem to capture it pretty well, if like the hamster or the starfish are more like the mechanism that you're sort of sometimes scared of and that seems sort of bizarre like the starfish or that you're trying (inaudible at 00:41:55].6) really trying to manage and keep a lid on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the progression from the hamster to the starfish was interesting because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the hamster was so relatable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really like felt for that hamster and felt very bad for putting this like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...beautiful, intelligent creature in a little cage. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could understand everything I was feeling. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it just wanted a nice little buddy at some point. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Yeah, and I was like genuinely like very sorry that I couldn't communicate to it that I just didn't want it to starve, but then with the starfish I mean they really weren't relatable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they were things that had changed in nature and grown and mobilized while I was away and that made is much scarier (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We're gonna stop for now. Um, on that note thanks for the (inaudible [00:43:07].2). </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, yeah, I hope you have a really good month. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. You too. I'll send you an e-mail. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, that sounds good and I guess I'll send you a bill at some point. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I can mail you a check. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Alright. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, take care. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You too. [0:43:38.7] </p>

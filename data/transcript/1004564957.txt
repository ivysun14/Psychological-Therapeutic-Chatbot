<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I remember we were talking about something on Friday that (inaudible at 00:00:15). I don't remember what it was. So part of not remembering what it was is also that I want to talk about but not today if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I still don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let me figure out what we were talking about on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you rather do? Would you rather go through that and figure it out or do you want to talk about what it is that you do want to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I want to do the other first and then figure out next week. [00:01:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are we on for Friday this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Just when you said we'll talk about it next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I meant Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just want to make sure I hadn't missed anything which I am prone to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, as am I. So I kind of just like the whole weekend was kind of off. And that way I couldn't fall asleep. Friday I went to bed around 3:00 and woke up around 9:00 which I don't usually do. And a friend asked to come over and I had [inaudible] show which I had been joking that we should do. I was like yeah that sounds cool. And they (inaudible at 00:01:52) an hour and a half. And as I was getting ready to go he offered - he's like well I could just hang out here and then we could see the rest of the show when your pedicure is done. I'm like oh that sounds good. And he commented that he really wanted to do something repetitive and relaxing and asked if he could do the dishes. I was like yes I would let you do the dishes. That sounds amazing. [00:02:23]</p>

<p>Ashby was out so I texted everybody and like hey Colin just asked if he could stay here and do the dishes while I'm gone. I hope that's okay. I said yes. I'm leaving the house in five minutes. And then Ashby's actually super upset. She's like I'm not okay with this. You didn't give me a chance to say yes and this whole thing. I'm like oh God because I could tell that she was starting to do this. What she said was it should've been completely obvious to you that I wouldn't want this happen. I can't understand why you didn't know that, and it's all horrible and ruined, and you can't tell Colin that he should leave because that was rude. Oh was like oh my God. [00:03:08]</p>

<p>So I texted back and forth with here a little bit and I'm just like Jesus Christ. So finally I call her and she's clearly half crying. I'm like I'll tell Colin to leave. It's fine. She's like no you hate me. We did that for a little while. I talked to Colin. Apparently even though it would've been rude to ask him to leave she already had flipped out as to why she didn't want him there to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh she came home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She had come home. She was at the gym. She came home. First she got my text and she's like well I'm already on the way home. I'm like Ashby I'm going to be gone in five minutes, but I was trying to... And so she came home and told Colin that she completely didn't want him there, etcetera. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>And so one of the things that we've been back and forthing on for years is she doesn't want to have guests over unless everything is immaculate. And I don't care that much. And also we've just both got back from vacation. Our kitchen floor was greasy, and I'm like it's fine. But to her when she walked in Colin couldn't do the dishes, which to me was awesome, was to her oh my God he's so revolted by everything. I'm like oh. So that's fucked. I had talked to both of them and it was just very awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like the world's least relaxing pedicure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, pretty much. Fortunately I was with - her partner pulls a lot of the same thing so she's like do this, do this. I'm like okay. She suggested that I buy Ashby lunch and (inaudible at 00:05:04) because she also tends to exercise, and come home starving, and then not eat. (inaudible at 00:05:13). So it was just kind of a blah, yucky Saturday. And Sunday night I was just like I still feel kind of yucky like I was tired, and dehydrated, and vaguely cranky. [00:05:29]</p>

<p>And also then I'm going to a drag show tonight which I'm excited about except for most of my make-up is packed up from when I went to the convention. So I can't have all my sparkle stuff. Ninety-five percent of my sparkle is packed (inaudible at 00:05:51). And so I was cranky about that then I worked it out; whatever. So my parents called. Actually I didn't want to talk to them. I'm tired and cranky. And then they sent me an e-mail that my cousin Daniel was in the hospital then didn't answer when I called right back which was super horrible. [00:06:20]</p>

<p>So my cousin Daniel is on my dad's side and he is my age. I do like him. He's convinced I need a man in my life and that I should live closer to my parents because - there's not really a good reason. He's like you need a man. You need family around. And I don't know. And I told him I'm not straight, but he's like yeah but still. He's just very... It's weird. [00:07:04]</p>

<p>So his mom, my aunt Vivienne, is my dad's youngest sister and he was pretty spoiled. He was an only child. His parents kind of weren't the most mature parents and tended to both spoil him and then use toys and attention to pit him against each other I guess if that makes sense. And so he had a very troubled relationship with his mom and with his father kind of off and on. And at one point when he was like six he moved in with my grandmother. He was six or seven. And he didn't know all of his alphabet. He couldn't write very well. And so my grandma was like we are going to sort this shit out. And he stayed with her for like eight months, and she was really working on everything, and then she died. [00:08:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was sudden and unexpected. And the other thing that was really horrible about it is she refused to go to the hospital in an ambulance. She didn't want to go to the hospital because she's scared of hospitals and she would not get in the ambulance. So she was driven by one of my uncles and they got there and basically died. (inaudible at 00:08:54) what our family had thought at the time and the doctor kind of said the stress of getting into an ambulance probably would've killed her. Like she's probably having a heart attack. It was one of those things where it's like well the stress might have killed her but it also might have saved her life. There's no way to know. So that was really devastating to my cousin. [00:09:23]</p>

<p>He went back to his mother and his dad off and on. And at one point he was just very angry at his mom and he used to do things like try to scare her. Like he would hide on the enclosed porch with friends and jump out when she came in. He smashed the window of her car one time while she was in it. He would just yell and say horrible things. And when he was like (inaudible at 00:09:56) his father's brothers, a couple of them, introduced him to drugs and alcohol when he was like 16 or 17 also which was not great. Also he has ADD that was never really dealt with, and he has a lot of anger management issues which were not helped by drinking a lot and doing drugs. [00:10:26]</p>

<p>So he's been in jail on felonies twice. And he has a kid. He has a daughter whose like 14. And so what was good was that he kept up with his child support and when in jail he had my aunt pay half the child support because it was really important to him that he do that. And then after being in jail the second time he actually managed to sober up. I'm not sure he stopped drinking completely, but he stopped doing drugs which was great. So the last maybe six or eight years, something like that, he's been really trying to turn his life around. He's specific I'm not hanging out with anyone from my (inaudible at 00:11:34) of his family because of the drugs. That's valid. And he's trying not to hang out with people he used to hang out with. [00:11:41]</p>

<p>He has this really great long term girlfriend who's been very helpful, but he already did a number on his body with a lot of drugs and alcohol. And her parents paid for him. He has unrooted teeth so my dad and my aunt basically paid to get dentures which was good. He was very self conscious of it. But five years ago he was diagnosed with diabetes and decided not to manage it. [00:12:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my whole dad's family has high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease, and a sweet tooth. Everyone does. And so he just wasn't dealing with it and he gave this really macho like I'm not going to go to the hospital or go see the doctor. And so his girlfriend they've been fighting. You've been sick for a while and finally she said either you go to the hospital or I'm breaking up with you. So they went to the hospital, the ER, on Sunday morning. And he has pneumonia, he has fluid in his lungs, his heart is enlarged - it's twice the size it should be - high blood pressure, high blood sugar, just basically everything, and kidney problems. [00:13:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So my parents e-mailed me like these are all the things that are wrong with your cousin and he's really worried about his kidneys and the enlarged heart. Yes. That's true. So I called him and talked to his girlfriend a little bit. She was completely upset and freaked out and just exhausted because they'd been there since the early morning. I tried to talk to my cousin and he was like I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I only talked to him for two minutes before I'm going to rest my eyes. Yeah. Rest your eyes. So I talked to her some more. And it's hard because I'm just like well she thinks that most of the heart problems are probably unmanaged diabetes plus having already beaten up your body. [00:14:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The doctors were like well a lot of this is treatable. You're not going to die right now but you need to do something. And they're doing tests today like stress tests and everything. But it was also one of things like when I was talking to here - I mean it wasn't this kind of thought occurred to me like he's obviously really ill, but it's like I don't know. I don't think anyone knows yet exactly how bad it is. And what he's done because he has such problems with anger, and these huge problems with authority, he has started his own business doing yard work things. And that was pretty good because no boss to argue with. [00:15:14]</p>

<p>He got his GED in prison I think, but he doesn't have a whole lot of education (pause). So I don't know if he will be able to do that because that's kind of physical labor and stuff. And also when I talked to her at the same time it's clear that both of them were still a little bit worried that he wouldn't be able to leave the hospital. And I don't know if he'll get out any time soon which is terrifying. He really is my age. And I knew that he already wasn't in the best of health just in general, but I didn't know it was that bad. [00:16:16]</p>

<p>And also his mom also when she died suddenly she didn't want to go to the hospital either. Yeah, my whole father's family hates hospitals. They're terrified of them which really doesn't help. I think basically my mom is just better at strong arming my dad into going to the hospital than anyone else which is insane. (Pause) But I talked to my parents again my dad actually called me like I left a message and he actually called me back. He never does. My mom always calls first. And he was really worried which also he never does which completely freaked me out. [00:17:22]</p>

<p>At one point when my dad was talking about his doctors my mom was worried about dialysis that and my dad's doctor said well he's still a young man. They're saying that my dad was still a young man to be on dialysis. And so I started to say to him dad, well you know Daniel is still a young man and then I'm like oh God. It's kind of weird to think about my cousin and also about my dad when they are both not really aged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And my commented that my cousin Daniel has an old man's body basically like he's a young man with a beat up body. (Pause) So yeah we talked a little bit about it but mostly we were just both freaked out, and he was... My dad doesn't express a lot of worry. [00:18:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I know. I know what you're saying. Your dad doesn't express a lot of a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he hates talking on the phone or he hates calling people a lot for some reason. They hopefully understand. He's like well my kids should be calling me. I'm like I left a message. If he asks, just call me. So him after me calling him was really weird. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But if I follow this is kind of his version of being like completely off the wall hysterical?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes which...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which would freak you the hell out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically. And also there's not really comforting things to say like Daniel really is really sick. You know there's nothing really comforting to say like it oh it'll be fine. Like if it was just pneumonia I'd be like okay. Well pneumonia that's totally fixable. But everything and that he's been living with diabetes for five years and hasn't treated it. He's scared of insulin. He's one of those. So he's scared of taking insulin which is also insane. I'm like but then you'll die. [00:20:04]</p>

<p>And also he goes around like this big tough macho man and I'm like really you can't take an insulin shot. So (pause) I don't know. It's just very weird to have (pause) him be in such bad shape when it's all so many things that are so preventable. Like he's known about having diabetes for a while and just hasn't done anything about it. He smokes and he knows he shouldn't, etcetera.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He should've been in the hospital however many weeks ago in the first place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So his girlfriend was saying that he had actually (inaudible at 00:20:58) crappy for about a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well he was confronting all of those other things. [00:21:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and so they had been arguing about it for a little bit but she wasn't sure. Sometimes he just acts sick when he wants attention. He wants her to make him dinner. And she had been away for work for the beginning of the week. And when she came back she was she was really tired. She wasn't quite sure if he was serious or not. And she was like I've been telling you to go to the doctors for weeks. How? And finally they had this huge blow out fight which was go to the doctor or I'm out. And she says she feels really guilty about having that fight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like yes but I support that fight because he went to the hospital.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just so... I don't know. It's just so frustrating because it's all preventable. Like I feel like... I don't know. There's no reason for it to have gotten to this point. And I hope this wakes him up and makes him realize he needs to take care of himself, but I don't know. It took two felonies to get him to stop well sort of stop doing things that were illegal. I mean do we need two terrifying wake up calls? Can we just have one? And I almost thought with my Aunt and my Uncle dying that that would've given him hey go to the doctor. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>I mean after that both my dad and my Aunt Francis went to the doctor to check if they had cancer or something. I can't remember. So I'm like why the fuck didn't that terrify you into the hospital? (Pause) And also he's in Oklahoma City. It's not close. Like this is one of the few times where I'm like fuck I wish we lived closer. Cincinnati is a shithole but (pause) I don't... My dad doesn't have any direct family that's close in Cincinnati anymore. I mean I have my Aunt's husband who still lives in Cincinnati. And he would totally he would help Daniel if he could. But the next closest family is in Michigan; four or five hour drive. But they're also not doing well physically so I'm like Jesus Christ. And I'm not even sure what going there would do except that I really want to yell at him for not going to the doctor and then buy him some healthy food which I don't know. [00:24:38]</p>

<p>(Pause) [00:25:34]</p>

<p>And yes we're worried about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's kind of what I've been doing. Yell about it, yell about it, instead of talking to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:25:47) were attacked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean part of it is just like it's time for tests and waiting which sucks and (pause)... So Daniel's kind of melodramatic but one of things is he feels like people - I don't know. He worries that my family won't stick around, won't call him, won't look after him. And part of that is because he was horrible with his mom at the end of her life. And at one point - I don't remember what it was. So his mom did not leave him money directly. She left it to my Aunt to give to him because she knew if she gave it to Daniel he would just blow through it in drugs. [00:27:06]</p>

<p>So would sometimes get really resentful about that or not resentful he'd get really upset about it. And sometimes he would feel like there should've been more money or there's was more money that she was hiding or keeping from him. It was kind of unclear. And so (inaudible at 00:27:34) at my Aunt's door yelling at her about something and then talking about how his mom never loved him, and life was really unfair, and she was not a good parent. But mostly just talking about how... I mean I don't know. It was obvious he was talking about how much he hated his mom. And my aunt slammed the door in his face and my Uncle was like get the fuck out or I'll get my gun so that happened. [00:28:20]</p>

<p>And then my dad is really upset because he's like what are you doing trash talking my baby sister who's dead and who you were horrible to. And so eventually he would have to (inaudible at 00:28:39) where she was like I forgive you. I'm also not forgetting what happened, but I do forgive you. It's probably part of AA recovery promise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:28:59). My dad felt the same way. He's like I understand that you're sorry but you also were really horrible to your mom. I don't know. Daniel feels like he's never gotten anything in life because no one's ever done anything for him. And he resents my brother and I because we got everything. We were given things he wasn't given. (Pause) And it's weird because I don't know what he expected. I'm like it's not like I was given admission to college. I had to work really hard for that and so did my brother and no one gave us our jobs. [00:30:17]</p>

<p>But one of the things he really feels is that his mom didn't love him in that his mom was... I don't know. The thing he got from his mom didn't love him, but loved his other cousins more or she cared about them but not him. And he feels like she never gave him I guess praise that didn't also undercut a little bit which is weird because I didn't see him all the time. We saw him like one a year maybe twice a year. But I don't remember that. I remember that his mom really doted on him I think too much. I think his mom and his dad could've used some boundaries around things. And it really sucks that he didn't get treated for ADD. But it's hard hearing him be like everyone else gets anything, and I never got anything, and you're going to forget me. [00:31:49]</p>

<p>That was the other thing after my aunt died he's like you're never going to come back to Cincinnati. You're never going to call me again. I just have to get used to being alone. I'm like... Among other things you have this awesome rocking girlfriend. Your dad is either living in this house or living next door. He has other family like... I don't know. And it's so frustrating because I can't really fix that Daniel. I can't undo that you might want to let it go or find a way to deal with that. And he's also super resentful of our cousin because dad didn't directly tell Daniel that he's better than him. [00:32:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He tells Daniel that Caleb's better than Daniel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because Caleb will be like I'm better than you. I'm smarter than you. You're just... Caleb is smart and also an asshole. And he's had so many opportunities that he's completely trashed. He failed out of two or three colleges intentionally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he was mad at his parents. And then he had two kids with someone to get back at his parents. And then got married also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get back at his parents? [00:33:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Got married and had another parents to get back at your parents. He's done a lot of things to get back at his parents. He also was basically going to become a minister of a little store front church, but actually no one, I think, maybe including him knows why he didn't do that. He probably would've been good at it. He's very charismatic. But he's back in Cincinnati. He's on unemployment. He's, I think, living with a woman who's supporting him. I don't really know. But he's just needled Daniel all the time to make Daniel lose his temper which I really - I'm like why the fuck are you doing that? [00:34:22]</p>

<p>So sometimes when I talk to Daniel (inaudible at 00:34:27) had some kind of fight. And Caleb has been talking about how he's better, and he's smarter, and etcetera, etcetera. And it's still really needles him like I think he kind of believes it which is frustrating to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Daniel believes it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that Daniel believes that in some ways Caleb is better. Like Caleb actually went to college for a little bit and also did a trade school briefly. Like Caleb can sound more proper sounding than Daniel can. Caleb is kind of this smooth talking guy and Daniel is a blunt talking guy. [00:35:32]</p>

<p>And I may have told him so. I told Daniel how at times I'm very proud of him. I'm proud that he got off drugs. I think it's a really thing that he's got his own business, that he has his girlfriend, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like there's a way that... I mean in addition to being empathic and upset for some of the hardships, the things that went against him, and worried about his health in addition to all that it sounds like there's a way that you kind of take this on like that you feel a degree of responsibility. [00:36:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean part of it myself, my brother, Daniel and Caleb are all the same age. My brother and Caleb are the same age, and me and Daniel are the same age. So (pause) I don't know. So there's a (inaudible at 00:36:41) which I'm actually pretty sure that Caleb's parents and probably Daniel's parents to an extent would say things like why can't you be more like your cousin Seth and Karen which sucks. And I also just feel like as a family member I feel a certain level of (pause) responsibility for him. Like I really want to help him in any way I can. And I guess some of it is because he's caught up in things that happened a while ago. I find myself wanting to really say I think you've done a good job. Because to me one of the things that he probably really wants is I think he wants someone to say you have done good with your life. You are a fuck up that doesn't suck. And so... [00:37:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:00).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't know. Its seems like I don't call him that much because I hate being on the phone but also every time he gets on my ass about how I need a man, and I'm really not interested in that conversation. So I also talk about my life and what's going on and sometimes he sounds kind of - I think it's kind of - it sounds like it makes him feel kind of bad because I'm going to get a masters and he didn't really finish high school. We've had this sort of conversation about is he smart or we talk about regrets about the past. I guess in a way he feels, I think, kind of let down by our family. I think he does. [00:39:13]</p>

<p>So my grandmother dying - Like he feels like he had this potential path that if she could've educate and take care of him that he would've done better in school which I think is probably true. And so in this way he feels kind of let down and abandoned. And then (pause) I think he wanted someone else who was not his mom or dad to take him in when grandma couldn't. I don't know. He wants whatever the things are that were given to everyone else and not him. But he also doesn't take a lot of responsibility for things he did. (Pause) I mean I do think it was really shitty that a couple of his uncles get him using drugs. However, he was the one that kept using. [00:40:30]</p>

<p>And it's just been like that where I'm like Daniel I get that you were really mad but - he had this thing of getting fired from jobs like low level like pizza delivery, whatever type jobs, because he'll get upset or mad at authority. And when he gets upset he yells. And because he's a really tall big black guy everyone's super intimidated. I mean he is intimidating physically. And so that happens and then he gets mad at authority again. And I'm like also maybe you shouldn't have lost your temper in the middle of the parking lot. And sometimes I'm like yes you've totally been dealt some crappy hands, but you should also take some responsibility for some of that. And he just - I don't know - doesn't want to. [00:41:39]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the feeling that it has something to do with the way that he can't that you do a little bit. Like that he can't or won't take responsibility for a lot of things somehow makes you feel more responsible for him in some way. [00:42:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what if we had been closer to him in some magic way which [inaudible] was closer to Ohio. Like would he have had different role models that were close by. It's kind of what if...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like if things were different you could have helped things turn out better for him? [00:43:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And there's also this other weird thing which my brother and I have talked about. My father has always said (inaudible at 00:43:23). They were, I think, raised like you've got to go to school, you've got to go to college, you've got to get ahead, you've got to do a lot better. And out of their kids most of them haven't it and it's really weird. Like Daniel is in the worse position than his parents were. Same with my cousin Chris. Caleb totally in a worse position than his parents are. And then Jim's daughter, Layla and Jeremy like Layla's doing pretty well for herself. She's working hard. Her brother we're a little unclear. Her brother it's a little unclear if he's into gay activity or not so it's kind of like everyone's like what the fuck happened. Like seriously, what the fuck? [00:44:37]</p>

<p>So it's very cathartic to us. We're sitting like why the two of us are the ones that succeeded and everyone else didn't. And also that... I mean to an extent Daniel, Caleb, and Chris are not exactly resentful of us, but they're kind of just a little bit of do you think you're better, do you think you're more special, why are you being so fancy? I'm just like I don't know man. I was raised by the same family values as you were. You guys (inaudible at 00:45:30) and I didn't. [00:45:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something that I think may be guilt that go along with it can weigh very heavily on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know it's just so... It's not survivor's guilt but it's like I feel bad for doing well. And the other thing I feel bad about is I think that in a way, yeah, I think his mom would be kind of disappointed. I know my grandmother would've been totally disappointed. [00:46:16]</p>

<p>You know none of them wanted - They all wanted their kids to do better or at least - No they wanted their kids to do better. And not that they had to go to college like my brother and I, but I think my cousin Caleb at one point was working at a steel manufacturing facility. And everyone's like that's great you know solid, blue class job. Go for it. And then (inaudible at 00:46:48) thing whatever. But I think all that anyone has really wanted of them is to have a regular job, pay your bills, take care of kids, and I'm just like I don't think that's that. I don't know. It is hard but I'm also like I don't think that's an unachievable goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:47:40]</p>

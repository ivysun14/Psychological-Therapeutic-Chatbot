<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) It's almost as if, when I first came in I had a thought in my mind.  And there was so much emotion involved with it, I, it's almost as if all this time I've been trying to separate myself from it so I wouldn't feel so involved.  It's really a combination of thoughts.  Because it occurred to me several times last night and today, uhm, that when I thought of what I'd been saying at the end of last time, I felt, well, I, I wished I hadn't said it.  I don't know if I felt embarrassed or that I had exposed too much of what I felt or thought or just what made me feel uncomfortable, but I did wish I hadn't said it.  And then when I came in today and saw how you looked, my first reaction was that you wished you didn't have to come in here and sit in here for an hour with me.  And it, I don't know, it just made me feel very unhappy.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How did you feel I looked?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, when I was lying here, I think I was telling myself I thought you looked either tired or as if you had other things on your mind.  But I think my reaction was that you were, I don't know, being almost mocking, as if you had to act like you didn't, well — (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You didn't finish the sentence.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I didn't really, what I was going to say I don't think I — I don't know, it just didn't seem to be right.  But what I think, I'm thinking I think is that it seems that you have to appear pleasant to me and so you have to kind of make yourself look that way.  Because there's one expression on your face and then you sort of change it.  And I noticed that yesterday too.  But yesterday I didn't, I, I think I took it personally in a way but not, not as much as I did today.  Because there was somebody else that you were talking to first and so I, it was very easy to say that that look had something to do with that person and not anything to do with me.</p>

<p>(Pause) And I suppose under all this is the feeling, well first is sort of, well, naturally you'd feel that way because how can anybody want to be with me.  And then I'll, I suppose too I'm thinking that I haven't pleased you and how can i.  (Pause) And it makes me think of how there, I don't know if I've been doing it lately, but I used to so often have to have MSCZ tell me that he loved me.  And even then I, well, I'd ask him why.  Because it just seemed, how could there be any reasons why he would.  And although it pleased me, I couldn't really believe it or else, if I did, I think I somehow felt there was something wrong with him or else he wouldn't feel that way.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that there's some parallel between — well, I was generalizing on how I need MSCZ to tell me he loves me and I, in return will rarely feel like even saying it or say it, and how I seem in any relationship so concerned with, well how peop—, whoever it is, is reacting to me or liking me, that I don't ever take time or there's nothing left over to return any kind of feeling.  And I, I was thinking of class last night and just now it occurred to me that the feeling I had the whole time was hoping that what I did this time would get recognition.  And although I made some decisions that I never had been able to make before, I think essentially what was behind my mind was I want to do it a certain way so that other people will like it.  (Pause) And it was really, it took an awful lot of almost making myself to think about what I liked and to make decisions on that basis.  But I felt I was doing it more last night than I'd ever done it before.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just wondering, I was thinking again of, uhm, how you had changed your expression so much, especially yesterday and how I didn't really think about it that much, but perhaps it was on my mind anyway and that I said what I did at the end as sort of a way to please you so that you wouldn't feel that way toward me.  If I said something nice, then perhaps I could make up for however else I was failing.  And I know last night when I was thinking about having said it, I was wondering almost, well, why did I feel it was necessary to say something nice when I was saying things that perhaps weren't nice.</p>

<p>ANALYST: To placate me, you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What, specifically, were you referring to yesterday?  Which things you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Simultaneously with analyst's last sentence) Well, I think just the fact that you had given me a feeling of considering how I felt important.  And I, I was just trying to remember what I had been saying right before that.  But I think what I was saying right before that was something rather, in my mind rather negative.  But I can't recall what it was.  Oh, I know.  It was feeling or enjoying the feeling that I had a certain power over you and how that enjoyment made me feel, or even thinking that I did made me feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And my expression today, can you describe it further?  Because these must be connected, the expression you felt you saw today and this feeling that you had undue enjoyment you felt at the idea you had some control over me.  So I wonder if you could say more, ah, about what you saw in my expression.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, if anything, it was that you weren't thinking about me or that I didn't, giving me the feeling that I didn't have any control over you.  I don't, I don't know, I, I, I don't really have any clear impression of the expression.  It was just more that you had to kind of, you were looking one way before you thought I could see you and then you had to sort of change.  And (silence) or it was just an expression of, whatever was in you mind you weren't pleased with and then having to erase that from your whole posture and everything.  Perhaps because you — I'm, I'm, now I feel I'm — well, maybe I'm not —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You feel what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I didn't see that there had to be any connection between the feeling I had yesterday an the expression I saw today.  And now I'm wondering if I'm not just forcing myself to see a connection because you suggested there is one.  But I was just going to say that the displeasure, whatever it was, that not liking the thoughts that you had in your mind, and that's how interpreted your expression at first, were, was because the thoughts in your mind were that I thought I had this control over you.  (Pause) And when I'm thinking about this attitude of having control over you, I'd never thought of it in this way but it's only to the extent that I can affect what you do a little bit and therefore that I can, to some extent, determine what goes on here and that it's not just you determining it.  So then in a way it's, I don't know, it doesn't seem to me the same thing as control over you anymore.  And then the next thought is simply that I'm trying to wiggle out of a term I don't like using.  (Silence) For some reason right after I said that, I became conscious of the fact that this is being recorded.  And immediately I wanted to ask you how it was working.  And then I thought, well, I can't do that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: In what sense do you mean how it was working?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know either.  (Laughs) It's just sort of, when I was told that this is what you wanted to do I was told that I hadn't been done before and that — by you anyway, and by anybody here.  And so that it was presented to me as, as if it were an experiment, in which case you would be asking how is it working.  And I suppose that's what I meant.  (Pause) But it's almost, I don't know, part of the thought process I go through with lots of people when my thoughts, when I'm conversing with them, go to things I don't feel I can ask because somehow they're not my business or too personal.  And so then I sort of try to think of some general thing that I can ask.  Because this made, I was just thinking of the fact that, uhm, a girl returned to class last night who'd been absent for about a month or long enough, anyway, so I thought she'd dropped the course.  And when she came back I made some comment that I was, uhm, surprised she'd been absent that long.  I can't remember what I said to her exactly but it led her to tell me she'd been sick.  And then she didn't say anything more.  Naturally I was wondering what had happened to her but I felt I couldn't ask.  And I, I really had this feeling of, it's not my business and I'd be prying and she might be very annoyed at my asking such a personal thing.  And then I would think, well, perhaps I'm not showing the kind of interest that I should show.  So eventually I found a way to — and I did think about this for a lot of the class.  And then I thought of a way I could approach the subject again so that, without directly asking her, she could tell me if she wanted to, which she did in enough detail so it was obvious I could have asked and it wouldn't have bothered her in the least.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What is it you want to ask that you're afraid to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, what is it really?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, that, eh, what are you aware of?  Just what you said or — in other words, did you say what you really were wondering?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I thought I was till you asked that.  And then I think (burst of laughter) what's really on my mind is that I want to ask if you're writing something, sometimes when I'm here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And you're afraid to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I guess so.  (Silence) I was thinking about why I'd feel afraid to.  And on the one hand I feel ridiculous that I felt afraid to.  But, I don't know, it was almost as if I was stepping outside of what I should be doing.  Or it wasn't right for me to do it or it wasn't my business to ask or — (4-minute silence) I think I feel that, no matter what I wanted to ask, that I can't ask you questions.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was going on while you were quiet right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think basically I was wondering if I had any sense of humor at all.  (Pause) And I was thinking that it had struck me funny, I was laughing at myself, in a way, when you asked me what was really on my mind.  Because it seemed that I'd really been playing a game with myself and it just seemed funny.  Like now I had to really face or be honest with myself.  And for some reason it made me think of a boy at school who will used terms that hears but he doesn't know exactly what they mean and they're words that he's using one way but have a dirty connotation.  And obviously it's amusing to the girl I work with and myself because of the context that he puts them in.  But for some reason I didn't want to say either of these things.  And knowing that I didn't want to say it just made me feel very uncomfortable.  And I guess I sort of made myself go back to something that I could talk about.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think I might have had 2 different reasons for not wanting to say these things.  Because I think talking about my fears that I don't have a sense of humor and my thinking, well, maybe I do if I could find something like laughing at myself funny, then I'm saying something too personal about myself.  And, I don't know, somehow opening myself up to be rejected or hurt in some way.  And I think for the not wanting to talk about the boy was more, I didn't want to talk about the words he was using.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which were?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  "Screwed up"  and "Knocked up."  (Pause) And I think there's some connection with a fear I've often had that the only, if I do have any kind of a h—, sense of humor, the only kind I have is for sort of dirty jokes.  Although, when I'm told dirty jokes I very often don't get them, I don't understand them.  But I've always been afraid there's something wrong about what I do think is funny.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

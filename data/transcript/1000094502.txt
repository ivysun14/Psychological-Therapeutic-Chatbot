<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give her those tomorrow in fact.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my apologies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sorry, I felt pretty damned guilty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You take this stuff pretty seriously. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a contractual agreement, right? No, it's all one big joke.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, that's  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is a contractual arrangement, I mean. I did agree to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not that it would be a joke, but you know, I'm sure there are other people who agreed to do it and blow it off and maybe don't feel intensely guilty as you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. I don't know what it is. I mean, I could have done the questionnaire. For one thing, I can see that, you know, it's like they're like coding the variables this way, and they're doing that. You know, I mean I could just - it's like I see - and if I don't send it in, there will be a hole in the data, and then somebody will have to code it appropriately. 0:01:02.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you understand is the difference that makes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. It'll be a statistical pain in the ass. If I don't finish the sessions, it'll be a statistical pain in the ass. You might have to throw me out. I'll end up being some, you know, I mean lord knows what. And so I feel guilty. And who knows for something else. Yeah, I mean it's just - yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you something. What's your experience at filling those things out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My experience with them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what's it like to be answering those questions. Each time we have a session, to know you have to do one. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a burden. I don't like doing it. I'd rather juts kind of go home, you know, and think about what we did rather than - it sanitizes it, you know, in a bad way. Sort of like it cheapens the experience  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: - in a way. A little bit, yeah. I mean, it's no fun to - one of the things is that the questions are so shitty. I mean, apologies to whoever, but I mean there's some questions on there that just - the grouping of adjectives are terrible. 0:02:21.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just mean the way they're worded.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean they - well, yeah, that's all - (laughs) - as opposed to the way the font pitches.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I suppose you could have some objection to the content of the question, for example, or  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's the way they're worded. I mean, it's not sentence structure, it's the fact that - I mean, I guess like it starts off with was there a problem, you know. Was there a tension, you know. It's sort of like not all things can be classified as a tension. </p>

<p>But clearly, unless you did absolutely nothing in the session, I mean there's got - I mean there's always going to be something classified as tension. But it's not really tension. I mean you could say was there an issue, or was there an issue of - you know, it's just like it's either tension, yes or no, and if so, how much. And well, that doesn't really grab a lot of things. Or, you know, there's various aspect with the relationship that it describes, but they're really, sort of, weak, you know. They're really kind of clunky. </p>

<p>And now I know that - I know how hard it is to capture the vitality of some interaction on a frigging piece of paper. But still, you know, it just seems like there's one question that's like, "would you classify yourself as" - then it includes something like meek, you know, assertive, industrious and stuff like that. </p>

<p>Well, assertive and industrious are pretty different things. I mean, assertive - industrious just means like did I pay attention or did you pay attention. Assertive means like did I stand up to you or stick up for my rights. </p>

<p>I mean, you - and that's only two of them. There's three more. And it's like sort of this glop of ideas that really are completely unrelated. And so having to answer that is really kind of - having to classify where I fit on this scale is really - it forces me to remember this in a way that kind of - I don't like that memory of this. I don't like changing my memories of what took place here. Does that make sense? 0:04:46.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so. I mean, when you have to recall  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: You have to do it, by the way. You might want to do it sometime to experience what it means to have to sort of answer a stupid question about something that - I mean you see it  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I have my own questionnaires actually that I have to fill out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:05:02.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I forgot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So I kind of do have a sense. And I wanted to ask because you'd mentioned filling the questionnaires out before, and I had - not just feeling guilty, feeling you didn't like it much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. You're right, I don't. I mean, I might have been focusing on it because I mean, since our last, well, our last session, which I really got a lot out of, I haven't been - it seemed like still more work, to use the catch term from last  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What we were talking about last week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was just like great, I work my ass off in here, then I leave, then I have to work more. And it's like paperwork, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:05:54.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I thought it was telling that I didn't, you know, that I was willing to sort of finish off the forms and, you know, then I sort of  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought it was telling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I was willing to finish it up - finish it all up. And, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After last session?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I've been doing this sort of all along, but you know, just getting a little - finding the ones I had done, getting an envelope, getting it together, putting it in my briefcase. You know, it's all trivial shit. It could not be more petty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But perhaps it was trivial shit that you had been putting off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and a couple other trivial pieces of projects. So anyway, but that's how, now that we're talking about it, work. It just seems like it's just work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was work too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was work, and it was why I wasn't doing it.</p>

<p>So - but now, I feel guilty and I feel bad. I hope Maria isn't angry with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You imagine that she might be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. 0:07:17.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you being fallen behind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I feel like a jerk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, I'm sure I'll get over it. I'd feel better if I had the other one turned in too - (laughs) - but I'll finish that.</p>

<p>So I'll just drag my sorry ass around here for a while. I'll go visit her and cower.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And cower?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And cower like a dog.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you mean, you like - I'm not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Grovel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Grovel, make up or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should probably  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make amends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should probably do the same thing. (Laughs.) Yeah. 0:08:16.0</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll handle that. I'm just trying to think of something that will feel better - (laughs.) I can't even stand the way I feel. This feels  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel better for you or  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just felt guilty. I mean, I actually respect her a lot. I mean, she was - she - well, gosh, now that we bring it up, the intake interview was a lot like counseling, you know. It was sort of like, you know, I got to remember lots of things and got to think about it a lot. So actually, I think I associate with her with kind of like the counselor - the counselor model.</p>

<p>So I had this dose of yesteryear, you know, my previous kind of counseling experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So Maria did the  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maroa did the intake interview. And so come to think of it, I guess that's part of the reason I feel guilty is because she's like this sort of - she's been the good cop - (laughs) - or something. I mean, she's been - I mean, in addition to just plain thinking, she's very - she's always very confident and stuff. </p>

<p>But, you know, that was kind of a warm - it was a grueling process, but it was a result besides that they were very warm and sort of accepting, and this has been a lot harder work, you know. So I guess I feel - I guess that's part of the reason I worry about  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - not handing all this in. 0:09:50.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you described that, actually, at first I was a little confused. I'm not sure I quite got that - why you might think that she'd be angry, or why you'd be worried about that or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't figure it out until just now either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That she's sort of the, you know. I mean, secretly, I sort of wanted her to be the counselor, you know, because I thought that would have been pretty cool. I guess I'd better get over it. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's it like to tell me that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little embarrassing. Yep, definitely embarrassing. (Laughs.) Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yep, it's embarrassing. Want to go play some soccer? (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your Geiger counter is going off. 0:11:01.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit. A little bit. I showed it to you. No, it's just  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can imagine that that would be maybe something a little embarrassing to say, and perhaps you might wonder how I would react to you saying, well, it was - I did kind of want - I kind of had this idea - I wish that Maria had been my counselor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I've been brave up to now. I never shared my secret with anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That secret?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interesting you said you've been brave up to now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess. No, that it is opposite, isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been - oh, well, I've been sort of tough guy all up to now and sort of cloaking my feelings and cloaking my - god, I'm being so forthcoming. (Laughs.) Jesus. Yeah, no  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's interesting. You're being so forthcoming. Why talk about it now? 0:12:12.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's a good point. Well, I trust you a little more now. I do. Yeah. I do have to give you - I have to grant you full rights to some improvement in my life. I gave you partial rights last week, and I need to give you full rights now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure why that would make it a time. I understand the trust part, but the second thing, I'm not sure why that would make it a time for you to find it easier to tell me something. 0:13:01.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. Shit. I really don't know. I'm surprising myself in saying it. I guess - (laughs) - I'm really embarrassed now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This feels very revealing for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does feel revealing or you're just wondering if it feels revealing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, you look like  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Embarrassed as hell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look like this feels - like you're really uncovering or almost admitting to something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is really gross. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is really gross you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, okay, shit. Yeah, well, I have to confess. I liked her a lot. I mean, I found her engaging and attractive and at the time, when I was looking for grownups, so part of me always thought maybe if she thinks - you know, maybe two years down the road I'll stumble into this person, you know. </p>

<p>And if I get the Jim (inaudible) stamp of approval, you know, healed, she'll, you know, she'll perhaps - but I'm embarrassed to say it on camera because I'm sure people will see this that know her. And so this is double embarrassing. Because now I know - (laughs.) 0:15:04.1</p>

<p>It'll be - I won't have to avoid - I'll have to avoid everything from 6th Avenue north. (Laughs.) Like go nowhere near Beth Israel. I can see the ambulance; don't take me to Beth Israel please. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your Geiger counter is going off again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jim, you're pretty good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little joking and stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have to live with this somehow, Jim. If I don't tell a joke - (laughs) - yeah, well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well, I was saying you're embarrassed. And then  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was lonely. I found her very interesting. She's very bright, and you know, who wouldn't want that, you know. So anyway. Bit I guess I'm - I don't know. 0:16:08.6</p>

<p>It's a pain in the ass. It's a pain in the ass to remember her, you know. It's somewhere in here. I didn't classify it as an access of something, you know. Access to, I guess. My annexes to?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I actually don't know what they - they  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: They what? They don't like that stuff?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have access to all that  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They keep that in your chart up there, and I may have - actually, that's not true. I may have glanced at it in the very beginning of stuff, but now I have a little chart full of questionnaires that I fill out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But to be classified by someone who you found personally engaging  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and someone you might even think of dating or seeing in the future.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. 0:17:09.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're a category.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in front of the camera please. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>Yeah, right, so it was embarrassing. But I guess by saying it, I'm sort of somehow throwing in the towel, and my little secret's out. I guess I'm just - I guess I'm responding to the fact that - I don't know. Telling secrets in here seems to be legal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems to be legal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: More legal now. Somehow, the information's leaking in here in little ways anyway. We started a little bit of that. And somehow it seems to be - I guess that was - I can't say it was the first thing on my mind, but on the other hand it was the first thing that came to mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know - and one thing I'm curious about, and I want your opinion about, is obviously this little secret that let's say that's out in the open now, but has been in the background somewhere the whole time. Right? Because it was from the intake that you thought about this, and my guess is you haven't forgotten about it up till now. Rather, you've just - it was a secret, right? And I'm wondering about what ways that might have influenced, you know, what's gone on between you and I. 0:18:49.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. That's a pretty rough question. That's a pretty amorphous question. I mean, for one thing, I really worked my butt off trying to be very professional. I mean, I don't think  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With Maria or with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With Maria. No, I mean no, I never - I mean maybe she knows I like her, I don't know. But I tried to just sort of be straightforward. But it just made me uncomfortable. </p>

<p>I mean, on the one hand, I had to talk to her sometimes to get like billing and shit done. And  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And may still have to talk to her sometimes, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Well, you know. Can I be transferred out now? (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's uncomfortable to talk about this, especially on tape - if it's any reassurance, I doubt very much that anyone will be looking at this tape before you finish.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before the - 0:20:06.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before the millennium?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe. They actually have a lot of tapes up there that they have to code and stuff. It's a big - it's a huge undertaking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, thanks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But that only makes it a little easier is my guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, okay. So what happened? So let's see, why - how did this affect us. I mean, really, probably the most significant effect was just that when I talk to her, I was reminded that I liked her. And that she, you know, I mean, when the first counselor - boy, what a  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't like. 0:21:06.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: What a drag that was. And she picked up on it - (snaps fingers) - like that. I mean, instantaneously. And I was totally blown away. I mean - (laughs) - she was hilarious, I mean. I said, "Well, Maria, you're really good at like reading between the lines." And she burst out laughing. She said, "No, there was no reading between the lines at all. It was like totally obvious that you hated this one." (Laughs.) And I was really impressed, like, oh, somebody's listening, you know. That's a tough feeling, to feel understood. </p>

<p>And so whenever - and so when I went to her - I mean it was just like she was - and she was totally - but even I knew that she was very good at - she would never - I mean she just was businesslike the whole time. At the same time, she was very congenial. She made it easy to contact her. She was easy to get a hold of. I mean, she is very professional. I'm sure I was the one with scandalous ideas. 0:22:17.8</p>

<p>But I did - so if anything just kind of kept reminding me that there was this other kind of counselor out there that I could pick. It's like Jesse Jackson in - whatever it was, the '86 elections or whatever, keep hope alive, you know. It was sort of Maria was this kind of, you know. And every time I talked to her, I'd just go, Jesus Christ, why couldn't I have her?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And even when we were talking  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean that's what I'm saying. I mean, we - I only talked to her once a month or once every six months or something like that. But still, every once in a while, I would come up. You know, sort of this - you know, the warm voice of understanding. 0:23:15.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder in fact if that idea even came up in here. I mean, during while we were talking. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, for example, maybe you'd say something to me and I'd comment on it in a certain way. And maybe you'd think, you know, Maria probably wouldn't have said that. She might have said something else. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean, not that - geez, I'm not that stupid. I mean - (laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, did that sound - I think you took that maybe as critical or something. I didn't mean it that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, no it just seems so simplistic. I mean, that I would - first of all, I'm just not that - there's just been so many bigger things around. I mean  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So many other things to think about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, god, I mean - shit, I mean, dealing with Cynthia was - we're talking about, you know, total orders of magnitude of where these problems are coming from. I mean I - 0:24:26.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you know, my thought is just this. Is just - I don't mean to oversimplify it. I certainly don't mean to suggest that you've been sitting here the whole time thinking about Maria or anything like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) - what she looks like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can barely remember what she looks like. I haven't seen her since I first started.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, you know, I mean - you're telling me she did the intake, and you really liked her. And you thought maybe this person could be my therapist, right? And now you've got me as a therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But still in the background, you haven't forgotten that. She might have been  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if you were measuring up to anybody, it would have been the one guy that I saw for a really long time. This Harry guy. I mean that was - that's really - I mean she was just sort of a proximal thing. I mean, he was - he really just - I mean, he did a good job. He did a good job of sort of, you know, making me kind of fit what happened together into the present, or what happened in the past into the present. </p>

<p>And, you know, Maria's questions were, you know, often tell me about this, tell me about this. It ruined two days of work. Lots of frigging work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I ask you something? Does this kind of talking right now, does it seem like work? 0:26:00.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, you know, it's actually we really hit the nail on the head, because I guess I just - I feel like I let go of a key assumption last week, which was, you know, just - okay, it was wrong. I should not date people that I - I don't want to date people that I can't grow old with, you know. I don't want to be sleeping with anybody that I don't - I don't want to have transient relationships in that way. </p>

<p> But this one, well, I will be sad when this ends. I do. I mean, I will. It will, you know. I'm a pain in the ass. I know it. And I - like I whine. I'm sure by the end of this, I will have whined for six whole months about, you know, what a bankrupt, you know, paradigm you operate from. And at the end, I'll be sad as hell to see you go, you know. 0:27:08.2</p>

<p>It's stupid, and - but it's true. That's what will happen. Or something like that. But, on the other hand, you know, I'm not marrying you. And I'm not - I mean, I guess I just figure well, it is okay if this is just, you know, 30 sessions or 26 or - and maybe I can learn some things that, you know, it's sort of like a short course or something like that. You know, and so - you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that was  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: The work was keeping track of this old vision of what a counselor could really be and looking all through New York trying to find some counselor who could help me out, and never letting go of the memory of what I - how I should really be thinking or working on finding somebody. </p>

<p>So when I just decided well, you know, we'll just - whatever we do, that's fine. And, you know, it will be sad to say goodbye to Jim, but you can say it. And that's that. It's not going to rip you up as much as it did with Cynthia, or whoever, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:28:18.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so that - so this doesn't feel like work, because I guess I'm just letting it happen. Whatever happens, happens. That's kind of my  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And before, even like - even last session before we started talking about it being work, that wasn't the case?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hard as it may be to believe, for three months or four months, I just clung to the - I clinged? Anyway, I clutched the idea that - I just could not let go of the idea of what should really be happening in here and how far short of the mark you were falling. And occasionally, you know, you would sort of, you know, whip one in there. And whip it inside a place that would just kind of sober me up, or just show me that something's been happening. </p>

<p>I mean, somehow throughout all this, some work has been getting done at the same time. At the same time, I've also been sort of grumbling about this whole time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it was never what you'd expected. And you'd come in and every time, it was - I guess we might say part of the reason it was work was because we were working on different expectations or different assumptions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is right. Well, let me put it this way. I really think that now and 10 years from now, most people out there - including me, who's like been there, done that, seen it all - will think that when you go in to see a counselor, what you're really doing is going to see your best friend, somebody who sees it all, knows it all, and is going to give you. </p>

<p>I mean, you're not going in to like learn how to - I mean, this stuff - this sort of, you know, this little game of hockey that we play, this linguistic hockey, it just sort of - this is not what people think of as counseling at all. And my guess is that five or ten years from now, it will still be that way. That people aren't going to walk in and think, gosh, I'm getting better because, you know, I just really learned how to sort of slow down with my therapist or something like that. I mean, they won't use - they might use those terms. 0:30:58.9 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, you may - I think you may be right. And a lot of people look at therapy, and just people's idea of doing it is coming in and talking about their life. And sometimes fitting past events into current events, or coming to some kind of understanding that way. I mean, this probably is really different than that.</p>

<p>You know you also couched in there a little, you kind of refer to this - and you sometimes do - but just now you did, like it's a little trick or a little game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I didn't mean to belittle it. I actually don't know how to  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were actually right to pick up on that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The belittling comment?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That - no that I did react to it a little bit like you were belittling it. 0:31:56.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I apologize. I mean I - well, what the hell. I've had a lot of doubts for many, many weeks, and let's face it  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You may still.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and, well, not so much that, but - let's face it, this counseling will never touch somebody who's in - this counseling will never provide immediate gratification for somebody who's in a complete zone of darkness. I mean - or at least that's my impression. I mean, I really do think that you basically will not know or you guys will be the last to know when your patients or on drugs or when they're - you know, or when they're breaking up or when they're slipping on the ice at work, or something like that. You guys are going to be the last to know. Of all the counselors out there, you guys will be the last. You know. (Laughs.) 0:32:57.8</p>

<p>You know, but my guess is that - so, you know, why  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what can I say? I mean, you come by that - you've earned this reputation honestly. It's not immediately clear that sort of these workouts here are going to allow me to confront Cynthia more effectively or my boss more effectively or my coworkers more effectively. It's not at all clear, and it takes a long frigging time for it to add up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it is work and it's  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you it's work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, yeah. It was more work when I thought that it was a bunch of games, you know. And what was really  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you still  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it might actually - I just want to tell you some of my reaction to what you're saying. 0:33:54.5</p>

<p>Just the way it's coming across to me is I still get the feeling that it does seem like a little - like you're learning tricks to take out in the world and use. Or you're learning skills through this kind of what you refer to as sparring or something that we do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's not how - I mean, I agree, the language is misinterpretal (sp). But I actually don't think that's it. I mean  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean I really do feel like I'm being more honest. At that - I'm learning to say what's on my mind. I mean, these interactions are really dense. And even though I call it sparring, it's not a game. </p>

<p>I mean, I know - I told you a couple of months ago, I mean, in some ways the interactions are so byzantine and so dense that when I get out there, it's easy, you know, because I only have to deal with four senses as opposed to 40, you know, in a row. And all I have to do is keep my head about me for a couple of seconds, then I can just, you know, respond to it accordingly. 0:35:25.9</p>

<p>So no, but I am a little - I'm actually getting curious as to why you're sticking with this topic in this way, because you seem almost like you're now in kind of a sales mode. Like you're getting me to - getting me to sign on, you know. (Inaudible at 0:35:47.7) "We are recognized by the APA six years running now." You know, and it's just like all right, give it a rest. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No maybe  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And this fell on the heels of did you like me better than Maria, or did you like Maria first? Or whatever, I mean it's just sort of you know, I mean  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You may be right. Perhaps I became a little defensive, even, in response to what you were saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seemed that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of your  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know, I can tell you, it's actually something - something that I've noticed before, is just the way you talk about the process in here. So it wasn't something I just noticed this time, but yeah, it was - I did happen to bring it up right after you were talking about Maria and liking her, and kind of thinking about the possibility of having her as your therapist and so on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well, it's not like I've been cloaked about this at all. I mean, I guess I'm - I don't want - I mean I have stated from the outset - I've been very upfront about my, probably, critique of it. So it doesn't seem entirely fair for you to sort of spend a ton of time sort of driving home - I've already signed on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I'm signing on every day, and here you are sort of, you know, extracting a couple of extra ounces of agreement out of me, you know. Sort of like, look, I told you it was valuable. I told you I could change my life, you know. It's just sort of like yeah, but the language you're using still sucks - (laughs.) You're still using these little words like this is a game. I don't like it. Change this. 0:37:51.8</p>

<p>You know, like all right, all right. I never get these kids down on the ground. You ever see kids fight, and one kid will hit the other guy and just say it, say it. And then they'll say no, say it like you mean it, you know. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what your experience is of  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I said it already, but now you're like saying it well, I said it, said it, now you're saying no, say it like you mean it, which is sort of like, you know, two kids fighting. Psychodynamic therapy, say it like you mean it. (Laughs.) Whatever this is, I don't know what this is. </p>

<p>What is this, anyway? What do we do here? Is it (inaudible at 0:38:34.7) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's - I mean  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just don't bother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I can tell you  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What just happened there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't want to know. I don't know, I just want to leave this in its vital, weird process that I stumbled onto.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'll learn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what happened was you asked  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, tell me at the end. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At the end of the session?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the very end of the therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm happy to tell you at the end or  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, good. Do it then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I'm curious about is what just happened. Because first you were, what kind is this anyway curious, and then  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? 0:39:28.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just decided it would be more fun to wait until the end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought, actually, was in reaction to my hesitation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit, but then I just decided to trash the whole thing and wait until the end.</p>

<p>Hey, you started it with this idea that I shouldn't work at the level of theory, remember that? By your own recommendation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I point something out about just this past minute?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of more combative?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it has been more combative. Not just now, but for a few minutes now it seems to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your experience also?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder why.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why should you? (Laughs.) I mean  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not obvious to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, I mean - I got pissed off because you were bullying me, and so I decided to take back my 10 minutes or whatever I had left. I get that - you've been dominating this - it seems like a lot of the questions during this session have been sort of your victory march around the stadium or something like that - (laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really? Interesting. And I've kind of cheated you out of your opportunity to talk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I won't say that. But I mean we got to talk about some neat stuff, but there was some parts there which just seemed like the issues were really about you, you and the therapy. 0:41:08.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah let  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you as a therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure - I'm actually not sure what else to do with that except to explain why I was talking about that. Or at least what I was thinking, keeping in mind that you might have been right in saying that I was coming off as defensive, or that I might have had defensive reasons for saying some of it. </p>

<p>But I am actually - the reason why I was talking about it is I am really curious - more curious about more of your views of what this process is like. Largely because you have been very back and forth about it, and ultimately saying this has helped me a lot, and then back to - yeah, kind of language belittling it. I don't think the language is accidental. So I have been  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't accidental.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was completely deliberate. I choose my words carefully.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know you do. 0:42:05.9</p>

<p>And let's  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: It gets frustrating. And we both know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we had also been talking about why it was work. And I guess I was wondering - there was something in there about the way that you were talking about it, I don't know, that had to do with your view of it as work or - I don't know. This is - just to let you know  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's because I had a degraded view of it, that it was work to do it, you know. It was sort of like  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe something like that. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't commit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To tell you the truth, I haven't worked it out even to that extent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now that you mention that, that sounds reasonable, you know, something in that direction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I definitely - yeah, well. </p>

<p>But that doesn't explain why you - I mean you started off that way, but when you stumbled onto Maria and stumbled onto this other stuff - we stumbled onto Maria and stumbled on - yeah, it makes sense to me why you started this discussion. And that  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it was too much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it did have merit, but it seemed at some point to turn into you feeling, basically, having hurt feelings. Like I didn't value this, which I suppose I had it coming because I was mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know if you had it coming or not, but I didn't intend it to be any kind of - to exact some kind of revenge on you. But - (laughs) 0:44:04.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess that's my caring coming out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, another thing that's interesting is, one might say that you've been the therapist here for part of the session. It feel that way to you too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It felt that way to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's pretty good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, woohoo.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.) What was that like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like it, actually. I think because it highlights my fears that you haven't had a lot - haven't had enough experience to be able to sort of be a solid enough foundation for me to build on as these things go on. And I  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: - I'm already a lot of peoples' counselor. I do it a lot. And, I mean, as problematic as my past may have been and my present may be, you know, I'm like way better than a lot of people, and I know it. And they know it to, and so a lot of people will come to me for advice or to talk out some problem. And it's usually obvious as hell. And so I already do that a lot, and it's my natural mode.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And being the counselor in here is not the position you want to be in. You want to be the patient, the client. 0:45:47.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like I said, yeah, of course. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean I could - I mean - yeah, I mean it just - it's - it was tough dating a graduate student, and it's tough talking to one. Okay? I think you're sharper and, you know, there's lots of reasons why I trust you, but that kind of makes me feel uncomfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It reminded you that I may not be the most experienced therapist. I might not be able to handle every contingency. Perhaps something would come up that I might respond to personally and react. And maybe you can push it a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was - well, you put it in far more extreme terms than I would have. I think most - that's not how I was thinking. I was thinking mostly just that - I mean nobody's that therapist. That therapist doesn't exist. </p>

<p>It's mostly just that you're not quite old enough to know deep down what a midlife crisis is. Or what it means to, you know, what it means to - you might know what it is to have made a bad career choice, or you might know - but you would know that as a 27 year old or a 30 year old or whatever you are. But you won't know that as a 40 or a 45 year old. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. 0:47:18.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's no way you can like really be frightened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you - the stakes get higher, and like I said, I mean that's partly why I sometimes accuse you of playing language games because I just don't think that - I mean, for a 44 year old to be - have a drinking problem and to be risking things at work is a real frigging problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very different than it would be for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And for a graduate student to, you know, like miss a class or something like that or to show up late for rounds. Well, I guess that would actually be bad. </p>

<p>So yeah, no, I don't like that feeling. And I never will, and nobody will I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you've had that feeling before in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean that I knew that my last counselor, he had a family, he had seen lots of people come through, and he knew, for example, that when - I mean, he just knew lots of stuff. You know, he knew what it was like when you would interact. He knew what it was like when somebody from a damaged household would be living or interacting with somebody in a coherent household. I mean all these issues. And he knew all that stuff, you know. And he knew what it was like to have trouble in the workplace. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So stuff like that. But I'm not - it might be this therapy that we go through, but it makes me not see how much you know or don't know. I mean it might be the kind of stuff that when I'm the therapist it brings back these fears that, you know, that this will all fall apart under a certain set of conditions. 0:48:56.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe there are certain things that I don't understand as much as Harry might have because I don't have the experience. Maybe there are certain things that I will pursue just because I wouldn't get how you're looking at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You use a certain word, and I pick up on it. But sometimes you feel like maybe it's not because the word has significance so much as I just don't get what the hell you're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or you're more curious, sort of. I mean, you're bright and you're engaging, and you're just curious about something. And so you're going to follow up because you're curious and not because you sort of seem - you seem this - you know, you're seeing somebody go get into trouble before and you want to check out whether or not this particular patient is having this kind of trouble, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So rather than saying I understand how you're feeling, I say I wonder how you're feeling - (laughs) - something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why did you think or why did you just say that or something like that. So anyway, the answer is no, I don't like being the therapist. 0:50:11.5</p>

<p>I mean, I don't mind it too much if it doesn't go on too much, but all things considered, I'd rather just get my problems straight. Now I feel like a jerk. I feel like I'm being stingy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stingy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, like I should have listened to your troubles. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.) Really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, yeah, listened to your fears about your paradigm or whatever. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, actually, that's not your job at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it did seem like I contracted for you to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You definitely did. That's, in fact, why it's so interesting that the roles reversed like that. And it kind of happened - I mean, I don't know if either you or I intended that to happen, but it definitely happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I let it happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You let it happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I watched it happen, and I just thought, well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's interesting. I felt like I let it happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I watched - I let the - I knew when the questions were turning into, "I don't like the way you talk about my model." You know, and I was like, okay, I'll answer this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the whole time you're like what's the point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ready to get out of this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, let it go. Let's talk about something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I should have said something (inaudible at 0:51:44.2). Actually, I would rather have said something right then and there. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>But see yeah, actually I felt sorry for you at that point. That's - I felt sorry. I was like, well, I'll answer this one question. But actually, the more bold thing to do would have been to say you know, Jim, I hate to say this, but like aren't you whining right now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hate to say this, but let it go. 0:52:11.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Aren't you just trying to sell your model or tell me to say that I like you better than Maria or something like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.) </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so - I don't know, Jim. I think next time I'm going to say it. Next time if this happens again I think I'm just going to come out and say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just going to come out and say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't want to be - make you be the therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we'll see what happens then if you come out and say it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'll experiment. I hope you can take it. Can you  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you wondered this time whether or not I could take it. Maybe it occurred to you to say it but  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it did seem like a mean thing to say. 0:53:09.6</p>

<p>Yep. I did consider saying it, and I decided not to. </p>

<p>Time to go. You want to meet next week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Would you do Tuesday again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, let's go ahead and do Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I may not be able to meet twice next week, but are you trying to? Do you want to, is that  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If we can - well, we're a little - we are a little behind, because we missed a few, you know. I was out of town, and then, you know, we've both had our troubles.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay well  - -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if we can - and also, I will probably be gone for at least one week in August.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Early August, but it would definitely be better for us not to cram everything in at the end, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or not to be in the position  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's see if we can get through together next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, well, let me know on Tuesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, Tuesday at 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. See you then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll get started.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) I was just thinking about the feeling I've had (Clears throat), really for the last few days.  Er, I think it's connected with going back to school.  And (Sniff) I don't, I, I, I don't know, I guess it's something that I keep trying to figure out, why I feel the way I do, because then I think I can handle the feeling.  It's  a very unpleasant feeling.  And I know yesterday i—, I was almost trying to justify that it wasn't that I hated school because I couldn't handle it. I mean it was almost as if because I feel this way I think in a way that it means I can't handle it.  And I'm trying to convince myself it's not so.  But I didn't know quite what it would be if it weren't that. </p>

<p>And when I was thinking about it, then it seemed to me it was almost because somehow I felt angry and yet I didn't know what I felt angry at.  So, I didn't know quite how else to explain the feeling I guess, and it was seeming to me then that something else was more important, like MSCZ and the things I could do connected with him.</p>

<p>But then today it was, I don't know, a slightly different feeling, because when I was at school, you know, it's just a hard thing.  In a way I didn't like it and in a way I didn't mind it.  But it was almost as if today I just have this feeling that I was doing something that I didn't really want to do, but I had to do.  And just now when I was thinking about it, I was thinking how similar it made me feel to college — not so much high school, at least I couldn't recall it.  But college, and especially I'd go back from a holiday and then there'd be a lot of papers and exams and things.  And I think I feel this way more after Christmas, because after Christmas, there's always just 2 weeks or thereabouts and then reports are due on the children.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But I think generally, it just seems like somehow I've lost interest in something connected with teaching.  (Sniff, Pause, Sigh Silence, Sniff) It's funny, because right now I have the feeling that, although I do feel this way about school and I have to keep coping with it in order to — well especially at the beginning of the week or after a vacation — just to get through the days I have to somehow handle it to myself.  But (Clears throat) it is caused by something that I know I really don't understand.  And so in a way I, I don't, I was just feeling I don't really have anything more to say about it.  And yet, then I don't have anything else to say, er, I, I don't know, it's almost as if in a way I really would prefer to keep talking about it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I, I start thinking about the party that I know I was talking about when I was here last.  And I — somehow it seems to me that there's something about that that's connected to my reaction to it. (Sigh)  Well, I connected it to how I feel about school, too, but I don't know whether it's really connected.  (Clears throat)   But that evening I had very strong reactions and very opposite ones.  There were times when I was having a very good time, and then there were times when I was absolutely miserable.   And it all seemed to depend on whether or not I was feeling confident.  Or the fact that, I wasn't really feeling very confident, so if anything threatened it, then I would immediately become — feeling very miserable.  And somehow, what seems to make this feeling I have towards school worse is the fact that I don't know whether, it's almost as if I don't know whether it's all right for me to feel the way I do. (Pause)  Because, well another thing I was thinking just before I came in — they had just put out an alumni newsletter or some such thing, and I hadn't read it before.  So I just thought I'd look at it while I was waiting there.  And it just struck me that, I don't, (Clears throat)  I don't know, I don't really have a personal loyalty to the school.  I don't, somehow the school itself leaves me cold.  And so the only thing I've ever gotten out of it was the fact that I enjoyed working with the age group that I did.  And I think I still like them, but I guess I feel guilty that I don't like teaching.  Or at least right now that I don't.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Also, it struck me today — and uh, this might be part of why I feel so mixed-up about school — but I was just aware that I've come more and more to have very strong, I guess, convictions or ideas or something, about education.  But yet in practice, what I do is so often what I've always done before, because it's easier.  And I'm, sometimes when I think about these things I think I believe in now, I'm not quite sure how to put it into practice.  And then I start thinking, well, I'm not really interested in doing this anyway.  And so then I just do what I've always done.  And the contradiction then bothers me.  Just as something I know I've talked about before when I — the way I feel Sundays, or at the end of a vacation before I go back to school — how I feel I change into something different th— which is contradictory to what I was over the weekend or during the vacation.  It leaves me not knowing exactly what I am.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny, it just struck me that when I said I don't know what I am, that I was thinking what I sometimes have feared, is that I felt more relaxed lately over weekends and during vacations.  And I was just wondering, is that because I'm escaping and then that I can't handle the reality of going to work.  And yet I know a while ago, it was seeming to me that going to work was the escape. (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>But then I think again of the fact that I don't have confidence.  And I was thinking of another party.  But this seems, this part seems  similar to this feeling I have about — is it right or wrong for me not to like school when almost, I don't have confidence into whatever my feelings are towards school — just having them and not thinking I should change those feelings.  Because at this other party we were going to — I've never enjoyed it — this is a couple that gives the same party every year.  And although there might be different people that we meet each time we go, we know some of their friends and generally the people I've met through them I've not enjoyed.  And yet I think, I didn't want to go to this party, but I kept thinking, well, that's wrong, I should.  And anyway, MSCZ wanted to, so we were going. (Sniff)</p>

<p>But I, I think also in that feeling was also this feeling that if I were a different person, I would have been able to make something more out of the situation, and that maybe it was wrong for me not to like these people.  That it was, well anyway that it was my fault, not the fact that they just aren't the kind of people I like.  And it was a little better this time, because maybe I don't know whether I tried harder, or if things just happened differently.  But I still felt the same way about those people.  And it still bothered me, but somehow I felt more sure about the way I felt about them than I had before.</p>

<p>But I think what bothered me this time with that party was, they all liked each other, and so I felt left out.  (Sniff, Pause)  And this had been a situation too where this couple had said come late — it was sort, like an open house — and then uhm, go out with a small group of us to supper.  And, in a way I really didn't want to do it.  But I knew MSCZ was partly interested, and I think I was also curious.  That if it were turning into fun, then I would like to do it.  So we went at a time it was late enough, so that if we wanted to stay we could.  And this time, MSCZ, before I had even felt one way or the other, had decided he didn't want to.  And I was just as glad he felt that way.  But then when we left, I, it, I don't know, I just felt very much we were sort of outcasts.  Or i—, because I think the way we felt came partly from the fact that we just didn't get along that well with the kind of people uh, that were there, and (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>And also I think that there might have been another element — this struck me — well even, I think you even made a point of it on Wednesday when I was talking about the New Year's party.  That I expect something from other people that's unrealistic too, in making me feel important or playing up to me or whatever it is.  And, this, the couple giving this other party are inclined to — I don't know exactly how they judge who's important and who isn't, except I've always felt MSCZ and I are invited to things, because they like, they almost collect friends.  And maybe they enjoy us to a certain extent.  But yet somehow, I've never felt we were really that important to them.   They don't really care about us, so that the more people that are there, the less they care in that proportion.  And whenever we've gone to this particular party they give, they never seem to want to have anything to do with either MSCZ or me.  Uh, whereas with other people they want to talk, and so forth.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>I think this particularly bothered me more than anything else from that party.  So that I might not have enjoyed their friends, but they chose to ignore me.  I think is sort of the way I took it.  And, and  therefore, I don't know, it was really as if I had been ignored or deserted or something.  Uh, no, I don't think I'm saying it very well.  (Sniff, Silence, Sniff)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about the feeling I had after, too, of — there was a couple that uhm, we had wanted to have over, and it turned out that the only time it would work out would be — they were coming for this party too — would be before the party.  But then, things happened to hold both of them up, so that the woman came for a few minutes, but her husband hadn't been able to, and I knew he still wanted to.  And so then we said that — they were going to see somebody else after the party and that they cou—, if they still had time, why don't they come over to our house.  And it's a couple tha—, it's that elderly couple that so often I feel it's almost a duty to see them, because they are always making it clear it means so much to them to see them.  And often, sort of calling up just to kind of see when we're going to see them again and so forth.  And, and yet that evening, it was a great relief to have somebody coming in and uh, I don't know, somehow it didn't make me feel quite so neglected or unwanted or something.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny, that just made me think of this.  And I, I knew I was having a certain reaction uh, completely unrelated to MSCZ.  But I hadn't really understood it.  But I was just thinking that last night, it was very important to me, or at least, I wanted MSCZ to make love to me.  And I didn't feel so much a physical response to him as just somehow, I'd be reassured of something if he wanted to have intercourse with me.  And it was very, it was a relief and it was satisfying to me, even though I didn't have an orgasm and, and, or ever really physically respond.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And lately, uh, this isn't the only time that I felt that way — the day before I go back to school, after a break from going to school. (Pause)  And that makes me think again of what occurred to me yesterday, about going to school is somehow connected with my feeling angry about things, and just now also I was just thinking it has always been where I've tried to prove myself.  And I guess now I don't particularly want to prove myself there anymore.  Or at least, I, maybe I still want to to some extent, but I don't care about it quite the same way.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just thinking when I made that association, that somehow the fact — I somehow am feeling sometimes, though I know it's not always true that — well, I don't know what this means that I'm proving myself, but, well, in some way I feel I'm something through MSCZ's feeling toward me.  And I connected that with uhm, my father's lack of interest or attention and I, I don't know, it just seemed to make sense that, if MSCZ, if I were getting satisfaction out of MSCZ's attention, then I would withdraw from wanting anything out of school the way I used to and I turned to school somehow for something that I didn't get from my father I think.  Because I kept, I've kept thinking that I've had worse feelings about particular moments of school before than I do now.  But no, now it's just a feeling that things aren't important the way they used to or — again, it's this lack of belief in — uh, I don't know whether it's what I'm doing or making myself do it.  I don't know which it is.  I think they're different.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of some of the embarrassing moments at the New Year's Eve Party and how they — well, several of them came from my not recognizing names of some of the men that we met who were connected with the publishing world.  And, I don't know, then it was, just seem, and I was thinking of my dinner partner, too.  And I had felt very awkward with him and that part, I think, particularly upset me.  Because somehow I felt I hadn't charmed him, I guess, is really what I felt.  And I, I don't know, I know I lost perspective, so I have no idea what effect I did have on him, or if I had any.  But I felt I was a total failure there.  And it was just seeming to me the — it's almost as if I've chosen a different way even beyond MSCZ to prove myself th— now, or maybe I'm just admitting it more.  I've always wanted to.  And it's almost now I just want people to like me, and that's enough if they like me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST What were the embarrassing moments that you felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well some — I didn't do anything really — but it was more I knew I had just met somebody that other people knew who he was, and I didn't either recognize the name or didn't really catch it.  But one uh thing in particular that — I was able to laugh about it the time when it happened, or not exactly right at the time, because I sort of pretended it didn't happen, right at the time, but yet the man handled it in such a way that I didn't feel terribly badly about it.  Uhm, was — I met somebody who's a columnist and — I don't even now remember his name, because it's not — he's a columnist for LFX, and I don't read it.  But, he had been talking with GG, who we'd met, and that was about the only name of somebody who's well known that I did recognize. </p>

<p>And I think GG had really indicated what this man did. But, then later, we were talking about TQMZ work, and this man had mentioned his father.  And so then I just asked him some question referring to, was he a LTQM, or something like that.  And he handled it very nicely, but then MSCZ told me what he did do, and was sort of laughing at me.  And he wasn't doing it in a nasty way either, but it was almost as if, then I realized I better not say too much, because I'm just going to do this all evening.  So in a way, I could laugh at myself over that, but in another way I felt extremely uncomfortable that I'd done it.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>But then the feeling — my having a good time or not, I think at that party (Sniff), — really came down to whether or not I felt the people who were with me wanted to be with me.  And the time I felt most unhappy was when my dinner partner — there was a lot of dancing during — while we were having dinner and he didn't, I guess in the end MSCZ told me he never danced with anyone, but he didn't dance with me.  And at one point our whole table was dancing except for him and me, and I, I don't know, then I began to feel that he preferred to be somewhere else.  And I don't think I was totally wrong, although I think I might have made him feel that way, by feeling that way myself first. </p>

<p>And then, what made it worse was, MSCZ was dancing with a very attractive young girl, and he was obviously flirting with her and having a very good time.  And, and he wasn't planning to come over to relieve my dinner partner.  And it just, I don't know, I think I felt most miserable at that time, and (Sniff), and then eventually a friend of ours came over (Sniff), and my dinner partner left so fast that I know I was right (Chuckle) to some extent, except I might have made him feel that way.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>And the other thing that kept bothering me and — in a way I know it's silly to keep thinking the way I was thinking the next day, but I kept thinking, I didn't know how to get out of that situation.  I didn't know what I could do, so that both of us could get relieved of a situation that was beginning to get a little tense.  And I kept thinking, if I just knew what to do, as if there was some right thing to do, or 1 or 2 things, almost like tricks or something, that I could have done, and yet — and then I kept thinking, if I had just been more confident, the situation wouldn't have happened anyway.</p>

<p>ANALYST What did you feel he didn't like about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I felt that uh, that he must think I was boring; not a good conversationalist.  (Pause, Sniff)  And I imagine too, I was comparing myself to other women there and feeling he must think I'm not sophisticated enough or, (Sigh) I'm not sure if that's quite the word I want, but (Silence, Sniff), although really, well it was almost as if I knew, or at least I felt I looked attractive that night, but it was almost as if it didn't have any appeal to him, because he could see through it to the fact that — well, I keep thinking of the word g—, that I was gauche, and I'm not — I don't know quite why that keeps uh, occurring to me, except that, that I would be awkward, that I was awkward.  I was awkward with conversation, and awkward with knowing how to handle things, myself and him and the situation and (Sniff)—</p>

<p>ANALYST For example, other than talking, what did you feel you couldn't handle, or how did you handle yourself that you felt was awkward?  Because I don't have a clear picture of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I had some feeling about — that he might have danced with somebody else, but he didn't want to dance with me.  And I don't know whether that's connected with this feeling of being awkward and that he would find me awkward, too.  But — and I don't know how to be more specific than this — but it was just somehow I didn't feel he was responding to me as a woman.  (Pause) Thought that somehow I must have been feeling awkward as a woman, but I, I don't know how to be more specific, except that I was feeling awkward in conversation.  I mean, somehow I wasn't attracting him in any way. </p>

<p>And (Sigh, Sniff, Silence), and when I think about it, it just seems terrible that, the fact that one person or one man, because I suppose it, it's only with men that I'd feel this way — one man could, who didn't have any particular interest in me, or want to give me really, any attention — that it could affect me the way it did.  (Pause)  Because I did have a very good time later, and (Sigh) — I don't know, somehow I discount — we were mostly then with, well then MSCZ came up later and also the fellow who had relieved my dinner partner was there and, but they were all — and then other people joined us — but they were all people that I knew before.  And so somehow, I discounted the fact that they enjoyed being with me, because I already knew them.  And it was as if I had to gather a lot of men to make up for this one man that didn't have any interest in me.  (Sniff, Pause) And I can see how I'm doing that every day, or everywhere in regard to just my father and so forth, but, just keeps on happening.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST Well, our time's up.</p>

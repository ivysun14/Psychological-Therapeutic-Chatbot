<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: The nurse comes over and Rebecca goes, "What's going on?" The nurse says, "Well, we found that when she was in the OR with her hand, that the heart rate went down to 40 and it would hit a beat and then stop, take two beeps and then stop. So, we had to call in the cardiologist and guess what? You're staying overnight because you're having a pacemaker put in." I just you know, a pacemaker?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did that mean to you, to get a pacemaker?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It scared the shit out of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then of course after Rebecca left, I got all the more depressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What did you decide to do? [0:01:02.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know, I was - I mean, nobody explained anything to me about you know, the pacemaker. The cardiologist came in and said, "Hi, how are you?" And I've seen him before and he's given me a hard time before, and he's transferred me over to two other doctors every time I've gone there, like for a heart stress test or anything, you know, because he's the (sarcastic tone) "head cardiologist."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With his bedside manner?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just - well, I would say when I would go to his office to see him, after being seen by other doctors, like when I was in the hospital one time with my heart. I had to go see him and he's like oh, nothing's wrong, but we want you to follow up with Dr. um, I don't know what his name was, Patel or something, but I haven't met him. And I was just like you know, I didn't care for him. But when he came into the recovery room from the hand surgery, he was very nice, I mean he's like, "Okay Louise, from now on you're going to see my face because I'm your cardiologist." I'm like oh, okay. "And I have to do a little incision tomorrow and we're going to put in a pacemaker," and that was you know, about it, because he was going into surgery. [0:02:37.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's all they told you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They didn't tell you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well they had told me that my heart had skipped you know, and so I went upstairs to a room. Rebecca came up for a while, then she had to go right to work. So it was like you know, it sucked. You're in this room, you don't know what the fuck is going on, you know. The aides and the two nurses I had were excellent. The two nurses, they each work 12-hour shifts, so no sooner did one get off and the other one was back on, so it wasn't too bad. [0:03:30.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But boy, they didn't really talk to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About all this and what it all meant to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I couldn't get the fricken TV to work, so I was up shit's creek.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just thinking, sitting there thinking, I bet, huh? You couldn't distract yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The lady in the bed next to me, she shored like truck driver. Oh, I wanted to get up out of the bed and just put the pillow over her face, but I couldn't because I had all these damn machines hooked up to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was just that holding you back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I got up out of bed, I think I would have strangled myself between the wires going that way and this way. I've got an IV over on this side, another one on this side. Oh. Then we find, you're very low on magnesium, so we've got to run four bags of that. I got the four bags of magnesium, the IV solution, and then the pain solution. And over on this arm was the blood pressure cuff going all the time. Just, just you know, just let me lay here. [0:04:52.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No peace?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So of course you know, you go to call Deborah and she don't answer her phone. Oh, it was just you know, pissa.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were sitting there alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And kind of, I imagine a bit scared and depressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. So then I went for my crying spree and I asked if I could talk to the doctor on call.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he come in and I said to him, "Can you explain this whole thing to me?" He says, "They didn't tell you?" I said no, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This thing here and this thing here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to know what's involved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He says, "Oh, it's a little thing like this and he's going to open you up and put this in you and then you know, he'll close you up." He said, "In about ten days you'll come back and see him and it will be taken up." He says, "But the machine alarms them that if it's not going correctly."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The machine you were hooked up to? [0:06:07.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then the pacemaker, he said, "If your heart goes through this, it will jumpstart your heart." You know, make a regular beat. So I said oh, all right. So that wasn't too bad, the explanation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did that help you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it did. And then I had one resident, she was very nice. She'd come in and sit on the bed and talk to me and if I had any problems, she was right there for me. She held my hand for another crying thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, she did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she came in at 6:30 in the morning and she you know, would come right in my room and sit with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You needed somebody to be there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That night, when I - the day I came in for the hand surgery, of course that's all they had down was the hand surgery. (phone rings) If that's my kid I'll kill her. I know I should have shut it off. [0:07:20.4]</p>

<p>(talks on phone) Yes, Deborah? Huh? I can't, I'm in Donald's. In my drawer with - in my basket. Okay? All right, bye. (hangs up phone) She called up Mark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Call, what's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Call Mark. That was Deborah. Mark must have called the house looking for me. So I mean it was like they knew about this, so the day when I was having the... put in, when the aides would help me to get up, well they didn't realize that they couldn't yank me from underneath my arm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:08:27.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they're pulling me and I'm going, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you were just - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I said call the nurse in, so they called the nurse in. I says, "Somebody has to explain to them how to transfer me out of the bed and how to move me in the bed." I said, "They're holding from here and they're yanking. They've got their arm underneath my armpit and they're pulling me." I said, "No, no, no, they're too rough." You know, they'd scream - I would scream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jesus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? So, we had to go through how to transfer me. So then when Madeline came in, I told her, so Madeline went out, and they had to call a physical therapist up to show them all how to transfer me. I said, now I wasn't this bad in the beginning. Why did I have to go through all this? And the bathroom was so small, there was no cord hanging because someone broke the cord, so all you just do is press the red button you know? I had said to her the night I went in, "You know the cord is broken." And she called down to maintenance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the cord? [0:09:51.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, you know how when you go in the basement, they have that red button for emergency?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you pull it in case you need help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, well that - the thing was yanked right out of the wall, you know? So I just pulled the red button and they'd go, (sarcastic) "Are you ready?" And I'd say, "Why do you think I pulled the button? Of course I'm ready." I was you know, kind of sarcastic by then. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had had enough of the shenanigans.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then they'd come in with my tray of food and I couldn't open up my food, because I only had the one hand. I said oh, I was poking holes in everything, trying to get things open. One of the aides come in and she says, "Oh, you don't like your oatmeal?" I said, no. She says, "How about a box of Cheerios?" I said fine. She brings me a box of Cheerios and just leaves it there. I says, now how does - [0:11:00.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you going to open it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just took my knife and I just stabbed that package to hell. I think there was more Cheerios on the floor and in the bed. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were really getting the first class treatment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really enjoyable. Then I went back to him yesterday and he took all the staples out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The hand doctor, the hand surgeon?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The heart surgeon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh the heart surgeon, okay, (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he did them yesterday, and Deborah and her girlfriend came with us. Dolores, Deborah's girlfriend, she walks with a cane sometimes. Now mind you, she's a bag of bones. I don't know who they should help. She walks like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's wrong with her? [0:12:13.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was in a car accident 19 years ago and she was left paralyzed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So when she's in pain, when she's out of drugs, this is how she walks, and when she's got drugs in her, she walks better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Deborah had to come along because I wanted somebody's hand to hold when I was getting those staples pulled out. Well, we left Dolores laying down in the waiting room, across two chairs. I mean, Deborah is helping her all the way, and I said to her Deborah, I says, "You might as well just out there while I get my staples pulled out." No, no, that's the whole reason why I came, is to hold your hand. I said, "Yeah, but she needs more help than I fucking do." [0:13:28.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was she doing, laying on the...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was in pain. She didn't have any marijuana or no Percocets or no Vicodins or no Fentanyl patches. She was just out of everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She was dry, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Marijuana is the only thing that really helps her. She's got a medical thing for it. What the heck. You know, so I mean having Deborah around, she slept at my house, downstairs, last night, and I told her I didn't want her there. I said, "Deborah, what are you making for supper?" I don't know. One night she made this meal with potatoes and chicken. It was so gross. The potatoes weren't cooked. I didn't like the chicken and the cheese sauce. I didn't have anything to eat last night. [0:14:53.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, boy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The night before, I think I finally made myself a bowl of soup. There's not a stitch of food. I said, "Deborah, do we have bread?" Oh yeah. I says, "Yeah, but it's green." The only thing left in my freezer is a couple of hamburger patties, some frozen fruit, some frozen vegetables, and there was two pieces of chicken that she had taken out last night to cook for tonight. I says, "I hope you're not cooking that chicken for me." I said, "Because we just had fucking chicken the other night." Well, I says, "Well, I put it back in the freezer, Deborah." She took it out again. I says, "Well, unless you're cooking it for Dolores," I says fine, I said, "but I'm not eating it." I said you know, "A piece of red meat." She gave her food stamps to Dolores to go food shopping, over to BJ's. I got a case of water out of two hundred dollars in food stamps. [0:16:07.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's - were they hers?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were Deborah's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she didn't buy anything for the two of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so she's - it's just like what we've been talking about, there's this kind of like... You were feeling very, in a sense betrayed, by her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said, "Deborah, I don't know why you're staying here tonight," I says, "because I can get along just fine without you, Deborah." Oh, what are you mad because I'm up there helping her? I said, "Deborah, you haven't helped me at all." (raises her voice) You ask any of the tenants and they'll tell you I'm always here for you and doing the wash. I said, "Yeah, look at the pile of wash that's been there for a week and a half, Deborah," and I said, "And I haven't even been home to wear clothes." It was all her shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. She's not shopping, she's not helping you out any more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. So I mean... [0:17:08.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And meanwhile she'll - I guess you can't help but see her tending to this woman upstairs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Giving her all the shopping and food.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like the other day, she walked up to Rite-Aid to get Dolores's prescriptions but mine, they can sit there until Dolores has her car running, then maybe she'll get them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, but she'd walk up to Rite-Aid for her. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know? So I mean it's - yeah. There's no way - oh, wait a minute, there's - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long do you think that will last with Dolores?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going along fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's true, because with Bennett, she would go all the extra mile for Bennett too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right, yeah. [0:18:09.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so there's two eggs left in the refrigerator, there was no kitty litter for the kitty litter box, cats are out of cat food, I mean it's just wonderful, just so helpful, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah-huh. I mean it's pissa, you know? As I said, I don't need her there. I said, "Deborah, I don't want you here, I don't need you here." I said, "I've done fine with you not helping me." You know? So don't worry about it Deborah. I don't like seeing you and her being intimate with each other. [0:19:09.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They didn't like the fact that when I went up there to see if you were all right, that when I got up there you were in the bed naked. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too much for a mom to see, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't need to see that, Deborah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Boy, what has that been like for you? This is kind of - it's almost as big as getting a pacemaker.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know, and people say to me oh, what are you doing - what's Deborah doing with her? I don't know, why don't you ask them? I said, "I don't know anything, ask them."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it being asked by people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It kind of you know, hit - brings me to the boiling point where I want to cry, you know I'm just so sick over it. [0:20:12.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, tell me. Tell me about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I mean if this was something that was going on for years, okay fine, but now all of a sudden this? You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's very upsetting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Seeing Dolores all over Deborah and you know, holding hands and kissing and ba-ba-ba-ba. Yeah. I don't need it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really hard on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I guess they were down the TV room last Sunday, watching the game, and Fran.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fran's going to have an opinion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She just went in and she blasted Dolores, then she says to Deborah the next day, "You tell that nigger girlfriend of yours that if she's got anything to say to me, tell her to come and say it and I'll beat the fucking shit out of her." [0:21:19.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did she blow up on Dolores over?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, playing with the blinds and opening up the windows and things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, the TV room on Sunday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But of course you know the heat's on and the heat's going out, you know, out the windows and everything and Dolores hollering and screaming and Deborah sitting on a chair here, and Dolores's right here talking to her, Oh honey, (kissing sounds), just for all the people to see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everybody sees it, yeah, sure, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What has it meant to you, to have Deborah data Dolores, to see that? What I sense is that it has a lot of meaning to you, has just a lot of painful meaning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know it's just so fucked up. [0:22:19.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fucked up, oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean... I mean like before this Christmas party, she was lucky if she ever said hi to Dolores, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And all of a sudden the two of them disappear at the party to go out smoking. They missed the whole fucking party, you know? Dolores's eating habits, oh, they're like Mary's. And then I put hard candy on the dish, she opens it up and she puts the wrappers all over the place. They're on the floor, they're on the coffee table, and then she's always blowing her nose because she's allergic to the - she has allergies, one of them is the cats. So she's always blowing her nose. Well the next thing I know, I had a big box of Kleenex that's like that, they're gone, they're up Dolores's because she took them with her. My toilet paper was missing. She does bring food up there but you know, I'm not supposed to know these things. [0:23:51.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not supposed to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because Deborah doesn't want to get caught, knowing that she's brought things up there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not yeah, why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the time she took one of my big candles, it was next to my computer. Well, all of a sudden it's gone. I said, "Deborah, what happened to my candle?" What candle? I said, "The one that was right here next to the computer." I don't know. What's up with this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't want to get caught though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know? But I mean if you're going to lie about it, and then when I go up to Dolores's and there it is on the floor, I'm like, "Oh, is that my yellow candle, Deborah?" Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't like to get caught. [0:24:51.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she does, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not so hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's like I said, she goes up there and it's like she's in Michael Jackson's never-never land, you know? She doesn't answer her phone when she's up there, she just lets it go to voice-mail. What the hell's the sense of calling her?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah-huh, ah-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, if she's not going to answer your call.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She ignores you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She shuts the phone off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. But she's keeping her distance from you when she does that. She's off on her own, not wanting you to interfere or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and Mark has been so nice. I'm really not sure it's the same Mark. I think they made a clone and now all of a sudden he's so nice. [0:26:05.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The many faces of Mark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like he come over Monday and I mean the poor bastard was in tears. Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever do this again. I says, "Well I didn't plan on doing it, Mark." He says, "I love you." And then he's like, "Well, aren't you supposed to be saying something back?" I said, "Like I love you also?" He says yeah. He says, "I really love you." I mean, this went on for like two hours, all the nice talking and kissing and you know, just being so nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kissing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Really very nice, you know? Of course he wanted to do more than kissing but we didn't go that way. Oh, Christ. [0:27:15.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you were asking, you were asking the heart guy, how long until you can have sex, right? What did they say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said any time I wanted to. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What were you feeling on Monday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wanted sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why didn't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he was afraid to, so I wasn't going to push it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh he wants, it wasn't you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. What was he afraid of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he would hurt me, so. But I mean, he's been there every day, he's been nice, he's having it rough at home with Keisha, she's been acting up again and all this stuff. Yesterday, him, Keisha and Deborah had to go see the counselor all together, and so when Mark came by my house like at close to 5:00, he's calling Keisha, and he says are you all right, and she said yeah, and he says, "Well I'll be home very soon." She said okay, daddy. I said, "Where's Deborah?" He said she's at a zumba class. I said oh really? I said, "It must be so nice that Keisha has you." He's the one that picks her up from school, he's the one that takes her to her other counselor. He's the one with her, he'll maybe spend an hour with me, but then he's home with her for the afternoon. Where's the wife, you know? [0:29:06.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had said to him yesterday, I said you know, I said, "Keisha's really lucky to have you in her life," I says "because you do everything for her." He says, "Yeah, I know." I said, "Well, I'll tell you something," I said, "Keisha really appreciates the things that you do for her." He says, "I know, she tells me all the time that she loves me more than her mother." I says, "Well, that's because you're playing both roles, both mother and father." She forgot her lunch at home one day. Mark left work, went and got her lunch and brought it up to her at school, then went back to work. I said, "Did you want to just keep it you know, cool, until everything straightens out at home?" He said no. He says, "I need to see you every day." I said okay, fine by me. We'll see what happens. [0:30:26.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, in some way I was thinking you're trying to kind of predict for him, how he might feel, so he can give you a heads up, as opposed to just breaking it off at some point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he's too loaded up by what's going on at home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He said no. He says, "I'll keep you informed of everything." I said, "Oh, thank you, that's all I ask for, is just give me heads up."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, for it to be a little bit smoother for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little bit smoother, not as rough and jarring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't have a watch on, so I don't know any idea if it's close.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, can you see that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It' 10:33.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's my life in a nutshell. There was a meeting at the apartment building because they're going to give us those fob keypads that you slide the card by the black box, and that's how you get in and out of your building. [0:31:41.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to a key?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, when it does, it tells everybody down at the center, the office, what time you went out and what time you went in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what time you went in, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So one lady says I'm not signing for it. She says that's an invasion of privacy. She says I'm not signing it. One of the guys is going to call HUD and someone's going to call somebody else but yeah, you know, because they're not signing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So now what will happen is people will leave the gates unlocked. We have gates that go around the back, so that you know, people can get in and out that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Without their card.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because they only give you two cards, so I'd have to have one and Deborah would have to have one. [0:32:46.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if one gets lost, you have to go down right away, pay fifty dollars for a new one and get a whole new number.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, let' Dolores give her a key, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that is really - that's really then, upsetting, Deborah and Dolores. Deborah going for this woman, involved with this woman who's - I mean, I was just thinking about you know, I think for you it sounds like I don't know what's more disturbing to you, that she's lesbian, that she's paralyzed, that she's got a drug dealing history, she's probably still drug dealing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's got a criminal history.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's not much to look at. [0:33:46.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mark starts with Deborah, "How's the negra, huh? How's it going there, Deborah, who's hitting who?" So Deborah had a sore back and she couldn't bend over and Mark goes, "Yeah, we know why you got a sore back, ah-huh." He gets her all - I mean, the things that come out of his... "Yeah, you didn't want to go black when my friend wanted to go out with you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's black too, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He goes, "She's a train wreck. She looks like she got run over by the train over down the end of the street." So I mean, I just - it just got to me. I said, "Mark, enough, it irritates me to know that she's there, enough with the teasing." So he stopped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It irritates you. [0:34:48.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no that brings up a lot. It's not a joking matter for very long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. You know? So... oh yeah, and Deborah has gotten more rude to Mark, you know? So... but yeah. I'm bringing myself home a sandwich from Subway, so I have something to eat. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good move.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll get one for lunch and one for supper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good move. And you've got The Ride down here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did. When he went over a few bumps it kind of bothered me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right, in the chest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was sore. It's so sore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so sore, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow, yeah, well that's a major league incision you've got there. [0:35:51.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And not only do they do staples, but I've got two layers of stitching that are inside, underneath.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, but those will dissolve.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those dissolve automatically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Today was the first day I could take a shower, because I couldn't shower with the damn bandages they had on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. Oh, boy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got a rash across my chest that is from all the tape. I said God, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been under the knife quite a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first thing Mark does when he comes in the house is he gives me a kiss. He'll sit on the couch with me and rub my back, and he's just been so good. [0:36:52.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some TLC.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He said to me, "What does the doctor say?" I need an awful lot of TLC. (chuckles) He says, "I can give you that." I said okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, it's good to be getting it from somewhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah-huh. So I don't know, what did I say to him? I think I might have asked him when was the last time he had sex with Deborah. He says, "It's been so fucking long I can't remember." Oh, I says, "It's not the once a week thing any more?" He says, "Ah, shit no, she's not interested." I says well that does happen, you know? I said she's probably going through menopause, she's 42 years old, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that make you feel, hearing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:37:57.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. You know? He says and then at nighttime he's got to go pick her up. He drives her to work at 5:00 in the morning, picks her up at 8:30 at night. He says, "So by the time I get home picking her up," he says, "I hit the bed and I'm out." He said the other night she tapped him on the shoulder. He said, I thought maybe she might have changed her mind and was going to give me sex all of a sudden, he said, "But I didn't want it anyways." He says, "But she didn't want it either, she had a question to ask me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I says yeah well, this time you'll go home with no underwear on or something. I says you're bound to lose something again. Sure enough, he forgot his phone. I says it ‘s a good thing he wasn't that far from - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, that's the - </p>

<p>CLIENT: - the parking lot. That's not my idea of going up there, you know? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right, right. [0:39:10.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Walking up the street, yeah. Would have taken me three hours. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well, so this works out okay then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we're on for next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll just have them - I'll just tell him my appointment for next -</p>

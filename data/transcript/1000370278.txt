<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) I was thinking (clears throat) a little bit earlier today about something that was, well, it was on my mind at the beginning of today, probably because I'd kind of decided I wanted to think about it.  But, uhm, I was feeling, by the time I left school, I was feeling very tense and sort of uneasy about something and I couldn't figure out what it was I was feeling uneasy about.  And I had become annoyed with my assistant in a way that had nothing to do with what she was doing.  And this was bothering me too.  And the whole feeling that I had reminded me of the feeling I had yesterday, I think, when I said I felt uncomfortable.  And a feeling, too, that well, I started the morning with a lot of things that I wanted to get done.  And I got some of them done but not all of them because some unexpected things happened.  And, uhm, I don't know, I felt as if I were racing through the whole day and I had to select what I was going to do, which I never like.</p>

<p>And I think it's partly this feeling that I've missed something somewhere, that I shouldn't have missed.  And I think I was annoyed at my assistant partly because she was trying to help me.  And, and, ah, when I'm feeling that way, I, I guess I feel I have to do it all myself because I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing and what I think I'm going to miss if I don't do it.  Or often, I've been noticing lately, if I'm asking her to do something I'm, I've worked it out in my mind and I'm very explicit what I want her to do, uhm, beyond where she needs direction, almost with the fear, feeling that my way is the best.  And I think perhaps a part of that is the fear that maybe it isn't the best and I don't want to find that out.  (Silence) And I just began to think of 1 thing in particular that got me annoyed.  But I don't know, I somehow have the feeling that that's not really why I was annoyed.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, well, we had science today with a teacher in the school, who come in once a week.  And he often will come in late and either start his lesson and then kind of wander off, saying, "Well, you finish it."  Or, "Here are the boys.  You can get things back in order."  Or today he wanted us to start it.  And then while the, he gives the children a lot of things to experiment with and very often he lets them go beyond the point where they're still really using the materials.  And then he'll just suddenly leave, uhm, with the children sort of running around wild.  And he did this today and he was there for a while making it absolutely unclear whether he wanted to talk them again or not.  And I don't, I don't know, I was just obviously in the mood for being annoyed so this really annoyed me.  And I suppose the other thing that was annoying me was that, uhm, this is the aspect that my assistant takes care of, uhm, the different science things that we do in the room is sort of the 1 area where I've tried to let her really plan things and do things.  And, uhm, so she was planning on discussing this with them.  But then he was staying, talking with her and the kids were running wild.  And, and so again I had to do something.</p>

<p>And I suppose I was annoyed too because I hadn't had a break from them yet and I was just kind of tired of (clears throat) disciplining them.  And when I'm in this mood, I don't discipline them well, I just kind of get angry at them, which doesn't help.  And I knew I was doing that so I wanted to just get away from them till I could approach them in a more positive way.  But I somehow feel as if that incident, in itself, is not what was really making me annoyed, that it might not have annoyed me if I had been in another mood.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think the, uhm, implied, though, the feeling that I was being criticized by the boy's mother yesterday has something to do with it too.  Because I, I know all today I was very aware of wondering was I right or was I wrong in the way I assessed things and sort of, well, I don't know exactly how I felt about it but almost as if I were feeling sorry for myself that a mother would criticize me that way and then wondering if she really had.  And it, it was the kind of remark that she said her son had made which is unusual for a child to make unless it comes somehow from the parent first so I was kind of putting it all on her.  And I don't know, perhaps I was feeling guilty that she hit upon a spot where I felt weak, that perhaps I hadn't done enough.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But it's just this whole feeling, again, today of there's something I haven't done that I've missed doing, I should have done.  And (clears throat) and it, I think very often, if I feel the way I do today, it's the kind of day when I would just sort of sit there, trying to think through everything and figure out what it is that is disturbing me, main—, namely, what it is that I've forgotten that I am bothered by.  And, of course, sometimes I'll sit there and get more frustrated because I don't know what it is.  Probably there wasn't anything.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: This might not be connected with what you're saying, I'm not really sure.  But it does occur to me that there's one thing missing from what you've said here today, that you didn't mention anything about your being late and you usually do.  And I just wondered if you had thought of it and not said it or if it was missing.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  I had, I'd thought of it.  Uhm, in fact I was just starting to think of it now.  I'd sort of put it out of my mind for a while because it seems like the, practically every time I go to the hairdressers' it's what happens.  And although it hairdresser today, it, it's been bothering me that it happens.  And it was another thing that made me feel so tense today because I was so determined that I wasn't going to be late, it was almost an obsession with me.  And then I was.  In fact, I had to meet MSCZ — this was one of the things that happened that I hadn't planned on — uhm, to look at something and he was going on to his doctor after we'd looked at it.  And he was, he was, ended up being about 20 minutes late and I was really amazed that he was — he was upset but I think I would have been frantic if I had been doing something like that.  And, and the whole feeling today has been everything, I've been trying to plan everything that I did so I wouldn't be late, so I could get to the hairdressers' so I wouldn't be late and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's a —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I just did too much.  I did —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Your appointment with MSCZ was before the hairdresser?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It came up unexpectedly?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, I had, it had something to do with a gift my father's giving us that we're picking out.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And, ah, yesterday —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You don't mention anything about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't really know how I feel about it yet.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah!  Well, I'll figure it out —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) I haven't even thought about it, really.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, it was just that I, I ah, I wonder how come.  It's almost as though you skirted around what you and MSCZ were looking for.  I'm not sure but, eh —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ah!</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I don't know why unless it was my need to have some control (laughs) over the situation and not tell you.  Because I was very aware of that.  It's almost as if I'm, some kind of a game I'm playing because I think I half expected you to ask or at least I half expected to end up saying but I had to start out by not saying.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think in connection with it — it's, uhm, a pastel that my father's giving us and, uhm, and it's really a very nice gift but I, I almost haven't let myself think about it because I somehow think I have emotions connected with it that aren't pleasant and I don't want to really face them.  Because when he told me that he was going to do this last night, I had absolutely no feeling of pleasure when he told me.  But it's something that I should be grateful for and feeling pleased about.  It's a, whichever one we decide we want, it's very lovely.  And if MSCZ and I were doing it completely on our own, I think I'd be delighted.</p>

<p>ANALYST: He called you or he was here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, he was in PKW and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Out to your place?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  I think that bothered me too.  Because he called after he had uhm, — he often comes down to PKW, uhm, on business and will stay overnight Monday nights.  He might have called earlier, I'm not sure.  I can't remember if he said he had now or not.  But, uhm, what he prefers doing, even though often he'll feel as a duty to me he has to see me, at least that's how I've always taken it, but he much prefers to go to the movies or something when he comes down here with one of the men that he works with.  In fact it's kind of a joke between MSCZ and me because he, it almost, it does seem like it's sort of duty when he will have dinner with us or do something with us.  And so I think in a way I was hurt, although I didn't think much about it last night because I just assumed that he would do things this way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So, so he told you on the phone, then?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  And I, I don't know, I — it was almost a reaction of, well, good.  Anything I can get from you is fine.  But it, there's some reason you have for giving it to me which I'm not going to like.  And, I don't know, it was sort of like, well, let's get from him what I can, type of thing.  (Pause) I think I've always had that feeling because I've always had the feeling that he will give things to us as a way to show his affection because he can't show it any other way and I've resented it.  Because it used to be that, uhm, well, he rarely would buy clothes for us but if you ever did go on a tr—, shopping trip with him when he had decided he was going to get you something, he'd be extremely generous.  And then my attitude would simply be, now is the time to get as much as I can because he's, because I know him enough to know that he will be very generous and expect gratitude as a result, which I could very, very easily feign.  (Clears throat) And somehow I think I'm reacting the same way about the, uhm, pastel.  Because even today I, when we were looking at them, there are 2 in particular we like.  And one is within the price range that the upper limits that he had set.  And he had picked one out that he thought he might give us in that range.  And then there's a smaller one that both MSCZ and I like, which is less expensive.  And I think the main thing that makes me unable to say, "Yes, that's the one"  is because it's less expensive and then I won't feel I'm getting as much as I could while he's in this mood.</p>

<p>And it's thoughts like this that make me not want to think about it because it's just, I don't know, so cold.  And I'm not feeling that way he would like me to at all.  And I'm not feeling the way I'd like to.  And I don't quite understand, beyond that he likes to be the one to be giving, what's leading him to decide to do this at this point.  It's not a Christmas present, and, as far as I know, it's not a birthday present or any other type of present in that way.  So I think I'm sort of suspicious of what he's going to be asking in reply or response.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you have some particular suspicions?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, this would only work for MSCZ and me and he's giving it FYC and MEIR too so, giving one to FYC and MEIR so I'm not sure how much it's working.  But with MSCZ and me, we can't afford something like this ourselves and it would put us in the position of being very grateful to him and, in subtle ways, looking for him, to him for anything particularly nice in our life.  I don't know, it's sort of hard to — well, I suppose just gratitude and applause for this wonderful, generous thing he did.  (Pause) And also I think I sort of dread seeing him and talking about it because, I don't know, he'll have to be assured over and over again that they were all very lovely and it was such a good idea and appropriate thing for him to do.  And sentimental isn't the word, but when he talks about, I can just see him talking about something like that and getting, well, doesn't seem to be quite what it is but he somehow seems to overdo his sentimental and maudlin are the 2 words that come to my mind.  And that's, reaction to it.  Or in any case, he as—, he's asking the person he's talking to to enter into his exact same feeling and agree with him and also him but I can't anymore.  (Pause) Express them, which often I can't do now.  I used to play that game with</p>

<p>ANALYST: When did you stop?  I mean, in playing a role?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know because, uhm, — it was after I was married and I don't know exactly when.  (Pause) Because I think, before I was married, as much as I sensed that I thought things differently than my parents or there was something else to, ways to think of things, I really still held on to the fact that this, my parents' view of things or my father's or my mother's, whichever person was expressing them, was the way to see things.  And so I would respond in the same way and we'd all encourage each other.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny.  When I was thinking of my father in regard to the way he will sometimes respond to things in what I term as sort of a sentimental way, I had very much in mind the image of my sister, FNA, too, who, in particular, does the same thing.  And it's almost that my father really feels it because of sort of a narrowed view of things but FNA puts it on thick so that it's kind of a forced thing.  I don't know, it's what has worked in my family and, and she may not be aware of it.  But in any case it seems to be much more false in her case.  And somehow my reacting to my father in the way I do has something to do with FNA.  I, because I was just trying to separate my father from it and, I don't know, it just, I don't think it would bother me as much if, if FNA were unconnected with it.  I suppose one reason it bothers me is that it is one way my father and FNA sort of feed each other in something like that.  And they'll go on and on and it becomes sickening to me but maybe it's sickening because I'm jealous more than anything else.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think almost uhm, unconsciously I'm always comparing how I react to my parents and their reaction to me to how other members of the family react to each other.  And the reason I say this, though, is thinking just in terms of the conversation on the phone last night.  And my father began a, in a very awkward way, at least for me it was.  I couldn't immediately respond to it.  And I think in the back of my mind, making it impossible for me to think of anything to say, was this thought, well, if this were FYC or FNA, there wouldn't be this awkward beginning to the telephone call.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How would it be, do you imagine?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, that they'd rattle on and somehow he'd be talking easily.  Or that maybe just they'd be more pleased than I was to hear him call.  Because as much as I might have been annoyed if I'd known he was in PKW and hadn't called, I wasn't that pleased that he was.  (Pause) But I think the beginning of his conversation bothered me more than I realized (clears throat) because he started out with a phrase that people always say and, I don't know, to me it's never really meant that much but I've said it too because it seems to be the polite thing to do.  Because he, he began it by saying, "Mama sends her love."  And then he kind of stopped and said, "Well, she wanted me to tell you that and so I thought I'd better say it right away so I'd remember."  And it was just such an unfeeling thing.  There was, perhaps on my mother's part there was some feeling originally but it was so mechanically conveyed.  And it was like check number 1 off his list so he could get it over with and then he wouldn't forget.  And I couldn't think of anything to say when he said that except that it just, I know it bothered me very much.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

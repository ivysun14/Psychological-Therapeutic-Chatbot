<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so how you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I just, yknow, keep getting more put on me.  I, I know it, it sounds crazy, but it's like I go out of my way, like I feel like a prisoner in my own home.  I love to go out in my garden in the backyard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A, a woman moved in last year with this little Chihuahua.  She barks I mean constantly.  I have to wait and keep looking out to see, constantly.  It's like I remember last year my head was going to explode.  I had to come in and lay down I had such a headache.  So, it's like saying it to her doesn't even like, like she escapes the yard.  She's so little and I put bricks, like stones, the red bricks around so, last year 'cause [NAME OTHER] escaped the yard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I'm like trying to garden and trying to get her.  Yet, [NAME OTHER]  I'm going to have to talk to her 'cause I mean I love to garden in the back.  That's my relaxation.  I'm going, and it's like you have to approach it in a friendly way, and it's like, yknow—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the dog out all the time or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It seems like a lot, even if I'm in my kitchen and my window isn't open, they got super, supersonic hearing.  I'll, I'll put some bags down or whatever, she looks straight at the window, whoo, and they have that bark, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, constant.  So, now I don't want to go out back because she's out there.  Then my neighbor next door on the left of me, he has a, an Akita who I love her.  She's beautiful.  I love her, um, but now [INAUDIBLE] in and out four times prison this and that.  His wife moved to Florida, but she comes to visit.  She pays his bills.  Oh please, and, and now he locks her in the basement 'cause now he's working for ten hours a day.  So, that's killing me.  It's breaking my heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she doesn't bark?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When [NAME OTHER] isn't at home, she barks constantly.  It's not so much the barking from [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, it's breaking my heart 'cause she's in the basement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not outside.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you offer to dog sit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know why, because he, he, he borrowed money off of us here and there, and I thought he was doing okay and he needed it because he's not working and, and [NAME OTHER] living in Florida, but yet she pays his bills, and then, then I realized he's, he's buying stuff with that money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did he ever pay you back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He asked us, oh, no, no.  He asked us if we, if I would let her in and out and [NAME OTHER] said I'm not, no.  I'm not going to let [NAME OTHER] do that.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, too much responsibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's too much responsibility with him like, I don't know what he takes, but it's always twenty dollars, twenty dollars.  So, I don't know what that is.  I don't really care to know, but, um, if I come in and out of his house, and he, whatever he takes, he might accuse me of taking something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean?  So, you have to really go to the extreme with your mind to, to keep yourself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know what you mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow, um, but I give her water outside when he does put her outside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and I always, when I go to the PetSmart for my cats I get dog biscuits for, yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I'm just an animal lover, and yknow, it's like okay, I can't go in the back and I haven't, I need to go out in the back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, I mean it sounds like that your one next neighbor is not necessarily the issue about going out back.  It's more the Chihuahua.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you just need to talk to your neighbor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, and I'm going to have, it's going, it has to be like [NAME OTHER] do you think there's some way that [NAME OTHER] and I could become friends because I love to be out in my garden, yknow.  Is there any kind of treat or some kind of a thing that, yknow, we could do.  I just can't go out and say, yknow, [NAME OTHER] can you give me a break, is which I really want to say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does [NAME OTHER] work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I don't think she works as much as she used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the dog is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, [NAME OTHER] is out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Insides sometimes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And when she don't chain her up, she gets out of the little nooks and crannies, goes down the alley and then, um, reversed.  Then I'm worried she got out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right.  Then you're taking the responsibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I feel, it's like when people go away, we have a street cleaning thing on Thursdays; can you move my car 'cause we're going to Florida.  I don't go nowhere.  I'm like, yknow, the, the, the dog person, um, um, the valet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're the reliable neighbor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, but yet people treat me like crap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean if that's the case and these are people are asking you, then I mean I would say no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it's too [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am saying no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am saying no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean I think that's reasonable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow, like the one lady on the end, she's in her [AGE] and her son's in his [AGE], but can you take us over to the doctor?  Can't do it [NAME OTHER].  It's like I tell [NAME OTHER] take my car to work because they see my car parked outside, [NAME OTHER] always home, and that's not the case, yknow.  I have a job.  I'm nonstop all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm still crying every day.  I'm going through thing where I gained like six pounds in the past like month and a half.  I can't stand it.  I'm eating sweets, which is not me, and it reminds me of years ago when I was really bad—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you definitely are not overweight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Definitely not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You always tend to fall on the side of the underweight side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, six pounds.  Even though it may be six pounds, it's, it's not obvious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, but it is to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You look healthy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well maybe 'cause I'm tanning a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, yknow, it's like I got my mom and [NAME OTHER] to where don't call me at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're getting, I don't even want to say 'cause as soon as you say they're getting along, boom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know, then, then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just have to expect the worst for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if they're not calling in the evening, you can count your blessings, yknow, 'cause, yknow, some of the stuff that they have to go through, they have to work out on their own.  There's nothing that you can work out for them, yknow, that you're always kind of the one in the middle, and that if you're not finding myself not in the middle, then just appreciate, yknow.  You know what I'm saying, if you're not getting those—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Calls, yknow, they have to realize they have to work it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And not put you in the middle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And, yknow, I'm still crying every day, and now I'm going through I guess the change of life 'cause I haven't had my period since like September, and then all of a sudden, I'm on fire.  It's like, it don't come on gradually, yknow.  It's not like you're sitting there or standing there going I'm feeling a little warm.  It's just I'm hot and then I'm cold.  And then I went to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in the beginning of March 'cause I'm, my hands are numb in the morning, and I'm not, I know I probably have a pinched nerve 'cause sometimes it really stops me in my tracks.  Um, so he wants me to have an MRI because, um, every now and then I get so dizzy to where I have to have my hands over my eyes and try and feel my way to, to lay down, and it, it wakes me up.  I don't know what that is, um, so, I, yknow, and plus I want to call to see 'cause I usually get blood work when I'm there once a year.  So, I want to see, get the blood work done and then have the test done and see if my, my equilibrium might be off or, yknow, potassium or my cholesterol might be high, or I mean or something.  I'm a diabetic, and yknow if you're diabetic and once you get blood work done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, blood work or if you're urinating a lot and drinking a lot of water.  I mean that's one of the signs, but usually—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not extremely thirsty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow, so that's not anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it runs in the family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't think it runs on my Dad's side, but we don't know 'cause my Mom was adopted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, and your Mom doesn't have it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Her side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so, and I'm worried about [NAME OTHER] and his health.  He snores and God, he snores like I never heard anybody snore before.  It's like, and then he goes into like a, a whistle and then like a cry.  And then I'll hear him breathing, and I'll be downstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's his work hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He snores like crazy.  He's eating like crazy.  He's gaining weight like crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's his work hours now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, he's slow right now, which is surprising.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yknow, but we did go up to see his friends in, was it in, like a month ago, [DEIDENTIFIED] or that I've only been in their company maybe three times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're like, they're really nice people.  They're like, like still living in the hippie days, but they're in their sixties, yknow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they got, oh, it's funny.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you got out?  You went to [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, and all morning he was in bed, I was down in the, in the basement living room and for an hour I was talking out loud, I'm not going.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you went?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I went.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And did you enjoy it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I did because I didn't just sit at the table.  I went around the whole house because she's got stuff, like there's a show on Home and Garden TV called What's With that House?  Well, she got every nook and cranny crammed with this little things and I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The whole house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Collector?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, but, but, yeah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you had in common?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I'm, my house is very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not as cluttered.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It isn't cluttered at all, but when I go to other people's houses, I enjoy that, yknow.  So, I kept myself—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it sounds like you were trying to talk yourself out of it before you went.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I always do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it's good 'cause I think, yknow, I mean if it's slow right now, maybe this is the time to work on doing something else special I mean like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not happening.  We only go out if we're invited.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no trip to the shore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Huh-uh, it's not happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] someplace.  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because he would do the same thing at home that he would do when we were away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know this.  Um-hum, yeah.  He's not the sightseer or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's get away from the neighborhood kind of type.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He needs to be away from the neighborhood, which is exactly what I was thinking that it gives you a chance to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and actually that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Get beyond your, your block, which obviously has a lot of stress when you spend so much time there, yknow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and the funny thing is I live across the street from a church, which there's nobody looking back at you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm just, every day is, I know things can't be perfect.  I can't tell [NAME OTHER] what to do.  I can't tell [NAME OTHER] what to do, but I can ask.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I think unless, unless [NAME OTHER] knows that, um, her Chihuahua—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know how it don't bother her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She must be used to it or maybe [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, 'cause whenever she's home, [NAME OTHER] out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Whenever [NAME OTHER] out, [NAME OTHER] barks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds like with [NAME OTHER] her way of dealing with it is to not have, not have her dog in the house.  Soon as she gets home, put the dog out, yknow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she has to still hear her barking.  Oh my God.  It's from a little tiny dog, what a bark, and I love animals, and I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need the quiet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then it seems like on nice days, I have all this stuff to do.  I had to take my Mom and all her taxes down.  I just dropped them out and then the man [NAME OTHER] does 'em, and, uh, it's like trying to get work done.  It would be like I tell my sister, take three hours like at, at noon, go somewhere for three hours and come back at three and try and catch on those three hours.  See nobody gets the fact that I work at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do everything so that nobody else has to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, and then there's times it goes through my head, I'm just going to kill myself, yknow, just going to kill myself because I can't, I need some peace.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that don't stay with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it comes and goes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's more like a feeling of frustration that you get, yknow, when you're feeling pushed to a particular limit that you start feeling that way.  You know you always seem to handle all these things that are there.  I mean, yknow, with all, with the all people that, that are putting pressure on, that you feel pressure from like your family and even your neighbors, you always seem to succeed.  I mean you seem to still, yknow, do what you need to do and take care of the things you need to get done, yknow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just I wish that there were some moments that you were able to enjoy a little bit more too, but it sounds like you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's rare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's so rare.  I haven't worked in, um, in ten years.  Never had a day off in ten years.  I can't stand it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, now who's your boss right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, yknow, in terms of taking a day off, it's also something that, that you need to allow yourself, yknow, but I think you get so driven with certain things that you feel you need to get done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That it's hard for you to just kind of say okay, yknow, I'm just going to take a day off today.  Yknow, you're your own boss, but you're your own tough boss if you know what I'm saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it wouldn't be the end of the world to take a day off and give yourself that opportunity, but I think you have to prepare yourself not to be down on yourself if you didn't accomplish that day.  It's okay to have a [INAUDIBLE] day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean?  You'd have to say to yourself, it's okay, yknow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's okay to go shopping or, yknow, goof off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the other thing.  I hate, hate shopping.  I hate it for anything, clothes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you liked going to the craft store, didn't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that closed.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Find another one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did.  I did.  When I was up [NAME OTHER], uh, I said on the way up there, I said to [NAME OTHER] I said geez, I really miss [DEIDENTIFIED] 'cause see they didn't just sell fabrics.  They sold all kinds of little windchimes and stuff that I like putting outside and all.  So when I went up to [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER], I, I was telling her and she said, oh, there's another store better than that, and then she was showing me all this other stuff that she bought.  It's called the [DEIDENTIFIED], and she said people think it's just Christmas stuff.  So, there's one in, in a [DEIDENTIFIED], but there's so, I called and here there's one right over in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, she said they sell everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And did Joann's Fabrics close across the country or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they all close or just the one store?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just the one store I found out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause they're, they're a chain, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They closed the one that I go to on [DEIDENTIFIED], 'cause they're building a Target there where, where the movie theater was and all, which I didn't know there was another one around, and [NAME OTHER] said yeah, there's one right up by her, and here—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's, um, there used to be just up near [DEIDENTIFIED] there were like two huge, I forget the names  of them, two huge craft stores right by the, not in the mall, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Michael's, there's Michael's and then there's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's another one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that just opened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're in the same strip mall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like they're both like right next to each other practically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Ace, not Ace.  I know.  My, my neighbor gives me the sale paper all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I guess my point is that I know that you don't like to do certain shopping—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I remember you have liked to go craft shopping—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean.  Yknow, starting projects or, yknow, and again—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, that can feel like work, but yknow, it's more, it's less mundane.  It's like doing something that you enjoy doing and, yknow—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I'm creative every day, I, I enjoy that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, then that's your, that's your break, yknow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So I would say, yknow, why not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] craft store.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I certainly did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do that.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did.  I did that.  I called Monday to see where they were located.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Go visit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I am.  I am going to go do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doctor's order.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's like, yeah.  If I, if I have to go buy clothes and stuff, I just hate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or grocery shopping or that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, hate it.  And I also got, um, [NAME OTHER] right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She, she already wrote me two letters 'cause I got jury duty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So, she had sent them out.  Well, they claim they never got it.  So, then I got to show up for jury one trial or one, um, two days or one trial.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's in the city of [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she claims it's government, federal and county.  So, um, I said, yknow, my doctor's secretary already sent two letters, and she said well we never got them.  She says did they use the word excused.  I was like I don't get it.  So I said I'm going there tomorrow, and then, um, so I, I told [NAME OTHER] and then I told the woman on the phone that I'll send another letter if that's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me write up your, I'm assuming you need the prescriptions.  So, I'm going to write those real quick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well she said she would take care of it and write up a letter for 'em, and then I have to send this in with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me take a look at it then.  Um, let me just see.  Let me get this written up real quick for you.  Are you taking any Klonopin during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You're taking half twice a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay 'cause before you were only taking it at bedtime, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was taking it during the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you said I could take an extra half if I couldn't sleep.  Well, I don't.  I don't take that extra half.  I take half, half and whole.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's how it's written.  Let me give you these and now I'll take a look at that.  I've never seen one quite that big.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well it's the whole thing.  It's all the instructions and what, what, where to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's the prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep, let me take a look.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Usually it's the postcard they send you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they didn't get the letter twice.  She looked it up.  So, I don't get it.  I, I just don't get it.  I mean I really just don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's odd.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, if, if twice I ignored the postcard that I've been selected for jury duty—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did, did you send the letter with the postcard like when you sent the postcard back—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was the letter that [NAME OTHER] typed up, were they together?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't think I sent the postcard, but it has your identification number.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause there's usually, there's the little postcard and then there's a couple of things that you check.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I did do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually just says that I can't, and then you attach the note.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can send the two back together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I wonder if the two were sent back separately like the letter was sent and your card was sent 'cause unless [NAME OTHER] had your ID numbers—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	From the card.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Yeah, because she did have the ID number.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it was on the letter?  But did she have the card?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty sure because she had to answer questions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's odd.  Well, yknow, talk to [NAME OTHER] and see 'cause she'll probably have a copy of whatever she sent too 'cause she keeps those on file.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so, so I did, and she said well show it to you and then she would type something up, but to let you know all about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see here.  One, two, three, four.  So the next visit would be the first week and second week in June, [DATE].  Want to do June [DATE], eight thirty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just want to make sure I'm not going to the gynecologist.  Okay, I'm not going till the [DATE] of June so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you a card.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE] is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okey doke.  Turn this off.</p>

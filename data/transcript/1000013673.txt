<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the... interview 18. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I had a French test this morning. I think things went pretty well considering how I much prepared for it. You know I did a lot better than I would have if I hadn't taken it at all. But I think I did okay on (ph) that. Yeah, but I feel an extreme pressure, as far as my time goes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: With this week in particular and the rest of the quarter. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a sense of having so much to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you always feel like you're rushing some things or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There's a tendency to rush things, that's the thing, I don't do it so well. Like I said I was rushing from one thing to another. I'm likely to put off the second thing and run back, when I should be doing the second thing. Trying to think of a good example. I don't know if I'm going to take the test this morning and come back and study for an hour. And then go to work. </p>

<p>What I end up doing is taking the test, and messing around for an hour. Then going to work. And I finished study after work until 2:30. And then working late, and then messing around for 15 or 20 minutes, rather than choosing to study. But that gets pushed around. But, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but it's like saying you can't really handle that, that rushing thing? [0:02:37.0]</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I sort of-</p>

<p> COUNSELOR: After these piled on activities (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have to feel that some of the time is my own. Of course that's what-what it ends up being, the time that's my own, I usually spend it, almost like I've been twiddling my thumbs for the last three weeks. (inaudible at 0:02:56.8) I have to study. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that time alone isn't worth much to you anyway. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It isn't worth much to you anyway, that time alone, in terms of what you really-</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's not. No. It's sort of... it's sort of like a rut, for me (inaudible at 0:03:26.5) in. There are demands and then the will. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give you a chance kind of for some time off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just you know, some people-I'm trying to distinguish from this time off. Because some people when have time off, they read or -  there are a lot of things people do during time off. But my time off-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is just time off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just time off. It's time, more or less with nobody (ph). If I keep up activity after activity, I don't think I really mind until they get some pleasant activities and then (inaudible at 0:04:12.0) it isn't going to work. But at the end of the day, I'll-I'll just-well, halfway through the day, I'll get very very tired. Well, it's like-I don't what, that involved in saying that. I just sort of-getting tired, I'm just thinking how this-not really wasteful time. That waste time I spend is maybe (ph) rest time. (inaudible at 0:04:57.0) I get one done very quickly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So -  so you're kind of implying that maybe it's just a requirement you have for some time that is just time off. Just for your own physical-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's a requirement that I seem to have developed. I'm not saying that I have to have it, always being-always there. It's something that I've developed, it's a habit. It's like some people (inaudible at 0:05:27.5), develop a habit of sleeping 10 or 11 hours a night. Something like that, and then I really need it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've gotten into that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And somehow you-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I don't have it I miss it. Like right now, I feel like taking a cup, two cups of coffee.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the account of, you mean, having had a day like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not just to say, (inaudible at 0:06:02.3). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's sort of getting exhausted having to do all that running and have things piled up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, things have been coming at me too fast, for me. In my medicine (ph) class [two more to be mailed] (ph) to me. Just a little bit thing, but that's how they've been. Just the one thing you have to remember, I always seem to have just little odd chunks of time between two activities. And the chunk of time is too short to get into anything. </p>

<p>I don't know-like when I have 45 minutes between two things, doesn't feel like enough time to do studies. I don't think I can sit down and study for just 45 minutes. It has to be a long time before I can really get into it. So I don't even bother, I don't even attempt it, until (ph) I've got a long period of time to do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not that you've really failed at that, studying for that 45 minutes chunk of time. It's more like when you just look-when you kind of imag-when you think of 45 minutes in studying, it just doesn't seem to fit, with how you study. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can't get that involved and get into it. I'm going to set it down and come back and pick it up in another 15 minutes. Do that six or eight times in the course of a day, you've spent an hour and a half on a book. I have to have a whole hour to have at one time. It's so much against my nature if studying to be something like that. It takes effort to get started. [0:08:10.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It takes like a certain amount of effort, every time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of-the way you're seeing it, it doesn't pay to have to put in that effort. Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that it doesn't pay but that... sort of. It's (inaudible at 0:08:51.7) prolong something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you won't have enough to show for that kind of, kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's - it's sort of 6, 15 minutes a day. It's scattered throughout the day and not, not anywhere approach, an hour and a half thing. And sometimes I try to do that (ph). I just had a short period I have to be (inaudible at 0:09:29.6) in that. Maybe just more time than just, within the means (inaudible at 0:09:36.5). That's in the back of my head. I have to keep on glancing up at the clock and stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you think you were stressed or anything like that, that kind of thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well by-biased by (inaudible at 0:09:54.9). Kind of the reason that, what I've been talking about so far, three, four weeks-four weeks, something like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you don't really care about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just a little observation for me, [to consider] (ph). I don't consider any, a major thing, for the (inaudible at 0:10:23.9). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have other important-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, maybe (ph) a little fact. It's a good thing that you-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not an issue in any kind of way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in the one sense, I think that it would be. It would be nice to be out of this, be [out of college] (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Literally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To get... you know, if I spend time with little chunks of time during the day, studying, I could clearly make this time at night, do it at night or something like that. You know, some-in a way it would be good to be able to do that. But then you know in the nighttime (ph) it's an issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But even-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's not a critical, issue. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what's happening when you're talking about, just that, that mental thing. Is it, the thing we've talked about a lot about not-having it or just getting into something? Or... [0:11:29.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really, tough to get into. I don't know. Just... just sort of awkward always having to come here and find something to talk about it. It may not be awkward for some people, but-is it healthier, to be talking, than just [staying the same] (ph). It just seems to really just hard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like about-what I guess basically what you mean is, just is you've always had people to talk-once you think of them. You do it a lot of listening to other people, and kind of waiting around to [become friends with them] (ph). And clearly, there's like a question-I mean it's not structured like that, or you can't do that. Like it's intrinsically difficult for you to have to sit with that with having to talk. Then on top of that, I guess there's things about, well what should you be talking about here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm always having to come up with something. Seems since there's not much time, it's an ongoing thing. And even if there were, then that would be the moment, that this would actually open into this thing. You know just the thing like you and I would be really [have to] (ph) get down to business, really down to the fine-the most significant things. [0:13:19.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what happens when you think about, that you really should be getting down to business and talking about the tacks (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really doesn't bother because just, I think I'm doing the best I can. I have a hard time, in school. And it bothers me. I have a hard time with people. It bothers me. I'm not coming here, if I'm going to have a hard time here. And let it bother me. Because that's just one more thing to upset me and I don't need that, so. If I have a hard time then I'm just going to accept it, even if it bothers me. [0:14:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you manage that, in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will. First thing I will do tonight. Work hard. And surely I'll show up. Plus school is mandatory. Do I have to in school? It's hard. Interacting on the street is always mandatory. This is sort of here in time so many benefits and, it is-it's not so clean, kind of pass and fail. I mean, I get as much out of it as I put into it, I suppose. That's all I have to tell you. It's sort of let you in on like it-I've yet-I get as much out of it as I put into it. </p>

<p>But, I shouldn't get upset if I can't put a lot into it, than one particular time, if you have to sort of see its whole purpose. It's not the sort of thing that someone could, could sit down and point at me and say, "You need to go to the counselor today. You must." You know I'm not going to die without it. (inaudible at 0:16:02.4) I just-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are times-</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I-what I'm looking for is just something to make, my understanding a little better or my life a little better. That doesn't mean it's-my life is completely unworkable unless I find something. But it's just I'm-maybe something that you said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well-well something-I was -  this part (ph) I get was something about, that it really makes a difference to you that, you're not desperate for this thing, or if that's not the critical thing that's going to make the difference in your life, every time you come here. That doesn't, absolutely. [0:16:44.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well- that's true but-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That isn't what you want in here? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really, no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry it's rough on you to have to come here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of it. I sort of, can't conceive of this being the like, the critical thing, and doing the way you're talking about it. The wish (ph) I have is not like-I sort of, I just can't continue, is I feel like that. If you-if I were to make it be the critical thing and have all these expectations on talking. You know expectations in terms of everything like that. </p>

<p>There's always a possibility that these things might not, really work out. If it were the critical thing, then, I'd just be sort of-condemned. Well not - . At this part, I don't so much regarding this as something like, when I come in, and understanding is dished out to me. [0:18:22.5]</p>

<p> It's sort of like, it's-it's like a wrong turn. I think a wrong-it's the sort of revolving and then it comes back to you. Maybe in a different way or something. It's just-I don't know. Some sort of meteor that helps understands themselves or something. It's not like, well -  I can't just come in and sit down and you're not-and I look at you and start listening to you and find everything is so wrong with understanding. That's... I don't know. </p>

<p>I'm trying to sort of speak out, something to say that, the idea of just being offered (ph) in my - I don't know. My feelings about this here. I already found (ph) it. But I don't know. [0:20:21.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe-you've used the word optional several times. And then that you said-I guess if that-that's that what I think that means in a literal way is something like, "Well, you don't have to do it. You can stop." Somehow. Is that, the central thing, in this therapy? This thing that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it's necessarily the centralized thing. Well-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that isn't the point you're trying-that isn't the point you're trying to make then. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no. At this stage in my life or point in my life, it seems to me that I could-I could manage to go on another way of functioning. But, just how wrong I got, rather than satisfying it, when I [try to take this with me] (ph). The impression of the things that I do, when I'm looking now, it's just going to be two weeks and all. This is-I continue to come because I'm sort of seeing hope. I have this feeling that, that I can pick up this option and make the ride smoother or something. [0:22:15.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I see. It's like saying-I think I see, I should say. You know you could manage in certain sense, without thinking about these things. You're trying to deal with them. But it changes the quality-it's going to change-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way it is at this point. But when I first started, it-I had a feeling that I was not going to manage without some sort of help. And I, I'm not going to say that it changed my viewpoint. Because my viewpoint was between then and now, not due to this. It may just be due to, different tires (inaudible at 0:23:00.3). I don't know, but I started at the middle of winter, last winter. Yeah. </p>

<p>I'm not going to say that the change in my attitude in terms of coming here is, is due to all I've learned in coming here. But, I think it's just seemed better. It seemed better now than it did when I started. Not that anything has changed much but...most of the time I manage to, run through the things that pop or maybe to withstand it. And my real studying is do better. Like actually bear-not a (inaudible at 0:24:01.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So you don't know why this, why exactly this change is actually happening. And you don't want to describe the particular things that you've noticed, that kind of shift. It doesn't seem as much a question as just getting by, anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not as much. But I mean I'm still not entirely, out of consideration for getting by. That's sort of a side issue, as far as-and when I first came in, I got on the waiting list and everything like that. I was amazed (ph) then. Of course it-I don't know. The problem is with not having an optional, (inaudible at 0:25:02.3), more like, spiritual thing. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Consulting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, this is a tendency to... to (inaudible at 0:25:18.4) things. Otherwise I'm not going to put much effort into it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel as much pressure to-in one of the better things, I guess? You mean to really work at picking some therapy thing? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's-it's also-a little hard sometimes to come up with things you can figure out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean nothing really concrete is really bothering you in a desperate way and that doesn't give you anything to-so that, there aren't terrible things happening in your life that's so sad that we can talk about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid I don't understand. I'm sort of, not concentrating. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then don't -  let me not bother explaining again until I find out what you think your non-concentration is about. It's the same thing like I've talked about a lot, like last time? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not always. I was thinking about-I was thinking something out. I was thinking how I feel when I -  feeling somewhat reserved and I still feel a little bit unusual in this situation. [0:26:50.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not really comfortable here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not perfectly, no. It's just that, just that I -  a little bit out of place. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something maybe a little difficult for you about talking. Maybe something-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there's an element of difficulty, that wouldn't be here if I were talking to a friend, like situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think it is about it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm stuck (ph) on times. And why must I sit here. Or what am I doing here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still don't know-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that there are subjects that I still intend to shy away from. You know, like I don't want to talk about them. [0:28:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, (inaudible at 0:28:05.9), for what makes those difficult? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Talking about them with, anybody. Just hearing myself, saying it. I don't hear -  hear myself saying it ever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not using to talking about those things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because that's a problem with, with anything. And sometimes it is, ignoring those little problems. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are a lot of things that you've kind of kept in some ways inside you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I'm not even going to try to get at them, because I sort of don't want to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to not-not just because they're, they're (inaudible at 0:29:04.4) and you've not heard yourself talk about them before? Because that is an element, to share unfamiliarity, on how to do it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But there's also-I don't know another topic, instead of -  </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? You mean it's none of my business kind of? None of her business? Those things? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm afraid to tell you some of that. If I knew exactly what they were I might be afraid of telling them to you. Not knowing exactly what they are, there's an element of all of sudden something might come up that I hadn't really expected, hadn't even know. I might even be more embarrassed about or something. You might have said to me that might embarrass me. I don't know. [0:30:04.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd be surprised by-on some kind of low level at least, you'd be surprised. You might get a surprise or something because these things you don't really know what they're about. It might surprise you to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to-to know about, these things before I said them. I wouldn't - I wouldn't want to all of sudden act just surprised and pop (ph) up in front of-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd like to know before that. Before I told you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? You said something about embarrassment. And I'm kind of-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well sure. I suppose a surprise-it's not just any surprise, but I mean suppose it's a -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A personal thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A personal surprise. I just would have feel very awkward not having a chance to-to think about myself, and cope with it alone in private. [0:31:01.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd be like-you wouldn't have your proper face on it. Your clothes on, and (inaudible at 0:31:13.5) on something that comes in? Like you wouldn't-it would be kind of, (inaudible at 0:31:19.9) what I'm trying to make? Like there isn't, sort of being taken off guard. There is something very unprotected in that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there a-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also an element there of just being afraid, that I might learn something that I didn't want to learn. Not like it's his post (ph) - it is putting, make sense to it. You know we've talked about this. I could-you know like last week. Monday I could've come to the conclusion that I'm never going to be able to associate with, effectively working. (inaudible at 0:32:12.7) </p>

<p>That could happen. And if I was really convinced that that was the truth, I probably wouldn't get upset. But the other things, they're also a lot of things that I might want to know. That are sorts of personal news or something like that, that remind me that nothing is perfect. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying, or meaning that there might be ways in which you wouldn't-you'd realize ways in which you just (inaudible), or there's no hope for changing? Something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That might take away the little that I, that I think I had. That I'd like to believe I had. You know what if you take it and what I might do with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might just go, "You're not worth anything."</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, [then I'd be] kidding myself. I really don't (inaudible at 0:33:21.1). It's just like sort of taking away, these sort of things that, I lead myself to believe I have. If I-if that is going to be taken away from me, I would like to have it taken away, at least in private. And give me a chance to get upset and to think about it, by myself for a while. I don't feel like-I don't feel like I'm going to be scrutinized or... watched or pitied or anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If that's to say, say having me see you be upset about something, would be an unpleasant experience for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. Yeah. I just-I keep trying to make... give some sort of example. Like someone whose school. Something that like, wouldn't open the report card until like he's always - - they probably want to look at them by themselves first. If you know they didn't open them in school because they didn't want to have to show them to their friends. </p>

<p>If it's-they might have been ashamed of something that was in there. They might have done well but they wanted to know first, because it's their card. [It would be like] (ph) the next day we are all ragging on it. [0:35:17.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Control. Until-that they wanted to be able to control. Have your first reaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. I sort of plan how -  how I cope with what the energy (ph) is going to say. Sort of deal, build up some defenses. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're worried-I guess, I'm going to put the analogy back to this situation. Correct me if this isn't how you got-you're worried about say if I saw you being upset about something, what I would think of you? For that? That I'd -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's part of it. But I'm beginning to think that, a bit more of it is just-I probably would get upset if, if all of a sudden I decided that, that the things that I thought I had, I don't really have. Which I think-I just want the more-the thing that would be bother me more, would be just the fact of not having what I would like to think I have. And being what I like to think I am. Well I don't, I don't want to-have this thing where you thought you were fabulous. And that wasn't (ph) so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but it's funny because you also has this sense that you could be. There's something dangerous in talking about those things because your illusions-the idea that, because in a way, in talking about this is what you're saying, that the thoughts you have may be illusions. [0:36:57.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I may just be afraid of that because... I don't have, great esteem for myself or something. (inaudible at 0:37:26.1) But I don't know. I'm starting to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get on with things (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to be that involved, but to (inaudible at 0:37:35.5). I don't have that much time left. That's where I get confused. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What could change that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What could change what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean would you like me to try, in talking about it-starting from when did you lost track.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, oh I started...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just when.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know a particular time, it could be almost anything. If you (inaudible at 0:38:03.2) to me it would probably be better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were saying, I said something of that-I forget what I said, aside from the thing you said after it. You said, you didn't know-the thing about being worried that you're-that you'd find out that weren't still, kind of, the few things that you like about yourself. Or just things that (inaudible at 0:38:24.0) yourself, in thinking of what you have. I said, "Well, probably." And we perhaps-the only thing that it has to do with you is you really don't think you're a very good person." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean that, my parents always used to tell me, well not always, but-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait, now are you unconfused? Did that help? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but-it gave me something else related. That had occurred to me before but I just didn't want maybe to say it. Because I just don't notice (inaudible at 0:38:56.1). Within the past three years, my parents-well while I was in high school, they took to telling that I was self-centered and then I would say that was a bunch of bullshit. And never believe it at all. But, here, during therapy, I sort of come to the conclusion that there is a degree of truth, to what they say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really? [0:39:32.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How's that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the most that I've been involved. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it might be interesting-it might be interesting to try to, to figure out why, the therapy. But there isn't - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there isn't-okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Enough to say. That's like one thing that they told me, and I didn't believe. And I was having to [come to] (ph) believe. I wasn't who I thought I was. I just kidding. And they told me, that as a Latino, we're kind of lazy or something like that. And-but again, I think that I-I realized here, a lot of these things, my problems, tend to describe (inaudible at 0:40:32.6) Or especially a combination of my abilities, those things. You know, that I'm being -  being self-centered -  I do whatever I feel like doing, sort of. And since I've [learned this] (ph), what I generally feel like doing is nothing. It's not-not constructive for (inaudible at 0:41:17.4). </p>

<p>Certainly there are things going on, in my mind, I sort of had the root, is sort of - it's out of control self-centeredness. They called it selfishness I think. I think they did. Unless they just purposefully said the same thing. I don't know, I just want to think maybe that I don't, say the same. </p>

<p>You know like if I get candy at Halloween I'd share it with my sister. And I was never feeling bad about it. Or-well things like that. How easy -  I couldn't be lazy-I worked an hour every week with my father. I really more or less enjoyed doing it. I didn't resent it or anything like that. You know so all along I've been telling myself, why you're-you're not selfish and I come to the realization that I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then you are, I mean-[0:42:47.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, I don't think-do you mean that you are in some kind of basic way and then that's just made curious? </p>

<p>PATIENT: By nature, I don't mean-it's my nature. This is the way I am. But it's not like-it is part of a mental thing. You know like, it doesn't have to be this way. It's the most natural thing for me to be this way now, but I think I can change. It's possible for me to change. I don't know, even basically something wrong? It's almost basic but not quite. Hopefully there's sort of one layer, if I say there's more basic than it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's probably just change. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that would be very depressing to you, instead of thinking that you have to (inaudible at 0:44:02.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay though. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm looking for-it was more interesting. It wasn't distressing to me, because I felt like-well at least you know the truth so if you know the truth, it isn't shaming to me. If I am selfish, like I don't think I am, I pretty much go [over many things] (ph). But if I am selfish, and I highly doubt that's the truth, that I am, then it's possible I could change. So all-I just sort of-then the same thing applies to these other things that we talked about, you know that I don't want to talk about. If I found out I didn't have it you would have to look for something I would. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you-if you found out you didn't have-complete the sentence. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They sense I'm a great loser. But I may just be deluding myself about it. If I found out that indeed I was a little (inaudible at 0:45:17.2) go, "Whoops, there's something here." Rather than sitting around and cringing worrying that, maybe it's not real. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not having to put so much into, not looking at them, and preserving them as just kind of fragile things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no, I don't put (inaudible at 0:45:45.1), but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you could get down to it, the other way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what you're saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just, I think-it's not about the major point you're making is that-maybe it wouldn't be so if you found out you didn't have these things if you don't. Because, maybe then, it would be possible for you to do something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think I have these things, that are killing myself then I really have nothing. And maybe that's why at the same time I start trying to think I should be. A lot of times I've been thinking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would be a lot of the time not that I'm killing myself, but I'm still afraid to. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like, you can - you can kind of figure that out. Or say that, but that still only makes you really get afraid inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really, I get (inaudible at 0:47:19.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She decided to walk in a mirror (ph) or something like that but of course that was -  (laughs) was hard to take, even that you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is that to say, given that you think you can handle that revelation, if it were to come. About the-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's the point. You know like, maybe I won't be able to handle it. That's perhaps, why I don't. You know like if I found out I was kidding myself, I could either say, "Well, got a problem. I've got something real." Or I could say, "Holy cow, I haven't gotten anything, I could just-I could just totally quit." And just-I could be in a worse state than I am now in my delusions. And so I'm afraid to, to go take that gamble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid of how you really act. [0:48:31.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm right, yeah. So then, I have to prepare myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but kind of that you are at all sure that you act in a way that lead be to the kind of-course of action that you want to take. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just that I've gone so fast. And that's still not-this all still leaves me pretty much where I am, where I started. It's just that I'm not telling you, for a variety of reasons, that I'm afraid to talk about it. I don't know how to, and that's that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We've talked about a couple of things about that, which are it's very unfamiliar territory to you. I mean you don't know your way around it, at all. You wouldn't know what to do, kind of. And that you don't - you're afraid of how you'd react, if certain things turned out to be the case. Like you don't even know. </p>

<p>There's another factor that I was still wondering about, which is-talking about it here, and was lots to think about-saying those things to me. Maybe that presents difficulty. I guess part of that we did talk about it, was the fact of being public when you realize something like that, might be hard for you. But I was wondering, maybe also there were other specific kinds of things, that, say, talking to me about, these kinds of things, that would make it difficult. [0:50:28.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in one way, it's sort of unrealistic one too. Because that was, probably, could be someone closer to my age as opposed to someone much older.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but I-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And talking to a woman, so I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what is it about those things that makes it more difficult?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it might have something to do with... I don't know. If you were a kid, you could look up at a 50 year old man with a beard. If someone-if you're (inaudible at 0:51:33.2) you'll understand and he knows-he knows what's happening to you, he'll have a... I don't know what I'm saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He has some kind of control over the situation, that makes you feel more secure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like a control. It's something along the lines of respect or esteem, like I've lost faith in adults. There's just no question of what's right. They understand, you know, they understand-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They know what's happening, in a very general sense, or something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So whereas, here am I, and I'm 24. Yeah, I'm 24, and all of that kind of thing. In contrast to that, how do you feel about a 24 year old about those things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's much the same as if I were a ten year old trying to talk to another 10 year old or a 12 year old my problems. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what about it? [0:53:04.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're afraid you're being misunderstood. If this person will laugh at you. Or run out and tell the other friends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That they won't have the proper perspective. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a-you know close to it. I don't know. You know like I sort of think that I could talk to a father figure. I'm sort of, thinking (ph) of that. Or I just can't talk to someone near my own age. And of the other sex. It's not a matter of I, maybe just trust, things like that. I think it's something-it's not a rational thing, that I am in control of. It's just something in my nature, not afraid of or wary of. It sets you on guard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sets you on guard. Yeah I'm not- don't mean to arguing you out of it or criticizing you for it. But-or like that. I'm not saying, "Well, that it's too (inaudible at 0:55:00.8)." But I think we can be more exclusive (ph) about the grounds of that reaction anyway. What-that's what I'm trying to deal with. What is it-what is about me being the age and sex I am that's difficult. How is it difficult? What kind of problems does it, do come up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it's-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand it just doesn't' seem right. I guess. As far as, well-</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so much of my-the problems that bother me most, are with peers. Socializing with-with peers. Talking to them, things like that. And then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you have that same difficulty with me? It feels a lot like it does, talking to-having to interact with other kids in college? To have to be talking to me? [0:56:21.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somewhat. It's-I don't know. It's close to that. That it's almost as if you're almost part of the problem. And in the same way I have a difficult time relating to women. And there again you're almost part of the problem. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say almost part of the problem, is that-do you mean like, I almost fit in that -  that category.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That category. I can't go up to someone in a coffee shop and sit down and start talking to him or anything like that. (inaudible at 0:57:12.0) I have to-well to a stranger, I couldn't do it all, like a lot of guys would say. Start things kind of causally... I can't do that at all, even with someone I vaguely know, someone I might know from work or something like that. I don't know, it's just the sort the thing that can't or won't do. You know, you're -  it's like you're almost part of the problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm almost some of those people that you can't talk to. That you especially can't talk to. [0:58:01.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well... well not especially. I feel like you're almost one of the people that I can't-I can't socialize with. That I feel estranged from and I feel like I don't fit in with. I sort of picture all the people, (inaudible at 0:58:32.0) in, like a big group, and I'm out of it. So here I am trying to talk to somebody who is, who likes like almost part of the group. And I'm still out of it. I feel I'm calling you part of the problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I get a vibration from that place, but I'm still trying to make it more explicit. I think I can get-I think I could get what you mean. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go ahead. I was just going to rehash something, so I'd rather [do it] (ph) if you're going to ask my feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like, you think of me or you see me, and you see a person who could kind of, or the kind of person who would be difficult for you to talk to or get to know, if this was a coffee shop, if this was-or if this was a sweet (ph) shop or some place like that. [0:59:48.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't know, you just-you just seem to re - to remind me of some of the problems. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're always do-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like-Oh I'm really trying to think of a good analogy. I don't know, it's-you just sort of- if you want to talk over a problem you want to have with a group, you sort of don't go to anybody of that group, to talk it over with them. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well some people could-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some people could, and I'm just saying, you could. That's not exactly what I mean. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you-I - your sense of it. I-and a lot of things that you say, okay you're sense of it. It's just not gone (ph). It's just not right. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that depends if it's right-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know that it's just not right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of-right. But your immediate reaction, is quite (ph) fast.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And my way is to go-to go to someone who is out of the system, like write home and tell my parents, I'm having a - like a friend in Maryland or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Telling a person who is in the system amounts to-would amount to what? [1:01:56.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some sort of weakness. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Meaning (ph) a weakness-</p>

<p>PATIENT: To the, to the group, I feel, that I'm from. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The people that you should be keeping the group from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. It's-like admitting defeat or something like that. Yeah, admitting defeat. I don't know since... [1:02:53.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:02:55.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not the best thing I've said. But I mean it seems to instant withdraw (ph) me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say you can't manage this interaction thing, is this-this is the kind of proof and does that person use that -  is the kind of person, would be-part of the me -</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Admission of weakness for... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what would be wrong with that, would be-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be-it would kind of would better my position. (inaudible at 1:03:37.2). I really hate that. I say something like that. I'm not even too sure what it means, but it just seems like, when I read a book and they want to say something like-what I want to say or say that. Also it's sound of pretentious. Sounds like I've been reading that is (inaudible at 1:04:04.4)</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just look at opportunities, [see what they have to offer] (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah like, that wasn't better, you know what-so now you may be thinking about that. Are you the kind of person that would say some stuff (inaudible at 1:04:20.5) to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, if I was someplace to say it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of nice. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's fun. (inaudible at 1:04:36.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got to stop. But did you feel lots of pressure in talking about this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's hard to say. Not too, not too much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come it's hard to say. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh it's hard to gauge pressure. A pressure gauge. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like that time we talked about French. I felt more pressure then. I sort of felt like I was being called on to defend how I was doing. [1:05:17.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well maybe I mean-now when I'm asking, I'm really asking about a different kind of pressure. More like was this a difficult conversation to have?</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel uncomfortable having it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it was still-it was still far enough, far as I'm going to be, as a personal thing. I guess the whole point of it is, to somehow have-you know the ideal is to get, when I'm going to feel some-weak-not weak, more like vulnerable. Close to the critical thing. It just seems, I have to go (inaudible at 1:06:02.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like a wide range of things that get close that could be very sensitive to that. And like you-kind of a danger sign. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah looks-looks sort of familiar. Not like it-you know have another one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you-what did you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, like I think it could be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you say you want to-you spoke of, what should happen is that you shouldn't be so sensitive to the things around you, those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not to the things around me but to those things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not to feel so vulnerable about it all? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to think why I said that though. Like a connection I've made, but... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, another thing which I've just realized when I was marking this case, is that we only have two more times. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On this (inaudible at 1:07:15.1) New York thing? So-(laughs). I forgot to mention it before and it's kind of shitty to hit you with that at the end, and not want to discuss it, to have a chance to discuss it in time with me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, well, it's something to discuss. I suppose. I don't know what there is to discuss. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean, how do you feel about that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Feel? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I think you're-maybe there isn't a big discussion (ph) for you. Maybe, maybe it is like, "Okay. We'll have to a session (ph) two more times." But I could see a person, theoretically speaking I could see a person who acts annoyed, withdraw, upset and crass. Elated. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It depends on how I feel at the... at the moment of the last, you know the last session. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How long is this hour and then it's [all up]. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just to have something to talk about? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that I-that when I first started I had ideas about being (inaudible at 1:08:30.2), and now I have other ideas. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. See you. </p>

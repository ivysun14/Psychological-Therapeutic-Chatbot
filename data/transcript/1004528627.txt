<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. [00:00:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:00:23) (pause) [00:00:41] A lot going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's, I mean, I think it's good for me, but, it's not good. I don't know. The bar opened last week. And (pause) I worked last week one day and then this week I had off because I had you know, school. And then I went to school yesterday morning, I worked after school from like three o'clock until they close at nine. And (pause) you know, I gave my schedule to my cousin to see when I can work and when I'm available. And she texted me you know, Sunday, said, "When you say yes on a day does that mean, you know that you can work?" I said yeah, it means I'm around all day. [00:01:28]</p>

<p>And this is kind of what happened last year is we had the same schedule. I put no I can't work, or no after a certain time means no I can't work. Yes after a certain time means yes I can work after this time. Well, I came in yesterday and wanted to work and then I looked at my schedule and you know, I get irritated with the fact that I'm supposed to be there you know, eight, eight fif â€” I put it out of my mind that I'm family, I'm their employee. But, I also depend on this job for money, for health insurance, for dental insurance. Just for all that other stuff, just to help me out. [00:02:08]</p>

<p>Well last year towards the end of the season you know they were cutting me with hours. I was working six days a week; you know working about 32-33 hours a week. And I was kind of frustrated that, cuz I, you know, I made a point that I needed money. I was hurting for money, I wanted to work and I was available to work. They kept putting me on four hour shifts. [00:02:30]</p>

<p>Well sure enough, I go in yesterday and look at my schedule and I'm working six days this week and four of them are four hour shifts. And, I, you know in previous I would have gotten in a fight with them, I would have yelled at them, I would have caused a big commotion. But I finished my shift and then at the end of the shift I told my cousin and my uncle that it's not gonna work out and that you know, I'm not gonna work for them anymore. I was like I'll finish out my time but that's it. [00:03:07]</p>

<p>And they were kind of angry at first because they didn't know why I didn't talk to them. Um, before and communicate with them, which I had. I felt, I felt I made it clear when I gave them my schedule, when she confirmed with me what everything meant. I felt like, (sigh) I did convey myself clearly to them what my availability was, and when I was able to work. And still to the point, I don't know what it was, they're just having me hang around all day and like you know, and not work you know until four o'clock. Four to eight, which you can't make a living off that. [00:03:47]</p>

<p>And instead of arguing and getting in you know, a fight with them like I would have done in previous years. You know, thanks to my efforts in here and you know, my practice I thought about it logically and the easiest way I thought to not, to avoid a confrontation was I put all the blame on me, and not on them. Where it could be (inaudible 00:04:13) a screaming match, it was my fault, it was their fault, blah blah blah. But instead I kind of did it in a civil way where I put it all on me; I said it was nothing that they did. It was just I needed some space, I needed some time. [00:04:28]</p>

<p>But you know, and I, I did put it all on me but the major reasoning why I did it was because of that I felt I was being disrespected. I felt like they were taking advantage of me. Where, you know they say I'm a, uh, you know my cousin goes, "Well I don't know if you have homework to do, I don't know if you have that". Where in previous I would have said, "I would have told you if I couldn't work, and I needed time to do homework, I would have put it on my schedule". I didn't say that this time, I just let it go. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>Previously I would have also said, "You know why is this person working so many hours? What is he doing more than I am?" I didn't say that, I just put it all on me, to kind of end it civilly. Kind of you know, just so I wouldn't have this, you know, cuz in, previous in the past we have had a problem with this. And (exhale) you know, in a way I, you know, I know why I quit. I quit because of hours. I quit because I could, you know I wanted to work; I wanted to help them out. But I didn't want to be treated like you know, the way I was treated anymore. I just took a lot of it, I, um, I'm mentally burnt out from there; I can't work with them and have a personal relationship with them anymore. I just, I mentally can't do it. And to me, yesterday kind of bothered me a little bit you know. Taking all the heat knowing that you know, it wasn't my fault but it was in a way because of our previous past. All the stuff that I've done to them could have you know, influenced this and, (sigh) I really wanted to break down and cry yesterday but, I managed my emotions well and I just, I just feel sad that you know, it had to end this way, but I needed to end it. [00:06:24]</p>

<p>Um, when I was working there I was constantly getting pissed off, I was frustrated. You know just because I felt like I wasn't appreciated there. You know, I'm supposed to be family, I'm supposed to be doing this, but they are treating me like any other employee. Which was fine, but then they are treating regular employees like family. And, it kind of, you know, pissed me off in a way like, "Hello, like, I'm right here". [00:06:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like feeling like the outsider?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very, very much so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, it just, it, it ended. You know, it irritates me when my cousin's like, "Well I've got you on for thirty six hours". And I did it out and it's thirty two. So she kind of you know (chuckle), it kind of you know, it pissed her off a little. You know, it pissed me off, it was just like, "Well I scheduled you in". I'm like, I don't want this. [00:07:20]</p>

<p>You know I was thinking about do I just suck it up and change my schedule and play games and just say I can't work nights anymore? Or do this, do that and then I was like, no, I'm just going to end it. And yesterday I just ended it, I'm gonna work out the week and, and that's pretty much it and you know, I'm very torn right now because part of me is like I am letting them down. You know I thought I would be there to help them out, but the other part of me is, you gotta look at it as a business. Is this helping you out in your business? And, and it's not. It's not helping me; it was just making me more frustrated, more mad. I mean I worked there one day and I was really upset and I was just like, I can't do it anymore because of all the previously bad history. And I've put it behind me, but just the working relationship with them, it doesn't work because they're constantly picking on me, they're constantly looking at you know, watching me under a microscope and I don't know why. [00:08:26]</p>

<p>(Sigh) And it was just, it's very frustrating, you know, working there. But you know after I left I went and told them you know, what was going on at my home, and I talked with my parents. And for the first time in my life I was actually surprised at their reaction. They actually saw my view. They had my back. (pause) (sigh) And to me, not really, (sniff) you know, (pause) seeing this out of my parents; how emotional they were getting over it. How much, you know, it bothered them, just seeing how they treated me. (sigh) It really you know, made me feel good in a way. That you know, it took something like this to finally, you know, give to them. To finally see, you know what I have been feeling for the last twelve years working for them. [00:09:37]</p>

<p>And, (exhale) it, it, it, it was, it, (sniff) it was like a breakthrough because of all the, the work we've been talking about here and how you know, I'm trying to prove to my parents that I'm trying to make them see you know, my side of things and just to have them see that. And, and, witness it actually, really. (sigh) (crying) It was really (sniff), it was good. It was good because, I'm not really used to it (sniff), I'm not really used to them getting all emotional. They usually, they ask questions like what did you do you know, it's their business, they used to always take their side (sniff), and then to have them finally take my side was... (pause) It actually felt good. [00:10:29]</p>

<p>You know, knowing that I am making the right decision. You know they were pissed, they, they, they were pissed off, but they were good, they were just like, "Well why did you, why didn't you tell them it was because of the hours?" I said because I don't want to get in an argument with them. I go, because (exhale) I, they probably think they're not doing it on purpose, which is fine; I don't know what their thinking is. But (exhale), I just think there's so much history where they think they can just kick me around and use me. And, and that's it you know, and just listening to my parents argue about it, and how upset they were over it. (Large sigh). [00:11:13]</p>

<p>I just, I don't know where this is going. I don't know if it's going to explode because I don't know if my parents can keep their mouths shut. And having my parents, you know, interact with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins is different than me. You know, because, they are the outsiders, they aren't the ones that see me every day and they don't know what is going on. [00:11:36]</p>

<p>Um, as I mentioned previously, my siblings, they treated my siblings the same way, so my parents kind of, they saw the trend that was going on. And you know, my mother said to me the other day, she goes, "Why do you go back to work there?" And I said because I, I used it as a safety, I used it as a way and I told my sister this last night when I was texting her, I, I kept going back because I thought they would change. I thought, heh, you know when they keep telling me everything in the past is behind them and to move forward, I really thought, I really wanted to believe that in my heart. But, after still working there and still experiencing the hurt and the mistreatment and the, and, and, just the you know, the way I was treated, (exhale), I, I guess it didn't. And, and, me walking away is just the best thing for me to do because, I, I, mentally can't take it anymore. I really can't. I am mentally burnt out, mentally you know, done. I just, I, the hardest thing is that I'm very emotionally attached to that place and it's not even mine. [00:13:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think the attachment is about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Family. How I did, you know growing up; I did have a very close relationship with my cousin, my aunt, my uncle. You know, I used to; I was very close to them. I used to stay at their house all the time. I used to do a lot of things; I used to always want to be with them. But, me working on me, you know, being in business with them and seeing this other side of them pushes me away from them. I don't want to associate with them. [00:13:43]</p>

<p>You know, I tell people, I tell my mom all the time, I go they have two personalities. You know I like their personality outside of work, but from March till September when they're at work, I don't want to see them. Just because they like transform and it's (pause) it's, it's not good, it's not good. So I don't, I don't like the way they you know, I get upset at how they treat their employees other than myself. I get upset at the way they talk to other people. You know, I mean I get upset when they talk to customers rudely. [00:14:24]</p>

<p>Heh, you know, I'm just, in business 101 that I learned in undergrad, they're not using it. And you know, every time I try to make a suggestion that would help the store out, what would make the store better it's like they know everything and I know nothing. [00:14:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does their business suffer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's starting to. It's starting to. The problem is, they have a lot of volume, they do make a lot of cash. So, I think the greed is kicking in to them, but, the amount of work that they can do as they're getting older; my aunt and uncle are in their seventies, my cousin's pushing forty. They're physically breaking down. Um, reputation around town is out that they're not fun people to work for, so applications coming in are down. The amount of people that work for them are down, and all their old staff is getting older and breaking down physically. So, in reality I see the business has hit its peak and now I see it coming down. And I've, I wanted to be there to right the ship to keep it up, but I finally realized you know, a year and a half ago that anything I say they're not going to listen to; they're not going to value my opinion, they're not going to you know, listen to me, they think I'm out to get them. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>You know, there was an incident last year where some lady was stealing from them. I know who, exactly who stole from them but I didn't tell them because I knew they wouldn't believe me. And that's kind of messed up, because I was going through it in my head; I'm like do I say something, do I not say something? Because the lady that did it, had a beat up car, there was this that and the other thing and miraculously she had a brand new car in two months. You know, but they don't put two and two together because they're so focused on the business. You know, and I heard her talking about she needed this, she needed that, she was going through a messy divorce, she had a boyfriend who was involved in drugs I think. You know but they don't put two and two together, they had a suspect that was completely wrong. You know, and I know all this stuff, everything I did there was not to hurt them it was to help them. [00:17:05]</p>

<p>And even though I did have my problems, I did do what I did, you know there, I was, my intent was never to hurt them, I always wanted to help them run a successful business. (large sigh) And, I just never got the opportunity; the trust I guess just never came back. You know, because as much as they think I was there to screw them, they were the ones screwing themselves by not listening to me. Because I know every person that stole from them, I know when they stole from them; I know how much they stole from them. I know everything about that place and I didn't say anything because they wouldn't believe me. [00:17:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? Why do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they thought I was there to sabotage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were suspicious of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they weren't suspicious, they just, they were the type of people that don't like to find new help. They were the type of people that the less people they have on the more money they make.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I guess I meant why, why did they think you were trying to sabotage them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they wanted me to get rid of people that I didn't like, they thought if I had a problem with somebody. Because I never really clashed with the thieves because they knew I knew. And they, you know the thieves they didn't know to them, that I was just saying stuff to get them in trouble, but really I had full evidence. I saw, I witnessed people do it. You know, it was, one of them, I told my cousin about it, she goes, "No they wouldn't do it". Then my cousin finally saw her red handedly doing it. Then she was like, she wouldn't have never looked, you know, but because I put that thought in her head to like look suspicious at it and she finally did it once, it was like, "Jesus Christ you're right". You know, but at first they don't believe me; they never believe me. [00:19:06]</p>

<p>And it's just, I really think you know, money has gone to their heads because they have to you know, take their four trips a year, they have to drive big fancy cars, get the big diamonds, the purses and stuff like that and they kind of lose reality. [00:19:23]</p>

<p>You know, my family did come from a lower middle class family where they struggled their whole lives (inaudible [00:19:31] this place, and they were treated like dirt pretty much and had to work for everything. And now that they do have this and they're kind of at the top of the mountain financially they're starting to treat people like they were treated. And to me, it's not right. It's not right because you always get and I believe this firmly, you always get a belief you know, you remember where you came from. How you were treated, how you like being treated like that. [00:20:06]</p>

<p>You know, my philosophy in a business is my business doesn't run without the people below me so what can I do to make them happier? What can I do to make them want to work for me? There, I didn't want to work. I wanted to leave there six years ago. I didn't because of family, and I wanted them to accept me, I wanted them to love me, I wanted them to you know, change. And for six more years I took beating after beating after beating and kept getting up and getting up and then going back and taking more of a beating. I can't do it anymore, I couldn't do it anymore. [00:20:51]</p>

<p>I mean the deal with the scheduling isn't the way to send me out and I hate, you know, I mean I got the message and now that I'm out, they're kind of upset because now they lost a good worker. They lost someone that knows everything about that place, who can you know do five people's jobs at once. And (sigh) to me I just, it's not my problem. [00:21:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I still don't understand why, why they didn't trust you? Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of the drug incident.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of me selling drugs and you know, doing drugs while I was working there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, so that's why they don't trust you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably, I'm uh, I, I, I'm guessing, I can't say that is, because that is in the past. You know I have been you know, cocaine and prescription drug clean for you know for over six years. I haven't been mariPetera clean you know though, but I haven't smoked mariPetera since January. You know, I mean I, I try to cut down on my alcohol intake. I don't drink you know, heavy all the time anymore. I mean a lot of it was me just being a wild early twenty year old who thought he was invincible. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>And you know as I've matured and gotten older and you know more things have happened and I've experience in my life, I've kind of mellowed out. You know, and to me I just think they have this image of this twenty two to twenty three year old kid selling drugs, doing all this stuff. I think that's why they don't want me in there as much. Or if I am there you know, working a full shift I'm working a full shift up front so they can kind of watch me? You know what I mean? Because before everything I did was in the back and in the kitchen and I kind of had free roam. You know I had everything so now, you know as I got older I started to see more and more stuff was you know pushing me to the front and making me you know aware of doing stuff. And, I mean, as much as they say that what happened at the past is over, with them I don't think it is. And with me I thought it was and I was trying to push on with it. But, I'm finally going to do it because I know that our personal relationship takes a toll. And, to be honest I'd rather have them in my life as family than as bosses, so I'm trying this for the best, I'm doing this for the best. (large sigh) We'll see where it goes, but I'm just, but I'm kind of concerned about my parents. [00:23:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I've never seen them react so emotionally you know, to defend me before. And I don't know you know, if it's going to come out. You know, and then I don't want to be in the middle of a family fight. I don't want to start a family fight. But, I just know that my mom is not going to hold her tongue back with her sister, she's not. [00:24:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will she say do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She'll, she'll ask her what was going on, if she knew why they were treating me like this. Why? She'll, she'll try to ask the questions why I was only working four hours. Why, why doesn't, you know and she'll start pushing buttons because my mother gets very emotional into things, she's very you know, quick to react; she's a very reactionary emotional decision maker. [00:24:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She doesn't give people the benefit of the doubt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope, she'll just get worked up, worked up and just start going. And that's kind of what I'm afraid of. Is she's just gonna you know blow something up. But, (pause) you know, I mean it, and it, and it sucks because you know, me and my siblings asked her to do this, you know, seven years ago when we were all working there and she didn't. [00:25:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To step up to my aunt and my uncle and say something, and my cousin because we felt that if it came more from my parents that it would have more of an impact on them. And, and it took my mother twelve years of us being there, to finally not take her sisters side and finally take her children's side. And to me that's, it's new. So I don't know how she's gonna react. I don't know what's going to happen. (pause) I know something is going to happen, but I don't know what, and that's you know, I, it, as much as I talk about how much you know, like my parents don't do for me and don't do that. The more and more we're talking here and I think as old as they're getting, is they're starting to finally see our side, they're starting to finally stick up for us. [00:26:21]</p>

<p>(Sigh) Do I wish it had happened when I was younger? Yes. But just seeing them last night, and seeing them you know, seeing my dad stand up to his sister more and questioning more, you know it makes me feel better. Because it makes me feel like we're finally getting through to them, even though it's taken thirty plus years. [00:26:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what do you want to get through? What are you hoping, what message are you hoping to get through?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to stop being picked on. Stop being walked all over. I kind of think we got that, you know that side from my dad growing up and that's our personality. Was, we do see people picking on us, we do see people taking advantage of us, we do see people using us but yet we still go back to those people. [00:27:16]</p>

<p>You know, I mean cuz the whole thing with my dad. The whole time I was working at the bar I, you know, when they come in here and you know, discussing in here about you know, how my dad got picked on and walked all over by his brothers and sisters and everybody, you know, looking back on it, I picture that as being myself in the bar. Just being picked on, doing all this stuff, but I was using the excuse as family. [00:27:43]</p>

<p>You know, it was his family that was picking on him, it was his you know brother, his sister that was taking advantage of him. Well this was my family that was taking advantage of me. It was my cousin who's my blood, my aunt who's my blood, my uncle's not my blood but you know what I mean? You know it's the same comparison; now I'm finally level with it, I mean, you know, feel what my dad went through. What you know all that stuff that happened to him, happened to me and I kind of finally see it on his level on why he kept his mouth shut all these years. Why he you know, was trying to keep the peace. Why he was, did the things he did. And to me now, it's just, you know as I get older, I'm like, I get it. You know, I get it in a way that there is some things you just got to overlook. You know, I think that he was hoping for change as well. And I was too, but.... (large sigh) ultimately it doesn't, it didn't come, it's not going to come. And you know, I have to do what's best for myself and I think that's what my dad did too. And it, you know, it's really, it's really hurtful, especially when you're hurt by a family member. Because there is that emotional connection to it. [00:29:13]</p>

<p>You know my sister and my girlfriend had been telling me to leave there for years, but I didn't like I mentioned earlier today, I have an emotional connection to it, and I don't know why. I don't know what my emotional connection is because it's not my business. You know, yes my family works there but, I don't know what it is. And it just meaning like now, like my cousin goes, "Well if you change your mind you can come back". And as I was thinking about it, well maybe I'll give them another week or so, but I know I don't want to. You know it's coming back to the play the guilt trip on me because they need my services. If they didn't need me for anything it'd be ok. You know what I mean? Now they, you know, now that my services aren't there, well, now they have to go to plan B, and I don't think they have a plan B. [ 00:30:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you, have you ever wanted to find a point where you're less involved with your family?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To what extent?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're like in the squabbles and fighting and you know there's a lot, you're very involved in who's doing what to whom and?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's why I'm here, is I'm trying to break away from that. I mean I told you, you know in our first couple sessions how I have a control issue, uh, well I wouldn't say I have one anymore, I had one you know I mean I still have a control issue but I wanted to be involved in everything. Everything I was involved in, I wanted to have my two cents in, to do this, to run this, and you know, now you know working with you and working in here, is I'm kind of content with taking a back seat role. [00:31:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what would breaking away more from them look like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know cuz I've never done it. I've never been, done anything like that before. Everything that I've done has been mostly family oriented. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you imagine moving out of your parent's house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You know I can, I should be now. I think now, you know, moving out was kind of rough. You know, I, I did feel homesick and did all that stuff, but after being back, I don't want to be there anymore. I, I don't want to be there anymore, I can't do it. I, I, you know, it's to the point where I'm ready to be you know with my girlfriend. I'm ready to be with her. I'm ready to you know, start my own you know, life with her. [00:32:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you been making plans about that? Or just mostly thinking about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've been talking about it, we're planning on moving once I get a full time position. Depending on what school system I end up in, is then, when we'll start discussing a move. But yes, it has been talked about. [00:32:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you, so you're, you're looking for jobs for the fall?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, for September.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there opportunities?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are opportunities, but a lot of them uh, most of them came out now, you know, but you know, I'm trying to wait for jobs that come out, cuz I broke them by list into districts, I want to work in a regional school district so I have like five or six districts. So if public, or schools or regional school zone, but that's where I'm headed. So I have a region, excuse me, I have a region that I'd like to be involved, be staying in. So, that's what works out, but I've also been you know doing that working you know, figuring out what's going on, but they just had a couple come out this time of year, but a lot of them won't come out until you know early August. [00:33:25]</p>

<p>So, now I'm in a dilemma because I'm not working at the bar anymore. I have no, you know, unemployment ran out, I have no income coming in. So now I'm you know, squabbling around to find employment for the summer time. Which is now two months away because I talked with my supervisor today at school and what we're going to end up doing is try to get me on five days a week doing my schooling. And that will be until the end of school in June. So, I mean I'm kind of limited on when I could work. And I was like do I, you know, I could work at a the bar on Saturday and Sunday but, I've already made my decision, I don't want to go back. I don't want to you know put myself in that situation again. Because I already know it's gonna fail before I start. [00:34:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the bar?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The bar,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I See.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The bar, excuse me. I know it's gonna fail before it even starts and, and ultimately, that's what they want me to do, is to come back. But I don't want to. And this is, this has been the hardest for me because I've walked away before, but I've always came back. And to me, I'm kind of scared about going back. About being pulled back because it kind of reverts the me moving out. [00:34:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you got pulled back, what would be pulling you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Emotions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of emotions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Guilt. Probably mostly guilt because knowing that you know, I told them I would help them and I ultimately couldn't. You know I do have a lot of guilt in me. You know I do feel bad because I do see my aunt working in pain, I do see my uncle working in pain, I do see my cousin working in pain (inhale) and I do want to help them out. I do want to you know, to, in my heart I do want to see them you know have a successful business. But in my head I want them to fail. I want them to, to know what it's like to be back down where they were. To remember what it was like. You know, to be the family that I used to love hanging out with as a kid. You know instead of these people that they are now. I don't like these people. [00:35:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Greed. Greedy, treat people like dirt, constantly on edge. You know, constantly picking on me for no reason. You know, picking on other employees for no reason. Yelling at customers. I don't like those people. I really don't. And it's just something that you know, I thought again, I could control the situation, change it. But, you know, I can't. I need to move on and I need to you know, get myself, you know in the right direction. And I feel the best thing to do is to just walk away from them. [00:36:40]</p>

<p>And before it was walking away, you know, it would be on heated terms, where it was yelling back and forth and it was a big blowout. And then it's like you come back in the fall, in the spring, kiss make up and everything is gravy. Well this time it's me walking away from them without a blowup. Without an argument. You know, without the, "I hate this person, I hate that". It's a civil way that you know, I should have did it before. I should have you know, took this approach before, but like I said, if I wasn't here working on my, my, my temper and my control issues and that and making emotional decisions, I could have never had that conversation yesterday and had it go so well.</p>

<p>You know to me it was very emotional, it was very hard, but to them I could see, you know, the anger in them. My uncle walked away. He was you know, disgusted. You know, he walked away. [00:37:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Disgusted about what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About me not being able to work anymore. (pause) Because, and this is my opinion to them, it's like, do you want to work or don't you want to work? I mean back when I was younger before I had the drug issues and stuff, they used to get mad at me if I took days off. Because I wanted, I was a kid, you know eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old, I wanted my Saturday-Sundays off. To them, they used to always say, "Do you want to work or do you want to have fun?" You know and I'd always go to work because I felt bad. I was always guilted into it. (sigh) [00:38:27]</p>

<p>I will never forget this. They got it in 2000-2001, I worked every July fourth until 2003. I finally asked for one July fourth off, I got it and then I got a phone call at noon time asking me to come in. (pause) And I went in. And, in my head I was like why am I doing this? Because if anybody else asks for the day off, do you think they'd call someone else to go in? You think that person would go in? While they were calling I wanted to hit ignore so bad you know. I mean, and I guess I should get rid of this message, but I have a message on my phone from my uncle from last year when we had our last blow up. Um, I'm gonna share it with you if that's alright. [00:39:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, it's very disturbing, and it's very you know, it puts things into place, and I don't know why I keep it, but I do keep it. I have held it for over a year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can I ask you, why do you want me to hear or listen for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just listen to the tone of his voice, listen to how he's speaking to me, how he's addressing me. This is after one of our big arguments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm imagining you're not sh, playing it because you want me to, you want to show me how nice he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want you to know the working environment that I'm at, just how it's you know, the environment that I've been in. And this is, you'll get the relationship that we have. Because of this place. And maybe you can get a sense from his voice about how it really, how it you know, it the trust is still not there and it just.</p>

<p>(voice-mail sounds in background)</p>

<p>VOICE-MAIL: First saved voice message.</p>

<p>UNCLE: Yeah, you're a lazy punk you know, you still asleep or don't answer your phone? You know, what's the matter with you, you know? Listen, Peter and I were talking you know, and uh we're still available for you. But uh, and uh, Peter liked (inaudible 00:40:56), you know, I know you stopped by and talked to him, ordered your lunch and everything and feel like we've been beating, why don't you get your ass down here about, at least face to face and sit down here and talk things over and you're welcome to come back, we'll welcome you back with open arms (inaudible 00:41:15). And you know if you want to do Friday nights fine, if you want to do Friday or Sunday night that's fine, we'll do whatever, whatever you want is fine. But get your ass down here and talk to them face to face like a man, (inaudible 00:41:28) You know. Get down here and talk to them. Peter wants to talk to you, everybody wants to talk you know, we're not chasing you out of here, so uh, I'll talk to the people, we'll sit down before opening hours, you know, get down here and we'll talk to them, alright? Talk to you later, bye bye. [00:41:51]</p>

<p>VOICE-MAIL: End of message. (beep) This message will be saved for twenty one days. Next missed message. (beep) (beep) To listen to your messages. (beep) Thank you and goodbye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He mentions Peter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was, I heard some of it, it was a little hard to hear all of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I'm sorry, do you want me to play it again?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's ok, no I think it was his cell you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was on a cell phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He mentioned Peter who is one of the other cooks. And Peter in my opinion is the dictator of that business. Peter is an illegal immigrant who just recently became a citizen because he married an American girl. And Peter gets to pick and choose what hours he works, gets to pick and choose what days he works. And whenever something goes wrong to mess up what Peter is doing, Peter's schedule, that's when they attack me. Because they have me work so Peter can have Friday nights off, Sunday nights off, Saturday nights off, so all my schedules for four days. You know, and then him mentioning talking to the boys, well his two brothers work there, and having me work these nights in these four hour shifts, is I come in at four and they all leave. You know what I mean, and that's what, that's what irritates me. Is, who are these people to tell you how to run your business? [00:43:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, he, did he say, I thought he kept saying, "Get your ass down here". Is that what he was saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm. Mmhm. And what pisses me off is he goes, the first sentence he said was, "I was talking to Peter".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And he said something about lazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, my, I was lazy. Because I wasn't up and I wasn't at the time. You know, and you know, they just said, they thought I didn't want to work. But at the time this happened, I had a full time job. You know, I was, you know, filling in helping them out and I asked, you know, didn't want to work Sunday nights because I had to get up and go to work on Monday morning at seven o'clock, seven thirty. But he wanted Sundays off. So, I mean it just, it, it, it irritates me to the point where you know, it's supposed to be their business, it's supposed to be family and this, you know the guy he's talking to is not even a manager, he's just a cook. He's not the kitchen manager. He doesn't have a manager title, he's an employee like myself. So, it, the first thing that ticked me off is, why are you consulting him? Why aren't you consulting my aunt who's a manager, or my cousin who's a manager? Why are you consulting him? You know, and my feeling is this. If they were going to lose me, they would rather lose me rather than four workers, three workers. (sigh) You know and to me that's hurtful. [00:45:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you listen to that message often? Or do you just keep it there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do listen to it every time I listen to my voice-mails.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, every time, you probably check your voice-mails at least once a day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not all the time, I mean I don't usually get, usually I answer my phone, but you know, whenever I check my voice-mails I'll, you know, that'll come up and I'll play that. And you know, it's just a reminder of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just what was going on and how they really think about me. You know, how he really perceives me, how he thinks you know, stuff goes on in the past, and how it's over, but from that message, from my perspective I know it's not over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm. Yeah, we're going to need to stop. I really want to talk to you next time more about the voice message, what it means to you, what it feels like to hear it. I really want to understand more about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, can we talk about you know, now that I don't have any money coming in, I'd hate to miss every week, but just for financial reasons I can still do the hundred dollars if it was every other week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let's just wait, I do need to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will come next week, cuz I want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's a good point, so let's bring that up right at the beginning of next week and then we'll sort of figure something out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you, I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely, take care. [00:46:35]</p>

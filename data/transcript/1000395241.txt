<p>PATIENT:   (Silence) I put this out of my mind today, but I think immediately when I come in here, uhm, of a feeling I had last night.  Wh—, I think I know in part what it was about, but I don't know, when I e—, I found it hard to fully understand it and I, I'm not sure how hard I wanted to try to understand it.  But I do—, it was after supper and MSCZ and I were reading in the living room.  And I just, every once in a while would feel like crying.  And at first it just, I mean it was sort of startling to me because it would seem like there was no connection with anything.  And (Sniff), I don't know, it was just sort of a feeling of things were well, I guess, sort of out of my control and awful in a way.  But I didn't, I didn't understand (Sigh) in what way. </p>

<p>And then, I don't know, at one point I was just looking at MSCZ and I said something about his hair.  (Sniff)  And usually I want him to have his hair longer than he does and he's always getting haircuts when I wish he wouldn't.  But this time, I, I don't know, I was just saying something about, maybe you need a haircut soon, and sort of laughing that it was the first time I'd thought that way.  And then I just started crying again.  And what was partly on my mind right, right then was that I'd had this feeling I wanted to kill my baby.  Because that's really I think essentially what I wanted to do.  Not just hurt it, but I wanted to kill it, make it not exist. </p>

<p>And, but then I felt well, that wasn't really it.  That I could handle that, knowing I'd felt that way.  And (Sniff) it seemed to have something to do with (Sigh), I don't know, somehow feeling that I couldn't really respond to MSCZ, or, or, I won't be able to respond to the baby.  That I'm sort of isolated and — in my feelings.  And that I could be surrounded by people who love me and who are reaching out to me, which is certainly the way I've been feeling.  I think that's what I tried to say yesterday about how MSCZ had been toward me.  And that I can't do anything in return. </p>

<p>(Pause) Or, I mean I can be pleasant in return, but it seems to involve somewhat of a pretense.  And if I respond it's only a brief kind — I m—, it might be a sincere response, but it's not a lasting response.  (Sniff, Silence)</p>

<p>Uh, well, I was just thinking then I had a dream that (Sniff) — I think it involved MSCZ mainly, but there were other people there and it seems to me, I, I felt sort of outside of being the person in the dream. When, I don't know, there were other people there, I mean other men, who were, I think, having intercourse with me.  Except it was sort of not me, then, except it was me.  And — but they were — I was not feeling any response of any sort.  And then, it was sort of like MSCZ's turn, or MSCZ was the only man left.  And then I remember in the dream, I felt very responsive. </p>

<p>And (Sniff) I don't know, it seems connected with the feeling I'd had last night of (Sigh) th_th_ that I, the thing that's bothering me is that so often I don't feel I am responding to him sexually.  And it's almost, I've felt this way so many times before that if I could I, I guess the feeling I had last night, too, was if could respond to him sexu—, sexually, then almost everything else would fall into place.  And I, I think that's why I wasn't really worried about having, at least I didn't think I was, about having felt that I wanted to kill the baby.  Because somehow I felt that was secondary, and, I mean it bothered me.  And when I first thought of it, th_th_ the thought of it bothered me.  But then I was thinking, but really that's not the main thing.  And — (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So the real paradox is, uh, for you, that at a time now in your life when, in a very real way you've gotten some things that you've always wanted or felt you wanted; like you've gotten a baby now, or you're about to get it.  You feel that there's really nothing more you could ask of MSCZ.  He loves you, he's affectionate and all, all the things you've indicated.  Your father's uh, certainly shown you some interest.  He's done things for you.  Your mother's coming to help with the baby.  The paradox is that at this point, when you as you said, you feel loved, when you have what you want in a certain sense, you want to get rid of the baby, you can't respond to MSCZ, you feel, and you don't want it.  That's the problem.  How come?  Why?  Why should that be?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Silence) I don't know, I, I think of (Sigh) — well, it doesn't seem like a very good answer, but I almost feel as if it's happened so late and suddenly to me that I can't be different than I've been all my life.  And it's sort of like I'm still acting the way I always have, according to habit.  And, or whatever, I mean, I, I, I don't even think it's a feeling of distrust that — certainly with MSCZ, anyway.  I might sometimes worry what will happen when the baby's there and how will he act toward me then.  But I think I really don't question how he'd be and just for him, I mean, I think maybe, maybe feeling that the baby's a threat to me is s_ s_ something else.  (Sigh, Sniff)</p>

<p>And I, I guess I have this feeling, too that if my parents are going to be this way, I'd just as soon have them be this way to me and not have it be because of the baby.  And so now I'd like to not have the baby be there, and still have them be as they are.  I guess that's part of the paradox.  I always thought well, I'd have to have a baby to get all this.  And then, when it seems like that's what it is, then I don't want the baby to be the reason for getting it all.  Because it's almost like well, it's not me.  And even though that's what I wanted, it, it's sort of empty if it is because of the baby that I'm getting it.  (Sigh) Because the baby isn't me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because another thing I'm, I was just wondering is, I mean the baby is sort of me while I'm pregnant.  And it's not me once it's born.  And, and I was just wondering again (Clears throat), because generally my memory of how my father treated my mother involves the times when he was angry at her, or annoyed, or exasperated or picking fights with her, really.  Or, I don't know, being — as much as he'd go into the kitchen and talk with her, and I remember that, too, and the feeling I want to  be part of it, and feeling left out.  There was a lot of what I felt was unfair on his part, of treating her unpleasant. And, I don't know, I'm just wondering if I think somehow he was different when she was pregnant with MLWZ. And that as long as she was pregnant, he was showing that much more love to her, or being that much more kind to her, or something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well maybe that, maybe I am more worried about how MSCZ will be afterwards, than I admit.  Because I was just thinking that there must be a certain feeling of, if I can't respond now, later I might want this again and I won't be having it, because I won't be pregnant.  So that if, uh, I don't know, it's almost like if I can't make the most of it now and I don't know, it's almost, I mean I'm not really pushing MSCZ away, but I mean, it's sort of as if, if I'm not responding, then he will probably naturally turn to the baby, I guess.  Perhaps I'm afraid that he will more so, because I didn't respond and seem unable to.  (Pause, Sniff, Swallow, Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking too that I don't know, in a way I think it pleases me that my parents are being attentive, but — or showing some signs of affection, or however.  (Sigh) I mean, an_ and I, I l—, I like to think it's for me, even though it's because of the baby too, it's still for me.  And I don't know, there's something about — I want to be able to feel, even though if I feel pleased with it, still independent of it.  Which again, makes me think of what I was thinking awhile back about it being habit that — I've been anything but independent of my parents, or MSCZ sort of took their place in, in where I put my dependence, I suppose when I got married.  But I certainly don't think I was very independent in one sense, that is, when I was growing up and until I got married.  But yet, I always wanted, that was uh, was one of the biggest things on my mind, was to feel and be independent of them.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But that was clearly a protection for yourself, so you wouldn't feel so hurt when you uh (Coughs), felt shut out.  I find something puzzling.  Uhm, I'm not sure just how this happens, but what seems very clear is that the way you're feeling and the way you've been feeling in the last several days, really it isn't possible to explain it on the basis of the way things really are now for you.  Of your real relationship with your mother or father or MSCZ, at the moment. </p>

<p>PATIENT:   But the way you've been feeling makes a great deal of sense as a way that you must have felt around that time when MLWZ came, when your mother was pregnant with him, when you felt shut out from what your mother and father were doing.  When you felt left out, when all the attention went to MLWZ.  When your father turned to him, when your mother was preoccupied with him.  When you must have felt very, very left out. When you hit your mother it's very clear that you ah, were really attacking the baby.  It's hard to understand it any other way.  That you were saying you didn't want that baby to be there, as curious as you might have been.  That baby interfered with you, made you feel left out.  And your anger at it then would be quite understandable, and you're feeling left out and unloved. </p>

<p>ANALYST: I guess what puzzles me is that I say this after all the things you've said, and uh, you don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause, Softly) Well that puzzled me, too.  Because yesterday, or whenever the other time was when you said it, pretty much the same way I, I don't know, all I could concentrate on was the way things are now, and how people are being to me now.  How could I feel this way when they're being this way to me now? </p>

<p>(Softly) And also, I, I think the other thing that keeps troubling me is the thought that it's my baby now and how can I feel threatened by it the way I did by MLWZ.  I don't know,  just sort of how can I lose the whole context of how things are now?  And — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Mm, then I was just thinking that, I don't know, first I was thinking well, there've been other babies born after MLWZ that I've been closely connected with.  But in a way that's not really true.  This is really the first baby that has meant much to me.  Because, I mean, FYC's (Stammers) first one did, in a way, because it was exciting.  And but still, it was her baby and she was part of another family in a way, at that point.  (Sniff) And i—, I don't know, it just, it didn't really affect me.  And my life wasn't going to change because of MDI's being born.  And so this is really the first one, and I suppose that might be why.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I, I don't know, I even feel now I, and I don't know why it is that I, I'm doing this that I have to have a reason for feeling this way, that otherwise I find it very hard to accept that I'm feeling the way I did when MLWZ was born, or when MLWZ was there, as far as my mother's being pregnant.  And (Clears throat) I, I don't know, I mean I, I know what you're talking about when you say all these feelings that I've been having lately seem to point to that.  And they certainly have been connected with that time.  But yet, if I think about them I think about them as very isolated memories.  And, I don't know, I just don't know why I find it so hard to accept.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, then I think of something that maybe is part of it.  I'm not sure (Sniff) if I've ever admitted having those feelings in that way.  I mean,  I remember other times when I've told about them here, of fighting with MLWZ and hurting him and saying, I want to kill you.  But he was older then' he could protect himself, to an extent.  And I, I, I don't know, I suppose I was afraid I might someday do something.  But on the other hand, it was more unlikely.  But when he was — my other memory is of his being born and a_an_ anticipating his birth, was hoping it would be a boy and then being very pleased it was.  And I don't know, having him as sort of a toy for several years while he was just a little boy.  And it's almost as if I've never admitted having these feelings.  And I've always thought of that incident of hitting my mother, very much as FYC hit me, and I, she wasn't showing enough interest in my tale of how FYC'd hit me.  So I did it to her. </p>

<p>ANALYST: In your tale?  What was the tale?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Of how FYC hit me first. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Oh, I'm sorry, you mean that — Ah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   I mean, that's how I, I had always remembered that incident before, or thought of it before. </p>

<p>ANALYST:  I just misunderstood the word.  I was hearing it in another way. (Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:   I don't know, I, I'm thinking that maybe that was part of what troubled me so last night.  Because I really, I think I was just feeling very afraid.  And (Sigh), well, I'm thinking now, I would feel afraid if f_ feelings that I never admitted were coming to the surface in a way that I couldn't avoid them.  And your saying them makes it hard for me to avoid them.  But I wasn't the one who said them.  (Pause) And I, uh, uh, I don't know, it seems to me I'm afraid for 2 reasons.  One would be, because if I didn't want the baby there, what would I do?  If I really let myself feel the feelings of not wanting the baby there, just like with MLWZ.  And, (Sniff) and then I suppose the other would be what do you do if you feel so left out?  If you really let yourself feel so left out and admit it, and don't protect yourself against it.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just thinking again about feeling well, this lack of response to MSCZ and to my parents.  This sort of defensiveness, even though things are different right now for me and much more the way I've always wanted.  And that it's so out of context with the way things are.  (Pause) I, I don't know, I suppose it's as if I'm trying to protect myself from these other feelings.  That, well, I mean either the two I think of, of being either wanting to get rid of MLWZ or being left out.  And I mean not only not being able to relate to my father the way I want, but being left out while he relates to my mother.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know what it is, but I feel as if there's still something about accepting I'm feeling things that I did when MLWZ was born that I, I'm resisting.  Or — (Sigh, Silence)</p>

<p>What I, I just started thinking about having the baby again, and it's sort of a — I guess I was imagining it happening like at night, like maybe tonight when, when MSCZ's right now, had to take something into the airport.  And so he won't be home for awhile and I mean, it's after hours, so I was just sort of imagining that I'd have to get to the hospital alone, and Dr. BBB could not be reached.  And so I guess I'm imagining I'd be alone. </p>

<p>Yet it seems like some—, something about what I'm resisting whenever you compare my feelings to how I felt when MLWZ was born, is that I, I keep protesting that this time it's different.  Because I want to think it's different.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.  I'm doing pretty good.  I have a lot of new things showing up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, with what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I think I told you about my hernia didn't I, when I was here last.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I had decided to get it fixed up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you did, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and what happened was I got a bladder infection on my testicles, it went all the way back here and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I called him and he put me on antibiotics.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was that, did they find that like on the preoperative testing or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you see the surgeon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I didn't go, you mean for the antibiotics?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, the surgeon for the hernia?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] over at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I had it all scheduled but then after I was on antibiotics I had to call him and cancel it because I don't think they'll operate on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it's a [INAUDIBLE], it depends on how bad the infection is and how emergent the surgery is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, obviously, people that are in car accidents or this and that, that have to get surgery.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, anyway, what happened is, I spoke to my doctor, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] my hematologist, and that burning was starting again so he asked me about it and he said look, he says you've got to get to the bottom of that burning and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is different than the stomach burning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The stomach burning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I asked [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], you know, the doctor, the surgeon, I said could this possibly, could my hernia possibly be causing this burning so he says if it's just burning here that could be but you claim it's over here too, so I wouldn't want to misled you and tell you it is.  So at any rate, when I went to the hematologist, he says, I tell him I still have this burning and all, well, he says you've got to get to the bottom of it, we've got to find out what that is, what's causing that burning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's the same burning you've had for years?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I had and went away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You had the colonoscopy and you got all the studies done in the past.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had all those, upper GI, lower GI, colonoscopy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's been four or five years now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He had what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's been about four years, five years?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd say about four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's been a little while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so I told him, so he says, he says a good friend of mine is an MD, medical doctor, and I told him, I says nobody seems to be giving me anything to give me a little relief on the burning, so he says there is something available, so I says I spoke to about five or six doctors and they all said no.  So he saw this doctor he knows, he spoke to the doctor and told him about me and the office called and told me to go to a doctor over here, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  You know, I went to see him, he's a nice young fellow and he's very, he says, I told him what was going on and all, he says well, he says let's get started and find out what's causing that.  He said you shouldn't have the burn when you eat something or drink something, that's not normal, there's something causing it.  He says so let's get started on it, he says I want you to go get a colonoscopy; we're going to start with that.  He says we'll find out what it is.  So he got the girl, the girl called up here on the [DEIDENTIFIED], the what the hell was it, plaza something, it's a big big medical building and that's all they do there is</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Colonoscopies?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Colonoscopies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So at any rate, he made an appointment for me and I'm going to go there on the [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And here's that</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I was going to say that you probably are pretty close to needing another one too if it was about</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Four or five years ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what he said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're probably right on track with that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so he says we're going to start off and this here, you know, something, that there seemed to help me out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're on it now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I take it when it bothers me, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You ever hear of that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's an older medication, Belladonna Alkaloid; it has Phenobarbital with it as well.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's for intestine spasms or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You definitely don't want to take too much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't want to take too much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if it's helping, I mean in the short run it might be fine.  They just need to figure out if there is anything going on and stuff, you know, intestine wise or stomach wise.  I think when you had your colon studies before</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Everything came out pretty good and things settled down once you got all the good news, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Every test I took, nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I think we kind of also figured, I mean, you've been the type of person that when you get stressed or anxious, you feel it in your good.  Some people get headaches, some people get chest pain, some people get short of breath, you feel it right in your gut.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I think, wasn't it your brother that had been sick around the time that you got the colonoscopy the last time, am I remembering it right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he had a colonoscopy, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you had yours around the same time, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I just remember something with your brother around that time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so they couldn't find nothing so, it's something causing it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's always, I mean you were also due for that regular check up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To have another colonoscopy relatively soon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It makes sense.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've got to wait till the [DATE].  I feel like calling around, maybe I can get it up a little because I'd like to get it done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the whole problem, you've got to wait so long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now the doctor that you went to see, is he a GI doctor, is he actually going to be the one doing the colonoscopy, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, he doesn't do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's the family doctor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's the family doctor, he's not with a group, he's by himself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's the one that set it up, his secretary did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I guess that ain't far, what's today the [DATE], [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you're not far.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm going to hang around with it.  Also, what's the matter with [DEIDENTIFIED], they can't hire any, no doctors will go there or they can't hire any.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Over at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's been a tougher place to keep people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did, he says look, see this here, this man I have, a doctor, he says the name was [NAME OTHER] and he's from Africa.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Actually that's all you see in there anymore.  He's from Africa and he just came, cough, feel anything?  Cough.  Feel anything?  Cough, and how's next Friday.  He didn't say anything, if you don't feel nothing, leave it alone, if it's not bothering you, don't bother it or, you know, anything like that.  He went over there, he's writing down, how's next Friday.  You know, I didn't go to him.  He knew [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I think he's going to retire or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I wouldn't be surprised.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had to take, my wife had an appointment there last week and she went and man outside, the front of his office, a hell of a big fight out there.  The tenants upstairs are dumping trash and garbage in front of his office and he ran out there too, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did, ran out there and his wife was out there and man her heart was, she's going to get a heart attack.  She was arguing with them, you know, then the cops came, so my wife don't want to come here anymore.  She don't want to come down this way anymore and you can't blame her.  So let's see here -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that the only place [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] sees patients is right down there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that the only place he sees patients?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's the only place, it's the only place, he's with the hospitals, nursing homes rather.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure, sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nursing homes here, he goes all over, he's all tied up and then here, you know, when I go in here, he don't see many patients in there and the ones you see look like they just out of the sewer somewhere.  So anyway, let's get back to me.  Yeah, that there medication seemed to help me out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see, the Effexor, oh no, the prescription you had -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and you know the, on the Lunesta</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They called me up, you know, from [DEIDENTIFIED], they didn't call me up, they sent me a letter, they says, and they put on there two to three medications that I can take instead of taking Lunesta.  You probably heard it before from other ones and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did they fill your Lunesta?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Excuse me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did they fill it, did they get you some Lunesta?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they gave me twenty one is all they give me.  So he says Ambien is a lot less money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They have a generic now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's a generic for Ambien now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There is a generic for Ambien?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, so anyway, I went and got a price today.  You know, I'm surprised that this guy at this pharmacy that I called up which was [DEIDENTIFIED], he told me Lunesta was a hundred and sixty for thirty of them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of the 2 mg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh wait a minute, maybe we can come down, they're about five dollars a pill because they gave me twenty one and it costs me a hundred and nineteen.  Now the Ambien, the 5 mg, is sixty one dollars.  I used to get that all the time on the phone, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With the different medications.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now I wonder if that's a generic cost or the brand name cost?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I didn't ask him, I should have asked him.  I don't think he would give me, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The regular Ambien has a generic, Ambien CR does not, the one that's advertised on television.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you got some Lunesta, did it work, did it help?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's working, it's working good but it isn't doing any better than what Ambien was doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I used to get those for like a hundred dollars for thirty of them and then I'd get another one, he'd go like twenty dollars for thirty of them, the same thing, and I'd call the company back, you know, one of the druggist and ask him, what are we doing here, you know, a hundred to twenty dollars.  He says you're going to pay for the name.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I've written for Lunesta for quite a long time now, it's been</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't been doing it that long, have I?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The first prescription I wrote for you was in -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> June two thousand six.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For Lunesta, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No actually April two thousand six, so last year, last year two thousand six, not two thousand seven, so we're talking a year and three months.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So what do you think, I change to Ambien again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you think the Lunesta is not doing any better than Ambien and cost is an issue, that maybe the generic, you'll be able to, it will be even less.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Generic, well that should be about the same shouldn't it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I think so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I think I'll take the generic of Ambien or what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you want, I can write that prescription.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We can try it, okay, because -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You might get into the same question about limits on the numbers that you can receive but.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you usually put thirty down, right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but sometimes they'll dispense only twenty one or fourteen or, despite</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 5 mg</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now the Lunesta was 2 mg and we are talking about a good piece of change aren't we, from sixty to, sixty to a hundred twenty or one sixty.  There is a lot of difference, of course, I'll get a few more estimates on it too.  I just want to make sure I got a price before I came here to see you, you know, that way</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here's Ambien.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you think Ambien is better than Lunesta?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well  you're saying that they don't work any differently for you, they're about the same.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About the same.  They had a couple other names on there, I forgot which ones they were though.  You know there's a lot of new sleeping medication out there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did I tell you how many prescriptions were written for sleep medication last year?  Fifty seven thousand.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All over.  They're going to come out with something, I'll tell you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need the Effexor prescription today too?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I have Effexor.  I have Effexor, just the Ambien.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I put three refills on those, that should be okay.  Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so listen do you have any plan how you can, how you can reduce the crime in the city.  They want to, see it's the guns, okay, yeah, you see the guns shoot don't you?  I seen one going down the [DEIDENTIFIED] the other day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I haven't actually seen, seen much like that.  It's very, it's a number of neighborhoods I think account for the majority.  It's an issue for the new mayor, maybe when the Fall comes around.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> As long as they don't, everyone of them that they catch has a rap sheet as long as your arm.  They don't keep them in jail.  How about the one they just released that raped the little girl because they couldn't get an interpreter for him, did you read that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's horrible.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's a foreigner, an illegal alien.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm putting you down for [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tuesday.  Hopefully, you will have had all your colonoscopy -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hopefully, you'll have had surgery for the hernia.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This doctor sounds good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well it sounds like you made a good choice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and that medication seems to work pretty good too on me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe your wife would want to switch to him too, it sounds like the neighborhood is not as much of an issue.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's younger and -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's afraid to come down there now anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, you gave me an appointment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This isn't so bad here on the grounds of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Down there by [DEIDENTIFIED], it's a little -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Over here ain't too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll shut this off.  Thanks for the tape.</p>

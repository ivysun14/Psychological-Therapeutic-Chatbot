<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uh, I was thinking about being late on the way down here, and I don't, I don't know, I can't decide what (Sigh) really was involved.  Uhm, (Sniff) I mean I know at some point I made it a choice, and I'm sure it had to do with what we were talking about yesterday.  And then the fact also that, or maybe it didn't, I don't know.  Uhm, but I spoke with FHYZ today.  I've been trying to get her for quite awhile now, to see if I could have lunch with her tomorrow.</p>

<p>Uh, when I spoke with her today, I didn't really want to ask anything.  In fact, I'd been, well I had been really trying to get her, but I've also been uhm, feeling kind of hesitant to talk to her, because I, I just didn't know what she'd tell me.  And as it turns out, she and MDRZ have separated, and she did have some kind of affair with the uhm, professor, this summer.  And I don't know, uhm, I just felt, you know, sort of more disturbed after talking with her.</p>

<p>But the thing I was fixing on is because she mentioned that she did get more involved with the, you know, she became more emotionally involved.  It was not just sort of the cold approach of having an experience.  Although, I think she could handle it if she never sees the guy again.  But she does see him, she's taking more courses down here, and does see him.  And uhm, she just doesn't know whether, I mean, you know, when he comes, well, he's not well right now, and he'll call her, which may be just a way to ease everything off.  And she knows she'd really like to see him, but maybe she won't.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, it seems like she probably can handle it, but (Sniff) I just kept thinking, how could she just sort of, with someb—, I don't know whether it's because he was in the relationship of a professor, uhm, and of a course so that I could almost see a parallel between you and me.  And then here she is actually doing what I fantasize, or what.  Except the thought of her actually having intercourse with him, you know, if I tried to think that she really did have intercourse with him, which I assume is what she did do, because she didn't specifically say that, uhm, disturbs me.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>I don't know, the choice I made, I had gotten something yesterday at a store that, is uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It's clear what your choice was.  You're afraid to come here.  Oh, for, you know, whatever way you managed it. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  Yeah, because I knew could really, I knew I was going to be late.  I, I had intended on stopping at this store on the way here, because I was partly to the store, and the store was partly on my way here.  (Sniff) Uhm, because I'd had FSO at the park.  But Mrs LDJ was late, and I knew I'd be late, as a result, if I stopped, and I still did.  Uhm, uhm, (Sniff, Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>I, I don't know, I me—, I guess the thing I'm not sure of, is if talking with FHYZ made me afraid, or if I already was.  Uhm, (Pause) well, uhm, I was just thinking about another thing FHYZ said, because I asked how MDRZ was.  And uhm, she said she didn't know, and she was really being uhm, h, her whole attitude about him was so very different from the last time I spoke with her.</p>

<p>Because at that time, the question came up of whether or not she would consider leaving MDRZ.  And I think I actually said it, the question, although what she was saying led to it, and she was not at all bothered by my, the fact of my saying it.  But uhm, she was I don't know, very, taking the line of being very fond of him, and uhm, feeling sorry for him, and caring about him, in her own way.  And then this time she was very much of, well you know, who knows what he's feeling?  I've never known, all the years I was married to him.</p>

<p>And uhm, who knows, if she just, by separating from him now, couldn't care less.  And I me—, I'm sure that's not totally true, but just, uhm, (Sigh) there probably was a very shallow relationship between them, and, so then I kept, I think, thinking to myself, well that was very different from what MSCZ and I have.  Because we've discussed things she said they never discussed the problems they had in their marriage, ever.  And uhm, I don't know, it's almost as if by the fact FHYZ has done that, I had to keep thinking of things that were different about my situation, so I would know I wouldn't do the same thing.</p>

<p>And I don't, I don't know, uhm, FHYZ clearly is not at all unhappy with what she's done at the moment, so I'm not sure why I'm afraid.  You know, if, if her situation has made me uhm, I would imagine if I hadn't talked to FHYZ, and had this to think about though, I would have been resistant if I'd come here today.  But I don't know if I would have been afraid quite the way I had, or, you know, let myself be late.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you're still avoiding the subject. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, all I can think of, is something that when I was just talking about FHYZ's having had the affair, uhm, I suddenly thought, well, what if, i—, what if you had been her professor?  Uhm, I mean, it just seemed very possible to me, well it could have been you.  Or maybe that's just a way of feeling, well, she got what she wanted, and I haven't.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But if I would have an affair with FHYZ, then maybe I would have an affair with you, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, I don't feel as if that's the way I was thinking about it, but I don't know, it was more a feeling of being betrayed.  I suppose i—, i—, i—, you know, I couldn't uhm, I mean, it reminds me of my competitive feelings at home, you know, of thinking, my father shows some signs of affection with FNA.  If he can do it with her, he can do it with me, if I just knew how to win him over.  (Sniffs, Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, I was just thinking about something else that was on my mind when I was talking to FHYZ.  That uhm, somehow it seems like it might be part of just now imagining that you were her professor.  Uhm, but she said she was back in analysis.  And uhm, I don't know, if at that point, she told me she was with a different person or not, a different doctor.  But uhm, she made some comment, anyway, about it costing a lot, and she didn't know how she was going to afford it, because she's living totally on her salary at this point.  And I'm not sure how she's going to afford everything either.</p>

<p>But anyway, I said at that point, have you considered s—, if she were starting with a new person, going through, I don't remember what word I used, uhm, and may—, I, I might have said an Institute, or something, anyway, where you can uhm, pay less for analysis, you know, obviously thinking of me.  And uhm, she said no.  Well, first of all, she said no, because she wanted the best.  And I felt a little annoyed with her.  I don't know whether I felt threatened there too, thinking well, she's saying I don't have the best, indirectly.  Although she does—, I don't even know what she knows.  I can't remember what I've said to her.  But my feeling at the time was wanting her to come to you, to share you with her.  And I don't know if it was a generous feeling of uhm, she needs to have somebody to help her now, and she's ready.  Uhm, and you're the one to do it, or whether it was some other feeling.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Like what? </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, a—, a—, I'm not sure, except somehow, setting up a competitive situation.  (2-minute silence) Uhm, I wa—, just puzzled how I got here, but I realized that as soon as I didn't say anything more I was thinking about FHYZ's having — I know that Mrs BBF at this point, has very strong feelings about FHYZ, partly because she did not accept any children, well I think she might have accepted one, for LKC, from our school, maybe not any.  In any case, Mrs BBF had wanted more accepted, and I don't know whether she thought because they were friends previous to that time, FHYZ was going to accept them, or what.</p>

<p>But uhm, FHYZ made some comment today, because we were talking about where we could meet for lunch.  And I said, probably it's better not to meet at my school, which is what we'd done last year.  Uhm, because I had already sensed on Mrs BBF's part, a strong reaction.  It just seemed like it wouldn't make too good sense.  And FHYZ said, oh, she definitely preferred not to, for personal reasons, to see Mrs BBF.  And I didn't, she didn't go into it, and I was just wondering what it was.</p>

<p>And then I thought about the boy who is part PPIN and part American, who just came into my class, that has been quite a problem. And Mrs BBF was talking about his verbal ability today, and uhm, how his English is really quite immature, or you know, very elementary.  And the thing she used as an example was, he said, "I fix."  Instead of i—, she had been talking with him about something, and instead of saying, I can fix it, or any other way, he just said, "I fix."  And uhm, I don't know, first I was thinking of it, well, what does she expect me to do with him then, since my class is highly verbal, and he'll just be left out completely if we continue at their level.  Or, you know, it's kind of hard to expect him to join in, in the only way he can, which is just listening and always, listening because he'll always be behind, just trying to catch up.</p>

<p>And uhm, but then I thought, well, he said, "I fix."  I wonder if that's, oh, what I was (Sigh, Pause) I sup—, you know, sort of, well, because then I think of something that FSO, that uhm, I, I, I'm not sure, and just thinking well, I might have thought of his saying, "I fix."  And then thinking those other things as a cover, but because I wish I had a feeling I could fix myself.  And uhm, and I was just thinking about the last couple of days, FSO's been very unhappy, and very unhappy about my going away, especially at this time, but also in the morning, and waking up at night and wanting me.  And last night when she woke up, she said she wanted to stay awake and then sleep in the day when I wasn't going to be there.  And uhm, the other day she'd said she wanted to be a man like Daddy.  It was better, and I don't know, I just have this feeling I'm communicating something to her right now.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Mm, and then I was just thinking how last night, uhm, I guess MSCZ was in a good mood.  He'd gone to a class and had really enjoyed it, and liked the professor, initially, in any case, and had been wo—, quite worried that he wouldn't, because he had not liked some of the people he'd seen last year in the department.  Uhm, so he came back in a good mood, and then was being very jolly.  And I do—, I don't know how I was feeling when I was home.  A—, maybe not particularly jolly, but his jolliness made me feel angry, and, or just that I wanted to be a depressant.  I wasn't, I don't know if I was really feeling angry.</p>

<p>And then I became very aware, because he was u—, you know, in his jolly mood, prolo, prolonging dinner the way we often don't.  Uhm, and I just felt that I couldn't stand it.  I wanted to ge—, be by myself, and keep a distance, because even in responding to his mood, wou, would have been not keeping a distance.  And uhm, of course then he wanted me to respond to his mood, and began just harping on that, and, and really kind of, first joking and then really beginning to harp on it.</p>

<p>And I c—, well, I, I was first thinking of it as well, when I was here, I couldn't stand responding to what you were saying, and I was trying to keep a distance I gu—, it would seem as if between us.  And yet, it seems also that because of that, that I was, you know, because of here that I was feeling that I wanted to keep a distance between MSCZ and me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, y, you really sound as though you've gotten quite a ways away from what you were beginning to confront yesterday, the dilemma you feel.  It's okay to have these fantasies that you can toy around with, talk.  But when it gets down to the real nitty gritty of it, uh, really acknowledging what you really, truly would like, you back off again.  Stay away, coming late, and you prefer to talk about FHYZ, and her affair.  And you sound somewhat detached. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause, Sigh) Well, I think I'm thinking again what I've thought other times, uhm, and m—, I know I was saying it yesterday, that I can't, uhm, I just can't stand thinking of these feelings as anything but fantasy, because if I, if I start thinking of them as something that I really want, then I'm afraid I'll act according to it, and uhm, I'll lose MSCZ.  Or, I don't know, maybe I'm afraid of actually facing, if it's what I really want, and I can have it, what would happen too.  But uhm, I don't even really believe, which may again be because I want to keep it just fantasy, that it, that it's what I really want.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence) And a—, a—, well I don't know, just, I feel, I'm feeling I'm being trapped again, of not being able to, it's almost like, get rid of the fantasies.  I'm trying, because, well, I can see that I have to be able to look at it as more than fantasy, even to be able to get rid of them, because I, in trying to keep them just fantasies, I'm also not able to get rid of them.  And uhm, yet I'm afraid to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I c—, a—, I just don't know what aspect of it that it is.  Whether I'm afraid, if I say that's what I really want, then I'll do something, or if it's, I'm afraid you will.  But uhm, I think I'm afraid I can't say it's what I really want, and something won't happen.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   It's, something.  It's pretty vague. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh, 3-minute silence) Well, I just feel I can't get less vague because somehow then it will be just what I'm saying I can't, feeling I can't do.  And uhm, I don't know, it, if I think, well, I'm going to make myself, that doesn't (Sigh, 2-minute silence, Sigh)</p>

<p>I d—, well, I'm thinking more directly, just simply that what I'm afraid of, is if I say I want to make love with you, right now, here, that then I could not handle it if it happened.  And I sometimes feel if I really recognize that's what I want right here, uhm, it could happen.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But that fear is a measure of how much you want it.  You want it so much, that saying it will make it true.  That's how much you want it, that says the, how powerfully you want it, that you wish just saying it could make it so. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well then I wonder if, if I stop wanting it that much, that I'm afraid of, I mean, that I, you know, so I don't feel that it will come true, and I just want it, then how do I handle it when you say no?  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Now I, I, I don't know, after saying that I can see that it's really part of the same thing, of wanting it so much that, I mean, you know, just the whole inflexibility in, uhm — I me—, I don't know, I just can't imagine wanting something and then not wanting it enough so you can't stand it if you can't have it.  That's one reason why I've always found somebody like FNI so hard to really understand, because she can so often make plans and want things, and then turn about in 2 seconds, and not want them anymore.  And (Sniff) I don't know, just i—, you know, she's very flexible, and uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up. </p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you've had  -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had ear surgery.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did they do on the ear?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They re uh, they redid the ear, the ear was from laying on my ear sleeping.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> From perspiring and everything, it got to be real sore in there and I went to the specialist and he said it has to be redesigned, relined.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The point is now you know you have sleeping habits, you lay a certain way and it's difficult.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can't lay on your left ear anymore.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah you say well I'm not going to lay on this ear because it's sore, but then I lay this way and then, then when I get almost asleep then kinda just automatically go into your sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, exactly, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's rough, it's really, really rough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I imagine when you had rolled over that way you probably woke up because of the discomfort on it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I find the best solution is I have to sit up in the chair, I have to sleep in the chair.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you've been doing that for a while off and on too hadn't you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'd already been doing that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do that once and a while because it's uh, well because of sinuses too, I'm having some sinus problems, but uh it's, it's uh there's a lot of problems involved with that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A lot of people with the sleep apnea too will sleep sitting up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I went through that sleep apnea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went through that and no major problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only problem was just uh the amount of time getting to sleep and then waking up when I wake up and not being able to get back to sleep, except you know if you have a good dream and you wake up in a good dream to go to the bathroom because, you know, that's about one of my problems, going to the bathroom two/three times a night and you get up and you go back and you try to get back into that dream but you can't, you can't get into.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's better to wake up when nature calls though then the alternative.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well looks like, when I have a wet bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly you don't want that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want that either.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah that would probably be worse then staying with that same dream.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm taking water pills too for blood pressure, my blood pressure probably.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well which water pill is it now? Which water pill?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh furfer -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Furosemide. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's a name for that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is that a good one?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's okay um you know since you were here the last time I did get your Lithium level back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know they haven't changed the Lasix level at all right, it's been the same dose all along?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Same dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Does the level look good, the same?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's where it's been at the lower side .59 which is you know that's about what it's been on the prior one, actually it's a little higher, we've had one that was like .49 so it's a little bit up, but it's still at the lower end, which is good, that's what we want to do, we want to keep, as long as you're feeling good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We want to keep it at the lower end of the range because of you know for things like your kidneys and everything else, we don't want to have any complications you know with those.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah well with complication comes with new medicine sometimes when you start if it hasn't been screened enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You always have to be careful with certain water pills too, that if, if they go up on the Lasix that can raise your Lithium level so we don't want you to ever get toxic, so right now it's on the balance with some of your other medications.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought so, yeah that right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'd rather keep it at the lower end too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I still go, the only thing is occasionally when I don't sleep as well, I don't have a pattern of say, I'm going to sleep for so many hours, I don't have that. Sometimes I have less hours and sometimes I have a little bit more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The last time you were here you were having a really bad stretch, I mean it seemed like everything was a bad night [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah it was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean is as if you had come good nights now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then you picked up the Zyprexa, you picked that up and that helped the sleep, making me sleep a little bit and then we went and ordered the medicine and then I wanted to get off of it a little bit so you said cut it in half so now I'm cutting them in half you know, they break pretty good, the color I have, they break pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're tough cause there's not a score across them so you always have to be careful cutting them, but if it's working for you good. I've got some other patients that cut Zyprexa too so. Now have you lost some weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I lost weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah I can see that, looks like you've lost some weight, how much have you lost?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I lost well, I lost a total of over 40 pounds, I lost, I was 230 just a few months back and I was determined I was going to get down to 195 and I had just five more pounds and I'll be to 185 so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I'm looking for.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it's noticeable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just spent like couple of servings in half instead of eating this much I'm eating half as much see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah no, no it's worked well for you, I noticed as soon as you walked in, you looked much more comfortable and you know what, and that was the suggestion in that sleep study too. They have found that you did have some periods of apnea but they didn't think that you needed the mask and all, they suggested weight loss.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right that's what proved it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you know you're doing everything that they suggested.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that's what I'm trying to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's for the blood pressure too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's.. you're blood pressure, for your sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My blood pressure it was a high of 154 over 80, now it's 130 over 70.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that is so good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very, very glad for you, that's excellent because you know and maybe that explains why your sleep has been a little better than it was the last couple times you were here, cause again cutting down the weight is gonna help with the sleep apnea, it's going to make the medications work more effectively and it's going to make you feel better and stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then we talked last time about the number of naps that you take too. I had to curtail that completely I don't like, I don't take naps, that's taboo, if I feel I'm sitting down too long and I start to get sleepy then I get up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it isn't, summer time is better for you too, I think you can get out and there's more to do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not, except this kind of weather.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah this is the type, just like all the big snow storms that kind of keeps you bound inside a little bit.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You don't feel like doing anything in this kind of weather. I just try to find a shady spot, I found a shady spot in the yard, it might be illegal but it's shady. Where do you park over there, do you have a special place?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The doctor's lot's in the back so I park out back there's two trees by the back of the lot so there's like four spaces that get shade, all the rest of them don't, so I watch.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know I don't think all these, all these cars are parked out there, that's not all patients is it? Is that patients?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some staff too, most of the staff parks in the back, most of ones up front are patients or visitors.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Are they?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mostly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you've been doing good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've been doing well depression wise and eating well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I uh I've kind of put that aside, I'm focusing now more on positive things which I have always tried to be positive and I'm coping with the problems. Like if I have a problem I could think of it cause I just psych it out, I can do it, I did this, I did things before, I made things before and I created things before and I can still create things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's in the mind's eye, it's in the mind's eye and now I, how it registers in my brain plus you know you can talk yourself out of a lot of things. They say well the roof, the shed needs a new roof you know I'm going to repair it one of these days, you say that when the sun's shining, then it rains and then it reminds you that you have to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You need to take care of it yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You have to do something about it so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like you've really kind of applied yourself, sounds like you've really made some accomplishments.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm starting to and of course I come and talk with you and I get the encouragement from you and I do appreciate that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your welcome.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I appreciate everything, that's what you make it, things benefit me. How's you and the rest of the gang getting along?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Everyone over here, they're good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some people are the same?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it kind of goes along the same.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You must go through levels, you know you see people who are coming around a little better and that's encouraging to you. You come and you have some words.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Even when you were in the hospital or in the outpatient program I'm sure you saw people at the end of the time that you were there that you could say, you know that you could encourage them. You do get better.  Again you see people at all different phases.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that's, that must be where, that's like myself as a teacher you know I'm a teacher, you know I taught tech school and when I have a student who's really applying themselves and I see them starting to just to do things on their own now see, that's when you always encourage them to do things like on their own, you help them along to get started and then once they get started and they have their brake pads and have the right instructions and they go ahead and they have to take it on their own see so I feel myself you're helping me and I'm helping myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean you're doing a lot of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm doing a lot of this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A lot of yeah. How's your wife doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's doing good, she's getting ready to retire.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One more month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> One more month?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One more month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh my gosh I'm falling out of my chair.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah she's retiring, she's counting the days now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow one month so is there any big event or function at her job, is there's going to be a party or a function?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, at her work yeah. She had a party for the 25th, her 25th year there she had a party for that and then they'll have a retirement party for her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what are you going to do with yourselves?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] well like I said before, I had to just get used to her being home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Being home yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Get accustomed to her being at home because.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'll have more togetherness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I used to think sometimes boy I can't, she can't wait till retirement and then I don't know how I'm going to handle it, that's what I say to myself. But I say to myself, what am I going to do, I mean what will I do, I'll have to handle it, I mean I have no choice you know, we've come this way for 54 years we came this far.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you'll handle it okay. The important thing will just be that you keep to some of your routine you know the things that you do, keep up doing those things and obviously she'll be around and you'll be able to do more things together, but it's going to take her a little time to adjust not seeing all the people at work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well she likes to garden, she likes to get out there with the gold fish and the coy and feed the coy and she likes to do those things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well hopefully she'll find a routine that she likes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And her health you know, her health is a big factor too. She has a number of things, she's got diabetes and she has kidney problems, but health wise if she's able to she will, she's looking forward to it you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well congratulations to her, tell her I said congratulations. Give her my best, so it's a big milestone, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How about you, when will you retire?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know I got a lot of years to go here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Your about [AGE] aren't you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [AGE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I got a few years to go.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How many years you been a doctor?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think its thirteen, oh no longer than that, since a doctor its been like seventeen.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seventeen?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But since I finished training it's been thirteen.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thirteen, have you been here all that time?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Since 1990 yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You've been here since and you're in charge aren't you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm the senior partner.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I saw that some place.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, medical director here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In that paper that you put out there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah I guess so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But are you really ever in charge though?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah things are going fine here, you still have [NAME OTHER] and her news.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You must like it or you wouldn't stay you know. Do you find, do you find yourself, I mean, you talk with people, that's what you do, do you find at the end of the day that you carry a lot of thoughts that you might have had with people like myself, you're talking with me now and then when you go away if you have, maybe have a disagreement about something, do you take any in your head and toss it around in your head and?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean I guess to answer that yeah when you see people and you're working with people its inevitable your going to think about things.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did it ever get to a point where there's trouble, like maybe you had some troubling things and you found it hard to sleep or? I'm just trying to ask you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm a pretty good sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know how I feel because when I say something to somebody I try to say things and deal with kindness and its easier, I don't try to, I don't make no waves, I don't make it rough for anybody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think if you know if you're helping someone too, I mean obviously taking good care of yourself is very important so you're there to help, you know there are certain problems that you can help with and one's you can't, so it's recognizing your own limits and that allows you I think to be able to sleep at night, but I, you know not necessarily carry on much of work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like work, work that you have to take a sleeping aid or something?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have not, I think it's been a while, occasionally when I'm on vacation and I travel I'm going across time zones then I'll take something, but no I haven't, I haven't really needed that, I mean usually my hours are so long that I can sleep on command pretty easily.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You can very easily put just put your head down and go to sleep then you feel rested after.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But now but that effects your night, that was my message before about taking too many naps. You don't want to nap too much or else you won't sleep solidly at night time, your body gets fooled you know but, occasionally I've taken a sleeping aid, but usually when I travel, you know most of the time I don't. Sounds like your doing good. Do you need prescriptions today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh no I don't think I need anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't need any renewals.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your Lithium's okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got the Lithium.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Zyprexa.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Level is [INAUDIBLE]. Zyprexa I have for five and ten, you gave me two different ones. Now when I finish up what I have, we want to order by mail again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, the one from May should be okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my wife says, she said, correct me if I'm wrong, she's wrong, if she needs, if you need the medicine through the mail it has to go through your office?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well no if you have it through the mail and there's a renewal on it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's a renewal on it, that's for ten, but I would like to have it for a five.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you just mail in the prescription I gave you in May.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh just use that, use that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah just return that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You don't have to go through your office.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hut-uh no.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is the same as going through your office right, this is going through your office.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have the written prescription for the 5 mg when you're close to the time for renewal you just send it in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh you just send that in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then they'll change it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because I have a five and a ten.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But now the other possibility is I mean you could renew the ten for another ninety tablets and split it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No I don't want to keep splitting it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay that would last.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean that's another thing to do and like you say it's not totally accurate too and you lose a lot, you lose a lot of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So yeah so just send in the prescription that I gave you before for the five's and then when you're ready for renewal they'll send you the five's.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That should work okay. And so you're Trazodone and Lithium are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Another thing I uh when I had some blood work done, the lady said to me do you want this script back, I didn't know they did that. They filled that, they made out the papers and everything and then she said do you want the script back, I said to use it again, I said that's the first time I heard that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I guess if the prescription was written like a Lithium level once every six months or something like that then that would make sense to give it back and forth, but I only wrote it up for the one time so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I don't know, like I say that's something new.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But they sent it to me, they put, I mean it was clear that they got me the results, it was good and you had it done here at the hospital too, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Keep it on the low side.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah I think .59 its higher than what it has been before but it still at the lower end of the range and maybe that's why you're feeling better too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'll keep it the same okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we just need another appointment, let me turn this off.</p>

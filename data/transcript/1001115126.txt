<P>TH 1: Okay. You just made a comment that I am very interested in hearing more about. You said I think something like Jonathan this is the professional you were wanting to see. And so I'm very interested to know what you wanted to have happen for you, and what you wanted to have happen for your mother. You had some ideas I bet. Great.</p>
<P>C 1: I just want, I just wanted to like stop having so much anger inside and just stop being mean to other people.</p>
<P>TH 2: Wow. So the anger is on the inside and you can feel it</p>
<P>C 2: Mmhm</p>
<P>TH 3: . . . in your body?</p>
<P>C 3: Mmhm</p>
<P>TH 4: Where do you feel it in your body?  How do you do anger inside?</p>
<P>C 4: Well, uh</p>
<P>TH 5: Do you feel it is your shoulders or your stomach, or your thoughts?</p>
<P>C 5: Well, when I look at somebody, I just grit my teeth at em and just want</p>
<P>to go up and hit em for no reason.</p>
<P>TH 6: You grit your teeth, and you just want to hit them for no reason? That does sound like anger doesn't it? Well, you know how I show anger is I take . . . Oops that's not red is it? Take a red pen and kind of go like this. That doesn't look too much like red either, but just to show that that's anger. That you are trying to figure out and you are trying to cope with and you are trying to understand. That takes a lot of courage to say I'm angry and I would like for it to be different. Don't you think?</P>
<P>C 6: Mmhm</P>
<P>TH 7: Do you know anybody else that's angry?</P>
<P>C 7: Well, my brother.</P>
<P>TH 8: Your brother. I don't have your brother on this map. Let's see, you said you were eleven, right? Your brother is how old?</P>
<P>C 8: Sixteen.</P>
<P>TH 9: He's sixteen. Okay, and what's his name?</P>
<P>C 9: Chris.</P>
<P>TH 10: C-H-R-I-S?</P>
<P>C 10: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 11: And how old is Chris?</P>
<P>C 11: Sixteen.</P>
<P>TH 12: That's right. You just told me. Thank you. And so he is angry too. Are you all angry about the same thing?</P>
<P>C 12: No.</P>
<P>TH 13: No. What's he angry about?</P>
<P>C 13: He's angry because like he was supposed to come home a while ago but he didn't get to come home, and he is just mad cause he is not gettin' to do what he wants to do.</P>
<P>TH 14: Come home?</p>
<P>C 14: Yes.</p>
<P>TH 15: Is what he wants to do?</p>
<P>C 15: Yes.</p>
<P>TH 16: So, he wants to come home and that means come home and that means  come home and live with you and Janice?</p>
<P>C 16: Yeah.</p>
<P>TH 17: Where is he now?</p>
<P>C 17: He is in California.</p>
<P>TH 18: Okay, come home from California. So, what's he doing in California?</p>
<P>C 18: He's goin', he's at this home where it's like he has a parole officer and  everything, and he has to just keep doing what he is supposed to do and he will be  able to come home, but he is having problems doing that.</p>
<P>TH 19: He is having problems staying out of trouble?</p>
<P>C 19: Mmhm</p>
<P>TH 20: That's too bad. Did he get in trouble in California or he got in trouble here and . . .</p>
<P>C 20: Well, probably some here and some in California.</p>
<P>TH 21: Wow. Okay. You and your brother pretty close?</p>
<P>C 21: Mmhm</p>
<P>TH 22: Do you miss him?</p>
<P>C 22: Mmhm</P>
<P>TH 23: How long has he been away?</P>
<P>C 23: I don't know. I don't remember.</P>
<P>TH 24: That long? Since you were how high?</P>
<P>C 24: Mm, probably since I was ten.</P>
<P>TH 25: So, about a year.</P>
<P>C 25: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 26: So, you know why I do this, like California, ah, one year. Ah, when I put it on a piece of paper it sticks in my head a little better. I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but it just kind of, it goes into the computer in a different kind of way if I kind of put it out there, and then you get to see what I'm doing too in a way, where I am going in my head. So, Chris is angry. He wants to come home.</P>
<P>He's gotten into trouble, and ah, you're angry. Do you know what you're angry about?</P>
<P>C 26: Not really.</P>
<P>TH 27: Okay. So that would help you if you could understand what you're angry about?</p>
<P>C 27: Mmhm</p>
<P>TH 28: That makes sense to me. Thank you. I want to hear what your mother would like to have happen. What for you Janice, what would you like to have happen?</p>
<P>M 1: I would just like for Jonathan to know what it is he is angry about. I would like to know what it is.</P>
<P>TH 29: So there are these big questions marks around this anger, hm?</p>
<P>M 2: What role, if any, that I play in it, and how to be a better parent. That's what I am looking for.</P>
<P>TH 30: So how to help Jonathan in his feelings. How are you doing with yours?</P>
<P>M 3: Mm, much, it's better.</P>
<P>TH 31: Were you angry too?</P>
<P>M 4: For some time. Years ago.</P>
<P>TH 32: What was yours about?</P>
<P>M 5: Mine was about, you know, the divorce, separation, the result of that.</P>
<P>TH 33: Okay. So let's see. This is Jonathan's father we are talking about?</P>
<P>M 6: Mmhm</P>
<P>TH 34: Okay. So, this is the way I make a divorce. Okay. And his name?</P>
<P>M 7: John.</P>
<P>TH 35: John. And where does John live.</P>
<P>M 8: California.</P>
<P>TH 36: Okay, so he is in California. And how long have you all been divorced?</P>
<P>M 9: Ah, for as long as Jonathan has been here, about . . . eleven years.</P>
<P>TH 37: Okay. Eleven years. So do you know your father?</P>
<P>C 28: Not really.</P>
<P>TH 38: Have you seen him?</p>
<P>C 29: Not that I can remember.</p>
<P>TH 39: So as far as you know, you never met him. Do you have any pictures of him?</p>
<P>C 30: Yeah.</p>
<P>TH 31: What does he look like?</p>
<P>C 31: I don't remember.</p>
<P>TH 32: So you don't have pictures that are in your back pocket or in your  bedroom. Well, you have had two big losses. I'm thinking about your brother not  being with you, and not having your father. That seems pretty big to me. So this  relationship that Janice you and John had was not an easy one, huh?</p>
<P>M 10: No.</p>
<P>TH 32: And do you have any contact with John at this point.</p>
<P>M 11: None.</p>
<P>TH 33: And what about with Chris?</p>
<P>M 12: Frequent.</p>
<P>TH 34: So, Chris would have been about five or six when you all divorced.</p>
<P>M 13: Right.</p>
<P>TH 35: Okay. So we will show that. Five, six years old, and did Chris live with you?</p>
<P>M 14: And his dad.</p>
<P>TH 36: And his dad.</P>
<P>M 15: Mmhm</P>
<P>TH 37: And then when you were divorced . . .</P>
<P>M 16: He lived with me.</P>
<P>TH 38: He lived with you. And he visited with his father, his father moved to California?</p>
<P>M 17: We lived in another state. His father lived in the same town as us for approximately until Chris was ten, five or six years after the divorce. And then he moved to California within the last five years.</p>
<P>TH 39: So how did you deal with, let's put your anger up here. You're saying you're not so angry anymore, so we will just put a little bit. How did you deal with yours?</p>
<P>M 18: I just grew out of it.</p>
<P>TH 40: Time.</p>
<P>M 19: Yes. And I just, time. Let it go.</p>
<P>TH 41: So, you left this relationship or this, your time in this relationship left you with some wounds?</p>
<P>M 20: Yes.</p>
<P>TH 42: Who stood by you? Who supported you?</P>
<P>M 21: My mom.</p>
<P>TH 43: Wonderful. And your mother's name is what?</p>
<P>M 22: It was Lorrine.</P>
<P>TH 44: Lorrine. How do you spell that?</P>
<P>M 23: L-O-R-R-I-N-E.</P>
<P>TH 45: Lorrine. Okay. When did Lorrine die?</P>
<P>M 24: June of 1996.</P>
<P>TH 46: Not very long ago.</P>
<P>M 25: Right.</P>
<P>TH 47: Were you close to your grandmother?</P>
<P>C 32: Mmhm.</P>
<P>TH 48: Were you pretty special to her? (C nods) Let's see, if we were going to show a real special line, what do you think about purple? And we will show a nice big line between you and Lorrine. Okay. How does that look to you? That look like that makes sense?</P>
<P>C 33: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 49: So, you lost somebody very important to you and to you too. Did you all live close together?</P>
<P>M 26: Um . . .</P>
<P>TH 50: Did you get to see her?</P>
<P>M 27: Different states. The same state that we came from where Christopher and Jonathan grew up basically, were born, and where the marriage took place. So far in distance geographically, but very close. We had daily contact.</P>
<P>TH 51: Really.</P>
<P>M 28: Mmhm, all the holidays we were there. Mothers Day. Any other excuse to be there we were there or she was here.</P>
<P>TH 52: What happened to her?</P>
<P>M 29: She had cancer. And so the last nine months of her life she lived with us.</P>
<P>TH 53: Oh really. You took care of her?</P>
<P>M 30: I did. Jonathan too.</P>
<P>TH 54: . . . a great person. So you were a young doctor, huh? What kind of cancer did she have?</p>
<P>M 31: She had originally had breast cancer that had metastasized to liver, so that's what she went out with, liver. Bone, blood, it got pretty bad.</p>
<P>TH 55: Was she at home when she died?</p>
<P>M 32: Yes. She was in our home, in my bed.</p>
<P>TH 56: Wow. Well, this is obviously a tremendous heart hurt for you. She stood by . . . (offers M a tissue)</p>
<P>M 33: Thank you</p>
<P>TH 56: You're welcome. . . . you when you were having a hard time, and you were there for her. Is it hard for you to see your mother crying because her heart is so full of her relationship with her mother?</p>
<P>M 34: It makes me want to cry, but I know I gotta get over it.</p>
<P>TH 57: Uh, I don't follow you, you have to get over it. You have to, I don't get that.</p>
<P>C 34: It's like, I can't go my whole life that my grandma is going to come back.</p>
<P>TH 58: Right. Because she won't come back. But you must have wonderful memories to bring her back with. And you have a big kind of hole in your heart to not have her. It hadn't been that long ago really. Again, I'm just thinking about the, the losses for you. To lose your granny, your brother, in different ways, and your father. That's a lot Jonathan. That's a lot to have to handle as a little boy. You know? You know how I feel about your tears? They just seem so healthy and so wholesome. And so real. And I'm glad that you can have your tears, and I hope it's okay for you to have your tears too. Because, you know, sometimes underneath a lot of anger is a hurt. Like a, a hole in your heart. Does that make sense to you? Seems like it does. Like there is a little, little boy inside, about, I don't know, maybe about this little, and he has gotten hurt, and he's inside of you, and what I hear is that you are trying to get him to be big boy, tough, you know. Get on with your life, you know. Ah, get past those tears. But this little guy still lives inside of your like a little girl does inside of you that lost her mother. That's real. Is it okay with you if I talk about you having a little girl inside of you?</P>
<P>M 35: Yes, it's okay.</p>
<P>TH 59: How does that fit for you? Does that make any sense to you?</p>
<P>M 36: Ah, yes.</p>
<P>TH 60: Who is with you now to help you with the pain of losing your mom,  maybe some, the residual of not having things work out with John, your worries about Jonathan and Chris?</P>
<P>M 37: There is no one that, was that, is with me like my mom was. When she was alive she was like the center of my life, you know. I mean I have my kids and everything, so I never developed close ties with any other person, and the only other person that I can think of now that I'm closest to would be her oldest sister who has been, I've been like her favorite niece since I was born. When I was born, my mom, she asked my mom Let me have her. So we developed a relationship over the years and over the distance of the two states, and now that I'm here, you know, we are closer geographically, and we've developed a stronger relationship based on what was already there.</P>
<P>TH 61: Wonderful. So you share the grief.</P>
<P>M 38: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 62: And papa?</P>
<P>M 39: He is in the other state.</P>
<P>TH 63: How is he doing?</P>
<P>M 40: Well, we don't have much contact with papa. He was a bit estranged from granny at the time of the death</P>
<P>TH 64: Mmm, had that happened a good while? So they weren't divorced.</P>
<P>M 41: No.</P>
<P>TH 65: They were kind of separated a bit? Okay.</P>
<P>M 42: They were living in the same house but separate lives. So that's why mom had to,</p>
<P>TH 66: Okay</p>
<P>M 43: I took care of her at the end of her life because he said I guess you are going to go with Janice because you are so ill, and the doctor told him what she needed, and he said I guess you are going to go with Janice. So. . .</p>
<P>TH 67: Wow. Well, this is quite a story. This is quite a story that is all around you. So you really knew granny, Jonathan, but I guess did you know papa well? Or . .</P>
<P>C 35: Sort of.</p>
<P>TH 68: Sort of. So what color line would we put between you and papa?</p>
<P>C 36: Green.</p>
<P>TH 69: Green. That one I bet is just going to be really pale. Do you want to do it? You make it like you think. Let me get this out of your way though. Mmm, okay. Thank you. They're very different, aren't they, the connection you had with papa? When will you see him again do you think?</p>
<P>C 37: Probably Christmas.</p>
<P>TH 70: So you will travel?</p>
<P>M 44: With Chris coming home, he wants to see you know his relatives, his cousins.</p>
<P>TH 71: So Chris is going to be home for Christmas?</p>
<P>M 45: Mmhm.</p>
<P>TH 72: Wonderful.</p>
<P>M 46: So we are going to go there so that he can see the cousins that he grew up with and, and probably see papa at the same time.</p>
<P>TH 73: Well, you must be pretty excited about that. How about you?</p>
<P>M 47: Yes, very much so.</p>
<P>TH 74: Well, I want to give you a picture that I have about your challenge. Do you know, ah the word challenge like if something's a challenge? It's like if you had to climb a, a big hill and you had a lot of weight on you, that would be like a challenge, and that's kind of what I think you have. This is the picture I have. Here it is right here. This is like the little one inside of your, okay? And this is like his heart, and his heart is sad. But he is not supposed to be sad. He is supposed to be big, what were you going to say?</p>
<P>C 38: Happy.</p>
<P>TH 75: He is supposed to be happy. So he is supposed to smile, but he has a heart that's hurting. So what do you think that would be like for this little one?</p>
<P>C 39: Hard?</p>
<P>TH 76: It would be very hard. It would be very hard. So here's my idea. My idea is that you have to take this little one, and you have to let this little one know that you are going to be there with him and that it is okay to be sad when you're unhappy and when you feel lonely, when you miss your brother, when you wonder where your dad is, when you think about your grandmother. I bet you saw her suffer. And when you think about how special she was. It seems like to me that we need to find a way for this little one inside of you to not have to pretend because I think when you have to pretend, it probably makes you angry. It probably makes you real angry to have to pretend something that's not true for you. What do you think about that? What do you think would have to happen for you to have more freedom to just be with your heart? What do you think would help?</p>
<P>C 40: I don't really know.</P>
<P>TH 77: What do you know about Jonathan? What do you think would help him?</p>
<P>M 48: Just be allowed to be and feel I guess what he's feeling and express it. Be able to express it. Ah, he didn't know what it was. You know, it's like those things were there, but I guess he'll have a better understanding of what's causing it and feel free-er to express what's going on, and I guess it's my job to get him the help to get through it.</p>
<P>TH 77: Are there any, ah, men like would papa be able to help Jonathan?</p>
<P>M 49: No.</p>
<P>TH 78: Would Chris?</P>
<P>M 50: No. There, there . . . we have a family friend that Jonathan has confidence in, Mr. Jay.</p>
<P>TH 79: Okay, so let's put Mr. Jay here. Mr. Jay. So what kind of color line would you put to Mr. Jay?</p>
<P>C 41: Red.</P>
<P>TH 80: Red. Okay. Want, mhm, to do the line?  I didn't know the heart had a sound. There. Okay. Thank you. So do you get to see Mr. Jay?</P>
<P>C 42: Mmhm.</P>
<P>TH 81: Would he understand how much loss you have suffered?</P>
<P>C 43: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 82: Great, great.</P>
<P>M 51: He was there. He knew granny. He was there during that time period for us. He knows Chris. He knows that situation.</P>
<P>TH 83: Wonderful.</P>
<P>M 52: He knows papa.</P>
<P>TH 84: Wonderful.</P>
<P>M 53: So he is, ah, Jonathan's closest male friend that he trusts.</P>
<P>TH 85: Wonderful.</P>
<P>M 54: He is just super busy.</P>
<P>TH 86: Yeah. But a little understanding from a man could go a long way for Jonathan because you know it's like you have a similar job here. This could be your little girl. Mama has a little girl inside of her too. So you have this little girl and she has a heart that has to be taken care of, and of course, ah, me too. I have a little girl inside of me too, and you know, she has hurts and disappointments and stuff that I have to deal with. I'm just thinking that you, Janice, you seem to do such a wonderful job of being able to be where your heart is, and that's so wonderful for you to, to see, and I suspect at times it may feel a little overwhelming, I don't know. It may, as you say, make you feel like maybe you want to cry too. And maybe that would be okay. And if there is a man like Mr. Jay who's in your life and who could say, yeah, you know, Janice has sadness. She lost her mother, ah, and Jonathan has sadness because he doesn't get to see his brother. He lost his grandmother. It sounds like not much is there for you and your father at all. Is that right? Well, that must be a tremendous loss for you. So I suspect if you don't figure out how to love that little one and have, have a good open heart to yourself, that you probably are going to clench your jaws and find your muscles tight and have to express it some way. I suspect that's what's happened with Chris. And he's, hasn't been able to take care of the, that part inside of him with his hurts, his wounds, his pain, his disappointments, and I suspect it's just come out.</p>
<P>M 55: Chris is really effected by the divorce. He was you know the center of attraction for five years before Jonathan came, and then he just, he blamed me for it, and then he is angry because his dad has not been what he needed, you know, emotionally and even physically.</p>
<P>TH 87: Really?</p>
<P>M 56: And supportive, and so it's a never ending cycle.</p>
<P>TH 88: I'm sorry to not get to meet Chris. I kind of feel like he is here a bit, and granny, and papa. So Jonathan, what do you think about the time we've spent here tonight. Do you think . . .</P>
<P>C 44: It helped.</p>
<P>TH 89: I'm so glad. I am so glad too that somehow or another that you and your mother knew how to communicate about this so that you could get help. How did that come about?</p>
<P>M 57: He told me about two weeks ago. He said, Mom I have some anger. I need to talk to a counselor. I said, Well do they have counselors at your school? He said, No. I said, Okay. And then he mentioned it again a couple of days later. Mom, what about the counselor? and that's when I began to search out resources and I heard about this opportunity.</p>
<P>TH 90: You are a very wise young one. You, I know when you have that ability to know what you're feeling, it gives you choice about what to do. If you didn't know that you were feeling angry and you just went around punching, all you would do is get in trouble, but to be able to know it and to ask for help is just so impressive. You must be very proud of him.</P>
<P>M 58: I am.</p>
<P>TH 91: I would love for Chris to know about what you were able to do. I think that would be wonderful. I don't know if he knows how to do that. Do you know?</P>
<P>C 45: Not really.</p>
<P>TH 92: Don't know if he does not, or you don't think he does know how to know what he is feeling and ask for help?</p>
<P>C 46: Well, he probably does a little bit, but probably not a little bit too.</P>
<P>TH 93: Just a little bit?</P>
<P>M 59: He's in counseling.</P>
<P>TH 94: Great.</P>
<P>M 60: It took him a long time to accept it, but part of the coming home had to do with you have to go through counseling.</P>
<P>TH 95: Good. I'm glad. So how has it been for you for us to spent this time together here.</P>
<P>M 61: Great. It helped a great deal to put things in perspective and I thought I'd stopped crying about granny, but I see I haven't . But it's important to know so that you can, you know, try to get some results. Very helpful. Very enlightening.</P>
<P>TH 96: I'm glad. It has been a real honor for me to step into your live and your world for just this little bit of time. I won't forget you Jonathan, and I won't forget you either Janice.</P>
<P>M 62: I thank you for taking the time.</P>
<P>TH 97: I thank you for listening to your son with such attentiveness. You are a very good mother.</P>
<P>M 63: I try to be.</P>
<P>TH 98: And I am imagining that you have learned a lot from granny about how to be a mother.</P>
<P>M 64: Oh yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 99: And you are going to have to figure out a very creative way to learn about how to be a daddy, you know, because maybe you'll learn from Mr. Jay because John's not there for you. So it's going to be a little tougher for you and for you as a parent if you have children. But you are off to such an incredible start as a young boy. Really. So, I would like to say goodbye to you and goodnight to you, and can I shake your hand and tell you, You are very special.</P>
<P>C 47: Thank you.</P>
<P>TH 100: You are welcome. You are a very special woman.</P>
<P>M 65: Thank you.</P>
<P>TH 101: I hope your holidays are wonderful.</P>
<P>M 66: Same to you.</P>
<P>TH 102: Thank you. And I'll take these little ones. They have become more special because they've been here with you two. Yours has a heart sound, did you notice? You know what, maybe you should take this home with you. What do you think?</P>
<P>C 48: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 102: What do you think? Do you think it would help, that you would remember about your heart and about your losses and about how it's okay to feel said when you're sad, you don't have to cover it up with being tough and angry?</p>
<P>What do you think?</P>
<P>C 49: I guess. Thank you.</P>
<P>TH 103: You're very welcome.</P>
<center><p><b> Treatment Plan for this Family</b><p></center>
<P>In future sessions, McLendon would want to gain information about Jonathan's school, the neighborhood Janice and Jonathan live in and their relative sense of safety. She would continue to help Jonathan increase his awareness of how his body feels when he is angry and look for productive ways that he could discharge his energy. She also follow up on Jonathan's sadness and help him search out ways he could deal with that. It would also be helpful if, at some point, Chris (Jonathan's brother) could participate in a session.</p>

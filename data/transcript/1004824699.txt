<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm pretty well, Bryans.
 
CLIENT: So, Franco broke up with Sascha.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which I know because she called James last night to tell him that Franco had broken up with her and she basically, like, yelled at him, reiterating the things that she said before. So, I don't know. (pause) James did not seem to be as hurt by it as I was afraid that he would. But (pause) on the hand, poor Sascha, and on the other hand, like, how dare you do that to my husband, like, what the fuck? [00:01:20]</p>

<p>So James and I talked a lot. I kind of tried to say, look, (pause) just because, like, Sascha is hurting and that's true, but that doesn't mean she gets to treat people badly, but at the same time Sascha's really hurting. But also, like, there is no way that James can be responsible for Sascha's unhappiness or Sascha's breaking up with Franco. Like, James is not responsible for that because the two people responsible for a relationship are the people in the relationship. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I see where you're going [with this] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, James has...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you put it like that. [00:02:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) But this is kind of (pause), like, I don't know. (pause) Like she was trying to get James to take responsibility for her unhappiness and James was pretty ready to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did she say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She said that James took advantage of Franco. I mean, I wasn't on the phone. James picked up the phone, said hello, and then I could hear her voice, sort of, for, like, five minutes. And then he said, "OK," then she hung up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You heard of the breakup from her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just that he had taken advantage of Franco and that Franco was a really good person, James was a really bad person and that she would (ph) never want to be friends with him again, and that he had put Franco in danger by having Franco taking care of me when I was—like, putting him in danger, you know, having me commit suicide in Franco's apartment and that would be a really horrible thing for me. And this was, like, basically what she'd said before and that (pause) she just thinks you don't, that's too much to ask of somebody. [00:03:52]</p>

<p>So, I mean, I would expect me, I mean myself, to be feeling really guilty right about now, but it's just so obviously crazy that I don't at all. Like, no. I think that anyone of this five or six, like, therapists that I've ran our crisis plan by would have mentioned if it was too much to ask for somebody to come to take care of me. Like, pretty sure there were a lot of really good medical professionals on that case and a lot of really pretty crappy ones also. But somebody would've said something. Like, you are the only person who feels this way. I don't know why she feels that way, but (pause) I just—I don't know. [00:04:55]</p>

<p>Reminds me a lot of the way that Bryan and I used to operate. Bryan was really unhappy and he would kind of ask me to take responsibility for his unhappiness and I would do it. I don't know. So that's a pattern that I got to know pretty well. like I said, it's a really easy step from wishing you could make somebody feel better to feeling like it's your fault that you can't make somebody feel better, and from wishing that you could feel better to feeling like it's somebody else's fault that you don't feel better. So that's mundane (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, (inaudible at 05:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I think James wrote to Franco and then we kind of talked about, like, OK, so what do we do now? James was like, "Well, you know, I don't want to say that you can't be friends with Sascha. If you want to be friends with her, be friends with her." You know, I do care about Sascha a lot, but I'm really not interested in being friends with somebody who treats my husband like that. Just not interested. I think that's a deal breaker, which is really hard for me to say, but (pause) I can't let that stand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that the immediate sentiment was, like, wanting to punch her in the nose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. James was very touched because he could tell that I was, like, totally ready to beat her up. (laughter) He was like, "Please don't, but that's awesome." (laughter) He was like, "Now you feel how I feel when you want to beat people up for me on my behalf. Like, don't. Just don't." (laughter) So I'm not, I'm not going to get in contact with her. [00:06:55]</p>

<p>So James e-mailed Franco today and we had talked and thought, you know, yeah, we want to support him but we want him to get to decide what taking care of him looks like, you know. So, James e-mailed him to say basically, like, "Hey, we know you guys broke up because of this and we're here if you, you know, we're here." And so Franco said he was probably going to sleep for several days and that (inaudible at 07:30), which is what he does when he's depressed. He just sleeps for, like, 14, 16 hours a day, you know. (pause) So that didn't (inaudible at 07:48)</p>

<p>It made me feel weirdly better, like getting me out of my own situation or something. And also just talking with James is good, but (pause) I don't know. I've been up and down. (pause) I was angry yesterday. I mean, you might have noticed that. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [How come] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure why. Weird (ph). (pause) I think you're right. [00:08:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I wondered if you were a little relieved among other things about Franco and Sascha breaking up and that, although I imagine what you most wanted was for things to go well and work well for them, my impression from the way you talked about it was that often it really didn't. And that it was sort of affecting you and James's friendship with Franco in crummy ways and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it's probably better this way. Yeah, and that we get to still be friends with Franco, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like your impression of the other ways you can make him happy. [00:09:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they—no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it's not as though, like, it was awesome, but now I think I get to be friends with him. I mean, it's like also...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's this weird thing where I'm trying really, really hard both kind of verbally and in my own head to, like, defend Sascha or do justice to her, but yeah, she was not good to him. She's not good to him and (pause)—but, you know, that doesn't mean that he doesn't care about her and it doesn't mean that I don't care about her. James actually doesn't care about her but (laughter), like, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All those things can be true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but (pause)—so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 11:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's better for things to be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (background noise) [Really lucky clock] (ph). Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's OK. It's better, like, for things to be, I don't know, resolved in some way, although I am not banking on that being a firm resolution, but I am sure there's more drama where that came from. But yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so you're saying also you were angry with me yesterday, but aren't sure why and I thought I was right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [You know] (ph) asking me to think about something in a different way and I don't really want to think about it. [00:12:03] But it didn't last very long actually. I thought about it for about half an hour. I was like, (inaudible at 12:31) (laughter). Well done you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) I'm so thrilled. (laughter)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And hard work is all (ph). [00:13:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel like I keep trying to find something t hat's easier and you keep trying to say, "No, you have to work harder than that." And I think you're right, but it's tough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Extremely tough, yeah. So it feels like I'm encouraging you to work harder than you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It feels like when I get—I don't know if complacent is the right word, but, like, settled somewhere, then you say, "No, that's not actually how it is." Then I say, "Fuck. (laughter) OK." I guess hard work can—there's kind of two different things going on that are both hard work but in different ways, you know. Now I can't remember the distinction I was trying to make (inaudible at 14:45)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>You know, I don't resent it—it's just hard to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was strange. [00:15:46] I was doing pretty OK today, most of the day, and just, like, in the last half hour before coming here I just kind of went downhill. I'm just feeling, like, kind of exhausted and sad, frustrated. I don't know what to make of that</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's (ph) the time of day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I have to go to work after this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm closing tonight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, how late does that mean u have to be there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 11:45.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's pretty late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and then I'm back tomorrow at 7:00, which is (inaudible at 16:46), yeah. I don't think that's going to happen very often.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I switched with somebody else because she couldn't work the shift.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>You know, the work, it tires me out but when I'm there it's like (pause) it's an escape.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your feeling the last sort of, whatever, 45 minutes or so, have been (inaudible at 17:51) mood down, tired.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Irritable. Yeah.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I've just been kind of flipping on and off the last, like, three days. Yesterday, like, I was pretty low. I, you know, left our appointment and then kind of after about an hour, like, (inaudible at 18:41) I felt good and then felt bad again. And I don't know, like, (pause) I don't know why. I'm sure there is a reason for it, but I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you then feel worse again yesterday and when better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, and generally this is what we were talking about or what I was trying to make a point about towards the end yesterday, is this way that (pause) feeling bad comes over you without (pause) a sense that it's related to anything that's happened, usually. But (pause) it is unusually in a way I think you don't want it to be. I'm not sure how it's (pause)—you know, it's kind of a way of talking to James about (inaudible at 20:24) because it's very difficult, and you do and you feel horrible. And then you kind of lose a sense of why and then I wave my arms about it, and then that sucks to hear. But I think it also gives you a thinking (ph) about what's going on and in that sense may be actually kind of reassuring. Like, (inaudible at 20:59) horrible, like, digesting it for the first time after we met and also being upset with me and then felt better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then (pause) we're, you know, feeling some degree of, outside of frustration, me just about (pause)—I think it feels to you probably like there's a way that I am pushing you or hurting you when I say something like that, but maybe (ph) it's alongside is then that at times it might be right or ultimately helpful (inaudible at 21:51) sometimes not, but sometimes (inaudible at 21:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, clearly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think there's another level at which it feels like (pause) the image that came to my mind for a reason I'm not clear about is, like, that I'm also, like, (inaudible at 22:04) to you or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [It's not very much fun] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think at that level it feels like I am, in a way, being deliberately hurtful, like I know what I'm doing, I know it's going to hurt, and there's something about me (pause) maybe kind of wanting you to, or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm reading Infinite Jest, still. I'm on, like, page, like, 500.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) (inaudible at 22:51)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 22:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) But there's a long kind of (inaudible at 22:58) on AA. I mean, it's about AA (inaudible at 23:00) about, but one of the things is Stan. He's been (inaudible at 23:07) or says, you know, "One of the things they don't tell you about when you sign on for AA is that the way to get better is through pain, not around pain. It's not in spite of pain—it's through pain. So, I thought about this.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I think there's a way you sort of (pause) also, like, dramatize your narrative (inaudible at 23:59) a little bit. I don't mean you're being dramatic—that's not the sense is which I mean it, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes sense. I mean, like, that's why I don't keep my journal regularly because I do (pause) structure my life like a story in the way that I interpret it and I recognize that that is limiting in some ways, you know. And that, like, if I'm only choosing to look at these five things then those are the only five things I can see. It makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. I guess what I have in mind is (pause) like your relationship with Bryan, which (pause), you know, did involve his doing things that were I think really scary, some of it really hurtful to you. (pause) I guess I think (pause) that was his fault, that was not your fault. These are (inaudible at 25:45) or it's like there's something going on with you there...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think he was a bad actor?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I mean is, I'm not talking about his abilities on the stage. I mean, like, you know, in the way you talk about, like, an international relations, you know, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, OK, OK. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You (inaudible at 26:04), like, I'm already very clear I'm not trying to let him off the hook or say that, you know, it's because of something you did that he would always do that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but there's something going on where (inaudible at 26:14) do it. He knew something was hurting you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, that was something that both kind of got in the way of my seeing (pause) our relationship as abusive and kind of helped me figure out what, like, abusive relationships look like when I started (inaudible at 26:42) is that, like, yeah, it was clearly something that I was participating in, clearly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you were complacent in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and (pause), you know, in the case it was like the story was something about, like, self-sacrifice being a good thing and, like, that being how I justified myself. Yeah, you know, I'm here. The narrative I have is, well, it's going to hurt a lot, but then it'll get better. And that's how I know it's going to get better. Yeah, so where it gets scary is when you say, "OK, well it's going to hurt a lot," and then I don't get better and then it just hurts in different ways or different things hurt and I just keep going. [00:28:01]</p>

<p>You know, it's like where my narrative breaks down, starts to (pause) get scary for me.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, if we were talking about something that was very painful or look at some painful aspects of it or reframe (ph) it in some more painful way, and then it doesn't help. Like, you just feel worse or you feel more confused, or something like that. Is that the same thing] (ph) you were thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>You know, what I worry about is that there's no next act (ph). I'm not on the way to anything, I'm just here.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>You know, but Beckett play, rather than Shakespeare (inaudible at 30:09) (laughter) I actually really like Beckett, but this doesn't mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't want to be in one of the (inaudible at 30:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughter) You know, I liked him because of that, like, the (pause) challenging the way that we create narrative structures and stories to say, like, look, there's a beginning and a middle and a end and you're going somewhere, and then saying, no, that's not actually how life is. That's not what happens. And it's really getting at something, but it doesn't mean I want it to actually be true. (laughter)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Yeah. You know, and I don't know what you're going to say next. I don't know when it's going to hurt. [00:31:40]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I've been watching Veronica Mars, like, (inaudible at 32:21). It's another, I don't know, 2004. It's really good. So there's kind of this (inaudible at 32:32) type. She's a (inaudible at 32:34) private investigator and she's investigating her [best friend] (ph) murder, like, kind of over the Christmas season. And her mom has left for unspecified reasons. And so in one episode, she finds out that her real father is actually the father of the girl who was murdered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was (inaudible at 32:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And who is a suspect in the murder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 33:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. In the murder, and so, like, the closing scene of this episode is her, like, getting back in her car and just, like, breaking down, like, weeping at the steering wheel. And then, like, the opening shot of the next episode is, like, her weeping and then she sits up and the wise (ph) side of her is like, "So your dad is Jay Cane (sp?). Well, get over it." (laughter) And (inaudible at 33:25) keeps going. I kind of feel like that, you know. Just, you know, have to keep going.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Yeah, and I don't know where to go next. (inaudible at 36:35) take the apartment, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 36:38) James. So we'll move in the next couple of days. Should be really exciting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're moving over the weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Probably, but I'm working both days, so, no (ph). I haven't packed and I don't know how to start. I keep thinking that I need to and (inaudible at 37:19) I haven't done nothing.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Yeah, things like moving are like a wall in front of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this may sound like a stretch but I was sort of seeing your feeling and felt (ph) things here considerably similar, where you really want to be in a different place, like, emotionally, but it can be really hard to (pause) pull together all the ways you're feeling so bad and kind of organize them in a way that (pause) will help you move on and move out of this. And you're afraid it's never going to happen. I guess (inaudible at 38:37) talking about today, but you're not going anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [You know, and this] (ph), I can sort of live with it when I'm just afraid of it, you know, when I'm convinced of it [since things are worse] (ph). It doesn't feel like I'm going anywhere. I know, I mean, I guess when I step back a little bit I'm (sighs) being bought into that. [00:39:28]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I think I should be able to get over it more, just keep going or, you know (pause)—I don't understand in some ways, like, this is I guess pretty basic that I really don't understand why this is so crippling for me. [00:41:33] Like, why (pause) I—yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 41:54) (laughter) (pause) Why haven't I packed? Why don't I do the dishes? (pause) Why can't I have sex? (laughter) (inaudible at 42:36)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I have an idea. (pause) At least [the things I've seen] (ph) kind of recently—more than recently, [at the moment] (ph) recently is (pause) the sort of stealthy and crippling effects of your guilt for being angry. [00:43:28]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>There's a part two, but (inaudible at 43:55) part one until (inaudible at 43:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 43:57) OK. I don't know what to think about that. And that it's clear to me that I get very angry and then I get very guilty about it and that's crippling to me, but (pause) it's just air (ph). I try to convince myself to feel less guilty, for example, or to feel less angry or to deal with anger in different ways, and it just doesn't seem to touch it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, at the moment I'm not providing an explanation as to why or context as to why or suggesting that this is something you have or ought to have control over...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 45:01)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for now, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what's part two?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part two is I think you sometimes try to manage the (pause) guilt or sort of soften the blows for a minute by, like, you know, doing kind of a so-blotulating (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not allowing yourself anything you would enjoy or that would help you get things you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 45:48)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like packing your stuff (ph), or feeling OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's something to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We (ph) can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome dear (ph) (inaudible at 46:16). Do you want to meet on Tuesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, take care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, today actually yes, after my exam they want me to get there at 8:00 tonight.  Because I was originally, I told them a long time ago I had exams and I was just like yeah, can't work, and then they asked if there was anyway I could come in after my exams.  I said "Yeah, uh, 8:00 probably."  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What time they close?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eleven.  That's like three and a half hours if I help close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, um, statistics, business statistics and I've got 96, 92, 92 on the exams and I've been there everyday, done all my homework.  That's a guaranteed A.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since it's cumulative, there's no new information so if like study the whole year, I'm not worried about the ones today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's your paper on that's due Monday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's uh, uh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Dry mouth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well just the cough and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, the paper is on, you have to read a story called, I think it's called [INAUDIBLE], we have to do a critique on it, because we've been reading a lot um, all semester.  Well, only half the semester because it's accelerated you know.  So, it's a critique on the story.  We have to be the critic and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're, you read the story?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not yet, but I've read stories all year and I know, I did a critique on uh, did a critique on a critique for a project on [INAUDIBLE].  So, uh, I mean I know how to [INAUDIBLE], I just haven't read it yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're grade in that class is okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my quiz average is 81, and I mean it'll, it'll be fine as long as I do well on the project.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll have an A or B.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, what's going on with your, uh, personal life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm talking to [NAME OTHER].  We're getting like, I know I'm being careful I'm not going to let him take advantage of me or anything.  But, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not about you as much as it is what he's up to.  Where is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I want to be with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's at work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he called me like a few, like while I was here a few minutes ago, um he has to work from 11:00 to 7:00 and then he supposed to come, or he wants to come um, at 8:00 and see me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How is he doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's doing fine actually.  He um, his dad is home right now.  Um, he's home, they don't know when he's going to have his attorney trial thing, whatever they do with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well last time you where here you were going to go meet him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And say that's you didn't do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've met him and then he said a lot of things that you know, something that I would like to hear and [INAUDIBLE].  But he really did sound sincere and like.  I didn't want to have to break up with him but like, like exactly a year ago is when meet, talking like hanging out as friends and stuff —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you didn't want to why did you say you were going to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Break up with him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he keeps wanting me back and I've, I've kissed a guy on Friday, [INAUDIBLE].  But it was kind of ending anyways, because it was like a bad relationship and like I know I should have done that but I told him about it and he said, "It doesn't matter to me, I'm, I still want to have you back and stuff like," [INAUDIBLE] I know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So where is he stay now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> His house —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Himself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With his dad and his brother.  Right now he's saying he wants to spend as much time with his dad as he can.  I'm like well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I though he was going —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I though he was going to go stay some place else in North Carolina or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was one of his options, the other option is to stay here be a manager and go back and forth between here and [DEIDENTIFIED] to work like two days a week or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he really is seriously talking about um, in the fall going to [DEIDENTIFIED] to do, um, do automotive, to get his automotive degree.  He's going to be a mechanic because he's really good at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This causing your mom a far amount of distress?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Uh, my dad more is so then my mom.  He just doesn't like him, which is understandable but he just doesn't like him.  My mom actually does like him she just like for him to treat me well, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how often do you guys see each other?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well I got this house you know, I told you I signed a lease.  But he's supposed to, he was supposed to help me, coming down today, no I'm seeing him today at work and then he was supposed to help me move in tomorrow but he thought it I meant next Saturday when I said I was moving out so he was going to um, he's working a double tomorrow for like 15 hours or something like that.  So, um, yeah so he can't do that but um, but I mean before that I've seen him pretty much, I talk to him everyday.  See him every other day, [INAUDIBLE] it's been fun.  Yeah, I just told him I don't want to jump in to anything right now.  I just want to be friends and just, just hang out.  Like we used to not have to worry about anything else and not have to worry about always telling you what I'm doing, when I'm doing it.  Not that I had to, but just knowing have to check in with someone all the time, because I mean I have other guy friends I want to hang out with.  But this guy I kissed, like he's out of the picture, that's not anymore.  Like I don't talk to him anymore, so because he wanted something serious and I, after that happened.  I was like I, you know I told you I'm just out of a relationship, like I don't want a boyfriend right now.  But he didn't seem to understand I just had to break it to him the hard way.  Well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what, what is your plan as far as where you're staying now, you going to stay with your folks for a little while longer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, um, they just wanted me to stay home to make sure I got enough rest and stuff.  Um, but tonight I have to work so I'll probably stay home tonight.  Then Saturday we're going to, [INAUDIBLE] I'll probably just be studying all day.  I hope that I can come down here and study because I've already got, you know the library and time here.  Then I'm going to move in to the house on Saturday.  My dads, they're supposed to go on a retreat this weekend for the family retreat.  I told my dad you know, go ahead, go ahead.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't go to that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have been, I didn't go last year I had to work and stuff and it's right during exams and so it's just a bad time for me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I already went to the collegiate thing back in January so, it's a good place but um, not the right time to go.  So my dad said "he's just going to stay here and back me up" and um, of and the other thing they don't want me to drive until I get the okay from you and they think I'm okay and like I mean, I'm pretty sure that I can sit behind the wheel and concentrate on the road and drive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I am sure.  That's, I just told them you know, like I'm pretty sure that you're not inside my head.  You don't know, you can see my actions, but you don't know what I'm think in my head, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not unless you tell us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right and I'm trying to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Trying?  Is hard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I am yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it hard to get it out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not anymore but I'm trying to tell them what they want to hear and them the truth.  Like I don't know what else to say to them, my mom and grandma and everyone know I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They worry about you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know too much.  It's just tough because they just won't step back, you know I have my own place in the summer, everything's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't seem like anybody steps back, everybody's like —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Including your boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No he hasn't been so clingy though.  He, I don't call him, like I wait for him to call me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is how often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like once a day when he gets off work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not that bugging you incessantly —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like he was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only time he's really bugged me was like right when I broke up with him.  Like wanting to get me back, like that was hard and he called me and I'd be like, "Oh I love you dah, dah, dah, dah."  That made me cry, it was sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You told me last time you didn't believe that though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why I didn't and then when I talked to him on Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I believe he's going to change but it's going to take a while and I'm not going to just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not back in this relationship 100%, yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm still looking at other guys, like I'm not, I'm not looking for another guy, but I'm just like hanging out with people seeing what, where things go, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if I asked uh, uh, I asked [NAME OTHER] is he your boyfriend, you would say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if I ask him are you his girlfriend?  What would he tell me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably no, because I told him I just finished, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Think that's what he'd say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'd hope so because that's what I would say.  I hope he understands what I'm, I mean, I don't know, like we'll [INAUDIBLE] gave me a little dog and stuff but [INAUDIBLE] dog because, no because listen, I want a dog, he wants a dog, my house that I'm staying in the summer can have a dog.  But it could be mine for the summer and then I could just give it to him while I'm in the dorms and we'll, I know we're going to end up dating again.  It's just a matter of like when, you know what I mean?  I mean a dog is pretty serious thing, it's just I know your situation.  Your little pouty dog, cute dog.  Um, but I don't know, because we were looking at project pet last night [INAUDIBLE] really, really cute boxer in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Looks like spot, has little spots on the side.  [INAUDIBLE] but that's just a baby thing, that's not like.  We're just going to [INAUDIBLE], we're not going to make that decision until later so.  So yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, are you feeling a little dopey this morning from your Ativan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I do when I first wake up, because I wake up at 7:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] like when I get up I'm like walking kind of like that, like seriously bad and stuff and then I start like coughing a lot because the mucous in my brain and like that [INAUDIBLE] and stuff.  But not as bad as yesterday morning after I, I just want mom, I don't, I go to sleep without it I just don't need to feel like medicine, you know.  I mean if it works that cool but I don't want to take more than I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You took three last night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Isn't it 1 mg?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a lot, that worked like really well.  [INAUDIBLE] to calm me down?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> During the day?  Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I don't want to be knocked out like in the middle of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, yeah take have of one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't, she doesn't have those in my thing so like I don't, I'm not going to [INAUDIBLE], because my dad will [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking Sonata at night and Ativan?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  I don't like Sonata.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I mean it helps but I mean I did, it's fine but when I took it Saturday night with everything else, which I probably shouldn't have done at 2:00, and then I woke up at like 6:00 I think I was sick anyway.  Then I got hot and that made me throw up and like a lot or throw up, nasty, because I ate a lot right before I went to bed because I was [INAUDIBLE].  It was just not a good situation.  I mean I'll take Sonata but I'd rather take the Ativan if it works so well, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't have some of those with except for what you gave me.  So, I can't just pop an Ativan if I need to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you have any?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she dropped a little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, why um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, because she doesn't, you need to talk to her about that, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I didn't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't listen.  We talked about this several times, [INAUDIBLE].  She doesn't listen.  I told her, I told her today, because she wanted, like she had questions too, like she thinks I'm just going to go and tell you I'm fine.  Everything fine, dah, dah, dah, and like not tell you what is really going on, but I was like I'll have him give you a call and tell you what he, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know what do you want me to tell her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean if she has a question like, how much medicine should she be taking?  Should she be able to drive a car?  I guess just tell her what you think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean if you're dopey, you should drive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I'm not, like I'm not going to drive after I've taken Ativan, because I know I would be dopey.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even this morning.  You probably wouldn't want to drive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no not first thing.  But like right now I think I'd be okay, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know because you kind of act kind of drowsy.  The thing is with the cops, there like if you seem a little drowsy they're going to get, arrest you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like when I wake up a little, like maybe tonight.  Like after it's already —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of worn off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> After this kind of, what time is your test?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Five thirty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Today, what are you going to do today then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just go to the [DEIDENTIFIED] library or I just, I have a few people that are study with me.  We have, they're in my, they're in my management class.  [INAUDIBLE] and they're in my chem class, we're probably going to break up and study for accounting some and study for that some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No so on the Lamictal um, you where on the other size of the other shape of a what that would have been, when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, probably a month ago, but it was only like for two days, two or three days.  It wasn't like, because I told me mom it looked different and she's like I know they must have given, they changed the generic, they changed something at Kroger.  They gave it to me and I was like all right well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she went right away and got the other one again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you'd been on it for a few days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it wasn't like a long period of time.  Probably like a week at the most.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have, have you missed a period?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never did, but I just had one like a week ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just had —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it was normal, so you're not pregnant?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, because that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that was the first thing, when I told her that [NAME OTHER] called me pregnant —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The first thing they asked me after I threw up, "Are you pregnant?"  Like well thanks for assuming the worst.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, he doesn't even know you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It wasn't, no it wasn't wanted.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He doesn't even know you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know it was just kind of mean.  Like I said, I threw up, I'd been sick, I have the flu.  Are you pregnant?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you were throwing up because you had been drinking, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.  Like this was, no I didn't call the night after I'd been drinking.  This was Sun, Sat, Sunday morning after I took all those sleeping pills and everything on top.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The drinking thing was like a month ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which kind of started all I think, you know what I mean?  So [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your mood more even?  You notice a difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean yeah I do.  But I'm normal any other time.  I am going to battle my mom when she starts in with me.  I am going to fight back, you know?  Not fight back but like give her my opinion, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's even except when someone —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about you thoughts are they going too fast, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not if I take a breath, like think about oh I've got to do this right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you getting confused over things, like things don't seem real or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum—um, no.  I took the biology test and said econ test yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How do you think you did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The biology was 158 questions.  That was hard to like sit there for that long and answer all those questions.  But I calculated if I missed 14, I can still make an A.  But I'll either have a B+ or an A in that class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I felt okay about the final but not like, you know, oh I know I got an A.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you study for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, yeah but need to study more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about the econ, did you study for it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum, yeah I think I did well on that one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've done remarkably well consider all the difficult times you've had this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I tell my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's been a tough term for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It has but my mom, actually it's been like one of my easiest classes, not easy but the class I enjoy.  Like I enjoy [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they're not hard, they're not easy —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Classes they are hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They are hard, but I've done well, you know because I like studying.  My moms like, because the other day I came home, they made me come home and study because of everything that had happened.  The doctor said, "Take medicine," and I don't know what he said, because I didn't get to talk to him, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], and I told my mom I was like please have [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office call me, tell me when the appointment is.  I'll take care of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I will and um, so um, what was I going to say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For sleep and for anxiety in the day if you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just like have a bottle so, not, not [INAUDIBLE] can I just put it in my little blue thing and just if I need a half of one —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to be okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, uh, just if my mom would just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it weren't for your mom, I wonder where you would be sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean yeah I do to, but she's just, just so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a trade off you're right, trade off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told her the reason that, the reason I'm in the house is because she said, "Uh, if you are, if we can't get along I have three ground rules."  I mean I don't mind the ground, I can follow, no screaming, no drinking, no going to [NAME OTHER]'s house, because of his dad.  I mean I don't understand that one but I don't like go to his house anyways because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you understand why not to go to that house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah I don't want to.  It's not like you're going to punish me by saying, "Don't go to his house or else I'm going to come pick you up."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right but you just said, "I don't understand why I can't go there."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I said, "I do understand, I don't want to go anyway," like she doesn't need to make the rule because I wouldn't do it anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just be careful in that situation, you know it's, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's beyond weird.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's beyond weird, it's illegal and it's all that stuff too —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know and it's uh, I guarantee it's he's still under surveillance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he is.  [INAUDIBLE] find a job, which is a good job [INAUDIBLE].  He's an architect and [INAUDIBLE] library over there —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like I say he's still under surveillance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure they're watching him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sure they are.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] I mean he, he's a nice guy like he's was never, never threatening to me which [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I don't know but, I mean I thought I understood why.  Just I would walk in the room, he has this little chair, they have their main room and this chair that he sits in and watches TV.  He'll like fall asleep there until he goes to his room, everytime I would walk in to the room like, "Hey [PATIENT NAME]," and then like get up and leave or sometime like [NAME OTHER] would go back to his bathroom and bedroom to change or something and I would sit on the couch and he was in that chair.  He wouldn't talk to me, he would just like watch TV and [NAME OTHER] would come in and we'd get up and leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what else I can do but I don't care [INAUDIBLE].</p>

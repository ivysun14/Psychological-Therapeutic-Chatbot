<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's just basically at night time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. Is there anything, when you say you feel like is it the TV watching you or is it, do you feel like they're talking about you or making references and stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I believe it's talking about me.  Especially the local news and stuff like that.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just, sometimes I get so paranoid and just think that everybody wants me.  It just calms me down for a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now have you been contacting your mom when you're having this paranoia and panic feeling or-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Every now and then, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been better at trying to leave her out of it because of her nerves?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Okay.  No, any suicidal thoughts?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Who, me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.  God no.  I got too much to live for.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay.  And during the day do you have much anxiety?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What does that mean?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just nervousness?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, the nervousness is not bad, it's just paranoia. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just paranoia.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  What's the president of the United States and I don't know, I just, it's the same old thing.  I watch a lot of news, CNN news, all day long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know.  That bothers me a little bit, but not too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So it's not really feeling sad and depressed or fearful?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, just that paranoid feeling.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do they mention you on TV, or what-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.  It's just, it's just the sort of thing that just bothers me, like the other day on, that guy on Channel 12 news that killed that guy that was on the news?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I felt like they've been mocking me and all this stuff and you know, I just think he should be in jail.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely. They let him out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But how are you relating that to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I just, I just, I don't know.  I feel like they've been messing with my head or something all this time and especially morning time.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the mornings, what happens in the mornings?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just, I lay in bed and watch them and they're talking all this junk, [NAME OTHER] and all them and I used to date a girl named [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] I can't think of her name though on Channel 12 in the morning time.  [NAME OTHER] and she was a nice girl and just, you know, it makes me paranoid.  I get a little paranoid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  Now when you, do you spend much time out of your house?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not much, okay. So...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Unless I go over to my mother and take her a sub sandwich or something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Now when you go in to buy the sub sandwich you have to interact with other people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is that experience?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's fine.  That's fine.  I enjoy that.  I love that.  I wish I could get around more people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well what keeps you from getting around more people?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, it just, I'm just, I'm too uncomfortable.  Too uncomfortable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does, like social situations, when you're around people you don't know make you uncomfortable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  How about that guy, that sheriff that was shot in the face?  I had cops all over my lawn around my condo.  He went to the Catholic church right up there beside where I live.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They had sheriffs and all that all over the place and [NAME OTHER] came over there.  I don't know if it was the last time I saw you or not but [NAME OTHER] came over and she got up on the balcony and she had a black thing around her neck telling me she's going to hang herself so I called [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER]'s wife.  She called the sheriff, the sheriff came over there and told her to leave and you know they thought they had a warrant on her arrest and my brother came over there and he got, he's driving a tractor trailer now.  He's coming back from [DEIDENTIFIED] right now. But the sheriff said, told [NAME OTHER] that we did have a warrant on her, to call her up and tell her if she comes over and I give her a hundred dollars to get out of my life apparently. So she came back over and there was two sheriffs up on the hill and then he came to the door and said that we don't have a warrant on her but she came anyways and all.  I haven't seen her since then.  That was kind of a mess.  Then I had somebody come in and clean my house the other day.  I've got this little bitty Maltese dog you know.  All her teeth got rotten and I had to take every one of them out and [NAME OTHER] had her before I did and she won't eat nothing but human food and her teeth were all just rotten and I had to take every one of her teeth out and it's impossible to put any weight on her and somebody told her that I was abusing the dog and another sheriff came over about a week ago and took a picture of the dog and he called my mother and she called the vet and the vet called the, the sheriff called the vet and he said this case is closed, he says this is ridiculous.  Then the veterinarian told them how good I've treated that dog.  I get her groomed all the time and she just, she won't eat nothing, but Kentucky Fried Chicken. She loves Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Kentucky Fried Chicken and ham.  Some of these [DEIDENTIFIED] dog food but I love my little dog.  Somebody said that I was mistreating that dog.  It was ridiculous, ridiculous.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why do you think they would have said that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I don't know.  I think it was the girl that came in and cleaned my house that one day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because you can't put no weight on that dog, there's no way. She's lucky to be alive this long.  She really is.  She's lucky to be alive this long.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well now when you go out to Kmart. That's a fairly crowded place.  What does that feel like walking around in there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Don't bother me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Doesn't bother you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So awhile back, it may have been a couple years ago, you used to think when you were in those places that people were staring at you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And thinking things or they could read your mind.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you having any of those kinds-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do feel, I feel like they can read my mind sometimes and that really upsets me.  I do, I feel like people read my mind, that bothers me.  I mean that would bother anybody.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That makes me nuts when I think somebody can read my mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Is that a feeling you get very often in public when you're around other people?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really, but it's basically when I'm at home watching TV.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who will be reading your mind when you're at home watching TV?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The president of the United States.  Some of the bigger people of the country.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is it that they could actually come into your home and read your mind through some device, or-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  It's like my brother called me one time and said the government's tracing a lot of people's calls and said don't worry about it [PATIENT NAME] and I don't know what he meant by that.  And he's always talking about there's two, two and a half billion Chinese that don't give a dang about you and don't worry about them and I don't know what he means by that but that makes me paranoid.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two billion Chinese that don't care about you, but that makes me a little paranoid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now what are you eating during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hot dogs.  I've got some cheeseburgers that I've made.  I've got ham, I've got bologna, I've got Lean Cuisines, I got spaghetti Lean Cuisines and chicken fettuccine Lean Cuisines.  Stuff like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're doing all your own grocery shopping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.  Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it bother you to be in the grocery store?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, no, no.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  These symptoms are really a problem more at home right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is, it is, it is.  It really is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you find that when you go out of the house, get out and go places that-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was going bowling pretty regularly there for awhile and I got a 210 the other day and as soon as I walk in, a bunch of blacks, they were wearing [DEIDENTIFIED] sweat shirts or something like that and that bothers me a little bit. Because that's where my [INAUDIBLE] come from, [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] is right above [DEIDENTIFIED].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, why do you think that would have anything to do with it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know but I swear I think, my next door neighbor, [NAME OTHER].  She's got a baby from a black guy and it don't bother me or nothing like that but the blacks, I don't know.  I feel like the blacks are I don't know.  I just feel like it's all about the blacks and all.  To be treating them decently.  I don't know.  It's like the blacks, when I watch TV, there's a guy named [NAME OTHER] that's on the CNN news, a woman named [NAME OTHER] or something and stuff like that and those things make me paranoid.  I don't know because when I  grew up in [DEIDENTIFIED] some of my closest friends were black people.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Playing football in [DEIDENTIFIED] that's where my lived at too cause everything was one school [INAUDIBLE] bus [INAUDIBLE] to [DEIDENTIFIED] which was in the middle of downtown [DEIDENTIFIED] where it's just like the middle of a black town, [DEIDENTIFIED], you know.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well now you are, you're still taking your three Depakote at night right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And your Klonopin, you're taking that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twice a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Twice a day.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twice a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Okay.  Let's see.  The Geodon, are you taking that with the food?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's what you said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.  Definitely take it with food.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're taking 180 mg in the morning...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At day and night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And two at night...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's a total of 240.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think because this morning I woke up, I went and weighed 280 pounds on my scale at home.  I've been drinking a whole bunch of fluids today.  All I've had is a ham sandwich.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many, how much Pepsi do you drink a day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A pretty good bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A liter?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At least a liter, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A liter of Pepsi.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A liter. When I appeared on [DEIDENTIFIED] family physician. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was really nervous and shaky and everything and he said, how much caffeine do you drink and I said I drink a lot of it.  Because [PHYSICIAN NAME] when I'm watching TV, if I'm not constantly drinking something I feel like people are watching me and I've got to be doing something, constantly drinking Diet Pepsi or Diet Mountain Dew or Diet 7-Up or something like that.  Diet Coke or anything to keep busy and all.  It's like my poor mom, she's got near Alzheimer's and all and she does puzzles constantly trying to keep her mind sharp.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Today is her hair day.  She gets her hair done right up the street.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I'm thinking, are you doing any running?  Remember you used to-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My knees [PHYSICIAN NAME].  It's [INAUDIBLE] Do you hear it pop?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That bone on bone.  I've done so much exercise in my lifetime.  I went for a long walk yesterday up by [DEIDENTIFIED] and came down the hill and up by the Catholic church and came around and came back down my condo.  And my knees were fine then but a lot of times when I move my leg it pops and all. I've been exercising so much, there's no way I can run.  I mean, if I could I'd be running now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I went looking at them treadmills and the thing costs about two or three thousand dollars [PHYSICIAN NAME].  I guess you know that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of course I didn't know that my sister's got one and I went and looked at one.  I was trying, I wanted to get one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's not any cheaper?  Like maybe twelve hundred or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  Maybe, maybe at Sears or something like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Try the sports place.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where's that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] may have them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or there's another [DEIDENTIFIED] over there by Best Buy. Besides Best Buy, they have them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, that's where I bought my football jersey. Yeah, I know where you're talking about.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Now when you were at your primary care did they check your blood pressure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Let me check...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wait, primary care or [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They both check my blood pressure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was it okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Yeah.  It was fine.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, let's see what we get here. Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What do I do? Fill this out and then bring it back the next time?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I've got some educational literature I want to give you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, 129/82.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's about what it normally is?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't even know what the blood pressure should be?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, that's pretty good right there.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I think we are going to go ahead and stay on your current medications.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And we're not going to change anything at this point.  Just make sure that you keep taking that Geodon with food...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Otherwise you lose half of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?  I will see you in about two weeks, you'll be fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Thank you.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Interview 14. Interview 14.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [They did] (PH) all this work, it cost me 70 bucks. Which I sort of expect some cost, but it's really-then he comes out and says, "Your rear right tires slashed" you know "You should put [on a new] (PH) tire." I said, "You got to be kidding me, it's only about 20,000 miles [on it] (PH)." I was so mad when I left there. 0:00:25.3</p>

<p>Anyway, other than that everything's fine. Really. I (inaudible at 0:00:31.6) since Tuesday I felt really good. Tuesday night I got drunk. I was supposed to go to something for [field] (PH) work and I got very irresponsible and I didn't go. And I just to say hello to this bartender of mine, friend of mine. And ended up staying there for about three hours and got wiped out. It wasn't too bad. I don't think it was out of depression anymore. It just sort of - I felt really good-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't find yourself like with (inaudible at 0:01:06.4) feelings and choked up sadness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (inaudible at 0:01:12.0) like, I felt really good after [we] (PH) talked Tuesday. I don't know if it was, you know, what we said or just talking. (Inaudible at 0:01:21.5) sort of good about (inaudible). And I came home drunk and Daisy, my roommate, was up. We started talking and I guess I came to another sort of conclusion about being depressed. And, you know, I guess I felt like I really resented-as we talked, her mother died when she was 12 or 13, something like that. And she felt like she's never really worked though that (inaudible at 0:01:49.5). and it's all of a sudden sort of dawned on me that I really resented the fact that I couldn't talk to my mom and dad about what I had just been though. Like it was a real crisis kind of thing and I couldn't say anything to them. And I really, really resent it. 0:02:06.5</p>

<p>So anyway, we cried for awhile (laughter) (inaudible at 0:02:09.8). The fact that she felt, you know, like she hadn't been able to say something to her mother, you know, when her mother died (inaudible at 0:02:15.4)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never established that kind of relationship with yours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Feeling] (PH) missed opportunities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it was like I, it just really kind of dawned on me how she felt about her mother dying when she did, you know. And I guess I don't understand death because I've never really faced it. But it was like a really weird thing to really identify that it's like my mother and father almost died because I can't tell them this. 0:02:40.7</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you just kind of for all (inaudible at 0:02:44.2) and purposes in this crisis they were dead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. And I guess I felt really bad about it. It was almost like a release though of the depression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds kind of like it was really bad that you couldn't share with your parents because it was [a nice] (PH) thing in the shared ness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling (inaudible at 0:03:05.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was nice. It was really nice. I guess maybe I feel closer to her than I ever have felt. That she was able to share something with me also that she's never really been able to share with anybody. But she didn't really know how to either, you know. And it was like a revelation almost to be able to share it with someone. [I never really] (PH) me really feel like I understood it. Now I really feel like I do. 0:03:34.9</p>

<p>And it was also, you know, just the thing about like Charlotte sort of felt like a lot of the depression I had may be built around not having been able to say a thing to them. But it was also relieving to get it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, kind of there was a, like you couldn't say anything to them (inaudible at 0:03:55.7) and recognizing, feeling the sadness that you [couldn't] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well recognizing that, you know, at least perhaps that had something to do with being so terribly depressed, you know. And it was really, I mean, kind of good to get that out. And then, yeah. Like, I've felt a hell of a lot better since then, I think. I haven't been really depressed at all since then. I haven't had any, any bad feelings. And, you know, it just sort of felt like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It actually] (PH) is a (inaudible at 0:04:29.1) great day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [Pretty] (PH) much. And it just seemed that that helped work it though, sort of like an unfinished part of it in recognizing that. It was really good. 0:04:42.5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you been having any kinds of feelings of like, [I don't know] (PH), like maybe you're guilty, or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I haven't felt guilty at all. I haven't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:04:52.7) think about the abortion much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like you're back to [regular] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, I, you know, I feel perfectly fine about it, like a crisis is over. You know occasionally I think about it as that kind of think is "wow." And the thing is people don't know what I've been through. And in a way it's kind of a good feeling in the sense that I'm almost-what have all these other people, you know, been through that they aren't able to share, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Kind of like (inaudible at 0:05:27.3) gone through a life experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess, you know, it's like, well the way Ann [told] (PH) me, every once in awhile it's like, I've never been through a crisis like that, I don't think. I don't think I've ever been through anything as traumatic, you know, just sort of really big, as that. And I sort of sometimes amazed at wow, I just did it, you know. And I don't feel too bad. I don't feel bad at all. Even, you know, as it comes to me (inaudible at 0:05:57.8).</p>

<p>In fact, kind of when I (inaudible at 0:06:05.9) I guess and sort of another kind of recognition that that's done and over with and really isn't carrying any more of an aftermath. Wednesday when I went out to [Albany] (PH) I met Gary. We were going to meet early and he was really concerned, you know how I was feeling. And he called Monday or Tuesday or something like that. So it was Monday maybe. And you know I had said, "Yeah, I'm OK, you know, I'm sort of depressed a little." I just said, "I'm not sure what it's all about, but I'm really pretty much OK." And so we kind of arranged to get together Wednesday about seven, you know, just kind of be together for awhile. 0:06:55.3</p>

<p>Well I got there and-he's co-working with a couple, with a school social worker who I know (inaudible at 0:07:06.8). I really like her. We like-I sort of wish I'd been able to get to know her better because the three of us really have a good time together, you know. But anyway, we went out to, they hadn't eaten so we went out and had a bottle of wine together, you know. It was really, really fun. And you know he was sort of concerned whether I was OK. And I said, "Yeah." And this was (inaudible at 0:07:26.8). And it was just a really-I just felt so much happier than I had for awhile. And spending time with people that I really enjoy. And it was like I was able to really enjoy them. 0:07:39.6</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And just be able to be there have a really nice time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What came up a lot, and I'm not sure how I look at it, was the idea that, of leaving, you know, and separation kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling of sadness like, I sensed that when you were saying like, "I wish I (inaudible at 0:08:01.0)."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Missed opportunities in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of yeah. Well I'm not out there enough too really to have gotten to know her well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but kind of knowing, feeling like the kind of possibility that (inaudible at 0:08:18.2) was really made real.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she's leaving also. And Gary was kind of (inaudible at 0:08:26.5) the fact of loosing his two women, you know. They're out there. And it just started to dawn on me that I'm really not sad about leaving school. You know, like the people that I'm close to are scattering too. I'm not close to that many. But this is one person, Gary particularly that I'm really leaving. And I'm really not sure how to deal with it at all.0:08:54.2</p>

<p>You know, like leaving college wasn't so bad, everybody was leaving. And I just sort of left it at that, well I know I'll see those people I care about. So it wasn't no big hassle. And I recognized that even though you see those people relationships often change just as being separated for a long time. And I'm, you know, even now I feel sort of, I guess sad, you know, I'm not sure how I deal with it. 0:09:18.8</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:09:20.5) you say you feel sad, but when you say how you deal with it you (inaudible) see him or whatever (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You know, I can say, "Wow, it's really sad to think of leaving." That's the only place that a tie means anything. And [no one] (PH) else goes with it, you know. I don't know if it's like, you know, really concluding a friendship that's meant a great deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. (Inaudible at 0:09:50.0).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:09:53.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess I look at it as it is doing that and I really just (inaudible at 0:10:01.7). You know, I'm sure we'll keep in touch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but as you're saying this it's kind of like the end of (inaudible at 0:10:09.1) relationship, I mean (inaudible) relationship but (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I mean we certainly can't get any closer being separated. And I just sort of, I really feel, I guess I really feel bad. Yeah, part of just the working relationship we have and just the caring relationship. And it's just a really nice thing that I, you know. Like Wednesday we started to talk about getting together before Sue and I leave. And, you know, going out and really having a good time. And (inaudible at 0:10:52.4) the training group thing and one of the girls said, "Let's have, how about having the last one at my house and we can have dinner and all." You know, like there was another termination kind of thing. I'm like, "Yeah, that sounds great." And that was another thing to deal with. And then like, I'm having this overnight with this group of girls that we just [ended] (PH) the group, so all these things are starting to pile up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like all these (inaudible at 0:11:20.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's just sort of a-I guess I'm just sort of, I guess I'm just more conscious of, maybe conscious of terminating than I ever have been before, maybe as a result of teaching crap. (Inaudible at 0:11:35.2) much more aware.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. You have, maybe having more (inaudible at 0:11:39.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That could be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:11:44.8) coming together more at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I really - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean (inaudible at 0:11:53.7) or not. I hadn't really thought about (inaudible at 0:11:58.1) as you were talking I started thinking</p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:12:00.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) (inaudible at 0:12:04.3) did that. but that's all-you know, like I guess as I was walking over here today it was really kind of nice, I wasn't worried about the fact that I have absolutely nothing to say. But I really just feel sort of good today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And feel very relaxed about, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really-of course I'm half asleep too probably. (Inaudible at 0:12:27.2) been up. But I didn't feel bad about coming in and not really having much on my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's, you know, that makes me feel good to know that you know you can feel comfortable about coming in here and not feel that you have (inaudible at 0:12:41.1) or have something important, you know. You see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well and I guess I realize it too that, you know, it finally dawned on me, "I don't have anything to say today." And before, well particularly before the pregnancy abortion thing came up, where there was really something to-it always felt sort of uncomfortable if I didn't have anything on my mind. And it just dawned on me, when I was almost all the way here, but I didn't feel bad about it all. I was just sort of comfortable about. And then I just sort of felt, "Oh well, something will either come up or it won't."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like the feeling like just feeling relaxed about being that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:13:25.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It makes me think that-I don't know what I just thought-it makes me think I'm much more relaxed. You know, sort of after having been through this big huge crisis thing, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the sadness afterwards. It's kind of like coming back to life, but life looks a whole lot better than it did before you (inaudible at 0:13:53.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I, you know, I sort of feel like just sort of more relaxed about life in general and what may be ahead. Like it isn't so-I don't know how often it hits me as being overwhelming anyway. But like particularly today, you know, I'm just feel sort of relaxed and I feel like I've really done work this week. Like I'm really getting this paper, hopefully, out of the way, and anticipating training (inaudible at 0:14:26.4) Wednesday night. I'm sort of prepared. Not as well as I would probably like to be. Didn't bug me that much at all and I just sort of, yeah, you know, just go with it. And it, you know, turned out all right. And I was just, you know, I guess it's-since Tuesday, you know, I've just been much more relaxed. And it feels sort of good. 0:15:00.8</p>

<p>I was just thinking of the fact that I'm going to my folk's house this weekend. And until this very second I guess I hadn't thought (inaudible at 0:15:11.4). You know, I'm thinking about things that worry me or anticipate kind of. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I heard you say that your roles have changed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I am or not, you know. I guess I really won't know unless I feel like I get there and I'm irritated. Like my mother called Monday, Monday, (inaudible at 0:15:36.1) Monday. At any rate, I didn't know what she was saying. She knew I was coming and she wanted me to go to church with her, you know. And she's sort of demanding it. And I said, "Look, I have a paper that has to be in that Monday coming up and I have to have it in." I said, "There's a shower, you know, for Jillian going on Sunday afternoon." She said "Well you can do this much for your mother" kind of thing. And I said, "Look, I'll go if I can. If I can't I'm not." And I really - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You got irritated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really did. And I was very, very short. She really just made me angry, like, she had absolutely no right to make any kind of demand on me. I have enough things to worry about. And I don't know whether I'm going to feel that way, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You kind of (inaudible at 0:16:27.5) the thought of like having (inaudible) knowing that she can bring out that anger and irritation (inaudible). It doesn't feel good when it happens like that, the feeling and that (inaudible) for a weekend of this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well I can deal with her most of the time, you know. I guess what I'm sort of wondering-and I don't know because I haven't thought about it at all-whether the kind of realization I made Tuesday night when Daisy and I were talking, you know, had an influence on just total kind of attitude I have toward them from now on, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a bad way or in a good way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess I didn't give-probably be more of a negative kind of thing than a positive one. But I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, kind of like, sounds like (inaudible at 0:17:23.0) mom and dad (inaudible). But I guess, you know, the thing I was kind of thinking like when you were talking about [having with] (PH) Daisy is being able to kind of say, "Isn't it sad" you're feeling a real loss that you can't relate to your parents just like she's (inaudible at 0:17:42.1) can't relate to her mother. You're feeling sadness about the kind of (inaudible at 0:17:46.5) and that's the (inaudible) of the situation. You see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except I think like Tuesday night even though I was drunk-I'm usually, it's really weird because usually when I'm drunk I don't remember a whole lot of what I say. And I was really; I hadn't had anything to drink for three weeks (laughter). Anything I had hit me like a lead balloon. But I really felt like I resented it, you know. I don't think that I've ever - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Resented them for not being able to be people who you could talk to about something like this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And I guess the thoughts that are sort of, you know, just sort of beginning to - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like your mother can demand you go to a shower but, you know, you can't really demand that she was being concerned and accept you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just would, you know, sort of like I refuse to accept that kind of demand, you know. Wow I just thought of something else too, that some of the things that I have to talk to them about are around Don and I getting married in September, you know. And I have decided that anything that ever-anything around getting married that becomes a hassle just gets left out. (Laughter). If it means I won't be there I just won't go because I just refuse to go through a hassle about the whole thing. 0:19:07.9</p>

<p>And I, you know, I don't know, you know, how well - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your wedding will probably be different than the other (inaudible at 0:19:16.1) that lasted.</p>

<p>(Laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But go on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. But I sort of just resent the thought of-I guess I'm beginning to resent the thought of even having to deal with them this weekend. That I have to ask them what they're willing to pay for for a wedding that I plan to plan. And not all the plans that I intent are ones that are completely - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:19:47.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think they'll accept most of them. I don't, you know, but I begin to resent the fact that they even have any right to demand anything from me anymore, you know. And I don't know if this, you know, these are things that are just coming through my mind right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but it is kind of like the thought of having to sit there and negotiate (inaudible at 0:20:08.7), kind of resenting that you have to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's not so much having to do that except that even though I've always not been able to say some thing to my parents, about what I'm doing with my life and all, I still felt fairly close, fairly open to them, you know, compared to other children and their parent kind of relationships. But now all of a sudden, you know, I've really lost something out of that relationship. And at least the feeling I have right this minute is, you know, resentment and one of like "You have no right to ask anything of me any more because you've lost that right because you couldn't hear me, you couldn't, you know, hear something I had to say." And I, wow, I haven't thought about this since like Tuesday. It's really becoming kind of frightening as I talk about it, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which part's becoming frightening? The actual being there or what it all means?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What it all means, not just going there but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of what it all means (inaudible at 0:21:22.7) your relationship, how you relate, your attitude.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I'm, you know, sort of feeling inside, you know, like it's recreating this loss of my parents almost. And it's, I guess, it's really, you know, just the whole thing of finding out that I was pregnant, you know. And the real bummer about it all was that what in the hell would I say to my folks, you know. Like right from the very beginning of the crisis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is what, that was like one of the big things that showed its ugly head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it really did. And, you know, it always, you know when I was younger and I had friends or people I knew in high school, you know, they would become pregnant or something would happen. And, you know, I would always pride myself that that wouldn't happen to me, you know, kind of thing. And then I also recognized in, you know, even in projecting it (inaudible at 0:22:26.9) possible. Wow, what would I do about my folks, you know. And it was always the recognition that if I was, if I had to tell them that, that they wouldn't reject me, but wow, what a blow, you know. And now I feel like I hadn't shared that at and I can't. And I, I don't know if it's even hate, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but yeah, maybe it's-pain's not the right word. I'm trying to figure (inaudible at 0:22:58.4) a sadness and disappointment that you can't or couldn't, you know, and kind of a resentment that, jeez the first thing in all that crisis was, "what am I going to say to my parents?" and it has to be that way, or had to be that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The disappointment thing, it's really, it's ironic almost. It would be so disappointing to have to tell the, you know. And now I'm recognizing what a disappointment they are to me because I can't - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you can't. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really is. And the same is true, like I could never tell my brothers, but the feeling isn't the same. And like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow parents are somebody you feel you can talk about thing that seem important to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm beginning to think even now, you know, I'm not sure why-maybe it's because it's perhaps the biggest crisis I've really ever faced. But there's lots of things I've done, you know, lots of things I do in my life that I can't tell them about. And it hasn't bothered-you know, like I remember lying in high school about the things I was doing. I didn't want to hurt them. They couldn't deal with it kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they didn't feel like, they didn't have big meanings for you then because I guess you weren't so big [in a way] (PH). Like they didn't have all these [implication] (PH) like [that lie] (PH). You know the disappointed ness that you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well they, they weren't the kind of thing that I guess I needed then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Yeah, it's like you could handle it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And this has been the kind of experience where I sure as hell - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It's] (PH) good to share.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sure as hell needed them or, you know, it would have been nice if I could have gone to them, I mean probably been a lot easier, or at least very helpful. And I couldn't go to them in a time of need, a time of personal, emotional, psychological need. You know like I know I can go to them with an economic need.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but when you're really down and really hurting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like their values and expectations are just getting [where they] (PH) may be able to respond to you, just like the mother (inaudible at 0:25:28.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. it just, you know, it also occurred to me that I can probably go there this weekend or anytime and be all right, you know, in a sort of act kind of way, as long as I don't think about it. And the resentment and bitterness probably comes out only when I allow myself to think about it when I'm there. Or perhaps if demands start to [throw] (PH) around, you know. And I, I don't know. That's just sort of an immediate kind of feeling about-it's always been hard for me when anybody makes a demand on me to accept it, you know. I don't like being told what to do. 0:26:14.3</p>

<p>You know in that kind of situation made me irritable much easier. I don't know. I guess it's-it seems to me funny that, you know, that I hadn't really considered, you know, all this until now (inaudible at 0:26:40.9). You know, I thought of more the fact that I can do my own laundry and get my paper finished. I can go bike riding; my mom's got a bike. I really hadn't thought about my parents being there at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Just] (PH) the things you can do there (inaudible at 0:27:00.8) there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [it] (PH) was funny [is] (PH) I say this-that's often true. You know, that I go there because they want to see me. And they are functional in the sense of - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Having things] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make you feel bad? Like that you just really don't feel the really wanting to see them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because I think I've wanted to see them before, you know. I think that the negative side of it, using them, taking advantage of them, comes out to me now. But I've gone there and I've, you know, it's nice to spend a day with them. I couldn't live there. I mean I care about them, but now I look at the negative side of it in terms of just the function they serve, you know. 0:27:50.3</p>

<p>And I don't-no, I guess it, I don't think it bothers me. I sort of feel like that's what they're there for right now. They haven't-I guess some of this brings out thoughts of, you know, the thing about my dad always having been sort of [outside] (PH) and never having really spend time as a father with the family, you know. and I've always, I think I've always thought my mother is too emotional or almost down, like she's always been a good mother for functional things. And feeling wise, really deep feeling wise, I think like, cut me short in my developing feelings, you know, as well as just not being able to take them from [them] (PH). 0:29:01.3</p>

<p>I'm not sure why I feel that way because I'm also remembering times when, you know, she was really blue and she could talk to me about it, you know. Or I kind of feel like there was an emptiness there too, something about, something about the relationship I've always had with my folks as being sort of empty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just not a very kind of, you know, (inaudible at 0:29:27.7) kind of relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot I guess is the contractual function.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I sort of feel right now like-or think that it was never really a full reaching out and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of inside people from one to the inside of another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess this experience where I really wanted to be able-you know, and part of it's I've never, I don't think I've ever had that - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Basis] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, had to have that. Where I really had to have it really brings out the reality of it. It was lacking something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it brings out the reality of not having it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. It really does. Hmm. And the relationship I had with my brother is similar, you know. I'm not very close to [them] (PH), for probably a lot of reasons. But I think of my older brother, who I could go to with any kind of a problem, like needing money, needing his bodily, physical help to do something, you know. But I don't know him emotionally, at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Really don't] (PH) (inaudible at 0:31:05.8) just don't really know what he's like as a person (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I like him, you know. And he's a really nice guy. And he's, you know, pretty sensitive to wanting to help people and do things. And like he and I politically, you know, are pretty opposite, but he listens. You know, he'll listen to what I have to say. My other brother doesn't always listen. But there's not emotional, really feeling relationship, and perhaps about that much more with my other brother, but not much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's kind of like, it's caring, but it's not like a really [gusty] (PH) kind of emotional thing between you and (inaudible at 0:31:57.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's funny [is] (PH) I always think of the things they have done for me, you know being the youngest, like helping me move and really going out of the way to do things like that. And I thought gee it's almost impossible to think of how I could ever repay them. But it was in terms of repayment, you know. And like, there's no reason why I should have to feel that way, or that any of us should have to feel if we give we have to repay, or if we take we have to repay it. But that, you know, like part of the whole structure of my upbringing, you know. When I was in college and I-my mother used bitch about the fact that roommates or something I would do, you know, wasn't repaid to me. And I came out of that expecting people, you know, if I gave you gave me something in return. And I still do that. I don't know if it's quite as much, but I still do it a lot. 0:33:03.2</p>

<p>And just overlooking the-doing it because you love or care or feel, you know. Well I've known that. I guess I just sort of [have battling] (PH) about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's kind of, it's hitting you like just seeing it is (inaudible at 0:33:21.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think what, I think I said it before to myself, you know, a lot of different ways, I'm adding it to the feeling I had on Tuesday, you know, that sort of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that sad feeling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the loss and the resentment. And it makes me resent them more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and it all kind of comes together like, you know, like maybe (inaudible at 0:33:45.6) your brothers (inaudible). But with the feeling on Tuesday [the same] (PH) it took on more meaning in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you know what it meant. You know that it meant not to feel (inaudible at 0:34:03.0) for not having that. And the resentment too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it makes me angry now, you know. Not the sadness of not being able to tell them about my experience, but I'm beginning to feel anger about them not being feeling people. And just really angry, you know, it really makes me made. And I'm thinking now, what the hell my father-I don't know where he's at at all. You know, like I remember growing up and him giving a great deal of his time to the church, you know. And I wonder if he's unfeeling or, you know, where he is in relation to the people he deals with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, you [you're sitting here kind of feeling bad] (PH). Where the hell is he? Does he feel anger?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know does he feel the people he deals with as a minister? And I sort of think of, when I was over at their house a couple weeks ago I told them I was going to get married. After a couple minutes of conversation my father said-I don't know if I told you this-he said something about, you know, "Well we're happy. We hope you'll be very happy" or something like that. Like a minister talking to - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You felt] (PH) like it was a speech.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like a real (inaudible at 0:35:31.6) to say that to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like he was talking to you like he was talking to two people he was going to marry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I-you know like it was - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he going to marry you, by the way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he and another man that Don and I work with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but it's the kind of feeling (inaudible at 0:35:52.7) kind of I'm his daughter and I'm just, you know, like - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a-talking to me just like he'd talk to anybody, like a speech.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know, I just-there's something else I was going to say and I lost it. But, it was really-at least my mother said, "Gee, I'm glad I'm sitting down" you know which was a real emotional response for her because I'm not so sure how happy she is, but like she could say that. My dad couldn't say-you know I don't know if he's really happy or not.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk).</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - big deal whether he's happy or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know if he feels anything. Like I've seen him emit emotions when his father died and when his mother died. And I can't think of any other time in my life I've ever really felt emotion or anything, you know, from him. You know it was always-like when I was little I went to him when I did something wrong because he was rational.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he didn't yell at you or anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he could deal with it. Yeah. Oh wow, that's just really funny. I remember once, you know, like he looked me in the bathroom because I called my brother a jackass. But I don't even remember him being really angry about it. It was just that I had said a swear word, that was unacceptable to him, you know. So I had to, you know, be punished for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:37:33.9) very rational (inaudible) you don't remember him getting [serious] (PH). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't remember him getting mad. I-that's really funny. And my mother-excuses me-you know gets emotional (inaudible at 0:37:55.3). How, how does she do that? I'm thinking she gets emotional for herself. I don't know if she has any feeling - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Emotion [towards] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when it comes to someone else. Although I guess I really know she really cared a lot about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like you can know the caring, but it's not-you can't touch it in tangible terms or express it [to her] (PH), you [got to] (PH) express (crosstalk) emotional.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm sort of thinking I don't know how, but it's like, you know, I know she loves me, like a really lots, you know. But it's almost like the love is for herself to love me, but it doesn't really come across to me as giving or sharing. Maybe it's like a duty that she has-I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I [see, meaning] (PH) she loves herself [by] (PH) loving you. Is that what you're saying? [She] (PH) does it as a duty and makes her feel good but it's not like it goes straight to you. It's for her rather than - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I think that's what I'm saying. I'm not sure that's the thing. But there's something, there's something like a wall. I guess what it really is now is, you know, just the fact that I, I've run into a loss with them. But I've sort of known it's there, but it really becomes apparent when I needed - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) you can see it. You can see the wall and you want there to be no wall. It's kind of like when you really look to them, it's like you usually [don't feel the wall] (PH) except when you really look to them. And they're (inaudible at 0:39:56.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I was kind of just now thinking, kind of comparison of where Don's parents are at. And you know, they like treated him kind of shitty. Can I have a cigarette? Sometimes out of our sort of different functional way because their poverty, you know, they (inaudible at 0:40:30.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Thank you. Not always intentionally, but I sort of think that Don's dad loves him a great deal, but looks up to him and expects him to make it. When Don doesn't have a penny to his name his dad will give money to his other brother because he just has this thing that Don is going to make. 0:40:56.2</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don can do it for himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like he really gets the raw end of the deal. His mother loves his other brother more and it's very obviously to the whole family, and it's, you know, [a] (PH) really cruddy thing, and like he really gets cut short too. And I was also thinking on the other hand though, like we could have told them I was pregnant. And maybe even told them-it'd more like to be able to tell them that I was also going to have an abortion. And it would, you know. And it's like the life experiences they've been through gives them a better acceptance, you know, of somewhat unacceptably social things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [It's in your life] (PH).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But on the other hand there's also that, you know kind of gap or lack of something that should be there for Don, you know, in the relationship with his folks. I don't know why I started to compare that. I don't know if I thought there would-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like, you mean, kind of [see it] (PH). It's kind of like they're not so good to me either, but it comes for other reasons (inaudible at 0:42:16.3) it's kind of the end result for something [similar] (PH). 0:42:20.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I anticipate there's almost going to be a wall between me and them because, well for one thing I'm white and they're not. and for another thing, like I know they don't like me, kind of respect me. I don't know how much-I don't know if I can love them I guess it really comes down. I start to, you know, think of resenting my parents more because I don't think I can love anybody. I've been able to love Don and that was even (inaudible at 0:42:58.4), you know. Like when I really discovered that I loved him I was crying and it was really upsetting to me, in a good and a bad way. I don't know. It was like really frightening I guess. 0:43:12.2</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:43:13.3) scared about it too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like a thing I felt. And I've always felt that, you know, it's like I don't think I can love anybody else, or at least any other man, in the way that I love him. And I've always thought that-and, you know, I don't know if this is true or not it's always kind of been a thought of mine. I just don't have very much love to give. And now I'm beginning to feel like blaming it on my parents because I don't know if they ever-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:43:47.5) responded to you (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well they must've, Scott. I feel like the person I am, you know, and the sensitivity I have-although I'm not always very satisfied with it-you know, has to have come out of love. You'd think anyway. It's just that I, now I see a real; I guess I see a gap in that. And like all of the negative things about me, you know, that I don't like, that we've talked about. I really blame them on my mother and father.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm wondering, you know, like you can really see how it came (inaudible at 0:44:26.6) but, you know, and blame it on them but [where does it] (PH) get you? You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't get me any place. It doesn't help. It doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. What I'm saying is you can understand that you blame [it on them] (PH) maybe the blame feels good for awhile or something, but it-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you maybe (inaudible at 0:44:51.7) accepted too. I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. that's kind of a good thing to say though, you know, that (inaudible at 0:44:58.5) change it because-and I'm thinking about when I first came here-I think I've recognized that I've blamed them for a lot of the faults I have, for a lot of the inadequacies I have. And I guess I thought that there was a way of changing it as a result of really blaming them or sort of exercising or something. And there really isn't, you know, there really isn't. OK, I guess I recognize it and that's fine. That doesn't do much else except allow that, you know, recognition. 0:45:43.</p>

<p>you know I don't, I don't think I'm probably, I'm, you know, sort of thinking about what I was saying. Maybe, you know, like what we're saying now helps in a sense of not having to carry the resentment, the sadness of Tuesday and all that that comes out, not having-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:46:11.3) this weekend, it's kind of-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or into the future.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like you know it, but it's kind of like, it's like beating (inaudible at 0:46:21.1) a dead horse (inaudible) image. You know, like it's made things not so great in the past by, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well it just makes it-I guess what we're saying now, you know, allows, I think it kind of allows me or helps me not feel as though I won't have to resent them or hate them. That, OK, they have inadequacies and they've hurt me, particularly recently. But that's the life that they have-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the way it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - and that's the way it is, yeah. And there's no reason, you know what I mean? It isn't really that justified to carry it on. 0:47:09.7</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, to carry and kind of (inaudible at 0:47:12.0) resentment burning alive inside you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just kind of what I was saying, it's kind of like this is the way they are, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was just thinking, you know, right now about Daisy and the kind of think with, you know, sort of leaving something unfulfilled in her relationship with her mother. Or not having been able to say things that she really wanted to. But like I don't know if a person who's lost someone through death, you know, can feel the same, or get the same kind of result that I begin to feel now as we're talking, you know, about loosing a sense of caringness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right because you never know that, I mean they never have reached the point that they can know that they could have been (inaudible at 0:48:02.5). Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, the absence still remains and-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and you've missed the absence-</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - it can't get worked through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - yeah, you've missed the absence and you never even can get to the point where you can learn that the absence can be filled or could always remain absence even if the person were alive. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's like (inaudible at 0:48:23.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That's kind of a heavy feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's kind of the thing I think when, you know, people die, it's kind of (inaudible at 0:48:38.7) to me. I'll always feel kind of that combination guilt or sadness for what wasn't developed because they've never come to terms with what there was when it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's, I guess the word is interesting. But it's sort of good to hear that, good to recognize because I've never really dealt with that, you know, I've never really, I guess, understood because I'm not, you know, I'm not sure what it's all about. I've never even been faced with it. 0:49:24.8</p>

<p>I'm thinking Wednesday also Gary and Sue and I were talking and last year Gary and I worked together, one of the fellows that also worked at this place, who was an extremely sensitive guy, met a woman just during the past year and fell in love with her. She has about five or six months to live. She had known this and had not told anybody. And then she met this guy. And they're like going through, I guess the most tragic thing I've ever heard of, that, the decision of whether they should share the time that she has left or whether it's best not to, you know, like separate and that. It's just a phenomenal thing. And like I can't grasp, you know, some of it, but it's just such a phenomenally frightening thing to speculate about. That kind of thing of knowing death is coming. 0:50:33.9</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of knowing (inaudible at 0:50:34.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's just wow. I guess I-Gary had told me about them a couple weeks ago and I hadn't thought about it except, you know, it was really, really struck me when he told me. And he brought it up again Wednesday. I guess Matt is now really beginning to have serious difficulties dealing with it. And I feel really at a loss because I don't know how to feel. I don't know, I just, all I can feel is a terrible emptiness and I guess sort of sympathy. Although I don't want to feel-I don't like sympathy. I don't like that, to feel that for anybody. But it's like an overwhelming emotional thing that I don't about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, what he's going through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of you can sense the immensity, but not knowing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, really, it's just so immense kind of thing. It makes me think, too, in a much smaller, smaller scale, what, you know, I guess I feel so much better to deal with counseling with kids or adults around unwanted pregnancy and abortion counseling, you know. Like I really feel I know in one sense this has been a phenomenally good experience in just building sensitivity and real understanding, you know, like the thing-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Empathize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, the thing of understanding what someone's going through is often a vicarious kind of thing that as much as you possibly can you do. And like I feel sort of good about there isn't a question about it anymore. You know, I really can sense it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (inaudible at 0:52:42.7).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And this other thing is so, wow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's outside your (inaudible at 0:52:51.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, so far outside. And maybe that's what makes it even more frightening than it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Inaudible at 0:53:02.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good, I've begun to feel I was just kind of-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday at two?</p>

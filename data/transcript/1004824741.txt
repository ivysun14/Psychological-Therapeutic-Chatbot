<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still don't know what to talk about. So the Kickstarter thing—I've got nine days left—is still around $2,000. Unless there's going to be some crazy rush last minute, I think that I have to . . . I haven't thought about this before, but I think what I'm going to do, I don't really want to ask my uncle, but it would just be the easiest thing. I think I'm just if he'd make up the rest, then once I get the money I'd literally borrow it for that period and just write a check. I think that's pretty fair, or I think it wouldn't be asking much. It is and it isn't. Like, yeah, give me the money, but I'm going to write you a check." I think that makes sense. I think it will be fine in that way, so I feel okay about it; or I might just ask three friends to just put in my $6-700 on your credit card and I'll just write you a check immediately when it comes through. [00:01:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you'd get no money actually in your pocket, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, what I mean is that way, right now it's $2,000, but we need to get to $4,500. Let's say no one gives anything anymore and it's $2,000. I would ask my uncle or whoever, to get me to $4,500, I would give them back their money. That way I keep the $2,000 that people gave. I just don't want to do this all again. This is fucking ridiculous. It's too stressful for me. I just don't want to do it. And, also, you can't do it immediately in a way. I guess you could, but it just seems easier this way. It's not a big fucking deal. Once I get the money, I'm just going to write you a check. So there is that. I made two music videos. Did we talk about this? [00:02:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you were starting to do it. Are you going to learn the technology?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me tell you what happened. Did I tell you about the girl who . . ? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She made one and you said it was okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sucked. It was a shitty IKEA commercial, so I stayed up two fucking nights and I learned how to make and edit a video on a Mac. I don't want it to be crossing a line thing, but if you get a chance you should watch this fucking video because I think it might even say something about me Well, I'm sure it does say something about me. They're fucking awesome. I am so proud of these fucking videos. [00:03:17] They've been picked up by a bunch of music sites and blogs. The thing is it's getting out there. We're getting traction. We're getting a lot of followers on Twitter. People are getting on blogs and sites. It just doesn't mean that everyone is going to fork over money immediately, but my band mates were like, "What the fuck?" because I just surprised them. They were like, "Holy, fucking shit. This is amazing." My mom was blown away. She loved them. She was like, "This is unbelievable that they're so beautiful with your songs." Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For her to be blown away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I gave my mom some props. I don't know. Maybe the cat's chilled her out or maybe she's just getting to the point where she's like—I don't know. She asked me how our show was and she was like, "I'm so proud of you. That's great." She didn't say anything bad about the Kickstarter thing. She was like, "That's cool. What will be the goal? if you get the money, what will you do?" [00:04:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's more supportive these days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Much more. Maybe it's finally gotten to that point where (sniggers) I kind of tanked her with my stubbornness. Maybe it's just her because of my grandmother. Maybe she's at a point where she's just kind of . . . but still, that's not easy for a lot of people at that age—or at any age. So I was really proud of the video. I was really, really proud.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are they? Are they mapped somewhere? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Vimeo. Do you know that site? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I'm out of it. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I've caught up on all this shit just in the last few weeks. Vimeo is this awesome—think of it like a much more sophisticated You Tube. It's not just cats doing stupid tricks or whatever. They're actually cool videos. The platform is nice looking. So it's on Vimeo. [00:05:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you spell it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: V-i-m-e-o. I know I can use that as a link. It's really easy, very cool-looking, simple, easy to use. I'm fucking psyched. The show went really, really well. We must have talked about that, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was last week. It was the night before you came in, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have these waves of being momentarily being really pissed at these friends of mine that I was saying haven't chipped in and I haven't felt like aren't spreading the word. But 1) I'm going to wait until this thing is over and I'm not really that upset. For some reason, I'm not that upset about it anymore. I have moments, but then I just feel like, "You know what? At least now I know who my real friends are." [00:06:50] 2) I'm trying very hard not to judge. Maybe there's something else going on. Maybe they're just waiting until the last minute. Whatever. I really doubt people are sitting around going, "Fuck him. I'm not going to give anything." That doesn't make sense to me. Also, I just feel like I want to be above that. I'm good and I don't need my rinky-dink little friends to . . . that would be nice, but I'm proud of the fact that . . . it's like I want to go beyond that. I never liked that to begin with. I don't want to be my first band—we've gotten kind of big, but we've gotten big here. That's not that hard. If you're pretty good around here, you'll be kind of big in this city. You'll play good shows. So it's both like I'm trying not to judge them, but also I just want to look beyond that. It's a big world and there are lots of music fans. It's not just about my friends supporting me. Most of my friends are supporting me, so it's not like . . . So I'm trying not to have like epileptic rage about it. [00:08:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're trying to not let it fall into the grooves inside about them being somehow above and judging you or not thinking highly of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. For a while I was going to write down e-mails. I was like, "If the campaign ends and they still . . . I'm just going to be like 'fuck you.'" What's that going to do? I'm just going to sound really angry and spiteful. Instead, if I see them and it comes up, I'm just going to be just very casually be like, "I'm disappointed. I' kind of surprised you guys weren't behind me more, but whatever." It's just not worth it to me anymore, those kinds of things more and more. Genuinely. I'm not just saying it. I feel like, man, it kind of feels good to be confident in yourself and just to know, "Oh, Jess didn't give me $20." Who the fuck cares? It's the whole secondary nonsense. The important thing is to do your thing, do it well, keep doing it, and all that other stuff—what does that mean? I'm not writing songs for Jess. Who cares? [00:09:38] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think for a long time any one person could have stood for the early people who didn't care enough. Do you know what I mean? In a way you have been writing your songs for your mother and father—inside you. And Jess or her mother could embody your mother or father approving or not approving or supporting you or not supporting you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Everything was about what certain people think, then it feels like it's a conspiracy or everyone has somehow kind of collectively decided. That just doesn't make any sense. That's just not a realistic perspective, not to mention the logistic. I think some people on Facebook are just not seeing my posts. Facebook has become this completely—I don't understand anymore. I have like 1,000 friends. I don't know who sees my posts. [00:10:48] The reason I know is because I don't see my friends posts. I almost see the same posts from the same brand of people all the time. The few people I talk to are like, "Yeah, dude, I don't get into that. Facebook has become this . . ." I read about it a little bit and they were saying how only something like 15 percent of your friends actually see your posts. That's just become this monstrous thing. The ultimate thing is that all that is secondary. Even if they were seeing them and ignoring them, something in me just doesn't want to dwell on that stuff anymore. (pause) So that's pretty cool. [00:11:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like something in you starts to know they're not your mother and your father. They never will be and it's just a person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No better, no worse. No bigger, no smaller.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Also, I was even thinking, who knows? I was like, "If I got really angry at them, what if I don't know that they have some issues? Maybe they're like, 'Dude, you never call me. You never come around. You don't come to our house.'" Who knows? I doubt it's even if that's the case, but if you open that can of worms it's like you're keeping tabs. You get so angry about something and people can be like, "Wait a minute. Settle down. We moved. You didn't help us move." You know, if you're going to go down that road, it's not worth it. [00:12:58] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear you thinking about the other person's mind and that who knows what's going on in their mind? And it's not necessarily what you always would imagine or the fantasy would make you think it is—the paranoia of your family, your mother's "they're out to get us". It's sort of the assumption that what's in everyone else's mind out there is what I'm afraid of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's kind of narcissistic. Like they're sitting around with nothing better to do than to think about . . . they get my e-mails and they're like, "Hmm. No, fuck him. I'm not going to . . ." That doesn't make any sense. It's not reality. So, yeah, it feels better to be like, "You know, they're good people. Whatever." Either they aren't remembering or they're waiting for the last few days or whatever. It doesn't matter either way. It just doesn't matter. [00:14:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think that with the Assyrian genocide having been denied—unrecognized, the massive pretending it never happened, it's not happening, this isn't real—there's a way that sets up in the culture, in your family, through generations, a massive sense of needing the other person to confirm what's in my mind. There is a way that your own mind is dependent on the outside judgment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need constant validation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, because it's never been there. It's never been enough to say, "This happened. I know it happened. That's all I need."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's also the reason they don't help each other properly. It's like half-assed. They help each other but then if they feel like you're getting a little too "something", they don't like that. It's definitely a very complicated, fucked up . . . and it's really unique in the modern period. I think it's fairly unique. I can't think of another—I mean Native American—no, these things are all acknowledged. I can't think of anything on this scale. (pause) [00:15:47] Meanwhile, I had a date the other night. I've been on a crazy streak of dates. Maybe it's because I feel better and I just don't give a shit. I don't know. Maybe I'm just putting out a certain vibe or something. Months and months ago there was this girl in Okay, Stupid, who I was kind of like, "This girl's cool." We kind of really clicked online. We were going to go out last minute but she was like, "You're going to hate me. I'm really sorry, but I'm not quite done with this kind of volatile relationship thing." It was a bummer. I never took her phone and number off my phone and, I don't know why, but for the show I texted her. Just kind of like the text I send everybody. I was like, "Hey. I'm playing this show." Blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To her, individually? [00:16:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well it worked out that way. On the iPhone, if you send a mass text, everyone else sees who is on the list. I don't like that. If they don't want other people, you know? So I sent it to her and she got right back and was like, "Whoa. [Psycho pike] (ph?)" She had my number because she was like, "Whoa. I can't believe you texted me," or something like that. She was like, "Actually, I was thinking about you because I was wondering if maybe you still wanted to have that drink." We went out the other night and (pause) I don't know what to say. It was fucking awesome. We had a really great date. I ended up staying at her place. I didn't even expect it to go that way, but we started making out in the parking lot at the restaurant. I don't know what to say, man. This was the most intense . . . we didn't even have sex. We just lay in bed and made out and whatever. I'm telling you right now, I've never been so turned on. There was something so incredibly passionate. I feel weird saying these things because I'm trying to stop myself; but, honestly, I felt like I'm falling in love with her or something. It didn't feel like a normal thing to me. That's all I know. [00:18:17] I'm not getting carried away with it, because who the fuck knows, but we're going out tomorrow. It just felt really comfortable and she said all these things that are really important to me that I didn't have to say; she said them. Like, "I really love that you have a grandma and you visit and you care about your family and stuff." She has this thing about respecting people who are older and blah, blah, blah. Her family is Russian and Indian, so she really cares that it's nice to care about your heritage or at least know what your heritage is. She just hit on all these truths. She was fucking awesome. She was like, "Whoa. I can't believe you even noticed them. That's really important." She said a lot of things that were like what the fuck? She's bright but like a normal girl, but she's really interesting and smart, so I don't know. It' was just awesome. [00:19:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she fit the Samantha mold in that check-list way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: In a way, it's better because she's really hot. But, no, like her apartment is kind of messy and there was nothing cool about it, so I like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Liked that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I liked that because it just seemed like a normal . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ordinary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of ordinary. She lives in Springfield. She's not trying to be all hip and that. There's something very heart-felt about her. (pause) It just felt like when we were talking, she was like, "I was really glad to hear from you." It sounded like we were both really happy that we got back in touch. It was really weird. I thought at the end of the night, (chuckles) "I'm definitely going to kiss this chick," then see her again at some point, hopefully; but when we started kissing, she was like, "I don't want this to end. Do you want to come meet my cats?" So I don't know. It was really awesome. I felt a little . . . She asked me how old I was and I just couldn't lie. That made me feel a little . . . I hated that. She's 28. In my mind, I thought I remembered she was in her 30's. She looks beautiful and young, but the way she carries herself there's something about her that seems older and wiser. She kind of has poise. [00:21:49] I know what it was—it was because her parents had her when they were so young. She didn't joke about it but she was like, "Yeah. You know . . . " I think her dad is 49 or something, although she said one of her boyfriends was 50 so, obviously, she doesn't care; otherwise we wouldn't be going out again or it wouldn't have been that awesome. But I was just like, "Aww. Fuck." But it was cool. She was like, "Are you fucking kidding me? You seem nothing like . . . I thought you were 30 or something. Wow. That's cool." [00:22:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn't sound like, to her, it felt like it mattered. It was more something that bothered you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was when we first got to her house. We had a cigarette and, yeah. Then it was just intense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And inside you that feeling was that you'd be too old for her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I hate being asked how old I am. That's just become a thing. I don't want to talk about age; and also because I don't ask other people. It's weird. I really see how my mom—on this thing I agree with them. I do feel like it's unnecessary, in the sense that I'm clearly an adult. I'm clearly probably over 28, so what? I get that you're over 25 or whatever you are. I kind of don't care. She could have been 39. She could have been 28, because I do feel it's like saying, "What do you do?' It's such an American—no one overseas asked me that question. I think it's considered rude. It's like, "What do you do?" because I'm going to judge you now. Psychologists are going to go, "she is this kind of person." [00:24:04] It's like that's not what people are—what they do and how old they are. It's like saying, "What kind of car do you drive?" or something, so it's definitely me. I just have a thing about it, but I feel like it's kind of justified. I feel like it's asked very casually. I always try to diffuse it. My answer is that I'm 54. I'm just like, "Yeah, I'm 54," and I make a joke out of it. Sometimes I lie and say I'm 38 or 37. So, yeah, it was definitely me, and I really like this girl. [00:24:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually her age, you were saying last time, might matter to her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In this case, I don't know if it would matter. I don't know if it would matter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's enough going there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've been with a fair amount of chicks. I've never felt—I hate this. It's making me cringe to say these things, but "sensual" or whatever fucking word for it. (chuckles) There was something so—I don't know what the fuck. She was kissing me like we had been reunited after 10 years. I was like, "There's no way this girl just kisses people like this. This doesn't feel . . . " And also, we didn't have sex. And after I was like, "That's cool." We got kind of naked and all of that, but we didn't have sex. So I was even hotter, in a way. So we really like each other and so, obviously, we're . . . [00:26:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Taking it slowly,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We're setting things up. We're kind of building. Also, it felt great. I didn't feel weird. I didn't have any moment when I was like, "This is weird." Those moments I have where I'm like, "Where the fuck am I? Some random girl's apartment in Springfield." I didn't feel that at all. I felt really comfortable. Her little kittens were jumping up and off the bed. That even felt good. It was so neat. I was like, "Yeah. This doesn't bother me at all." I was picking them up and playing with them. It just all felt good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like there was something much more in the emotional feelings than just highly erotic—a lot of emotional feeling woven into the erotic. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know what that . . . I'm kind of assuming, even though I don't want to, that she felt the way I felt. Things like this you can't just pull them out of thin air. I've been with enough women and I've never felt as hot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't often feel this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's never felt this way, not with Samantha, not with Meredith, not with Michelle. Nope. Not quite like this. Not quite like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would describe it similarly in the beginning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. I don't think I ever used the word, "really sensual". Physically, I've never felt anything like that. It was fucking ridiculous. It totally caught me off guard, completely caught me off guard. With the other ones, I described it that way because they were up here. Of course I was describing them like that, because they were . . . you know. Samantha? I don't even remember the sex. It wasn't that good because she was "on lock-down" or whatever the fuck. With Meredith we hardly ever had sex, so that was not great when we did. Michelle was good. With Michelle it was close to this, but there's something that just felt really open and really warm and genuine. I don't know. If she's like this with every guy she dates, that would throw me. That would be kind of odd. It wasn't a regular making out. Anyway, I don't know what it was. So that's cool. Does that make sense? Am I talking about it in a weird way? [00:29:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. I think your differentiating is something really important. I've heard you use some of the same language like, "This never felt like this before," but it sounds like you can see it as more with some of those woman as being, "Oh, my God. I won her over." The boosts in feeling so good about yourself in that working, the first night it works, and just sort of the awe of that actually working. This feels really different. It doesn't sound like you're in awe of her, like she's on a pedestal and untouchable. [00:29:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she's amazing, but even on the way home the next morning I was like, "I might never see this girl again, and you know what? I'm going to be okay with that." I took myself there. I'm just over that kind of . . . it would be a real bummer just like I did the first time. We didn't hook up, but if this was some years ago I would have been like, "Fuck." I didn't say anything mean or I didn't write back to her like, "That's sad. See you later." So, no; and also because our interaction was different than those other girls. There was something very adult in talking about all of these really awesome things. She's really into health. It was very healthy. We talked about family and music and writing. She's a singer. She's an amazing person just as a person. And she's really, really hot. She is really, really hot, but she's not like a Samantha/Michelle. Those chicks were so . . . she's really . . . it's hard to explain. It's hard to explain. Those other chicks were like models, basically. They looked like models. This girl looks like a model, but not quite. Her face is super-beautiful but she's got maybe a little bit pock-marked. She has some imperfections a little bit that are still really hot, but there's something. She dresses really cool but not fucking uber-cool. She just dresses cool. She has nice hair. I like that. It wasn't too much. [00:31:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the difference between being hot, attractive, amazing, and being perfect on a pedestal. You can really think she's unbelievably attractive and not have her on a pedestal. It sounds like she's more a whole person with some flaws, some foibles, some quirks . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We talked about her parents' divorce, her step-siblings, her relationship with her mom. I don't think she has a lot of money, maybe, but it sounds like her family is very well off or something, so she talked a little bit about it. She's very honest and very warm. She talked about her mom. Her mom used to be—Her mom was a dancer on an old TV show. My mom loved that show. I used to watch that show with my mom and dad. So, yeah, very interesting. I think we also connected on that. Her mom also kind of gave up her dreams and she's kind of a little bit something-something. They butt heads sometimes even though she loves her mom, although they had a different relationship. She's a girl and her mom is very young. So she's like, "We hang out, [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:21) and have drinks together." They still have a nice relationship, but she's like, "We butt heads and sometimes it's rocky." She's kind of estranged from her dad, her biological dad. [00:33:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something about it that sounds kind of ordinary in a kind of good way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And you know what I loved about it? The date was in the mall at the fucking Mall, that big, ridiculously—I'd never been there. I liked that. I was like, "I like this. I'm in this fucking place. I'm looking around me. There were some horny housewives. (chuckles) They're at the Mall for a fancy girl's nights and there were one or two businessman-looking guys. I just liked that. It was not some hipster place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There was no pretense around it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was nothing. Then I followed her to Springfield. The next morning didn't feel that awkward. She kind of had to really rush to work and so it was like, "You don't have to get up. I was just going to let you sleep." It was very sweet. I was like, "No, I know what it's like when you're . . . I'll just take off." We just kissed and she was like, "I'm sorry. You can just let yourself out." I was like, "All right. Then I'll talk to you later." [00:35:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This was Saturday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today is Thursday. The date was Tuesday night. Yesterday I texted her. We're going to get together tomorrow night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've already had an exchange it sounds like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, because we joked around. That was the other thing I liked about her. Even before we kissed or anything we joked around. She was like, "So, you're going to wait three days?" I was like, "Yeah, I don't do that shit." I definitely remember the three-day thing and I joked around. I was like, "Listen, we're either making out when we're done here or . . ." We joked around about the "friend zone" and it was very up-front. We were both basically in very clear but roundabout ways (chuckles) letting each other know that we really want to hang out, that we're happy that we're hanging out. [00:36:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There weren't any games trying to hide your vulnerability. You were both quite open with each other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She apologized like, "I'm really sorry about when we were going to get together before. It was a little messy and I had to end that."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound excited.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I haven't felt excited about a girl in a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's cool. It feels good to not be excited the way I used to be. I'm excited but I keep . . . whatever. It could be nothing and be gone in a week. It could even be something where we hang out and I decide. It's no longer that it's all about her and her power. I can decide that I'm not into it. [00:37:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's also very different to be excited about something ordinary. I just think that's a new experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her apartment was really messy. It was really messy. There were dishes piled up, nothing looked cool at all. My place is cooler. My place is very sparse. It didn't bother me one god-damned bit. Not one bit. Normally kitchens, bathrooms, I'm like, "Aww," but I helped her clean up after her cats. The kittens had gone nuts and ripped things up. I helped her out. I cleaned things up with her. I had a cigarette with her. We talked about that. We talked about my dad, how he died, blah, blah, blah. I was like, "But I fucking love smoking. I just don't do it, but it's awesome," and we laughed. She was like, "I totally agree. I'm all about health but I fucking love smoking." We had a cigarette on her porch. I don't know. I loved that we were in the woods. We were in the freaking woods. Have you been to Springfield? [00:38:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We drove by lakes and shit. Like where the fuck are we? I might have been there before but I don't remember. It was the woods. That was really cool. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't even seem to make it feel special. It was about the two of you as people, not about where you were, how cool you were, not what you were wearing necessarily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All around it, it wasn't about superficial stuff. That's part of it, but that's not all of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The only thing to get excited about as a kid in your family were the things that were extra special perfect, up on a pedestal. Things ordinary were not exciting. They were boring. I just think this is new. You're actually excited about her ordinariness. Still uniqueness—she's a particular person, but no better or worse than another person, on a scale of judgments. [00:40:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was really cool. (pause) It's been weird. I went on a date with a 24-year-old hostess from a bar. Because it wasn't online it was like, fuck this. I went to my friend's jazz thing and was like—what? This kind of sucks. It doesn't suck, but it was just like it wasn't my kind of music. There's was nothing going on there except the hot hostess (chuckles). As I was leaving, I was like, "Fuck it. I'm going to ask her out." She was like, "Yeah. Sure." (both chuckle) That was cool. We went out. We made out. That felt good. It was cool. She knows how old I am, so that was cool. What I like about it is I really like her, but I feel like I'm laser-focused on music and getting my life together. I don't think I would let these things side-track me. [00:41:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they're also back in your life again when they haven't been. Feeling excited. It was only a week or two ago you were saying, "I just don't know why." What's going on that you're not even into doing that, like approaching the hostess at the bar. That just wouldn't have happened. You talked about walking up to someone and then saying, "Nope," turning around, about face. Some things feel more alive again. [00:42:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I just feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe more comfortable with your ordinariness. For a long time it was that you had to be special in order for someone special—on a pedestal kind of special—and then when that wasn't doing it anymore, you didn't want to just fall for the surfaces, but you didn't know why you would do it otherwise. Now it feels like there's a little room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell you one thing that's never happened before ever, that just started happening maybe a few weeks or very recently, in the past I wouldn't imagine myself as being genuinely cool. When I would think of myself I don't know what I thought, but it definitely was negative or I'd find a way to make it negative. Now sometimes I actually feel like it's unsettling, but I feel genuinely good. I feel grateful, like how cool. I'm 40 but I'm really fucking cool, genuinely cool. I have my own style. We talked about that, too. She was saying how we don't like people that are too put together. Some of these bars I go to it's like every fucking thing has been hand selected. Everything is perfectly cool. It's just obvious. It looks ridiculous. We were talking about that and I felt like, yeah, I'm me. I finally kind of see what's attractive about me. I'm not all the way better, but it's huge. Now I think, "Yeah, that's cool." [00:43:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's huge. That's fucking huge. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so different than thinking, "They're cool and I'm not. I'm the outsider who's not."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went to Target to buy something and I had to try it on and their dressing room was like, "Oh, fuck. My hair is thinning in the back. Mother fucker." But I just kind of ignored it and I don't know. I use Rogaine. I do whatever the fuck it is you're supposed to do, but it is what it is and I'm still awesome. I'm going to be one of those cool guys that has thinning hair, I guess. I don't know. It doesn't feel great, but it felt good that it was that moment and then it was gone. If it pops into my mind it just comes and goes because something in me is like it is what it is. Second of all, look around you. (chuckles) No matter what you're a good-looking guy or whatever; no better or worse than other decent-looking guys, so whatever. [00:45:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All it is, is hair or a scalp. That sounds strong to say, but that's all it is. It's not you that you've defined you, according to a nose or balding or not balding or a certain kind of body. And it sounds like there's a little room just to start to say, "That's all it is."</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also what kind of person would love or not love somebody based on that? That's a fucked-up person. What is that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cool. 3:15?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 3:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you tomorrow.</p>

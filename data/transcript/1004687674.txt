<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey. It was very creepy realizing that I had been here last week and don't remember it at all. As I was leaving yesterday it really haunted me a bit. (pause) (sigh) I mostly (inaudible) Mostly for me usually especially because my hip has been bothering me so I didn't sleep at all really last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I did something vaguely productive this afternoon sort of. I (pause) had to get rid of my sharps container because it's full so I was looking at it and I realized that it looks kind of pretty so I did some artistic photography of my hypodermic needles which sounds weird, but it actually looks kind of nice. And this is normally what it looks like. [00:01:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long is that from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh about three months, four months. It's about a hundred sharps or so. But I was just doing some artistic photography of it, which sounds weird I know, but I guess in some way it's a way of making it (pause) not okay, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot of art, I think, that's like that, making things that are sort of pretty and realistic, clinical, and poignant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so having a way of expressing sort of the feelings I have about it without necessarily making it feel like, "Oh I'm looking for you to pity me." You know? It is just sort of a part of life and it's actually not as bad as it sounds. But it's just...trying to find something partially productive to do. I mean it's not really productive because it's not really...I don't know what it is. It's something to do with my time. It's an outlet. [00:02:54]</p>

<p>So I was very early on told that I was a miserable Ernest and I took it to heart pretty darn badly. So I'm always very (pause) fragile about that. I am not (ph) willing to even call most of the things I do art because of the fact of that. I had an art teacher who offered to basically get me into an extra study hall, which is in her mind (inaudible) I don't remember who it is...I don't remember very much about it anymore. That's how long ago it was. But it was like, I guess it was rationalized as, "You're very academic, and you'll be able to put this to better use." That kind of thing. I saw it as, "Wow, I'm the only person in the history of any time ever who was kicked out of art class for being too bad." Not because of bad behavior, being so bad at it that...you know. [00:03:57]</p>

<p>(pause) "But they were willing to bend the rules on a requirement of art so that you could, you know, spend some time studying." So, I'm always very fragile about calling whatever I do as really being art per se because I do not see myself as an artist. I do things that are artistic sometimes and, like I said, it's very weird. I've done actually a lot of photography studies in the past, more specifically, but again there are manipulating situations to make them look different than they really are and so I see it as more (inaudible) or like evolution or something that exists, not necessarily anything that I made. I don't know why but it just makes me feel very uncomfortable about it. [00:04:57]</p>

<p>But in general it's sort of putting two things together. It's not that I'm uncomfortable getting so many injections, it's just occasionally when people came to my house and they'd see this giant box of sharps—mostly because I was too lazy to have to...it's a pain in the neck to dispose of sharps—so I would just get the biggest box I could for them and then just whenever I get a couple hundred of them get rid of them that way. And so people would come to my house and they would see this, because I have a very small apartment, and they would ask questions and I'm one of those people that sort of makes light of something (pause) to make it seem okay. So I was like, "Yeah those are just party favors for later." Or just...I don't know where in the world I come up with these ideas but I'm just like yeah, it's not a big deal but also making it ridiculous because of the fact that (pause) I don't really understand why but the anonyms (ph) makes me feel very awkward. I don't feel awkward having people know that I do this but seeing the aggregate of them all together kind of looks a little bit like...I don't know. I guess I feel the same way as if for some reason I had a giant amount of empty liquor bottles sitting around the house too. I'd be like, "Yeah, they're for later. They're from a while back." I don't know, it seems weird. [00:06:30]</p>

<p>So the only thing I leave around that is used that isn't disposed of quickly, not like immediately getting out of the house but I take the trash out a couple times a week so to me it's kind of weird to have this giant stash of them around. But it is, you know, it's kind of weird. But I also don't hide them because usually when you're doing it—I thought about hiding it somewhere—but usually when you're being injected is you're already juggling a couple of things and the last thing you want to do is have to start looking for wherever you stuck that box. That and it's better (inaudible) in sight basically because you don't want to accidentally put your hands...it's sealable but you know. You don't want to accidentally hurt yourself. [00:07:24]</p>

<p>So putting two things that I'm wildly uncomfortable with together is sort of a weird thing for me. I'm normally not like that. So I, I don't know, I'll see where it goes from there. I just don't like (pause) I don't like where things are going right now. I don't like the fact that I am almost never this arthritic in the summer. You know? Yeah, it's very rare. I mean I'm in pain but it's not that bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually, unless I've done something to aggravate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Is that part of why the doctor wants...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It looks like...I mean, showing a lot of sense of other things too, there are different avenues that it takes but I in general have very, very high inflammatory responses and so it's kind of a concern. But it's kind of unusual for me. If I went on an outing like for a really long walk or if I did something like when I was moving, I did something to aggravate it, that's different than just naturally doing that. And that kind of scares me to get this bad again. (pause) And it's kind of worrying me. [00:09:04]</p>

<p>It isn't just the pain though. The pain is possibly the thing that makes me the most miserable and cranky. It's also not knowing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where it's going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...where it's going right now. I mean I know it's likely it's in my left hip but there are so many inflammatory markers that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That means that my body is reacting to what it perceives as something like...so basically the—what's it called?—marker alpha, means my body perceives something that doesn't belong there. It's TNF alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, it's very high. And so usually, that is your body's...the word tumor...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's like your immune system going "danger"...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And the word tumor is used just because that's what your body's natural thing for it because we didn't grow up like, we didn't evolve having artificial body parts or you know, other things. That's what it's...it's supposed to sense tumors or whatever but it's not. But there are a lot of things that indicate it may not be just localized in my joints but we don't really know yet. [00:10:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Is that an expectable or sometime worsening of the condition when it's outside of the joints?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I have other outbreaks of other diseases. I have something called Hashimoto's which is autoimmune thyroid and I have a bunch of them (inaudible) which is autoimmune...the salivary tear glands. There are a lot of them out there but it is a bad thing that I'm normally targeted (ph) so we'll worry if there's something new. I'm just not ready for anything new in my life right now like that. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, for sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a pretty complicated thing and they don't really have an easy way of being able to tell what, other than just a few basic markers, they don't really have a good way of telling what it is. So that's sort of a stronger dose. And most of the medications are exactly the same. Like if I have (inaudible) psoriasis, it's the same medication I take if I have rheumatoid arthritis. And if I Lupus it's the same thing as...most Lupus things are the same things...so they just raise the drugs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Differentiating doesn't actually tell you that much about what to do. [00:12:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I've had a couple of doctors that were obsessed with differentiating enough that they wouldn't treat me because they wanted to just really get a good response and I was just not into that. (sigh) So that's pretty much been on my plate lately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds pretty terrifying really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I'm just flipping exhausted. (pause) There's a lot of other things going on too that I'm just not thrilled about but nothing that I can immediately control. More finance drama, just other stuff like that. (pause) I sort of have to see where that goes. (pause) I am considering trying to find myself an academic position. We'll see, possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have in mind? [00:13:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing in specific, just something that is going to be lighter on my joints and maybe not full time if I can. I've got to figure out whether or not that's possible or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure whether you mean teaching or more school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Helping research something; someone who needs somebody who can do some research for them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, some sort, I've got it; a research assistant or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It wouldn't even necessarily have to be directly something that goes through an HR thing but just a professor who has a grant that can cut a check for somebody who does Internet contracting. Which I've done before when people that I've worked for, the requisition process was more than they really wanted to deal with so I've done that before where here's a (inaudible) with an invoice and get paid. [00:14:15]</p>

<p>So I'm thinking about trying to apply for something like that right now so that I can go back to working less at the store which is really hard on me and still be able to afford to...so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess, you're the right count (ph) for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I just need to get the energy to go out and do it, which is harder. (pause) But it's hard to be my attorney (ph) persuasive self right now because I just feel like crud. (pause) But if I could just get into that momentum (ph) then maybe I can. </p>

<p>(pause) (sigh) I'm thinking of doing something completely and totally financially stupid which is taking a trip. I have a friend of mine who lives in Australia now, we went to school together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the (inaudible) who's in Australia?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in Australia, which will be very expensive. Not as expensive as it could be since I can stay with him and I could potentially use a lot of frequent flyer miles that I have that I have been saving them for something that may not actually turn out to be so good because America may go bankrupt or paralyze (ph) so...I have been sort of holding off on that so that if we were to adopt we could use that to go over there. I kind of feel...after talking to my mom, she thinks it's a really bad idea but she's going to support me if I feel like I want to do it. Not a bad idea necessarily for the usual things I was expecting her to say like, "You're married and you're going to stay with a guy," and this and that. I was waiting for her to say like, "You going to know all the (inaudible)?" No, she knows (inaudible) I can deal. But she's like, "There's nothing worse than being stranded in a city and having no money." And I was like, "Well, that's true." And she's like, "Sydney's a very expensive city." And so she's sort of trying to gear me towards, "If you want to do this, go somewhere else," but I think that it might be...even going to Hawaii (ph), the ability to take the time off that I really want and need for a couple of weeks may be almost impossible otherwise. [00:17:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would it be more difficult to take time off...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well a couple of things. One of which is that—this is always great when I explain it—it is easier to get a manager to give you time off for something that is exotic than for something that is mundane. That and if I need to take a lot of time off, the cost of staying somewhere that isn't free or very inexpensive is possibly going to outweigh the cost of day to day activities, that kind of stuff. So (pause) I've learned how to do things pretty cheaply, that kind of stuff, but I think that possibly going somewhere that is not as expensive. Spending two weeks in say Italy where the cost of staying there is well worth it but yet spending two weeks there is going to be a lot more expensive. (pause) But I think I just really need something to look forward to. [00:18:19]</p>

<p>And that is my mentioning of Italy, that is exotic enough that I could probably get the time off for it whereas I need two weeks to go down to Cincinnati? No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not going to see that as a once in a lifetime opportunity that they want to help me do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dave (ph) doesn't have some conference in Hawaii or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he's not any good at actually talking to bosses for things that he wants to do or need. He's actually never gone to a conference other than when some...in the situation where his advisor didn't want to go and sent him instead. And he always felt like it was terrible because it was a bait and switch because he was asked to be out there because they wanted him on this planning committee and here's his grad student (chuckle) which apparently happens all the time. I've never had that happen in my career because most of the people I have worked with, they've never asked to be a part of something and then changed their mind on it I guess. But no, he's not any good at that. [00:19:25]</p>

<p>He can't even ask for the equipment he needs to do for his job right now. It's actually kind of getting to the point of disturbing. I think that I am sort of becoming a little bit like that. Not as much, but...(pause) a little bit like that. The whole thing of I would like to have this therefore I should already have...I feel like I should have some good results first kind of thing, but not to the extreme as he is. (pause) He is so paralyzingly (sp) afraid of everything. It's getting worse by the day. But it just makes me feel so sad for him. [00:20:26]</p>

<p>(pause) I was really hoping, because he had a couple of experiments, finally would be able to bring us results and then all of a sudden apparently they changed the rules. So we've got to wait for some red tape. It used to be that if you used blood bank blood you didn't have to go through all of these different procedures because it's already—to make sure that it's humanely taken or whatever—apparently now you do. You still have to go through getting the same type of experimental procedures as if you were using laboratory animals which is weird. And apparently they had sort of found out that he had not done that and he was like, "Oh okay, I'm sorry." Now that he's gotten caught—well not caught-caught, he didn't actually know—he's in a hole until they can let him reproduce (ph) it though. [00:21:37]</p>

<p>I really feel like having some things go well for him, the good luck hole at least...at least encourage him to want to do more. I feel so bad for him because he just...I'm not even sure. It would be very easy to try to force him to go out into industry but I'm not entirely sure he'd feel comfortable there either. I'm not really sure. I'm just...to be honest I am so filled with anger and rage that I can't do nothing with and have no real distinct ability to direct or to even necessarily quantize to his family for doing this to him, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. He's just...there's so many things about him that he spends time fearing other people, especially women, in his life that it just makes me so sad and so angry with him. The things that they pass off as being completely okay and normal aren't normal. And it's so easy to get sucked up into that world that (pause) it makes me mad that I, to some extent at least a little bit, kind of got sucked into it. [00:23:18]</p>

<p>(pause) The fact that...this isn't an easy one to talk about. His family is so wildly uncomfortable talking about money. The few times that we've needed to borrow money they have been very—his dad has been especially so—very stingy about what he can lend us. And at the same time there's so much that is super uncomfortable about things, you know? It's just like, yeah I need to know what you're comfortable with in terms of if you're going to ask us to do something in terms of money, what do you feel okay with, you know? It started with when we got married with the rehearsal dinner where we really felt like we couldn't plan anything until the very last minute because we had no idea what they felt comfortable with in terms of that. Not just anything in terms of money though, money was the most thing, but even formality or what kind of place that they felt (inaudible overlapping voices) with but like when they're coming here we didn't know what they felt comfortable with, you know? [00:24:30]</p>

<p>When you go somewhere—they took them to the harbor (inaudible) for Mother's Day when they were here—and because Dave and I are the members, we get billed for it. We tried to explain to them that they don't pay the check. There is no check. You get billed later. It was kind of odd to them. And then later on trying to talk to them about finances or household expense and technically 50 bucks a head is about normal for brunch around here, blahblahblah, that's actually not that bad, whatever. I mean, we don't go out and do it all the time but it is normal. That was like a so difficult for Dave in conversation to have. I could see him backpedaling on this. If they were more corporate about specifically saying, "Hey, I'm in the mood for a burger. Let's go to a burger place," then okay, we [kind of know what they want] (ph), as opposed to, "I don't know what I want. I don't know. What's good?" Well, what I think is good is not necessarily what you're comfortable with. And do you really want to be there, this place? [00:25:44]</p>

<p>If this were a couple of places that we are very comfortable doing that with because we knew it was not super, super chatty and scary but also not expensive. But here it's a little trickier in terms of that, knowing what they're going to like and what they're not going to like. But it's just that everything about that is hard. Dave's mom, she's (pause)...I don't even really in my right mind understand at all how her finances...where the money comes from, when she has it, when she doesn't. It doesn't make any freaking sense to me, at all. She has done these extremely elaborate things that she supposedly saved up for but they don't involve any member of the family sometimes. It's weird. And they live in this enormous house that they remodeled and at currently Dave's mom is going to lose her job because the person who...the (inaudible) store that she works like ten hours a week at is closing. I don't really get it. She has this fake job, she's worked at two different places now in two different cities, or she works at these extremely high end name stores like the kind of place where a sweater, to cost to knit it, is about 1000 bucks. [00:27:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there are probably like three or four of them around here, knitting stores like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where it costs 1000 bucks to buy the yarn to knit a sweater?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More of the higher end sweaters but yes. At least a couple hundred bucks to make a sweater normally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Partially she does it because she loves to knit and she gets a massive discount. She buys more than she makes, that kind of thing, and to me this whole concept is completely mind-blowingly weird, this concept of having shops that have people who have sheep who spin. We're talking like old (ph). At some point, just for fun, I'll bring in some of the stuff that she's made for us. At one point she sent me something and I was like, "Are these dresses for my turtles?" And she's like, "No! They're like [extraneous gloves] (ph) with ruffles on the wrists." And I'm like, "Okay! Right!" [00:28:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuck)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they look like tiny little dresses and I don't understand. But she knits that stuff for us and that's usually the only thing she ever sends us. And I want to try to (inaudible) through this but...yeah that's the only thing she does and if she's going to show her affection I might as well let her do that. (inaudible) home onto somebody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah she did that. I guess she just this year qualifies for social security but she worked in the industry for a long time and sort of got this weird...Dave wasn't speaking to her at the point where she had this supposed change in her life and quit the industry and moved to Washington. Because she lived in Kentucky and she lived in Louisiana in places and traveled an awful lot for her job. So we don't know entirely what...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was she doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She worked in the real estate industry. Not specifically in realty. She dealt with...she was a trainer for database something or other. She was sent to all these different cities constantly. So she had a very marketable skill but she decided she didn't want to do it anymore. Then she moved to Washington where Dave's grandfather retired to or something...I don't really get it. They had no roots in Washington whatsoever. Now they're in Idaho, again a place they really don't have any roots in and can't stand the politics with so I have no idea why they're there because she's...that's another thing that's very hard. She detests me for my politics although I never speak of them. In fact I really would never...it's not her business what my politics are. And she finds it horrifying that I would feel that way and act like "You know what, I would never ever press my feelings about things on you, ever. So sorry you feel that way about me. I would never judge you about your beliefs for things." [00:30:20]</p>

<p>But it's just a lot to have to handle, you know? But I just hate her for all of her supposed nonconformist—she grew up in out West for a good bit of her life too and Dave's dad did too—a supposed laid back atmosphere nonconformist bullshit stuff in which they are supposedly so enlightened about and letting people make decisions in such that what they did was they raised a fucking nervous wreck. Who asks their four year old if they want to go to therapy? Seriously! </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nobody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nobody! Who says to their 16 year old, "I don't really care about your life and since you said you don't like hearing about mine let's just not talk at the dinner table?" Nobody! You know? Because she was talking about workers in the streets and (inaudible) interested. Oh wait, he was talking about his life, she said, "I'm not that interested about this subject." He said, "I'm not interested in orange (ph) stuff either but I left it out in politeness," and she was like, "Oh I didn't know that. Wow! Well I'm glad we cleared the table and now we can just not talk about any of these things anymore." [00:31:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's way horrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why did therapy come up when he was four?</p>

<p>CLIENT: His parents were divorcing. They didn't say therapy, they said, "Do you want to talk about it with anybody, that Daddy's leaving?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he said no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he's four.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's four! And I don't think he really got it because his dad travels for a living.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not (ph) meaning they supposedly sat down and I've had people tell me about the experience of it, about what happened when his parents when away. I find it weird that the neighborhood kids knew more about when his dad went away than he does. I don't think he really understood that. That kind of stuff you know? Nobody does that. Nobody who has the possibility of having access to means, when their son says, "I might have to have brain surgery. Can you come and help take care of me?" says, "No, I really can't afford to do so," and then says maybe that she can come in for like a day or so. Nobody does that that supposedly loves their children. [00:32:42]</p>

<p>And what makes me even more enraged is she still played the victim all the time about this. She makes it seem like the big bad wolf is trying to hurt her and that's why she's keeping everybody at arm's length because Dave's just going to grow up to hurt her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those things generally go together in this sort of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nobody neglected her! Nobody!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...personality that you're describing. The kind of self-absorption and neglect of him and playing the victim stuff. It has nothing to do with reality. Those things just often go together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought there would have been something informative in her youth that would have...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There probably was. It probably...I mean sometimes there is, sometimes there's something sort of gross in the sense of obvious. Often there are...almost always there are a collection of more subtle factors if there's not something gross. And sometimes there just isn't much in somebody's history. It's just kind of how they... </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're just this overbearing pain in the ass? [00:34:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes, yeah. Often there are a bunch of more subtle factors. Like it's not something as obvious as gross abuse and neglect. But for example, often people who are anorexic grow up in these homes where like you go in and you feel like this incredible kind of emotional coldness and sort of under the surface hostility where (pause) there's not an obvious abuse and neglect in a way. It may be obvious from the feeling in the room but it's not like if you heard somebody talk about (overlapping voices) saying like, "So and so beat me up and didn't feed me for three weeks," or whatever. So there can often be things that are subtle in that sense but very powerful and sometimes (pause) it's just what somebody's like. Not as often I think but sometimes. [00:35:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like she's angry more at society than more of the person. It's like men oppressed women in all ways as a concept and they did terrible things for this. And also formality is wrong and ritualistic and there are points in your life, it's nice to have a break up point of saying this is when somebody graduated. And quite frankly, I don't give a fuck if they didn't in the 60s go to their graduations. You know what? He got a PhD, of course he's going to his graduation. And there are a few people that didn't. In his department the person who didn't is because he was from overseas and he finished in the middle of the year and his visa for being there as a student was up so I mean, are you going to come back to graduate? [00:36:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that's very different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then there's another kid from overseas who actually went there whose parents didn't come because he was from Asia. But really, that's the only people...and it's a small school so everybody knows when something doesn't happen or does happen, whatever. So it's so screwed up, that whole thing of, "Oh you know, we're not going to really celebrate the holidays. We're not going to do this. We're going to do that." It's so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I follow it sounds like you're kind of suggesting that they frame it as unorthodoxy and sort of non-conformity but it seems as a cop out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like people who are (inaudible) atheist because they are mad at God. They're not actually atheist, they're just pissed. You know what I mean? They're angry. And so they say they don't believe there's a way in doing this. It's almost like they're angry with the society therefore they tend to be as not important. And for a long time I even defended their right of this. But they made me feel so shitty for the things that were part of my life. And you know what, they are what they are. And no matter what anyone says, [inaudible] (ph) in 1990 is different than the way you'd have viewed him in 1890. It was not a way for you to...it was in no way that you were a shadow of anybody else. It was focused a lot on giving back to society. And it was the end of a journey of what you needed to know in life to grow up. It was not the same thing at all. And I don't think it's a part of being judged on, you know? [00:38:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just...the thing that really makes me so upset the most is the fact that she hates men. She hates men lividly and she claims that the only people that she didn't hate were Dave and Dave's grandfather. And now we see the neglect to Dave's grandfather. Dave used to think, "Oh there must be something wrong with me because she likes Dave's grandfather." There's more I learned (ph) that, you know? And she has to do these, "Sigh. I'm so put upon. I have to have this and that." It's like, to me I've spent so many years not being judgmental and saying different lies to different people but you know what? I'm freaking sick of it. It makes me think of that 1960s housewife who was drunk off her ass at two in the afternoon because her life was so hard. Everything goes back to that era. The only thing her parents ever did to her wrong was send her to top tier schools. The only thing they ever did wrong for her was support her to the hilt in anything she wanted to do no matter what they did. And she never ever speaks wrongly of them, ever. But it's not like her life was that hard or that bad. And if she did she doesn't talk about it and quite frankly she hasn't talked about it to the point where it's actually kind of dangerous. It was embarrassing. Dave hates to go to the doctors because whenever the doctor asks anything about family history he's like, "No idea." Me, I can do that on my mom's side of the family, makes perfect sense. You [get all this freaking] (ph) you went to the hospital if you wanted to get TB. You didn't get treatment! That's the thing. And [you can tell] (ph) all the doctors are like, "Oh, I know somebody that...I have a family that had to deal with this too. I understand it. These were bad places." So things didn't get diagnosed. [00:40:07]</p>

<p>But just being like the fact that people who had cancer or who had this problem found out all this random stuff, mostly on Dave's dad's side of the family, not much on his mom's still. But things that he never knew about. It is disturbing that they wouldn't have mentioned. I understand that on a heart (inaudible) but the alcoholism that they blamed one of Dave's many uncles on for having is because of the fact—not because of but it was spurred on by the fact of—that he had a cousin that died very, very young of cancer. And at the time people did give you drinks all the time. People encouraged you to get smashed back in the 70s when heartbreak (ph) happened. They don't not encourage it now. It was a lot stronger.</p>

<p>I'm not saying it's okay that he's an alcoholic. I've actually never met him but Dave didn't even know anything about this. And it wasn't like it happened before he was born. That's what is even weirder. It happened in 1978. So I don't know, I'm sorry if I'm over ranting here. It just makes me really angry. [00:41:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like I'm just over ranting on something that is...nothing of that important. It just makes me so mad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're unusually furious at what they've done to him, mostly because you see its effects on him and I bet because they've been that way to you and how they were with him also affects you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I bought in to so much of it—I still do—lock, stock, and barrel. It just breaks my heart because he's a good guy and the less he is around them the better. I will never ever be the person to put that in front of him though because I just can't. (pause) I can do what I can to protect him. And I've actually kind of sneakily kind of called up other people and said, "Hey, can you mention to Dave that blahblahblah," because I don't want to be the person that does this. Like, "Hey when you spend too much time around this person bad stuff happens. It's a bad influence." Because I don't want to be that put upon wife that pushes people away from their family. [00:42:41]</p>

<p>But I think that the biggest reason why Dave really—and I have family that is serious...I mean, we're not perfect. I mean it feels like he's drowning around her a lot of times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there's being the put upon wife who separates somebody from his family and then there's being a protective spouse who can see much more clearly because she didn't grow up with it, what his family dynamics are like and what it does to him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the worst part is I don't think they really see it as if there is anything wrong with it. They're still kind of proud of what they did. They still think that these kind of things are okay. And maybe they are okay. I really feel like for some people it is. A much more relaxed lifestyle is okay. But he's taken to these things like a duck to water. There's certain things he adores. Lots of thing he does like he's overwhelmed and crying with but there are certain things that he loves. (pause) And I think that (pause) by saying that these kind things are wrong makes it worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, Tuesday right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. [00:44:28]</p>

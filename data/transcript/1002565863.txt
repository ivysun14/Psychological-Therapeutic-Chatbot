<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
 
<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now what, okay, um, goodness gracious, okay, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] sent you over here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, what's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] want me to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he, I went to him, when I went to him the first time, he said how am I feeling and I just burst into tears, which I've never done in his office before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, as we talked he began to think that I might be depressed and so he gave me a medication to take and then he since upped it, uh, and uh, then after several months of it not really seeming to be really really effective—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He thought it would be a good idea for me to come here and, uh, see a counselor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you've been seeing someone here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I see, who is this, [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER], yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I forget the last name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she suggested that it would probably, or maybe someone else suggested, she said, someone thought I should see a psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, um, all right, when you burst into tears, what was the reason you burst into tears?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't know at the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so you just cried.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just cried.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just a whole bunch of frustration inside.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anxiety, depression or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I later, well after talking to [NAME OTHER] too, it seemed to come around to the fact that, in part, I had, uh, I had several surgeries in one year—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had bladder, not my bladder, well, two abdominal surgeries and eye surgery so she wondered if that didn't enter into it, some of the pressure of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One of our sons had gotten married, we were new grandparents, so a number of things but, uh, they seemed to just add themselves to each other to be a little more stressful than usual maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you feel, did you feel like you were under stress, [INAUDIBLE] stress?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no and that's what surprised me a little bit.  Of course, I don't think of the physical body in dealing with stress, I don't know why but I just think it's something emotional or mind or something and, uh, I was relieved really because I was getting rid of some of the responsibilities I had and I was looking forward to that because it had become more heavy responsibility.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Let me put this over here, so they don't hear me coughing so much.  Well, how's the, um, let's see, you're on Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Citalopram.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Citalopram or Lexapro, which is it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's in there, it's Citalopram.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Citalopram, Celexa, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was, yeah, instead of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how's it doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It took a while to do anything and then the main difference I felt was that I wasn't so irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My husband liked that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I never realized that something could make such a difference just in that one part of me because I don't like being irritable—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No more than he does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So pretty much the rest of you is okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, except I do have a number of things that I have seen kind of creeping up and as I thought to prepare for this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I began realizing that there were more, in fact I wrote them down because I was afraid I wouldn't remember them.  Memory is one of my things, some of the ones that everybody has, you know, with remembering names, remembering places and just where did I put that and forgetting to do things, things that come I think mostly, most people list, the age and I'm [AGE] so I guess I'm old enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're entitled to some of these things—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you want them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But the general feeling of mental confusion was one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Forgetting, uh, forgetting names of people, places, and things.  Uh, one of the ones that bothers me most is lack of initiative to do tasks, even the kinds of things that I enjoy and then, one of the big ones too is the longer and greater effort that's required to learn new skills.  We have a computer, about a year old, and it seems to be avoiding, avoiding me or I'm avoiding it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And our cell phone, I still have a lot of trouble figuring out how it works.  Uh, keeping up with home and church responsibilities, uh, I was on session at our church and that was one of the things I was really really glad, I enjoyed doing it but it felt like I was carrying a very heavy burden.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then my husband picks up things around the house so you can live that way but now it's just not quite fair for him to do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your husband does everything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not quite everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no quite, how much, does he do anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He does a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he really does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He does a lot of the cleaning and, uh, I do most of the cooking and he doesn't mind, he says he doesn't mind.  He really doesn't seem to but, uh, I just, it just, it's hard for me to get going—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To get the feeling of wanting to and I used to enjoy certain aspects of housework, not all of it but certain aspects.  Uh, I hate to be interrupted because then I can't remember what I was doing or where I was going or what I was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Planning and it does irritate me.  I've had some, occasionally confusion about medication.  I usually [INAUDIBLE] each morning and I somehow the pill or one of them changed and that kind of threw me off—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And things like that and we were both sitting there together so he's, he's kind of watching me more now than he used to I think.  Well, I make mistakes in some of my recipes, that's not a terribly big one but, and I have had some strange dreams lately but, uh, that include some of my family members and during the time, I've never done this before, I used to talk when I slept as a child—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, I am talking again but I'm also gesturing.  I wake up sometimes and I'll be trying to do something with my hands that has something to do with the dream, which seems odd to me.  I never, I don't ever remember doing that before.  Whether that's an effect of the Citalopram or it's something else—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel more, do you feel speeded up at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't feel that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes if I, if I have a deadline, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like if I haven't got anything for supper, it's just like I'm [INAUDIBLE], I get pretty anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have a lot of thoughts in your mind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thinking about two or three things at the same time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't really do that anymore because I can't focus on any one of them, I just have to keep my mind on one thing.  If I'm cooking, I can't have the radio on or I can't carry on a conversation at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can't multitask anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I used to multitask a lot.  I have three children and you learn to multitask when you have a family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, um, how nervous are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I'm a nervous person, I really don't but, uh, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Oh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was looking at, um, family, your mother had a nervous breakdown at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know that she was ever hospitalized, this was way back in the late 40's, there were children at home.  Uh, I don't know that she saw a psychiatrist, I don't' know, the terms have changed through the years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're right, you're right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she always called it my breakdown.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you have a sister, you have a sister who takes Lithium—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not for depression, for bipolar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bipolar.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and you have another sister with depression and two with alcoholism and a cousin with [INAUDIBLE] problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you've got a cousin with OCD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I see that, okay, and sister was arrested during a manic episode.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, huh, okay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your husband is a retired minister.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you a minister too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think if I had waited later to decide what to do, I might have been but nothing doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  [INAUDIBLE], well you're pretty healthy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't think I am, I have diabetes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you have [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, Gemfibrozil—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] involved—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Levoxyl, Citalopram, Zantac, aspirin, [INAUDIBLE] and you have an allergy to Erythromycin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And you saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] previously for depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel blue?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, not all the time but off and on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Off and on, and you've had some decrease in concentration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were easily irritated and you're now less so since you began taking the Citalopram.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I'm really [INAUDIBLE], a very definite change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're irritable without knowing why.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I, yes, that's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have restless legs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you don't have restless legs, you're moving your legs a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my feet more than anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't have restless leg syndrome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me ask you this, do you ever have experience of, have you ever had experience of waking up at night and not being able to move?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about anxiety dreams, do you have any of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't know what they, how do you describe them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Again, real, a lot of anxiety at night and you wake up, you can't move yourself—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or waking up out of sleep with a dream.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There is one other thing that I don't know if you noticed in there, my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and I had an aunt who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, that's a fact—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, uh, you know, my mother would be [AGE] now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and I had another aunt that had Alzheimer's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], so I guess I'm a little bit concerned about whether some of this that I'm experiencing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is Alzheimer's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, have you had a CT scan work up, that kind of stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, if that's what you do, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's generally what I do if I can get somebody to do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  Can you tell that way?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can tell whether or not you've got a shrunken brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I can tell you I probably do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe so.  Um, how distractible are you?  Are you real distractible?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We just had our grandson visiting and he distracted me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I can understand that.  Okay, let see your hands.  Yeah, they're warm and clammy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, um, see I'm wondering, one of the things that happens is if you have a sister that's responding to Lithium and has both highs and lows—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She doesn't have lows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She has highs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only highs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only highs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I might be the low one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You might be, have you ever had any of the highs like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you know of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Periods where you get real irritable for no reason for long periods of time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I used to get that way before my period but, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have that anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  That Celexa [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It helped the irritability, uh, definitely but I really can't say I see a lot of difference.  I still, I still, I'm not able to get myself going like I used to.  Well, I do things but I can't, I don't have the, whatever the word is, in order to just go and do things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm sleeping pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's that mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm just thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, let me take just a second.  You have glaucoma?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you have, what is the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cataracts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cataract.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have two cataracts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, um, you've got diabetes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, okay, let's see, one of the things I can do, if you want me to, um, I can give you something to help your mood, help your memory.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh you can?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want, if you would like to try that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, sometimes when people do have, I've seen it work in lots of different areas in terms of, um, it's given to people who have Alzheimer's disease—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it doesn't, it's not necessarily just for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've seen it, I've seen it help people who've had strokes, people who, um, who have side effects to medications, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, just in general sort of memory problems, you know, and it seemed to help that but it is the same stuff that works for Alzheimer's disease, it's called—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, is that Aricept?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, Aricept.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have a friend who's been diagnosed with early stage dementia—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's what she's taking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it helping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She seems to think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good, well I can do that and I don't think you have early stage dementia necessarily—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're aware of this, this memory thing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the fact that I don't seem to pick up things, you know, I used to be able to think better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I feel like I think, just, I did fairly well in school, I wasn't the top of the class but I did well in school and now I feel like it's such an effort to try to remember the things about the computer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And which button to push—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The logic of it I don't seem to understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll see what happens and you tell me, after we do this, you tell me what we, what [INAUDIBLE] and how you feel about it, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't seem like you need much of anything else—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right, grab the book, the great book of the pharmacies here, all right, let's see, Aricept is a [INAUDIBLE] drug as I remember.  [INAUDIBLE].  Okay, okay, we need to do Aricept 5 and do that for, oh, about a month or so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you need to take it with food so you don't get nauseated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And the next time we do this, you'll attest to it, it will tell me what our baseline is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see what we got [INAUDIBLE].  Um, all right, I'm not sure what else I want to do right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just do one thing at a time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very scientific.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that seems to, this is, has this bothered you, the memory?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It has.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can't, I meet people and I can't even remember their names—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have the same thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I do the same thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what I hear a lot of people say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I used to remember them, maybe you never did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean it's a real concern, you know, let's do something about it and we'll go from here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There was an interesting story from Reader's Digest, I'm going yeah, yeah, it says there was a college professor who was an ichthyologist—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and he was there and he was just wonderful with all his students and everything and someone said you really do a good job of remembering all the students names, he said but it's sort of disconcerting to me, he said why, he said well every time I remember a fish, I remember a student's name, I forget the name of another fish.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.  I thought you were going to recite one I could do, I could tell.  Like having a little clue word like belly—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Called Kelly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, nothing like that, nothing like that.  Okay, let's just see what happens and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get dry mouth with this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh dry mouth?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you can.  Nausea, all kinds of other stuff like that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh.  And you think I should continue with the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's just see where you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You read minds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well I, not necessarily.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not, I'm just, I just, I follow, I follow where you're going, anybody can do that, follow the end of the sentence.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so we'll see what we can do with this—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then we'll sort of reassess probably in about a month, six weeks—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A month, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You bet.  This is [PHYSICIAN NAME] again.  Um, this is an interesting lady that has a number of problems that I'm probably going to attack from a different direction.  Um, she's been scared and frustrated, um, and angry and irritable and the, um, Citalopram has helped her with that in that way.  Looking at her today though, she's still agitated and she is still speeded and, um, um, I'm curious about the sister being bipolar and having manic episodes.  Um, this person looks like they could almost be a carrier for the gene but yet that's not there, that could be part of the reason for her distractibility, inability to multitask and forgetfulness because that's what happens with, um, people who have a low level effective disorder, uh, they just can't get all their focus together but she doesn't give that flavor as much.  Her main concern is about her memory and she's anxious about that and feels over concerned and she's somewhat focused on that and with her history of diabetes, she certainly could have, and her age of [AGE] and her history of diabetes, she certainly could be having some early atherosclerosis or various plaques could be causing some problems with memory.  It's something, again, she's very concerned about and, um, I would attach that to, attack that too, especially since a friend of hers has had such a good result with Aricept.  Once we do that, then I'm going to, um, probably do a mini mental status exam to establish a baseline and explore other options.  Okay, thank you.</p>

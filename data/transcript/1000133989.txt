<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: Session 12. This is Session 12.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: May 25th, 1971.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to ask if I could talk to him in a few minutes because he's on campus and I was told that he could be bumming around until I need him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well want I want to tell you was that I was thinking more about what I said about the conference center and it's all true and I believe it. When I think of the conference center as a group, I think … And there are some people who are upset and for therapy too. So what I did when I went and talked to them one of those people, and asked him if he has time to see Murphy, if he wanted to do that. And he said he would but without me, that I could just give you his phone number and you could just give it to Murphy, and he could go and talk about whether they wanted to do that or not. It's not like having to buy into things that…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because he says he feels very, very uncomfortable with Sharon because she knows Murphy pretty well.</p>

<p>So I started thinking like where at the beginning we talked about what I expect of him with what was happening, and I was thinking that I liked very much what was coming up. Because I found your suggestions really helpful in getting me to think about what was coming out of and kind of active participation discussion is kind of what I need. And that realize it is really helpful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh that is very good to hear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really felt quite good about what is happening. And I realized most of the things that was happening was I was able to kind of bring out resentment and things that I could not voice to Murphy and hear myself say it and really examine them. And so be able to come back and talk to him about what was really bothering me. And having heard your suggestions on how to handle things with thinking them over.</p>

<p>And like what happened last time was, and what usually happens is I go home and have a long talk if something about him is bothering me specifically, which I wasn't able to do before the session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is kind of like having said it, it is more real to you or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saying it makes it more acceptable. I'm able better to hear what's bugging me really is something there. That that is where, that is the best place to handle this to come out with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like it is not a fantasy when you say it, it is just a projection…</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he is going to be able to handle that I'm not… being honest with him is not damaging. And that really helps a lot, it just really helps. (inaudible)</p>

<p>Like now if I'm not getting anything done, it's too easy, I'm kind of going to a summer session that is two weeks long and I have all these things to do like two papers and things I want to do around the house. And for research I can kind of work out in the lab.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's the thing – you're just kind of wasting time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm enjoying myself but I'm basically wasting time. I'm feeling bad that I'm not getting myself to work again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come that happens? He's not expecting you to be there because it's the summer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of. Also because, you see I always schedule things I have at the moment, is work. Everything between this free time. I keep putting things off, and finding immediately important things to do like the weekend is being swallowed up by these bike auction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the whole weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean like today and tomorrow. Because we have to go see them today. See the bikes today, then be there tomorrow morning depending on how long it takes for us to get a bike. Hopefully it won't take long. But there are all these nice little things that I want to do, other than the big important things I have to do. I'm doing all these … can I have a drink of water. [0:23:35.5]</p>

<p>I feel much better. All the nice little things kind of stretch out into other nice little things. And I could go on like this, I mean nothing would happen to me. But I'd much prefer to get my work out of the way, then do the nice little things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then I don't understand why it's happening then. Have you just suspended…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've just kind of suspended all (inaudible) slowly realizing I have to get back into it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you think you can just reinstate it, or do you think that it is going to be more difficult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what I think is going to happen like working the lab I'm going to have to make up a schedule of some sort. I feel I should start that next week or else I shouldn't bother, and I'll be picking out the (inaudible). Things that worry me at the moment are the paper. At least the thought of writing the paper I should have finished by now and I have not started yet. Merely out of… well kind of by the time the (inaudible) about the toaster I just can't think about all that research, there is just so much correlation and data to be done. And there are all these simple things I thought I would do, like paint the back porch and makes drapes for the front room, shit like that drags you down.</p>

<p>And I think well I'll finish those off kind of be refreshed, I'll go back and I'll work on the paper. But I haven't done them and I haven't worked on the paper. I'm starting to feel kind of bad about them. I'm starting to feel kind of hassled and a little panicky that I'm going to just going to totally throw the summer away. Next fall have three instead of one, and that would really be a drag. I'd like to finish all three, it is really important if I do decide to go in the artists (ph) program I do have to have my research finished. Also I've a feeling that they are not going to give me my scholarship unless I finish writing, and if I don't get my scholarship I don't go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right. But it sound like what you're doing now is trying to tell yourself that there are consequences for you fucking around now, while in fact from day to day there are both consequences aren't apparent, and you are having to get yourself thinking in terms of that. There's nothing in now to …</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is nothing in now to push me more. I kind of just think that I can muster the self-discipline without having to have immediate consequences. I don't know. I have to. I just really feel that I have to get by.</p>

<p>But as soon as I start working in lab that is a real chunk of it right there. But I'm finding it very difficult and I've kind of botched it. It's going to be very hard to get the papers done – one paper not so much because I don't need to concentrate, but the other paper, both of the other papers require research, a lot of it. I just don't feel it will happen.</p>

<p>But here I am, there is no way out, (inaudible), I botched it.</p>

<p>Like right now I'm in this peak where I could just go home and sit down and start working on it, but I can't, I have this thing to go to (inaudible). I've always …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the time…</p>

<p>CLIENT: The times when I do really get myself together are really the wrong times, like 2 o'clock in the morning, or right before I go to work. As soon as I hit the restaurant I really feel like sitting down and correlating all my thoughts about things, and all these nice ideas rush through my head. As I'm talking to people I'm having thoughts of that. And I just have no resistance whatsoever. Whereas when I get up in the morning, I'm perfectly ready to go back to bed. (yawning) That is about it.</p>

<p>Or I'll say to myself – well first I'll clean the utility closet and make a blueberry pie, and then with the rest of the day… However by the time I finish, by the time I get going there isn't that much of the rest of the day so when I'm finished…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you forget then at the beginning of the day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, but I do constantly. I constantly over-schedule myself. Always underestimate how much time it will take me to do things. I finally, like in terms of shopping and cooking, I always underestimate somehow exactly how long it will take me which is really frustrating because I wish to get all these things done, I don't. Just because my time sense is wrong, or else I won't admit how long it will take.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think you won't be able to…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think often I just won't admit it will take me that long. It is much easier not to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean on the ground if you don't admit it then you won't have to realize that you are going to have to meet schedules to do your work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. That I can kind of get away with doing a little and (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come you don't save yourself – I guess that means that what happens is that it's taken three hours instead of one to do a task that you are going to do before you study, and you say to yourself – oh dear, it has taken three hours, I guess I just can't do (inaudible) but I have done these other things.</p>

<p>But there is another way of looking at it which is something like, taking three hours to do it and that is because I tricked myself earlier in the day…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that is what Murphy says. That is what Murphy says.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About himself or about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, about me. I kind of come in and say, ‘Oh crap it took me…' . Or I come rushing in with this enormous load of things, and this and this, there's that and that, instead of going to Burman's (ph) I had to go to Andersons and Woolworths didn't have it, or I have to go here. I have to go the Auntie Anna (ph) and I'm hopelessly behind.</p>

<p>Oh I thought about more what I wanted to say to myself and I said to Murphy, ‘There is something wrong with me'. Jesus, it is really quite stupid of me not to… to keep on underestimating like this. There is something wrong with my brain. What am I not learning, what is going on?</p>

<p>It sounds like what you ought to be doing in those situations is saying, ‘Ok, at the beginning of the day, adding a factor of two to the amount of time… since you consistently estimate wrong, and you know that. You are going to keep on estimating wrong. You do something like multiply and see what that does to what you can do in the day. And it's not making accommodations like that…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you kind of don't think in terms of… well you kind of think in terms of if everything went right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I try to think I'll do as much as I can then I'll feel good about having this busy day ahead of me instead of looking at it realistically and saying I can only do these two things today. I shouldn't try to get anything else done until I've totally finished them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel frustrated at the end of the day when you don't do all those things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much, yeah. I just haven't accomplished as much as I wanted to get done today. I haven't gotten anywhere near it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess there is that bad thing about scheduling things that tight, but on the other hand you have this feeling of circumstance has full authority against you more than anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, not that I have not planned or that. All these little things that happen to me, which I think is part of (inaudible). It seems to me that that is just the excuse and not a true judgment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can it work then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, well it does work and it doesn't work. The worst is the beginning of the day finding stuff that you can't do for the day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you believe it at the beginning of the day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No but I hope it will. I mean I hope it works out that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh everyone would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but … I've usually got these little things that I plan to do or something that has to be done. I mean at one time or another but preferably much sooner than later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't do everything but you can't not do all those things…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I figure ok if I did them all today then if I don't get to do whatever the major thing is that I'll do it tomorrow, I'll handle it on a different day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what happens tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually something else. Tomorrow turns out to be unsuitable to do whatever for various reasons. Laundry has to be done in the next two to three hours. Or it is major shopping day, or I just wake up feeling irresponsible and Murphy suggests that we go to such and such and I say, ‘Oh great I'll do whatever it was later'.</p>

<p>And that is what happens about …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some of what happens is when you say you'll get rid of things in half an hour and (inaudible) next day, you forget about that. It makes like you're not keeping it right in the front of your mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there are always perfectly good reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah if it weren't for the other thing you have to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's almost as if I'm rewarding myself for having been good all year and putting everything else in front of my school work, I have all summer. But I don't have summer any more. I have all summer minus two weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really is kind of like you're starting to feel the time slipping away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me it wouldn't have been so bad if what you'd done was declare two weeks' vacation for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I kind of declared a one week vacation when I get back to work this week. But I didn't get back to work this week and then I kind of went to the lab at first got the research started. But it took me longer than it should have because I couldn't switch into gear, I couldn't focus my mind on it this way. I just thought I would finish before I thought I deserved a vacation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you made a mistake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I kind of did. I guess I did kind of declare a vacation for at least one week, but I wasn't realistic. I must have wanted to take two which I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably want to take all summer, (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I really do, but I have no choice I have to take…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing that seems worse to me is kind of thinking that you are doing it because you always planned it into the day. I guess it is the kind of complicated stuff deception and you'd probably go something like; ‘Oh I'm doing it, I'm going to do it at 4'.</p>

<p>You can't do it at 4 because blueberry kind of (inaudible)</p>

<p>‘Oh tomorrow.' Well I'm doing it right, because it is in my plans.</p>

<p>Well the fact is that it is in your plans but it never gets checked off and it always seems to me like it's even better to say, ‘Ok I'm not doing it this week, and that's all.' And not do it.</p>

<p>But this kind of juggling thing which we all do is really the worst of both…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that is what I just thought about it. It would be much less if I said, ‘Oh I'm just not going to do it. Which is what kind of happens when I get pressured. When I say, or when Murphy says, ‘Well what about …', and I say, ‘Well I've got it (inaudible) tomorrow. – and what about…—‘Well I just won't do it today, leave me alone'. Try to close the subject.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ‘Don't embarrass me'.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. I don't want to be hassled I'm just trying to skirt it and he's trying to push me in the middle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that is a kind of last… it is a last ditch …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That is only when I'm really pushed a lot. Otherwise I won't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to think that you're doing alright. How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I like to think that I'm self-sufficient, I can get it done. Well basically because I want to get it done. I want it out of the way, I do simultaneously want it not hanging over my head, but I'm not taking the steps to …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it is kind of like forgetting that thinking about it is really separate from doing it. And like you are putting in your mental time on planning or on and that somehow…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of the mental time is fruitful, I feel the mental time is not. The fruitful ones being – oh I have this body of information, how do I want to approach it and what do I want my first sentence to be and do I want to categorize it this way. How should I handle it and who should I highlight. Which all kind of goes on… I find it very difficult to just sit down and write a paper if I don't kind of percolate for a couple of days in advance, and kind of subconsciously and on top of my consciously worry about it a little.</p>

<p>With the rest of it, it is just; my God, when am I going to do it, I haven't done it, and I'll never get it done, and that is just takes my energy and time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm wondering is what is going to change this. Are you seeing it as something you're going to get to, or you're seeing it as a problem that you're not getting down to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I see it as a problem I'm not getting down to until finally I do sit down and start looking at it. But at this point frankly I don't know where it's going to be. I don't think it is going to be the (inaudible). Because I could possible start it Sunday but I haven't seen (inaudible) so I don't get …</p>

<p>And Monday is really time that I can screen down the two films that (inaudible). I know I should go down to the mall sometime Monday or Tuesday, preferably Monday because I'll be on campus. So I should be able to start it I hope on Tuesday (inaudible). And that would be nice.</p>

<p>I have to get, oh I have to get… – you see it goes on like this. The first step is going through all 65 articles or whatever and trying to categorize them and reading them or dealing with deciding where I want to place them in the paper, if I want to mention it by name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does this all amount to – if on Tuesday you don't sit down and do that, then you'll really …</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I don't have it started by Tuesday, if I have not reviewed my cards by Tuesday evening, and I kind of thought in some set form either on paper, some kind of vague outline, then I'm in real trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you will not get going…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll just kind of spend the rest of the week torturing myself, kind of convoluting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why would you do that instead of starting on Wednesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly I may start it Wednesday. It is very possible I may start, that I may start later in the week, but it would probably be difficult. Like I wouldn't make an effort to make Tuesday the whole and I start working on the lab on Wednesday to get myself galvanized and going. And once I've start it, I've started it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you don't have any trouble once you …</p>

<p>CLIENT: I pretty much don't have any trouble. It may take me a week, and I may not write it as concentrated as I usually do, which is sit down for like 18 hours and write the paper. But the paper is too difficult to do that. But I think once I get it going I feel guilty and worried enough about it to keep at it, and finish it.</p>

<p>Then I think, then I'm going to go through this whole process on the (inaudible) paper. But that is even more difficult because I have all the research to do. (inaudible) I still have about six or seven books to read on them, and that is going to be hard. I think the more I think about it I think the easier it is going to be, conversely it is going to be harder time-wise, but it is going to be easier after the lab.</p>

<p>Since I start working in the lab it is going to be kind of lost time. Some of the breaks in campus, to go in the library with regular, to get the things I need out of it, and to do the work there that I need. And the time being with people who are still working, instead of being with my friends who are kind of secretaries, or waitresses who are doing nothing, or just with Murphy who is spending time watching movies at the moment. I think that will help.</p>

<p>On the other hand I wish I'd got started beforehand just to take long, to get things done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't like to have to have those external things pushing you and putting you in situations where you're actually putting yourself into those situations?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. However it is more realistic to expect external situations to put me in that position. I mean that is just the way it works for me usually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is true. It is also true that you can… people can put themselves into situations that help them into doing things they want, instead of just that the lab is going to come on Wednesday.</p>

<p>You can think of that. I don't know. I don't know if that even sounds like it is really viable for you to consider doing it, or doing it at all. I know we're talking about (inaudible) and the that is the choice your making, and does it really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It isn't really viable. I really don't think—I think I will really just put it off, unless I were to all of a sudden wake up and say, ‘Today is the day'. So I don't think I'll do it on Monday.</p>

<p>One of the killingest things about days I pick is that they can never be days in which I end up with the evening is spent working.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: First of all (inaudible) is a terrible dampener. There is just nothing to look forward to. I mean I'll spend the whole day working on the paper, and what I'll do I'll get into my uniform and I'll run over to the restaurant. That would be just awful day. Also in terms of – well if I decide to cancel whatever activity and just work on this paper for the next 12 hours. I can't do that if I'm working and I really feel …</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm spending my time, as soon as my day starts working at the restaurant, because I usually have to be there at 4:45. And if I get up around 10 I feel that they feel I'm not going to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well at least it gives you six hours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But by the time I get started it's 12. My mind just works that way, (inaudible) really get going, get the momentum where I start breaking down, putting things …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the problems is, it doesn't seem like the constraints of your life allow that kind of temperament, that kind of way that you do it, to be very, to happen. It is more like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is a time that I have to work, and there is a way I approach that time, they complement one another. Because I have a limited space and time, yet I feel that in order to get working that I should have an unlimited space and time, but I don't have an unlimited space and time. I have a very limited sense of time, except in the middle of the week when I do pretty much have plenty of time, from Wednesday morning until Friday evening. That is my time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure that sense that is what you should do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure either but it is kind of interesting to me to think about how I approach it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is why you should try to change your work style, study style, somewhat, or realize that you can't do that other thing you've always been able to do? Like you should be sure on Friday…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think what it leads to is something that I do off and on, which is changing my study style and being more intense and more disciplined. Just not (inaudible) around as much. Knowing that I have a limited space (inaudible). I've had to do that all summer long (inaudible) lots of time on study. So that always takes me longer than I have to …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never get much done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I've found … and it's funny because my reading rate has gone down so much, I've got to be like everybody else. Then I used to gauge a fairly fast reading rate, but I just don't know anymore. Just about everything I've read has to be (inaudible). but there is no way around that.</p>

<p>And I know now, like as soon as I sit or decide to sit down and do the paper, I say, ‘Murphy look, the next few days just read the paper, you make dinner and you take care of yourself'. I really want to just (inaudible) that will be fine. (inaudible) and go to Don's for the evening. So do you want anything, and that will be okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think something different is happening now though, (inaudible). Then you said, once I decide to do that then he'll leave me alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he's not bothering me know, anymore than his presence as a free person who can say, ‘I'm going off to see these two movies'. And I'll say, ‘Oh yeah, ..'. Until I get myself together and really apply myself to the task, it's really easy for me to (inaudible). you're going to go do that, and I have no doubt.</p>

<p>My parents and I just talked on Monday, they are in Europe. I totally (inaudible) on one hand I knew that they got to go, they deserve it, they've been working hard (inaudible). on the other hand, it is very interesting that the amount of money they are spending to go to Europe is exactly, exactly the amount of money they used to spend on me, that really pisses me off a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that particular thing. That exact thing, is that the exchange they've made?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That they've taken, that they've withheld the money from me and it's been very, very difficult for me, in order just to gallivant off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is like a contrast between how painful not having that has been for you and how much pleasure they are getting out of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of what a luxury it is for them. (inaudible). to go flying around the country. Yeah that was the reason, supposedly, for cutting me off last summer. Because when I was a sophomore I took a long, I left New Hampshire to go to Chicago with Murphy and get a job there, which I did, and that was irresponsible. But they weren't giving me money so I could fly around the country. I kind of feel like I'm not giving them money so they can go to Europe, goddamnit (ph), for a month.</p>

<p>Problem is I really do feel they deserve the trip to Europe, I know it is making them very, very happy. They have always wanted to do this and they've always wanted to have the money, and they've always been short, and now they are not, now they can (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're glad about the things that they can do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I'm not happy about the consequences that it has for me. Because it has made life so much harder for me, this past year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So where does that leave you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it leaves me feeling totally fucked up about this, because every time I talk about them, it comes out double. I'm happy they are in Europe, the bastards, yeah. One part of me is like, ‘Oh wow they are in Europe now, I hope they find rashes (ph) and they never come back'. Really I realize that I'm totally mixed up about how I feel about the trip that they are taking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that you've separated rather carefully. What is confusing …? That one should have a more consistent negative or positive feelings about that, or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That I feel two-faced about things and when I talk to them I'm unable to them quite how much I resent them. A hour long telephone conversation (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So with them you're just happy that they are going to Europe. And they are having a nice time with this money, nice that they have money now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But in me, inside myself I'm very, very resentful of them. But I also feel I shouldn't be so resentful of them because it is their money and they deserve to use it. And they've just had so many bad breaks and stuff. So it's good for them, but it's not good for me.</p>

<p>How can they be my parents and things are good for them, and they are being bad to me simultaneously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How can something that is being so bad for me be so good for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It shouldn't be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or more like… it's not supposed to be this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah really. Like it is unfair. Really unfair, they just don't know what is going on. I have been unable to tell them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unable, not wanting to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I don't even know if I'd take their money if they were to give it to me, but at the same time I feel like they are withholding it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That they think that decision…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And I guess what I feel is that they've used Murphy as an excuse. And they've used… yeah, they've used Murphy as an excuse. They have used my so-called irresponsibility as an excuse to (inaudible) themselves instead of helping me out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean those were trumped up in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So really what was happening was that they wanted to go to Europe and …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. They wanted to visit last year and they were saving money, and what I did was gave them an excuse not to have to pay money to me so they could afford to go to Israel. Which made it possible, once they got into that whole trip, to take money to go to Europe. And what they really wanted to do deep down inside was to take the trip, and to get rid of this added expense.</p>

<p>So instead of being honest with me, they went through this whole trip about Murphy, which on an entirely different level is a real hassle that they have. So I don't think it is a monetary hassle, my parents show affection is never monetary. They have money to throw around to be monetary with their affections is just not their way of doing things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is kind of saying – it is so weird that they use money to comment on what they thought about your relationship with Murphy. That you can't believe that that is what it was really about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think a large part of it was about that I was an added expense and they wanted to get rid of that added expense, so they could do what they wanted. But I would much rather they had said to me, ‘Hey look, we're having a really hard time scrapping the money up to take the tour to Israel, how about can you afford not for us to pay your rent for a few months'. And I would have said, ‘Sure. Of course you should go to Israel. Sure. I'm doing well, of course I could pay my own rent. Why don't you just go ahead and when you see a way through give me what you can.' And I would have been fine. I would have done that. I really feel (inaudible). And even they themselves (inaudible). That if I had moved from New Hampshire to Chicago at a different time, then in the middle of their particular scriffing (ph) period to get the money up for this tour, that this whole thing wouldn't be going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was like an (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean for them I know it's kind of deliberate now they've had it all, I'm not even sure they'd admit it to themselves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean the kind of injunction of time. (overlapping)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so when they take off for Europe this year I feel that they are (inaudible) but they are just not admitting to it.</p>

<p>My father (inaudible) feels hapless about it. Like anything you need when you come home. I'll give you a coat, we'll buy you all these things you need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think (inaudible). His daughter he'll do anything for her, it's bullshit. It's crap, they don't do me any favors, it is just (inaudible). You are letting mom decide and you're just letting her anger and frustration and not being able to do what she wants talk both of you into shitting on me. I really feel like my mother is the force behind this decision and not my father. It is not something my father would ever do. My father is totally European, with family feelings, you know. I've never recorded him to do something (inaudible).</p>

<p>First of all my father was a giving-it-all, whereas my mother is very strong in feelings when she makes a decision in anger. When my mother is angry it infrequently comes out as very strong, she'll stick to it. And I feel very (inaudible) and I do love them a great deal, and I don't trust them for a dime. And I don't know whether to feel good or bad about them. I don't know how I feel about them. I feel simultaneously good and bad about them, and I wish I felt one way or the other.</p>

<p>If I hated them I could come out and say, ‘Goddamnit, I don't want to talk to you. Stop calling me, I'll stop calling you and when I feel like talking you'll hear from me. Bam.' Or else just forget about them. But every time I think about them I get both sides and I don't know how to deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of don't know how to act. How to act on your feelings, because you're feeling two different ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there doesn't seem like an action that could encompass both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sound very different before and after my phone calls with my parents than I do in the middle. I mean when I say to Murphy, about my parent to my friends, sounds very different that what I'm actually saying to my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which one is true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. They are both true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they are both only half true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I don't entirely love them or entirely dislike them and distrust them. And my basic instinct is just to continue pretending that we have a very close, very trusting, very loving. But my intellectual feeling is you can't trust these people, because they are going to turn around and do something nasty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't think you should let them in on your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not too much. They are just going to make a fuss. And at this point – like what Murphy and I were talking about the car, and I wasn't sure. And one of the possible ways was to get the car in someone else's name and me to take out the insurance in my name, so he is also covered. If the car is in his name, the insurance immediately goes up. His parents won't let the car be in his name. And my parents thought, ‘Oh well, we don't want to be liable with Murphy. Who knows what they'd do with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't trust them (overlapping). Do you think you are accurate in that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They might not actually like sell the title to the car or something like that. But it would just be a weapon in an argument, which I'm sure will be thrown in my face. I don't know when or how, but I know it would be. It would just be more, to them I would be in their debt if nothing else, they had done me a favor. Well I just don't want that. It is too dangerous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it is having to think in terms of the danger or how (inaudible) .</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I wish they would either butt out, or I would kick the (inaudible) to stay the hell out of my life, you know I could talk to them. But they are neither, they have got the advantage, the whole position there. They are not giving me the money, but they still want me to be their little girl. They still want to keep tabs on me, for me to call twice a month – and tell them how I am, and how I'm doing in school, and am I doing this, and has Murphy cut his hair, and this and that. Fuck that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now it's dealing with the fact that you really don't want to be calling them having such nice conversations at least on one aspect that you don't. You really don't think they deserve it, and you don't think you want to tell it to them, either one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to have to deal with the hassles that they create. I don't want to have to deal with their standards, I don't want to have to justify myself to them, and getting nothing from them except demands for justification. I'm not getting emotional reinforcement from them anymore. I don't trust them enough to be open to get that. I'm not getting any sort of monetary reinforcement from them. What else have they got to give me, except hassles?</p>

<p>And I really wish we could get into some kind of fight where I can tell them that, but we never do. We're both, both of us are being so damn polite to one another, so concerned. As if nothing has happened, and it has. A long time ago the storage, I'm still very upset.</p>

<p>What happened the direct correlation I just haven't (inaudible). I have no intention of spending $60 dollars to go out there and be (inaudible). Fuck that. I guess as we take a trip to the east coast we'll have to stop by. I wish we didn't have to, I don't want to have to go there. I don't want to have to bring Murphy there. There is nothing for me to do in New Hampshire except fight with my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've kind of done, you've done one thing, but you could manage without having to really say (inaudible). Is that how it works?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't have the mind to take a trip out there. And right now they don't have the money to pay for my trip. Fine. Yeah, it's just I don't want to come see you.</p>

<p>It would be quite possible to say that and have my father literally have a heart attack (inaudible). I would not want (inaudible), because he takes abominable care of himself and the heart condition that he has. So I don't think I ever could just force a showdown like that, hang up on him.</p>

<p>I really feel the person I would be hurting the most would be my father. And the person who is hurting me the most is my mother. And what is the point of destroying my father, because that is what would make me (inaudible). I mean ultimately that is what would have the most consequence. My mother is the type of person who would be hurt by it, very much, but I think she would have the patience to wait and say, ‘Well this can be patched up, I can let this lie for a while though it hurts me very, very much.'</p>

<p>Whereas my father I'm afraid would maybe become ill. He would take it as a direct insult to him. So really that is an effective thing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Effective? You mean it wouldn't hurt the person that it's meant to in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it hurts the wrong person. It wouldn't get the message across. It wouldn't change anything. It would kind of be doing to them what they did to me, and I do feel that what they did to me was totally reprehensible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You also don't think it is really confusing, do you, after this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except on a real selfish emotional level, which I occasionally voice that I would like to do, but I could never actually do it. So I'm stuck. I really feel stuck. Anything that I would do I don't like doing. Yes I could go (inaudible) but at the same time I don't want to hurt my father by not talking to him, by totally severing all communication with them.</p>

<p>He was (inaudible) and I really believe he does not have very much longer to live. So I don't know, I guess I just keep on going the way I'm going, even though I'm uncomfortable with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The discomfort of it is that it doesn't fit at all really, it doesn't fit the complexity of your feelings at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is another half of that. It is like with them everything is fine, you're really close. And then with Murphy and your other friends, everything is shit and you hate them, and wish they would crash.</p>

<p>And so there isn't any (inaudible) the two things are both there. Or you don't ordinarily express both of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ordinarily I express both of them (inaudible). You know occasionally conversations turn in a family. Usually when I mention my parents it is in the (inaudible) and half the time I mention them very warmly to people I'm close to. And the other half of the time I mention them as people who are totally crappy. There is just no consistency to how I …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is consistency what you want – like one way of feeling about them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two would do great. I mean I'd like sort of an amalgamation. I'd like one definite way to feel about them, that I could take an action that would fit the feeling. Then there wouldn't be any dichotomy there.</p>

<p>If I could hate them then I could tell them to get out of my life. But I can't hate them. If I couldn't entirely trust them then I could say, ‘Fine I'll talk to you, I'll give you conferences, we'll be close again.' But I can't entirely trust them. So I can't get whatever emotional reinforcement I could get from them. I mean that could be very important if I was close with my family I could turn to them. I'm not close with them. I don't trust them and I don't plan to . there is not even a feeling that is already there. As far as I'm concerned New Hampshire is (inaudible). This is where I live, there is no other place to go. I'd never go back there (inaudible). Unless there was something that happened to one of my family. Then I'd have to go back there. If it was something that happened to me, I'd go to Harper (ph) I wouldn't go back there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is a pretty profound.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that is a real change. So I feel I'm getting the dirty deal. I'm the one that has to jump between strings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In addition to everything else that they are getting out of this deal, the thought that they don't have to (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. As far as they are concerned I'm their daughter, they (inaudible). They forgot that they are not giving me money. That is the happy fact. I'm self- supported. And they are getting kind of used to the fact that there is Murphy, and there has been Murphy for a year. There is probably going to be Murphy for a number of years more, and they are getting used to that.</p>

<p>My mother is a long file that she has of things I did, she's now going to keep tabs on who my friends are. (inaudible) That really freaked us out. So they are getting used to Murphy and they probably talked the whole thing over and they are patching it together, and ignoring that I'm their little girl. But I'm not their little girl, goddamnit (ph), and they define me. They put me through all kinds of incredible shit. They are still putting me through all kinds of incredible shit and I'm the one who has to deal with that and not them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in fact you would like them to have to deal with that. And you would like them not to have forgotten that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think it's (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay so I think we'll stop (inaudible). So I think what we should do is you can call me here, because I think that I'll be here like Monday and Tuesday. And if I'm not (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Bye.</p>

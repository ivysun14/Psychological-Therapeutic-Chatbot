<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm cold.</p>

<p>I had kind of a strange day yesterday. More and more it just seems like more of the same. (laugh) So I, this friend or this classmate, he works for this magazine and he like wanted to take up the editing for the magazine. And like, I didn't even submit the, you know, it was just like his enthusiasm and all that. And he was working with the editors and they liked him. He told me that then they'd publish it in the next issue. But like yesterday I found out that what he just forwarded me the editor's e-mail that you know, it needs more work, we are very busy right now, so, maybe she can work on them on her own and resubmit in the summer. And I was like completely shocked and like crying, (laugh) so basically a mess. [00:02:11]</p>

<p>Because I was like what's the damn deal. And you know I just took the colleague's word for you know. And I e-mailed my professor, and like what is still going on and I don't want to work and I cannot submit my assignment, the final project because I just basically shattered and. (laugh) And you know I told Chris and he was very upset and the whole day at school was just like blah and Chris was like, he felt very, very badly. He's like, he, because I kept saying I'm sorry man you couldn't really see that. So he was like yeah, I'm just not giving you what you need and he thought, you know we should end it. And - [00:03:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't understand the connection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The connection between your work not getting published right away and Chris saying we should end it. I'm not sure I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it is - you know this is when we went for years, where like I get a rejection and then I feel completely and totally like inadequate. And then you know say that out loud and like, you know this is so bad, and I'm not a good girlfriend and this and that. And he was, he's been feeling inadequate as well. Because he's like, you know you should be with someone who can, I don't know bring you out of your state of depression or bring, or make you - basically saying I can't do anything. I cannot connect you with agents like other friends have. Artist boyfriends and they connect them with agents and editors and Chris cannot do that and he feels inadequate in other aspects as well I guess. (laugh) So he was just like, well, maybe we should just. And he felt (laugh) and I was like wow, you know I've lost you know, him as well as you know just, but. [00:04:31]</p>

<p>I've been think about all that a lot, just, but like in the evening, I spoke to the assistant, the program assistant secretary and he's was you know, very calm about it. (laugh) So I just sent the editor an e-mail. And you know, at first I thought wow, this is kind of underhanded and you know so manipulative of me. Because in the e-mail he'd written to the, to my colleague he said you know do you have other skills, I need help, this and that. So, I just took of my intentions the fact that I had seen that exchange, (laugh) and wrote to the editor saying you know, hey, here are your needs, (laughing) someone to work on the website. And I have many years of experience. Here's your portfolio and then and I'd love to be able to volunteer for the magazine in this way. [00:05:31]</p>

<p>So at first I thought it was very underhanded and I told Chris (sp) then he was like ah, you know you are so this and that. But then the editor got back to me and was very nice, he was - [00:05:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's this and that. What's this and that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, just like you know, I am underhanded and you're going to get into trouble by doing this you know. Because I thought you know, like the editor would read it and go yuck, you know she's just so desperate and whatever. And you know he would be, he would refuse immediately and you know. But he was actually very nice. He said you know, yeah, let's chat when you're free and I thank you for your piece, you know, work on it some more and send it back and. [00:06:13]</p>

<p>I don't know, like it wasn't such a crisis for him because you know he doesn't know that my professor wanted to send it off to a contest and because it was being considered by him I couldn't. I mean it's all like, I'm really close to him, and it's like it's a big deal for me and I'm all you know like dramatic about whatever happens to it, but. You know, outside it's, everyone is like, everyone has the right perspective and they're like Waria (sp) why are you getting so worked up about something so little you know? But I just kind of (laugh) I get into this thing of a downward spiral and whoever comes close to me gets injured. (laughing) [00:06:58]</p>

<p>And so. I mean it's true like, you know my professor (laugh) I mean like okay, you know, she goes, you're going to be okay, right? (laughing) She's wondering who - [00:07:08]</p>

<p>THEREAPIST: I'm sorry, I'm really not following you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laugh) Oh yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: About what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The professor. There's just -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you, why do you - it seems like this is something you're not happy about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The whole situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah. I mean it was a mess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think you're giggling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling like a bitch. (laughing) [00:07:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I'm just trying to say that - I'm trying to quickly (laugh) explain a scenario I guess. (pause) But what I was trying to get at was that I feel a lot of anxiety comes from being with Chris. And I'm not trying to blame him. But it's just that you know he's there and his judgment means so much that it makes me like second guess myself. [00:08:19]</p>

<p>I mean I want to be self aware, that's you know, that's, that's good. And I think if you are in a relationship you will only grow as a person. But then I feel like there's this negative side to being in a relationship. In my case where it just brings a lot of anxiety and a lot of self doubt for myself and for Chris as well. [00:08:45]</p>

<p>Like would I bring more? What I learned yesterday was that you know, I had this you know, bad thing you know. Had I not been at school yesterday, I would have been a lot worse. That would have, you know, that downward spiral would have lead me you know, into very dark places and this and that. But I was at school and I had to work and I had other people around me so, you know, the situation was a lot better you know. [00:09:13]</p>

<p>And how I dealt with it might be an underhanded way but I, I mean that was my way you know. Like that was the only thing I could think of. And you know I did run it by the secretary as well you know, it's like you know, I had this idea in my head you know. Editor's what do they know about even struggling artists? Everything is you know being like, oh yeah, this is not ready yet and they don't know the weight of their words and all that. [00:09:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the weight of their words?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean - rejection is so like horrific. In my case (laugh) you know I've had so many, it feels like, it's just like ten tigers. I'm carrying it around with me. I wish I could let it go. I wish I could take, carry it just the light weight of my success. Successes, but unfortunately I prefer to carry the weight of my losses. [00:10:10]</p>

<p>But like he, so I mean he has, the editors would have a completely different scenario and a third person would be able to you know, sympathize with me, but someone who knows the editor would say, which is what the secretary did. He told me that, normally he's a pretty nice guy. You can probably even approach him and meet him and talk to him, and you know. And if you want to offer him help, that's very nice of you. You should feel free to do that. Because you know, he's very, he'll be very open to that. And that was very good for me to hear because (laugh), even though my approach was underhanded, that's how I chose to deal with it. Because, I mean it was a risk, but I mean, I chose to take that risk because I kind of know that you know, like small magazines are always in need of help. And if you offer them your help they're not going to I mean, probably not going to (laugh) refuse it, so. [00:11:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that that will help you get your work published?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean I do have that motive. I mean why I mean I'm not going to lie and say, no I don't. But I'm hoping you know, by meeting with him, he'll be, he'll you know, I won't just be a name on the page, I'll be a person. And you know if I can free up some of their time, then they may have some time to like work with me. Because their knowledge is very specialized and like you know, not even my professor may be able to help me in the way that they can to edit. Because they really know what they're, you know in what forum the piece will look best published. So you know, they - yeah. [00:11:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're desperate to have them publish your work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! (Laughing) I kind of told people that because the, my colleague said yeah, it's a done deal. They'll publish in the next issue. So I kind of started telling people (laugh) and now I'm like great. How am I going to tell them (laugh) that it's not going to be published, and. [00:12:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you imagine it will feel like if it were published?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. I mean then my career has finally started (laugh). I've only had like online publications until now. So it would be like print publication would be. And my other colleagues have already started getting published anyways and I'm like anxious to be in their league you know (laugh). So - [00:12:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So a kind of recognition?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and like I said, start off my career and you know, I've give up so much to pursue this. You know, good jobs and stop living with my mom and this and that, so. I mean this is what I want to do and so. (pause) [00:13:24]</p>

<p>But I feel like if I weren't in a relationship I would be, I wouldn't have this constant need to run every decision of mine by someone, you know? And it's funny like, I don't just look for approval, I look for disapproval too (laugh) when I do something bad or wrong you know, not completely right, you know (laughing). [00:13:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're anticipating that Chris would scold you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well he would just be like, Oh, my God, oh, my God, he would you know, beat his head with me (laugh). So, what I don't realize that you know, he's not me. He's a different person. Then the way he may take what I'm doing, can be very, can have you know, adverse effects on our relationship, you know. (laugh) [00:14:29]</p>

<p>Like yesterday like, when as soon as I got the news I was you know, like feeling very bad about myself and I was like, and I saw what Victor (sp) had done like kicking me out. And I told Chris you friend was right you know. Like the reason is that like, you know I have this like strain which is, you know Victor (sp) kept saying a negative strain. And I'm just certain what that meant is that you know, in a relationship and like you know, more specifically in a sexual relationship, that negativity effects you know, people's sexuality and like you know, I mean that's what I was saying. I'm not like, I'm feeling so horrible right now. But I (laugh) do not anticipate being able to be intimate with you in, (laugh) in the near future. [00:15:40]</p>

<p>So I mean, that is - and you know he felt bad. He was like how can you compare me my friend and all that. But I mean I just fear that the you know this is, this is what happens when I feel bad and like limiting that badness, just not containing it within myself is probably what I should do and not like harm other people as well. [00:16:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure I understand how you're harming them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I feel, I mean am I not harming them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how are you harming? I don't understand how you're harming them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Looks like harm. I mean he was sad. Chris was sad yesterday. He was so, he was really sad and the look - we were going to school together you know, on the train and on the bus. I was like crying and you know he was off to the side. And then you know like, but then soon as we were walking down the hall and as soon as he met some, just this new woman in his department, I couldn't see them, I heard them. But like he was like oh, hi! He was like completely, you know changed his tone and demeanor. And I was like, you know, no wonder you know like, that's the kind of women men like. [00:17:18]</p>

<p>Or you know people, people, other people like, you know. Like light and you know, happy, and I mean I'm just, I'm releasing you know Victor (sp) of this. But you know like, I mean that's what he said to me, sorry I just want to be in a happier relationships. You know like, so. You know like duh, yes. Of course. You know like, look at that interaction you know, that's what people what. People want to be happy. People want to be smiling and feel good about themselves and not be dragged down. [00:17:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like people are happy all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the impression Victor (sp) gives. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you believe that? Do you believe that most people are happy all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is Chris happy all the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's too busy to be like oh, what am I feeling. (laughing) You know? But yeah, that is happiness for him you know, completely like submerged in his work. And like too busy to notice what he's feeling. That is, that is his state of contentment. I really wouldn't say happy but content. So yeah, he's - [00:18:36]</p>

<p>I felt so awful. I was weeping. As soon as I start, as soon as I heard him you know talk to that other woman. I just felt like (sigh), you know why can't I be like that. You know why - [00:18:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do people never have hard times in their life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm serious. I want to understand how you think about things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if they do, they handle it better. They shut the door, their door and like deal with it. You don't see them. But then when they come out they're all, you know all sorted out and ready to mix and mingle and be, and share my you know, vivacity with you. (laugh) [00:19:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you think that couples ever talk about problems?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, maybe they do in a way that is more adult like. Well that's what Chris says anyway is that I have a lot of childlike tendencies, so. (sigh) It can be very frustrating to deal with. [00:19:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would, what is adult like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When not be such a mess. I mean, I don't know. (pause) I mean the thing isn't just that I feel bad. I feel bad that I feel bad. (laugh) [00:20:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's double, it's a double like beating on my head. [00:20:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I have, and that's what Chris was saying that you know, like he should just not be so worried perhaps. You know, that he is in a relationship with an artist and artists get rejected, so he shouldn't, he shouldn't be, he should get used to that, he said. [00:20:44]</p>

<p>I supposed I should too. (pause) I don't know, I just keep thinking about there's something better out there for him and I'm keeping it, keeping him from it. (pause) I just feel so embarrassed and so like, yeah embarrassed. That I have this thing that I cannot shut the door and deal with properly and you know. That it's all exposed and out there for everyone to see and look at and pass judgment on and. [00:21:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you imagine being with someone who suits you during those times where you're distressed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what would suit me. (laugh) I usually do, I usually push people away when that happens. And this is not like a very recent thing. It, I was like this in college as well. I remember this was my goal was well like, I would get a bad grade in calculus and I'd just want to hide. And he would be all sweet and try to, you know, pull me out. But I wasn't ready to be out and I would just let that dark period have its, run its course. And then I'd come out. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it help, did it help just to know he was trying to make you feel better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I pushed people's kindness away so rudely and so like, yeah. I mean angry. (sigh) I really am very, very mad when I hear Chris are trying to be sweet (laugh). I don't know why. (laughing) It makes me feel worse. (laugh) [00:23:02]</p>

<p>But like completely in this case, I feel like I just do not measure up to Chris, you know. I keep feeling like that. And I keep feeling like bad and just the material conditions just don't change. (laugh) Like he's up here and I just cannot get there. (laughing) So, no. [00:23:32]</p>

<p>(long pause) I feel like people have like a certain set of expectations. Like you should be like this, you should act like an adult. You should this. You should that. And I just, I fall short of all those shoulds, you know. And that makes me, I mean yeah, that's what- [00:24:27]</p>

<p>(long pause) But you're trying, are - what was your question about like, if I can, deserve someone more supportive? [00:25:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wasn't - yeah, I mean one thing I was questioning is it sounds like when you're distressed you feel like you should take care of it all by yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My mom was like that. I think I get it from her. Like she, and this pisses me off a lot that you know, she doesn't even tell me after the whole thing is gone and done or you know even much worse. Or yeah, resolved. But that's just how she is. She says you know, like she has to deal with it herself, and I guess and I wonder if I'm just like that, but. [00:25:55]</p>

<p>But I've always been in a (laugh) relationship, do I don't remember. Well maybe in little things I'm able to do that. But then like don't like rejection and all like, I mean the pain just doesn't go away. It's very, very firm. And it's not something you can fix, you know. So instead it makes you feel horrible about yourself every, just days. [00:26:24]</p>

<p>(long pause) Well - it's not something I can even deal with. You know like, what maybe yesterday it felt like I deal with it because I'm quite close to, I don't know (laugh) these people. And I didn't want to take no for an answer. I'm like oh yeah, see you next summer, you know see you in the summer. No. (laughing) You know. (laugh) (sign) So. [00:27:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you felt something was given to you and then it was taken away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) And I feel like I can do something about it. I can fight. And that's what I felt like doing. (laugh) I mean I feel close in the sense that they like it and they need work, it's just that they, they don't have time right now to work on it. And if I could just change that, you know, like if I could do some of their work for them, then they'd have time. (laugh) I don't know. It's thought. It's you know, we'll see. [00:27:57]</p>

<p>(long pause) (laugh) (sigh) (pause) Yeah, but I feel bad that people around me are feeling bad that I'm feeling bad. (laughing) [00:28:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, I don't understand why Chris was feeling badly. I mean he knows this about you. Won't mean then, I don't understand that piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What piece?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why he was feeling bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well first of all he was feeling bad because he, I mean because he's seen me through this like. And he, yeah, because you know, he's like you know, you're so close. And you know, they said one thing now they're going back. And so he felt the disappointment as if it was happening to himself, you know. He felt bad. And then he felt that he couldn't do anything about it I guess. He felt helpless. [00:29:34]</p>

<p>So and then he was like, you know if I were with someone else, maybe they would somehow be able to do something that he is not able to, so. It's always this existential crisis with us because of you know, it's the past few months. So - [00:29:59]</p>

<p>(pause) He kept saying, you know Cecelia (sp) what are you getting out of this? You're not getting anything. You're not getting anything. (pause) What do people get out of relationships? [00:30:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, clearly you want to get something out of a relationship because you're in them. You're hoping for something, otherwise you wouldn't bother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why else? Are you in relationships because you have nothing better to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I mean I like, sorry I'm just think of you know being by myself in the apartment. And like being with Chris. I just like the coziness of being with someone you know. Like I like that when you're cooking, it's not just for yourself. It's for you know, two people or more, you know. And you know, I like that you have work to do. I don't like it but, I mean it's there, but then you have work to do, but you also have to make dinner, so you, you know put aside your work and make dinner. But, I don't know. I don't know. (laughing) [00:31:53]</p>

<p>I've, I guess I like feeling that I'm special for someone, you know. They don't feel for anyone else what they feel for me. That is like, yeah, just that. That position that feels like a pedestal. That I'm on that pedestal, you know. (laugh) Then there's all this other stuff, you know, like not being attracted physically to him. And then not, yeah. [00:32:34]</p>

<p>(long pause) I don't know, I just keep, I waste a lot of time (laugh) comparing myself with other people. Like other couples and then just other women and stuff. (pause) But I feel like I get to the, I am getting to the point where I'm like this is me and that's it. But it's, in a lot of aspects I wish I would change, but I'm not really sure how to or if I even want to, you know? (laugh) [00:33:47]</p>

<p>And then like Victor (sp) been friending all these undergraduates online. (laughing) And some of them you know, they have photos and I would get, I would look at the photos. And some women, they're just you know, bold I guess. And you know they take photos of themselves in their homes. You know and they're wearing tank tops and whatever and they're you know, they're well endowed. (laugh) And you know, so I guess someone like Victor (sp), or just like men in general, they, you know, they see that and they think ah-ha. You know like, this woman is, I don't know bold or whatever, and. (laugh) You know what I'm saying, trying to say (laughing). [00:34:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know, that she is - I mean, well what do you make of?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I'm not sure where you're - I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just mean, yeah, just that they're comfortable with their body image and whatever. And you know but, they think they're sexy or whatever. But I absolutely cannot do that. You know, I cannot take such photographs of myself. (laugh) You know I cannot, you know. So. [00:35:16]</p>

<p>So and I'm not going to be that woman, so. And I'm fine with that. (laugh) I just feel like is that woman what men want? You know should I be like that? You know like I shouldn't affect my rejections so much that I cannot be intimate. But then it's not just that I cannot be intimate. It is that I can't be intimate and plus the fact that you know, not being attracted to Chris physically. I don't feel like being intimate anyplace. So. [00:35:59]</p>

<p>And I just feel that I'm keeping him from someone normal and adult (laugh) as he says, you know like adult. Someone fabulous. Someone like the woman in the hallway. (laugh) You just see them and say hi and just have like a light relationship but then you know. Don't have to get in all that mess, you know. [00:36:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you feel that relationships between people are superficial?</p>

<p>CLIENT: After Victor, (sp) yeah. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that superficiality would be gratifying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: First of all it would be, probably be such a welcome change (laugh) from the way that I have experienced relationships. And it would be, you know a nice break from the sharing of all the muck, you know. It would be as if the muck is not there for you know, at least those few hours. [00:37:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're so, a feeling - I definitely am so like heavy and weighty so much of the time, that it would be nice to look at the superficial elements (laugh) for, you know. Like the think that attracted me to Chris all those years ago was his gravitas. You know like his political bend and his you know, ambition and his, yeah, wanting to do something very different. That's what attracted me to him. [00:38:05]</p>

<p>And I did notice that he, I mean he wasn't you know conventionally good looking. Or that you know, I wasn't attracted to him. I mean I noticed that, but I ignored it and now it's like, he you know, he adored me all those years ago, here's you know this problem back again. But, so yeah, I mean it would be, superficiality would be nice. (laugh) [00:38:32]</p>

<p>I mean I'm not saying he, I don't know if it's a basis for a long term relationship. But who wants that? Clearly no one does. (laugh) [00:38:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think so? What about Chris? He does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what makes him different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's just a much nicer guy than Victor (sp). (laughter) But maybe he's nice because not even good looking. (laughter) [00:39:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are those related?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm just being facetious, you know like, those of us who are not good looking have to be, have to compensate for that. But being nice and being caring (laugh) I mean, you know like you just, you know this one girl that you know the brats that are in the room can be cruel and get away with it because (laugh) you know. So. [00:39:35]</p>

<p>I don't know. (pause) But I do seriously think that we, or I give a lot of weight to the non-superficial elements and it would be good to be light again, you know. To be superficial a little bit. I don't know. (laugh) Be good to be balanced, you know, I feel like I'm not balanced. [00:40:18]</p>

<p>(long pause) Do I seem very confused? (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel confused?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) Again you know, should I be grave or superficial? And they're two extremes. (laugh) And I know that probably the answer is to be in the middle. To have a balance. To have a little bit of both. And I'm trying to get there I guess. [00:41:13]</p>

<p>I don't know, I just want to be you know, happy and make other people happy. And like more than that I guess, more than being happy and making other people happy, and this is new, but I want to know myself. Like I want to be comfortable in who I am. Like I want to be like all the other women online, you know? (laugh) I'm not a man, sorry, you know. Yeah, I'm not sorry. [00:41:52]</p>

<p>I'm not wearing a tank top and taking my photo in my room. (laugh) And it's great that they can do that you know, I'm not calling them any names at all. There's no value judgment you know, of them. If that's them, it's great, but it's not me. I am sexually suppressed, yes. Thank you for pointing that out, but no. (laugh) [00:42:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, thank you for pointing that out Victor?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughter) You know, and that, well that's who I am, you know, I'm not, I cannot be. I'm not going to get there anytime soon, if at all, you know. (pause) Yeah. I want to do something different. I want to be successful. I want to work. And that's my high you know. (laugh) My everything. That's my low right now, but. (laugh) I'm not so lonely. But I just want to be happy with the decision to be me, you know? [00:42:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a very different place then where you started off the session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laugh) I'm just tired of being frustrated and being kind of neurotic. (laugh) So it's fun. I'm not fun at all and you know, but it's a challenge. [00:43:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you were devastated the last two days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't sound fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I was being sarcastic, but. (sigh) But it's just like being with Chris is so like I take it too hard, I take it too seriously. And he is so awesome, but, I just, I look up to him so much that you know, my neck aches. (laugh) (pause) I mean it's not him, it's just, it's me that I feel inadequate and because I see him as having accomplished so much you know. So. [00:44:26]</p>

<p>(pause) I don't know how I can feel differently about that you know, about that. About being in a relationship with him. I don't know if this time that Chris will ever change. (laugh) I don't know what you think. [00:44:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I think it will?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The dynamic of how you feel about him and?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. When does that happen like, when people who have been together for seven years, and you know, they see each other in this way. And then there's reasons for seeing, I mean you know. Being intellectual difference it means two people are their accomplishments, do they ever feel equal you know? (laugh) [00:45:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I hope to help you think differently about yourself and other people in general. And so will that impact how you see Chris? Probably. In either directions, seeing more of his limitations and feeling that's not for you. Or seeing more of his qualities that you admire and living with the things that he can offer. It could go either direction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop today, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you on Monday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More days, a couple of days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, more then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's more. More days than just this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye. [00:46:15]</p>

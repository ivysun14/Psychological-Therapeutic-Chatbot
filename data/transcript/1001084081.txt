<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how have you been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, what's new?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, have a good Christmas?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Did you guys stay home, I can't remember?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we stayed home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get some things that you like or wanted for Christmas?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good and now you're back in school?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your last semester.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and it's been, I have a good schedule.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, what do you have?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> On one day just one class which is really nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And on the other day it's three classes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  So five days a week still, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So three days you have a longer schedule and two days a week you just have one class?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow and what classes do you have?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Photography, PE, [INAUDIBLE] contemporary problems which is like issues of the day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the other is abnormal psychology.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that a tough one or not too bad?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not too bad really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They have a project in the last semester but I'm not too worried about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, yeah, it sounds like it's not too touch a schedule which is usually the way it is your senior year, you know, you got all the tough ones out of the way, you get to kick back a little bit so that's nice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just amazed because, you know, they were screaming at me last school year that if you don't do all your classes now you're going to have a very full schedule next year and I mean it's light, I was expecting a very full schedule.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you have enough, you're going to have enough credits to graduate then with this schedule.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have to pass all my classes but yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay, well that shouldn't be a problem for you, you're a good student so good.  How'd you do grade wise last semester, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I passed everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good and how are you doing about getting to school, are you doing okay, are you having trouble?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> About the same as usual.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so maybe you're missing a day a week.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or something like that.  Okay and it seems like they're okay with that, they haven't -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Given you a hard time about it.  Okay, good, and how have your spirits been overall?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, a little down still.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you notice some fluctuations during the course of the day or the course of the week, do you get sometimes where you feel okay and sometimes where you feel down or do you feel down all the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Fluctuations I guess, it kind of depends on what I'm doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay so if you're doing something that you enjoy then you feel pretty good - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's down like during the school day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and then when you get home in the evenings and can have your own time then you feel better or weekends do you feel better?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you know what you're going to do yet after this year?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have no idea.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to work or go to college?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know I want to work on my driving.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd be glad to try and move out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But then I'd have to, I'd either have to get a job or go to college.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know which one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so I'm just thinking, so you're considering going to college?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you thought about where yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I just figure, kind of a small campus and also just something that offers the classes I want, otherwise I really don't care.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and do you want to stay like in [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, at least for the first few classes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so maybe like [DEIDENTIFIED] or something are you thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, because that's familiar and you take whatever you want.  I'm thinking the options of [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED], I think are the three I know of.  I don't know if, I know [DEIDENTIFIED] doesn't have a deadline for applying.  [DEIDENTIFIED] probably does but I don't know what it is and [DEIDENTIFIED] is very expensive, you haven't decided to go there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's really, I've heard it's really expensive.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so probably [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFEID] you're thinking then?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that sounds good.  And you mentioned work, are you thinking about looking for a job after you're done?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any ideas where you'd like to work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not fast food.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But anything really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh  huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Something that doesn't have a lot of people.  I don't really want to be face to face talking with people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'd rather be someone in the back hauling all the stuff around.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so like doing stocking or something like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or do you, I know you like animals, would you want to work like at a vet's office or [DEIDENTIFIED] or something like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I could do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, I'm not scared of hard work so I mean I could even go into landscaping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or something like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  Well I know that it can be tough to find a job for some people right now but probably by fall, hopefully, or summer they'll be more opportunities.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, good. Are you sleeping okay at night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  And how's your energy level during the day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. And has your appetite been stable or has it changed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's stable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you able to concentrate okay at school or do you have difficulty?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Do you find yourself worrying about things much or not much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A little.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And about anything in particular or just things in general?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Friends I guess, just other people, you know, how they're doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are your friends starting to talk about what they're going to do after they get out of high school or not too much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not that much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you enjoying yourself when you're at home like on the computer?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Any suicidal thoughts at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and what about stresses, any major stresses right now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I can think of.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, just the usual stuff, school?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you having any problems with medication at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure if this is due to the new medication or not, I feel I've been sending like stupid things more, I'm trying to think of an example.  Like just, I don't know, it's not quite almost out of control but just saying things that later I go, that was stupid and really, I can't think of the word, not empathetic of me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like, stupid things like that don't make sense or - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Critical things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just that could have really hurt the person or -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh I see, where you said something that you just didn't realize might hurt someone else's feelings?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So not intentionally just without maybe realizing until later?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, just things that I don't think about enough or - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I understand.  I don't believe the medication would cause that.  Sometimes it's just that we're distracted and just don't think through how someone else might take something.  Okay, has anybody said anything to you about it, like any of your friends said [PATIENT NAME] that was a rotten thing to say or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and can you tell if there's been any difference since we added the Cytomel or does it not feel any different to you at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and maybe because the dose is low, you're only taking 25 mcg a day which is a very low dose</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like less than a tenth of a mg so if that's not working it may be that it's not enough and we may want to consider increasing the dose a little bit.  Do you want to try bumping it up to see if it'll help maybe a little bit more at a higher dose?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh you don't, well if you don't to, you don't have to.  I mean our options are either to, if you don't feel like it's helping you, to try a higher dose to see if it would help or we could stop it if you don't want to take it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd rather not take it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and just so I understand, is that because you're concerned it might cause some side effects?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Of the medicines that can, well, I was thinking, the medicines that you're on, do any of them cause speech problems.  Occasionally Topamax can but it's a different kind of speech problem, it's more for people who have trouble finding words, if they're trying to say, you know, that's a, I can't think of what it is, oh a tree, something like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've had that a bit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so that, Topamax sometimes can have those kind of effects in some people.  The Cytomel, the kind of side effects it can have, like if you take too much of it, there's symptoms of hyperthyroidism which can be like having too much energy, feeling kind of wound up or losing weight or feeling warmer or things like that, it's like you've got too much energy.  Do you have any of those kind of feelings?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's not really trouble getting to sleep but it's like trouble stopping something I want to do to go to sleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you get really focused on something, it's hard to pull yourself away from it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, once I'm in bed I'm fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so [PATIENT NAME], it sounds like what you're wanting to do is to stop Cytomel since it hasn't helped at this point, is that right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and then do you want to just leave the other medicines the way they are for the time being?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, that's reasonable.  It sounds like you're doing pretty well overall.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Especially it's your last semester.  Now do they have a prom do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think you'll go to it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not really a dance person.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've gone to a few and the music is usually too loud.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not a lot of fun?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so I'm thinking what kind of events will there be to look forward to graduation, are you going to go to graduation?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, yeah, that's a lot of fun usually even though there's some boring talk, it's just fun to be with your friends.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'll be graduating so - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean yeah it's fun to be a part of it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But yeah they do a really nice graduation, it's very personal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.  Where is it, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's different every year pretty much. It's usually in the church somewhere.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well good, so that's something to look forward to and do you know when that is, is it going to be in June?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> May or June.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Usually it's late May, early June, something like that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  All right, so are you aware of having any problems with the Risperdal or the Cymbalta or the Topamax?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really, I mean the Topamax I think does do that speech problem, it's not much but it does do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, then it's tolerable then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When it does?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, it's annoying but it's tolerable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I think I'd rather have the other things I'm taking it for.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The benefits of it, okay.  All right, is there anything else going on that I haven't asked you about that you think might be important?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well this is something I know that I figured I would get on, you know, this thing happens with my friends, it always affects me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We do a little mars grade test, INFP.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, it makes sense, does that feel right to you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it feels right to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so what are you and [NAME OTHER] doing with that, are you - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We did it to see what jobs would work for me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  And what kind of ideas did you come up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Psychology perhaps.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm still going to look into it a little more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, I can see you working in the psychology field potentially because you're bright and think about things.  I can see you like to work with animals because you've loved that in the past.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are probably a lot of different things you could do, it's just a matter of finding what you really enjoy doing. You want to feel passionate about it and pursue it.  How often are you meeting with [NAME OTHER] now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right now I think it's once a week with the new schedule at school and everything, we're trying to figure that out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and that's going well, your work with her?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  All right, good, anything else you can think of [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Would you be okay if I invite your mom in for a minute - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> To see if she has any feedback.  Okay.  Why don't you join us.  So how do you feel like [PATIENT NAME] is doing?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um, all right.  I think this semester schedule she feels a little easier than in the past, she doesn't have much left really.  I've seen still some, you know, it seems like she gets kind of in a bad place and will sleep a lot or something one particular day which concerns me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and it usually lasts no more than a day when you see that?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well to that degree, I don't know if - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, to that degree.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I mean do you feel bad the next day or the day before that you just don't quite have to sleep or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess, yeah.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] was saying she still feels a little down but she doesn't really feel like the Cytomel is helping and she really wanted to stop it and she didn't want to try a higher dose because she was concerned it might cause side effects and I talked to her about the kinds of things it could cause, although it's unlikely but she still felt pretty strongly, I think, that you wanted to stop it, is that right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, which is okay if that's what she wants to do.  And [PATIENT NAME] if you change you mind in the future and wanted to try it again, we could probably try the higher dose.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because there's no need to try the lower dose again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You could try paying attention, a little bit of extra attention, the way you feel now and the way you feel in a week or whatever and just kind of see if you have an idea whether you feel better or the same or worse.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Just kind of be a little extra - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a good point because sometimes people don't know if the medicine is working until they stop it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's hard to tell sometimes and if you're noticing that you're sliding backwards a little bit, let your mom know and let me know because we don't want to do anything that's going to interfere with you doing well and feeling better, okay.  Any other thoughts?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Not quite, I mean the school semester is young yet.  [PATIENT NAME] missed one day far, you know, if that continues at the same rate, that again is still a concern.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But I guess, I mean she'll get out this semester, I'm pretty sure, I don't think that's going to be a big problem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well good, it's kind of nice to have a lighter schedule to finish with.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good, well in that case then why don't we just do this, why don't we stop the Cytomel and you can just stop it, you don't have to taper it or anything like that.  We'll leave the other medicines the way they are.  Maybe give it a month or so and see how you're feeling in a month or so, does that sound all right with you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and again [PATIENT NAME], if you start feeling worse in the meantime, please let me know or let your mom know so we can intervene before you slide down and I wouldn't expect you to crash or anything like that but if your mood's say at a minus two, if it goes down to minus three or four, that's still something we want to do something about so you don't have to feel worse, okay.  All right, good, any other questions or anything else you want to talk about before we set up another appointment?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I do have a question that I never asked you I guess.  A couple of days ago you slept all day, you didn't go to school and then you were up all night which, you know, there's only so much you can sleep in twenty four hours and I remember you were talking about being kind of babbly the next day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Is there anything else about that seemed different or -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I know -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Was it just that you were tired.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With me, when I get tired, I don't know what the exact cycle is but I get very babbly and I get very grumpy and I eventually crash.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You crash, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So do you think that's what happened that time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I just remember she was kind of -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I get very hyper.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Whatever the next day but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Kind of loose you said?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't remember you staying up the next day even, you went to bed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You said she's kind of loose the next day you said?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, just kind of - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I think.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well sleep deprivation can do that sometimes, yeah.  Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So that's the key, I just have to not sleep as much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, unfortunately -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm kidding.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can actually try that [PATIENT NAME] as a treatment strategy, it just doesn't, it's hard to maintain it though is the problem. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Eventually people kind of wear out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but it does work.  They actually, believe it or not, have done studies where they use sleep deprivation as a treatment for depression and found that it helps for some people so, all right, well why don't we schedule something for about a month or so then if that's all right.  Let's see where that puts us, February.  Now with your schedule now [PATIENT NAME], what day of the week -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Monday and Wednesday are my light day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Light being, what time do you get out?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Ten fifteen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're done at ten fifteen?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's really nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It is.  Do you want to pick one of those days so you can come in after school and have the rest of the day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so if you're out at ten fifteen, ten thirty is cutting it close.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Wednesday is a little tricky so Mondays are better, Wednesday we could probably come up with something but I'd have to think about it a bit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well I'm looking in about a month, the times I would have would either be like, like a Wednesday at noon or a Monday at either, a Monday at one, that's President's Day, is that a holiday for you all, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have no idea.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a federal holiday, it might be.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> What's the date?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's the 18th of February.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well all I know is we - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I think so because they get off, the Thursday and Friday before that is teacher planning or something. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We get off - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Valentine's Day</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a Thursday, yeah, that's the Thursday before.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I know, they're crazy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it would be good day on President's Day or a bad day then to do, like I could either do a nine or nine thirty or one or one thirty.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Your holiday, well you're going to have two others the week before.  It might not be a good day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> With both those together we might -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You might go somewhere, okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We could either do the Monday before, the 11th which is, but I don't have anything till like three o'clock or Wednesday the 13th, you know, at either noon or three o'clock. </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The other possibility is Tuesday and Thursday in the morning.  She'd need to walk out of here at ten.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So nine thirty would be the latest.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I have Tuesday at nine or nine thirty on the [DATE].  Do you have a preference for 9 or nine thirty?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Nine thirty I guess.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We'll be done by, okay, so [DATE] at nine thirty.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> How do teachers get organization skills, all these different schedules?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have to - </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is client number 1429-110 interview number 17 therapist Noff (sp?) March 10, 1971. Client number 1429-110 therapist Noff (sp?) March 10, 1971, interview number 17. </p>

<p>I'm going to get some water. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I saw that Clay fight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you did, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Have you ever been in a fight forum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but not since I was an adolescent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. This, this guy, this friend of mine, he's got to go. And I didn't want to go. I didn't want to pay ten bucks. And then finally I says ok, I'll go, you know. I was glad I did. But, you know, like there's a little kid. These people brought this little.. In the first place they had it in a ballroom. It was just flat, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where did you see it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: In Mountain Ridge. And there was this little kid, and they didn't, they must have not bought a ticket for him. But they stood him up right in front of me like two rows ahead. And I'm going out of my mind. I kept tapping this guy in front of me and says, "Either tell them to stand by the post or tell them to sit down." And they, you know they wouldn't. Well finally it didn't matter. Because all, you know all you could really see was the top of the screen. You know, with the fighters moving back and forth. But toward the end, like in the, the last five rounds or so and Clay was pretty much catching hell, this guy behind me was the only one I could really hear. He was like, "Kill the son of a bitch. Kill the bastard. Break his jaw, you know." 0:02:25.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They really want blood, don't they? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh man. I mean I was caught up in it. But the guy I was kind of for was, you know was a lead. But geez, you know. And anybody that, even before it started, anybody that would stand up you know, you didn't. You just didn't stand up. You didn't, if you'd stand up you'd, ah, it was really primitive. It was really....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I heard that at one of the sites, I've forgotten where, the projectors broke down. And they never showed the fights. They had ten fights there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was the, I was going to go to The Ring.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The Ring.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, boy here the sound, the sound didn't work. The place I was at, you know, right initially. But I think I would have too. I would have torn the place apart. Because they, you know they do all these, like they're milking you. Beer is something like 80 cents a glass. Hamburgers are 75. Hot dogs are 50.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know they're peddling this stuff like it's going out of, and then they just gave me such crummy seating that they, no riser for the people in the back. It was just a monstrous place. They had chairs behind posts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They filled it up though I bet, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. It was sold out. It was a weird day. I really had a weird feeling after. It was like, I guess my opinion like of Ali is like he's a little boy. But he's, he's a, well he's a comedian, you know. I think that's all, or whatever it is. I don't know what it is but it's something. And geez, he just took a, just a vicious beating for 15 rounds. 0:04:20.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He claims that he won nine rounds. You don't agree, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I thought he did. I thought he won almost all the early rounds. Because God, he was just you know. I thought what he was trying to do was, you know, beat Frasier at his own game. Because they had, they were punching on the ropes and Frasier would, the first round Clay fought like he usually fights. And then after that, Frasier would get him on the ropes and just use him as a punching bag. And Clay would just keep shaking his head like that. As though, you know he's saying it didn't hurt him. And he didn't push him away. And then he'd go like this with his gloves in the guys face. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that all about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he through the fight? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they replayed this, you know this knock off thing in the fifteenth round. The last three rounds, Clay you know didn't have a whole lot. But in the fifteenth round it looked to me like it was just kind of a wild effort. And he went down and he got up and he just went down and he got up with this most matter of fact look on his face. It was like he rolled over and just got straight up. And just stood by the ropes. It was just like, you know oh God you know. Just very matter of factly. I don't, they make this comparison between him and this Johnson in 1908 or something like that. The great white hope. The guy that beat (inaudible at 0:05:53:.2).Yeah. And I don't know. I'm glad I went to it. But I didn't, something, something didn't really strike me as being, I felt bad afterwards, you know. 0:06:18.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's the way I felt. And it's like something had been eliminated. I don't know. So anyway, I saw it. I hadn't ever been to a boxing match before. And my dad was supposed to have been a boxer. I watch it on television sometimes but never, never been to one. The crowds kinda like were like brutal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't feel too, you get caught up in the thing though you know. And then pretty soon you're doing the same thing. I don't think I was yelling kill him but I was you know. I kept thinking he'd you know, he'd pull it off. And if you'd pull yourself out of it for a second and just stop and think of the yelling around you, you know it would...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be pretty scary I'll bet. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because it (inaudible at 0:07:38.5) like sometimes at least. I had some guy on the left of me just constantly yelling. You know like they didn't turn the lights off soon enough so he's you know, "Turn the" you know, he's just yelling, screaming. When I was like in, all the way in grade school when kids would, when the teacher would leave the room, the kids would, would really start acting up. And I felt this you know, a little bit the same kind of way. It was like really uneasy about, either that the teacher was going to come back or was just you know that.... The yelling. It's been a weirdo week. 0:08:32.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think where I left off was something like I was gay or something like that. So I've been asking myself all week if I'm gay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know like, and you know I've been, it's like I'm out to prove something. I don't want to admit that. I mean that's and that's why I think there might be something there. Because I really you know like it seems... I want to say you put the, you know you put the thought in my head. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did I? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think you did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what, I mean what like, ok you know this is what I don't know. Because otherwise why did I, you know why did I start thinking about it so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As a matter of fact I think I did. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no I. I think I baited you. But I don't, I don't know if I bait you or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I, I went through a whole long thing and I says, "Ok now what do you think that means and be candid?" And you said, I can't remember if you said, you don't have a tape do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I have a tape. 0:10:05.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have the tape for that one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I listen there to the playback?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. I, it feels like too much trouble right now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well I think I can recall it but..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How, just by the way, am I, am I allowed to hear those things? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Anytime I want to or do I would I? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any time that the two of us agree. </p>

<p>PATIENT: We have to hear them together or can I? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean that would be my condition. I mean I feel as though that tape is both of our property. Therefore I want to hear it with you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to hear, I'd like to hear some sessions. Because I'd like to hear how my voice sounds. Well ok. I would have to initiate that. I think the way I was going last week was like I'd done, I'd done all these things that I couldn't figure out you know. [And I went a long ways with you] (ph) you know you gave back to me. And then, and then I think I said, "Why do I do that? " And you said, I don't know if you said to show her that I wasn't or because I was worried about it or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And [I don't] (ph) you know like it. But from the way I wondered about it, like this week. Let me just...0:12:07.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. </p>

<p>PATIENT: On Thursday the first thing I did when I got done, well for about an hour I was just thinking, you know. I was trying to figure out you know, because it bothered me. It really did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I went out drinking. Met this one girl I knew. We went home to bed but I didn't get to sleep until about four. Then I got up the next day and I went, that was a Friday. Oh, I had to be to work. And I was just dead tired all day long. I was still like wondering about it too. Friday night I saw this girl that I haven't seen for years, you know. And that was a weird thing. We never screwed when we were going together. And we went together a long time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we found out had now. And it was, it's like I set myself up again. Because now the problem isn't so much that I don't feel warmly toward either this girl or the girl Charlotte Basildon. It's like I feel a little tug, boop, and yet I'm still screwing myself up. Because now I'm, you know, this girl Charlotte Basildon just told me she might be coming back to New York. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I've once, you know once again I've set it up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like an ambivalent kind of thing, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you mean once you found out she was coming back you weren't so sure how much you liked her? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, but I thought she might be coming back. But yet the very week after I was up there, and this is the girl that I told that I, you know that I loved. I called up Jane and like I've had two dates with her. This is the girl that I used to date for a real long time. 0:14:15.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I'm sitting on the fence. Because I, I like both of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't really see how it's going to resolve itself. I mean maybe, maybe it will, you know I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long ago did you tell Charlotte Basildon that you loved her? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Three weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't remember hearing about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I told you about it. I think I said that it was really hard to say that and I thought I probably would have to learn?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To learn how to....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you're not sure that it's true. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm, I think it's true. I think you know, I think what's true is that I think good things can happen towards both of them. And I don't know that I, see this is what I can't, things are getting, this is the way I was last week too. So then on Saturday I went back home and I read. I read my ass off. I had this paper due. And Saturday night I, I read Saturday night. I didn't go, you know I didn't go out. And then I started eating. And I not only started eating, it's like, and I didn't, I just have thought about things but I haven't you know I haven't, you know I haven't gone through my note things and all this. And Sunday I, I read all day Sunday which I have never done for a long, long time. I went drinking Sunday night. And Monday night I went to the fight. And Tuesday night I went, oh that was last night. 0:16:16.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Weird things. Like on Sunday I bought this box of doughnuts. You know like I've been on this diet for a long time. And I'm still not down to where I want to be. Twelve doughnuts. And I ate all twelve doughnuts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yesterday for breakfast I bought another box of these things and eight of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like, it's like at work today I was silly. I used to always be that way. Silly. I mean you know not really silly but goofing off all the time. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean saying silly things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's like goofing off. Like for instance you see that red book over there. The bottom one. Well that thing cost 35 dollars. And our agency doesn't have it. So my desk Shelly sister has it. And I borrowed it for a week. But she made it a matter of conscious that I had to have it back there today. So I says, "Ok, if you put it on that basis, I'll have it back." And so I had it back. Well her sister called on the phone and so, you know I can go into B.S. things. So I b.s.'d her and I says you know, "I'm not even going to try and manipulate you into getting.." You know I was still manipulating even though I admitted it. And so she let me keep the book like another week. But I, you know I can see how.. Or like we were out at lunch and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that, that story so far does not fit into goofing off. 0:17:57.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. It's the way I would ask for it. The kind of, the kind of..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it worked. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it worked. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh sure but I mean it was like, it was like see I find that very easy to do. To be silly and to be, when I decide to. Like at lunch, Shelly, we were coming out and this old woman from some place comes up and says, or I thought she said you know, "Aren't you one of the Pembroke (sp?) girls?" And there's this whole thing like in Iowa, this whole thing with you know, how do I want to say it. You know like you're, you're one of the Camp, that's one of the things they did with my, you're one of the Camp girls, you know. And you can do take offs and all that shit. And of course Shelly, she gets all offended. She's fun to tease. Teasing is what I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wasn't working. I know that much. I wasn't getting things done. And see like I haven't sat down at night and, and really thought, you know, what I'm doing. I haven't really thought about you know like lots of things that have happened. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Lots of, like I have not made myself think about why all of a sudden out of the clear blue I called up Jane. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just one day called her up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. I guess what you're saying is that you feel as though you should force yourself to think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I'm doing, I'm doing things that I, I mean I don't know why I'm doing, or work. I mean coming, I'm coming in late at work again every morning. Or I stay out you know like until four. Three and four in the morning. You can't do that. I get, I'm so tired. It's like I'm doing the same thing again. I'm staying out late so that I feel bad when I come in in the morning. And then even with the people, I've got to have my head on straight and yet I'm. I don't ask myself why am I doing this. 0:20:15.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't stop to try to figure out why you're doing what you're doing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I've done that like before like I'll go for a week. See usually on Wednesdays you know or whenever therapy is, then maybe the day before I'll start thinking, "Well, you know where am I at?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'll try to, I'll try to bring myself into some kind of focus again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And before, I would do that all week long too. You know a lot more. But like today, today when I came it was like I had an apprehensive kind of feeling but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't prepare yourself this time. You didn't stop the day before and ask yourself what was going on, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, all I knew when I, when I drove here was, I said, I guess the only thing I wanted to know, I wanted to deal with in what sense, you know like, like you know in what sense if any am I really queer. That's what I want, I want to know. I want to know that but..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't you have to answer first whether you are or not? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but to me the easy thing is to say no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you don't believe it, like you're not even believing yourself. Even if you say it. 0:22:05.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Remember you asked last week if I had ever had any homosexual experiences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I recall two right off the bat. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I call. But I didn't recall the one that was probably, I just remember I was fantastically embarrassed by it. And I even remember before I ever got into this thing that I wrote it down. And I can't remember. I know I must have been 16 or 17 because I know I was in high school. And we visited my uncle's farm. And my cousin who's about, he's about ten years older than me. No not quite, about eight years. He was out in the barn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I was in high school like I never dated anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think, I think you know like, maybe I still fear girls but I was afraid of girls. And he said, oh he was peeing out in the barnyard, not in the barnyard the barn or someplace. And you know he was holding on to his penis and he was saying, he says, "You know what this is?" I says, you know, "That's your pecker." Or some dumb thing. But I was, I must have been twenty shades of red. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember I really got embarrassed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he said, he says something like, "Do you know, do you know what you do with this?" And I think I was mumbling. I says, "Yeah." You know because I know, all I remember was I just... 0:24:10.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very embarrassed. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah and I just wanted to get out of there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I, I think I was even some, I don't know if I was afraid, embarrassed is the only, I remember my face got really red. And didn't know what he was trying to prove. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then he said, he said, "Have you ever, have you ever." No he said, he said, "Are you dating girls now?" I says," No." Or I must have said a little because I wouldn't have said no. And he said, I don't know if he said, it was a farm expression in Iowa for screw. I don't remember what it was. Anyhow it was like, have you ever screwed or something like that. And I said, "No." And he says, "Well," he says, "You should be getting started soon." And then he said something about that he had screwed when he was 18 but he was really old when he started he said. Then he said, said, oh yeah he said it was the greatest feeling in the world. He was married then. That's right. That's what struck me. Because he was really, he must have been, he must have been around 25 or 26. 0:25:59.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was all. I don't, I don't, somebody came in then. But all I remember from that is that I was just, just really extremely embarrassed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Interesting that you bring that up as a homosexual experience. How was that homosexual? Just because...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know because the, the embarrassment was, maybe part like this guy had a, you know he had a, he was well hung. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I always you know, I don't know if I ever told you that? Did I? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The routine with getting the shots and everything? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, yeah, yeah, yeah you did. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Ok well I don't know if it was that. And then I was really simple. You know simple I think like, like I was the kind of kid that would never even talk about screwing. But I yeah, I think I think of that as a homosexual...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why just because you saw another man's cock? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I don't, you know like in gym class, nah it wasn't quite the same. In gym class I'd always feel you know, like I didn't like to take showers if the other guys were in there. 0:28:13.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you were afraid they'd see how small you were. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Because when I left the room here that was the first thing. I says, well hell, you know, that's got to be the, you know more, I don't know. I don't know why I think of that. Because the stuff he talked about..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you think he was referring to sex between males rather than?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No because he was telling me all about, well it wasn't all, but he was telling me when he had first screwed. And I don't know if I felt embarrassed because of, you know maybe it was both things. Huh. I don't know. That's what hit me when I left here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you left that incident out. You didn't talk about it last week. 0:29:59.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I, I don't know. The first two things that hit me was this experience with you know this little kid that lived down the road. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Your friend. In the locker room. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other was with this guy that had this kid in the room. But then this popped into my brain as soon as I went out the door. I don't know. It's weird now you know like, I've been using that word. It pops up in funny places. Like last night, I have this class and when I was leaving, one of my friends, she was going a different way. She, how did she say goodbye? "Bye Johnny" or something like that. High-pitched. And immediately I thought she was you know like questioning me or something like that. Questioning my masculinity. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And all I know is like I'm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you're supersensitive to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not, you know I, I'm sensitive but it's like I still don't believe, you know I still don't believe that I really like boys. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who said you did? What, you think maybe you might? Is that what you're saying? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. The psych books tell me everybody's got some of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. I mean that's what they say you know now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:31:54.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I've got one good friend down at the bar who I talk to a lot. And man, all somebody's got to say is that his pants are a little bit, you know. If he wears stripes, striped pants? All somebody's got to even implicate you know that he's queer and he's ready to kill the guy. It's like I want to say like it might be but see now I don't know if I'm kidding myself or not. I would say that it might be but what I think it's more, and maybe that's an alibi, but maybe what it's more is that, not so much that you know liking boys would have anything to do with it. But you know, knowing what it is to be a man would be more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why do you keep calling it an alibi? Why can't you say to yourself, "No, I don't like boys. That's not what it is." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't know. I mean how, how do I, I don't know what my subconscious crap is. My unconscious. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What difference does it make?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if it, if it's really, if something is really there...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Then what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then, then I'm still, then I'm still a lie. Then I'm not..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're a lie. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean if I am queer I would want to be queer you know. But if I'm not queer then I wouldn't want to be queer. 0:34:05.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how can you find out? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you find out? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know how to get at it. I don't, I don't know. Like I, I believe you know like that there is an unconscious part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I understand that but why..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok but then..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you have no little confidence in the conscious part of you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it, I mean so what is the conscious part if the conscious part is not..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't you feel as though that has some control over you as much as the unconscious part? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure. Yeah but I, what I would want is to know, to know what is going on under you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well go to bed with somebody. Go to bed with some guy instead of some girl next time. Find out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really shrink back from that. I don't think I would. I mean I don't want to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I agree. I, you know the thing that I just asked you I think is really the more important point than whether you're queer or not. Because you know, well one wouldn't think so. But why has idea or this question which I raised last week worked on you so much that you know, you're questioning yourself even. You know what is this shit about the unconscious being queer and you're living a lie? I mean I don't quite understand that really. What do you care what your unconscious is like if you don't know what it is? 0:35:58.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because in way, you know in ways I sense, ok it's like, it's like, it's like when I set the alarm clock for six in the morning. That means I will, you know when I go to bed I have the best intentions of getting up at six in the morning. When I go, when I set it at 11:30. At six, I set it, you know like from the bed. I get up. I take the alarm clock. I turn it off. I put it next to my bed and I go straight back to bed. And I remember everything I did and I still do it. It's like I have no control. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What time, what time do you have to be at work? </p>

<p>PATIENT: At a quarter of nine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why do you have to get up at six? </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, you know I could make it 6:30 sometime. But I want to get up so I can read an hour before I go to work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, really (inaudible at 0:36:51.3) you know. I really do. I want to get up in the morning. But the trouble is I like to stay, like six and a half hours sleep is what I should have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok but then I don't do that. Then I feel shitty. Or even if I do get up, it's like coming on time to appointments. I, those are little things but they are starting really to bug me. Because like I'll tell a kid out of here, I had to pick a kid up on Monday. I says, "I will be here at ten, you know." And I even left at a quarter after nine but I am such a damn idiot the week before I had to leave, I left you know like giving myself a half hour. It took me an hour and fifteen minutes. I was 45 minutes late. And this kid you know, I mean you should be prompt when, I'm prompt here always. So you know we're riding along and he drops a little thing on me. He says, "Well, do you have an alarm clock Mr. Alector?" I says, "Yeah, I've got an alarm clock, you little bastard." I didn't say that. Or coming, you know like coming in, I don't, at the job now the guy, it's a very lenient office. There's no, nobody's saying, you know that there's nobody riding herd on you. I mean you know you should be a professional. You should be there. 0:38:08.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet in those instances I, you know I, or I don't know, I don't know why I started, you know like why I called up Jane again. I, you know I do the things and I keep, you know I keep wondering why. It's like if I say, if I say, you know ok I say, "I'm not queer." Ok, I'd say number one I don't know what's in my unconscious part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who cares? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do because I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if, if I am, you know then that's that's what I want to be. To me the unconscious is probably more..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right then I'll go back to my previous question. How you going to find out what's in your unconscious? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Dreams. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That are properly interpreted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Can you interpret dreams? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Can you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you should know something about dreams. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know any more about your dreams than you know about your dreams. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I like dreams. Do you ever do like free associations here? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not ordinarily. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know. Some of that stuff you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know maybe, maybe it's from reading that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, so what do your dreams tell you? 0:40:08.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do your dreams tell you you're gay? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I had one I thought might be. But..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One out of how many? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't remember all my dreams.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ten thousand? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I had, I had one. The only dream that I have that is recurring in different forms. Like I haven't remembered any more. That's another thing. When I try to I can remember my dreams. I had one where, where I commit some crime. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's always killing someone. And it takes place, it's only occurred once like in the last year where I remember the specific crime and I was put in. It's always life imprisonment. It's always the death sentence. I get a reprieve. It's life imprisonment and I'm happy because I can go to the library. You know that's, that's where I spend my time. Only in this one it was weird. Because I was a guy, this was about two weeks ago. I was a guy who was with a bald head. And I knew it was me but it wasn't my body. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a very thin, thin body. A muscular body. And it had like almost a black, it's almost like an executioner. Kind of a slimy executioner with a black slim wet suit on. Only it wasn't a wet suit. It was the way the person was. Really a, I didn't like the guy. But I couldn't think of anything from like the previous day's stuff. I don't know, it's sometimes I, maybe it's like I wonder. I've got friends that are in, you know are like in regular classical analysis stuff. And you know, maybe it's a status thing I don't know. But they, you know they work on their dreams a lot. 0:42:25.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I guess I wonder about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonder if you should work on your dreams also. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I think, it's like somehow I think of my unconsciousness as being you know like totally and completely different from me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and somehow I can, I can see that is why you know like I'm afraid of lots of different things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't know what that is. And, anyway. The books also say I can't get it by, I can't get it by you know digging, digging with my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you get it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By dreams and free associations, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Slips of the tongue. Slips of the pen. Maybe being aware of, you know like in situations where I have to act spontaneously what I'm feeling. Those, I always, but see, on the...0:44:09.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel when you go to that gay restaurant for breakfast? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I always, I have a phrase in my head you know. If anybody would approach me I would say, "I am straight." That's what I'd say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) But nobody's ever approached you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I was all bummed the other, I was half drunk the other night. And I was going down the street. And I, you know this is, I started thinking that way and I said. This little guy, a real thin little guy. I guess my stereotype of a queer. He was mumbling some gibberish like he was schitzy, you know. And he came walking by, blahblahbla, like that you know. And I don't know what he said but I kept going out of there. I, it's almost like the, the, the feeling I had was so strongly against it that it made me, it made me almost, you know I paused to think. And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you so much against it, huh ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean what, you know. I guess I have some kind of idea that if you're really straight. If you really know what you are then..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you don't have to fight it so much, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, then you just, you just, you know you have worked it through. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. What does that say if I have a friend on the block who wears striped pants every once in a while? 0:46:03.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't, he's super defensive about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he's straight? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But see there. See that's another thing. I mean guys who are meeting, you know well maybe I'll just use myself as, meeting in a bar. There's some guys you know I like to talk to. Some friends I like to. But mostly I want to you know. If somebody's there, I'd rather be hustling a girl. But, you know, but why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not? </p>

<p>PATIENT: What does it prove, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that you have more fun in bed with them than you would with a man. How about that? What could be simpler than that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Well nothing except I, you know I don't come up with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You play ball with guys and you screw with girls. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's what I always, I thought that you know. It always makes me feel better or worse they way somebody else says something. You know if I think, like I think you as a person that you know, knows more than I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You say one thing, I feel better. You say another thing, I feel worse. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like I don't want to take the effort to do it myself. I don't, I. See I don't know when it happened, but all of a sudden it's like maybe some time along the line now, I started thinking more about like wanting to date one girl you know. And just wanting to really work things through that way much more. 0:48:29.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I see somebody and you know bingo.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you've got two. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you've got two you're going to have to work through. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. Or you know any other place like it's still. There's enough things that bother me about, you know. For instance you know if you see a, if you're with three of your friends you know. Let's say they're three girls. You know you don't call attention to maybe a blonde in the corner. But most of the time I will. Either by just looking at her or by making mention of the fact. And you know like maybe two of my friends it doesn't' matter that much to but maybe the third it does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know it's things like that that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or calling women by their last names.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well I've, I've changed that. I call Shelly, Shelly all the time. And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that she's Shelly inside? </p>

<p>PATIENT: She told me today, she said today, she said, she says, "I think you're afraid of older women." And I said, I said, "You might be right, you know." This would have been after by (inaudible at 0:49:50.4). This came with the book. She really jumped on me about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? What are? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we just have, that's a bone of contention that book. 0:50:00.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pearls? The New York Juvenile Courts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The New York Juvenile Courts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that? The statutes of the state or something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's the way they process kids through court. She, it's hard. It's really hard for me. I call, I call Katie, Katie now too. Not Gaynor. I couldn't today. I had to call her Katie G. I just couldn't call her Katie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tara I could. Tara like I met in the district. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why couldn't you call Katie Gaynor, Katie?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did. Except one time I called her Katie G. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess I was. I wanted to appear lighthearted or something so I called her Katie G. I guess that's part of it. I saw Tara like in the district. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tara? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I still haven't called her. That bitch. She was funny in the district though. It was out in Miller's where there's no signposts to anything. The kids tear them all down. And I asked her where a street was. She didn't know. But she talked to me today in the office for the first time in about six months. I guess I believe like I can't crack. You know crack through whatever it is. And that's part of the reason I think why I don't. I can see the stuff, you know? And it's always like there's got to be, there's got to be something lying under it which just will not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Won't come through. 0:52:49.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Like today when I went to, I went to dinner with seven women. And I honest to God would have wanted another guy along. It even kind of bothered me a little bit. </p>

<p>C:: What bothered you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Going to lunch with seven women. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially you know, two of them I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Saw?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Seven people, you can't have a good, you can't have a good supper for the most part. You can't talk to seven people, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you bitching about? Why are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I said you know, I looked and I says...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean that seems like a natural reaction to be unhappy with that situation. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but I've always been around women. You know like that's what I've really got to say. Where the hell have I ever..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there other men in your office?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean that's and I like to have you know. I like to have a ratio of about seven three, you know. I mean that's..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ask a man to lunch tomorrow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I did. I always do. I always want to, I either want to go with Steve or Richard or myself. But those two guys are right now bringing bag lunches. So rarely, I got this favorite place. It's a smorgasbord. Now before, I wasn't eating lunch. But those guys you know, like I would just as soon go in a group but have about you know like an even split. But my whole life. God, when I grew up it was my mother and grandmother. When I was in the ministry, half the time I fooled around with ladies aide groups and shit like that. Public aid was even you know. School, I don't know if residence counts. But here, you know like the last two years it's mostly women that are..0:54:45.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I get, you know I always get along with women but..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you'd like a little companionship too, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean from a woman? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Man. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At lunch. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Johnny you remember I won't be here next week. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we'll meet again in two weeks, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two weeks from tomorrow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Is there any possibility at all of not, you know not maybe, of course what have I got? Have I got three? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Two times?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Two left. Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that going to be a Thursday then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, ok? We'll go back to Thursday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a good deal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's March 25. 0:56:00.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. You taking a vacation or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, my father is having some surgery so I'm going to D.C. to be with my parents. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Serious kind of stuff?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Prostate. I don't think it will be too bad. It's just that I know how much my mother will worry so I decided it would be better to be with them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Take care of those parents, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Good luck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye-bye. 0:56:58.6</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first thing that came to mind when I was thinking about where we left off yesterday which I spent a lot of time yesterday thinking about, was—I'm not clear what the connection is necessarily, which is probably good (both laugh) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's what it means [to be the patient.] (inaudible at 00:00:34) (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah—is that the way I deal with things is to say, "I'm not that person anymore." The way I deal with things having been pretty rough for me when I was a kid is to say, "I can feel bad for nine-year-old Tanya, but that's not me. I am somebody different now." I don't know why that makes me defensive, but that's what I thought of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what would have made you defensive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I don't know why I thought of those as a causative thing like, "This is why I am being defensive or constantly rationalizing things." Another thing is my dad is so selective or was so selective in terms of the things that he was really bad at and the things that he was really good at; and I really don't want to—I'm scared of the fact that he did some things really, really well. It's not like kids whose parents don't show up for parent-teacher conferences, he would go to them and talk to people. I remember very vividly one meeting when I was in 7th grade, I think—yeah, because that was the year I quit school—I just came home from school one day in the middle of 7th grade and was like, "I'm not going back to school. I'm not doing that anymore." And he was like, "Okay." [00:02:38] So I took a couple of weeks off of school because I was getting bullied. We looked at public schools in the area and talked about what I would do and, eventually, I decided to go back to [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:54) school and finish out 8th grade. That's a pretty remarkable thing to do. That was a good thing. But you're absolutely right, and it's really weird that I can feel myself pushing back; like even right now. The other thing is that I had to have one parent that I could rely on and so when I was living with my dad, that was my mom. And then as I was getting to the point where [inside I just wanted them out] (inaudible at 00:03:39), but it's hard for me not to have anyone. (laughs) The other thing that occurred to me is that I'm just remembering wrong and I don't know how. It probably wouldn't occur to me that I could be remembering it wrong, except that I'm pretty doubting much everything in my mind right now and, I don't know, maybe that's not how it was. So it's not like that. (pause) [00:04:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something totally different and, the other thing that has been on my mind is that I talked to James for a long time, like two hours. We talked about a lot of things that were pretty serious [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:08) and he kind of said, "I want to be really clear I'm not going to seek restitution or penance or anything—I don't think he used the word "penance"; it wouldn't really occur to him. He is still really resentful or had a lot of resentment which, obviously, I'm just glad he told me about it. He did say he's been thinking a lot in the last few days and this has kind of made him think about and made him realize some things about our relationship and I kind of said, "If you get ready to tell me about them, I want to know what they are." He said he's really realized the extent to which my depression is contributing to his depression, which is another thing that I saw happening and I'm like, "I'm glad he's talking to me about it," but I don't know what to do about it. I think I saw that coming more than he did, but how could he see that coming? [00:06:24] I've been in his position before and he hasn't. I just don't know what to do about any of this other than just keep talking. I still feel kind of guilty when I think about it; also I just feel guilty for being so depressed. Then there is the "Does the last year of depression come from being guilty about Dan and not telling James everything?" Then I blame myself more for it and that's not good. Sometimes the responsibility really is mine. (laughs) I think one of the things I am constantly wrestling is what do you do with responsibility and blame? What do you do with it? Like, yes, my dad is responsible maybe—yes, (laughs) not maybe—yes, he is responsible for a lot of things that went badly for me as a child. I don't know what to do with that. I wish he hadn't done it, but I feel like I had a long time where I was angrier and a long time to be angry and I'm not aware of it anymore. It feels like it's gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The anger feeling is gone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's what it feels like, but that's just because I don't know anything. I get angry at him when I see him behaving in some of the same ways at his work as he did when I was a kid in terms of kind of saying, "Well, everything will sort itself out." And fundamentally recognizing that no, someone else will sort it out. They always sort it out for you, and that's not fair. [00:09:47] That's why I wouldn't ever work for him but I usually don't have to deal with that part of him. (laughs) I've gotten much better when we're planning camping trips and things saying, "Okay, poppa, it's your turn to make dinner now," and being okay with the part that I will have to sort out—more Amanda and I will have to sort out—and saying, "These are your responsibilities and you're going to do them." That's something that I've jointly learned to hold him accountable for. He's just so loveable. He's a very loveable person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know he is. [00:10:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. He's an incredible person. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:01) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not just that he's so loveable, but he's so loved. People just love him. His parishioners love him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there are just a few that hate him (chuckles), but he's really good at his job—well another part of his job (chuckles)—he's convinced that administration should not be part of his job. Actually, priests also do have to do administration. F**k it, you don't get to get out of this, except he does get out of it because other people clean up his messes. I think everybody just finds ways to work around him because they love him. I'm more or less okay with that because I'm not a child anymore, because I don't live with him. (laughs) I haven't figured out a way to work around my mom in the same way. She also is someone who is very, very loveable, although for her the kind of jagged parts are much, much closer to the surface, so she drives people away more. [00:12:25] People don't leave my dad in the same way they leave my mom—walk away from my mom. (laughs) Joanne, his wife, is never going to leave him. His ex-girlfriend he dated for ten years, never left. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you were growing up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I left him when I was 14 and going to boarding school, but that was me when I was 14, 13, I guess, when I made the decision, and there was so much self-preservation. I guess it's self-preservation anytime you leave somebody, I mean anytime I've ever left somebody. So here's another thing I've been thinking about—I'm jumping again, so we can go back if you want to. Here's another question I've been thinking about a lot that you're not going to answer or I don't expect you to, am I particularly narcissistic or is everyone like this? I really, honestly am wondering. (laughs) [00:13:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean "like this"? What are you referring to? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very difficult for me to come up with an emotion that doesn't, granted I'm reading this in light of reading a blog post on narcissistic [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:07). It's kind of what's in my head right now and (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:14:16) association.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really difficult for me to come up with an emotion or anything that I do or think or feel that doesn't ultimately relate back to preserving my sense of self; and I honestly don't know. It seems to me like both of my parents are clearly pretty narcissistic anyway from all of the blog posts that I read about them. (chuckles) And, you know, these things get passed down. I feel like particularly with the depression I can't think outside myself, and I hate that. Like I said, I don't actually expect an answer, I just wanted it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what you're wondering about is whether, because all of your feelings have to deal with self-preservation, in a way that makes you narcissistic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I'd look at them hard enough I can trace them back there. I'm not sure whether I should, though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What connections do you have in your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like wanting to take care of James. I want to take care of James because I'm unhappy when he is unhappy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that's because you love him? This is sounding pretty selfish. (both laugh) I don't mean to make light of it. [00:16:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. I just don't know. This is also one of the things that James and I talked about last night because I sent him the book on [narcissism because that's what I do.] (inaudible at 00:16:58) I also sent him one on there's a New York Times article on a nine-year-old who's diagnosed as a psychopath—a terrible article. I don't know if you read it. Did you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. It's really nursing. It seems like this reporter had this very strong negative reaction to being around this kid who, granted, is pretty bad, and so the article just gives no sympathy to the child in the article. It's all "Oh, these poor parents." Some of the scientists that she interviews, the researchers or whatever, they are supposedly about helping the kids, they're helping for these kids, but she really tones that down in a way that breezes kind of borderline hostile. James said, "Yeah, you do seem pretty narcissistic," and James is my Arthur of all that is real. (laughs) And then he said, "Do you think I am?" and I said, "I don't know. I don't know whether it's just everyone is fairly selfish. [00:18:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was his basis for that judgment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he said that particularly when I've been depressed, basically he feels like I have difficulty seeing outside myself, as far as I can remember. I don't actually remember exactly what he said. It was kind of a very quick "I recognize this in myself and James also recognizes it in me" and so we didn't spend very much time talking about it. And I kind of said that the thing that I am worried about is that he will then negatively judge me based on these other associations that he has and he said, "No, that's not how it is." Maybe that's a little bit how it is, but he doesn't think it's how it is. (laughs) [00:19:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like will he judge you critically for being narcissistic? I see. And he said, "No?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The other thing that is coming to mind is that when I was in the hospital James spent a couple, three days, basically staying the entire day alone with my dad and by the end of it he was completely psychopath. James did not know how to work around my father. (laughs) Maybe, more to the point, he does not feel like he should have to. And I think he really loves my dad . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he was driving him kind of crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He spent enough time with him to know that my dad will drive you crazy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what's coming across to me most strongly is talking about the intensity and worries around your loyalties to your dad, to James and, implicitly, I think, me. This process is reflected in how committed you are to really doing it right and how difficult that can be, given the things that often go along with doing things right on one side, such as planning and preparation and forethought and getting a sense of what the other person wants, and the way this process is kind of designed to frustrate all that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I do find it frustrating. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is that piece in here but there does seem clear echoes of that in ways you are talking about stuff with your dad and with James as well and, I think, being pretty worried all around that you're taking up emotional space in a way that's a problem. [00:22:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. About loyalty to this process and to you, what I thought of was that that loyalty is definitely there, but once this process has gotten going, I have to be able to be safe. These are just the things that I'm thinking about; and so it's not—now you're smiling and I don't know why. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go ahead. I will share.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. It's just that I feel a little bit ridiculous because I'm like aren't you supposed to get out your existential crisis when you're 19? Isn't that the time period? It's like, "No, I have to deal with this now." I can't do anything the same way that I've been doing it up until this point right now. (voice waivers) Everything has to be different. So, yeah, I'm already thinking about it. (sniffles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry—what are you referring to? [00:24:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I jumped to the constant on-guard analysis of everything that I think and feel and say and do, and then a meta-analysis of the analysis that also is going on at the same time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And am I right that you're saying that in response to my accusations of loyalty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yes. (both laugh) Although again now that connection is less clear than it was when I thought of it. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me as though you heard it like I was telling you precisely that you're doing something wrong and you're not doing this in quite the right way and you're overly analytical and thinking too hard and that, in a way, if you could just not do that you'd be taking up less space and would be less of a problem. I guess that's how I'm reading your . . . [00:25:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not quite. More like I heard it as you're giving me too much credit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're giving me too much credit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No—you are giving me too much credit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Part of loyalty. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's there, but this is also I have to be doing this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Okay, now I think I understand better. You're working really hard because of the intensity of your suffering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not suffering, precisely, but also suffering. Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like there is nothing more to the aspect where if you were seeing a physical therapist who said, "In order to deal with this terrible injury you've got to do these exercises," and so you're really going at them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're saying that's different from what's happening now? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm saying that's kind of more the sense in which you mean you're having to analyze everything and not analyze everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so, yeah. That makes sense. [00:27:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I go back and forth whether it's possible to overanalyze. It's possible to analyze it the wrong way if you use the wrong tools.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom wrote me an e-mail the other day. I wrote her a long e-mail yesterday. I said I haven't been talking to her and I'm just not ready to, "ready to" may not be quite the right words, but she commented on my blog and answered me back about sewing. She talked about sewing and I asked her a question and she wrote a lot. I wrote her back about sewing and about my life and she wrote me back. One of the things that she said was that she's really happy that the therapy is going really well. She's seeing new horizons in her own therapy. I just wanted to be like . . . it's been ten years working with the same person. Isn't that a long time? She had a long way to go. She still does. Amanda and I talked about this over the years. Chrissie is the name of her therapist. Mom will kind of say things like, "Chrissie says this is okay," or "Chrissie says this is the way things are," like this is the authority so that I can do what I want. I recognize she really needs somebody else to tell her it's okay to do what she wants ever; but when it's something that is hurtful to us, then I don't like it. (laughs) [00:29:28] There seems to be a really strong affirmation of mom coming from Chrissie and I think that's really important for mom; but I also wonder at what point it stops being useful. Affirmation-based therapy is not very useful for me, or I have not found it to be so. (laughs) I asked Dr. Heitz for a referral to you but also to somebody else and he said, "You don't really need warm and fuzzy, do you?" (both laugh) I said, "No." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I think I'm going to open that door.] (inaudible at 00:30:22) (both laughing) </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the point. You know what I mean. But he wasn't saying that about you. (laughs) I'm much too overconfident. I don't think I would go, anyway. I think I would forget to see them. (both laugh) It's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. I guess it's disconcerting not to know how you got somewhere or wherever you are. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Context rather the content is disconcerting. I end up at the end of a long speech with no idea of where I'm going from there, pretty much every day. I talk a lot. I talk from thought to thought; but my impulse then is to gather myself and say, "Where was I going with this?" and then go there and say, "That's not the point," again. It's hard. It feels like wasting your time. (pause) (chuckles) [00:32:40] Yeah. Warm and fuzzy is always pretty suspicious for me. Yeah. I guess I just associate it with both masking and masking attention that will snap and lash out at me. I'm not really sure where that comes from because my dad doesn't really do warm and fuzzy, my mom doesn't really do anything else. I certainly had teachers, choir directors, and friends' parents who were like that. (pause) [00:34:46] I expend a lot of mental energy not wanted to be like my mom (laughs) or not wanting to have her life to lead. I don't want to be here in ten years. I intend not to be, but it seems like all that kind of busyness and tension and making up my mind, there is at least a possibility that unmasking that, I don't actually have much control over that. I don't know whether I do or not. If you didn't think I did, I wouldn't be here, right? But I don't know whether I . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clearly you're pretty afraid of it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can't believe that stuff can go on like that. What if I actually get back to—not in a month, but in a year—that it was this bad, or bad? I don't think James could take it. That's not fair. I don't know whether I can take him; but I always don't know whether I can take him. Somehow I always seem to. It's just such a waste. My mom is so smart and so loveable in some ways, but I just can't call her. (laughs) I can barely read her e-mails. Even when I talk to her on the phone it's like a good conversation with her ends with me becoming invisible—or not ends with—proceeds quickly to and stays there. That's what she needs out of me. In some ways I'm really happy to do that. I really am. I want to be able to do that for her, but I can't stand it for very long or very much. I certainly can't stand it when I'm completely preoccupied with myself. (chuckles) It's like, "Ahh, mom, you've been working in government for 15 years and I know you're making somewhere upwards of $60,000 a year and you're a single woman who hasn't been supporting any children since you got divorced. I am a graduate student who is unemployed and has no savings; and you're telling me how proud you are that you got a job." Yeah, I'm still upset about that, in case you forgot. (laughs) She doesn't mean to, and she needs someone to do that for her so much. I want to take care of her in that way but it's self-preservation; and then I feel so bad every time I remember how long it's been since I called her. God, I'm such a bad daughter. [00:41:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm guess I'm still thinking loyalty and worry and guilt about taking up emotional space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What do I do about that? You don't have to answer that. (laughs) That's another one of those questions that aren't fair. The point is that I can ask questions that aren't fair, right? One of the points. You just don't have to answer them. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean worrying about taking up emotional space? (chuckles) That's a form of a question when you're feeling helpless and not sure what to do because it's going to put too much of a burden on you, I think. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (voice breaks) I don't [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:51) (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you refer in those times to in certain ways falling apart for you, not knowing what to trust or think about yourself or feeling like you're contradicting yourself a lot in a way—feeling kind of at a loss. [00:43:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just that knowing what the problem looks like doesn't help me make it go away. Maybe it is that if you fully understand what the problem looks like, then it will go away, but I don't really buy that because it is always back on, "I just don't understand this. I just don't understand this." Again, maybe that's true, but I find that very depressing. Yeah, that's why I feel helpless. I have so much training to believe that if I understand, I'll be able to fix it. Understanding is what fixes it—anything, but that's just not the case here or it doesn't seem to be the case.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. We can talk more tomorrow. </p>

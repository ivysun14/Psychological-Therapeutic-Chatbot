<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, is that true, I haven't seen you since January?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That is true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's crazy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Have you missed me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have, but I think I made up for it by seeing your sister.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you mean [NAME OTHER]?  Yeah.  That's what I hear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well that's not a good thing, so we got to figure that one out.  So, let's see, I saw you the very, uh, last day of January.  No, [DATE], and, um, let's see.  This is what I want to understand from you.  Um, how long after we upped the Lamictal did you notice a difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't remember exactly, but it wasn't a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a week or two?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It wasn't like a long period.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like clicked in or gradually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, when exactly did we up the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no, but I mean in other words, the fact that we haven't met in, in so long, uh, you know, obviously I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Talked to your mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did I just feel better, or was it slow?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just felt better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like, like boom, you, you notice, wow, you felt better or was it gradually?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was really quick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because like over these past few months, I just felt better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like not like a slow getting better, but just better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.  So by mid February, by Valentine's Day, you were good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fine.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.  I think that we're going to try the same thing with [NAME OTHER].  I mean, as I'm sure you know, um, we sent her to some famous guy because I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something, and he gave us some conventional strategies, but, um, you know, the tolerability is the issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, you know, we'll get her fixed over the summer.  We're very very hopeful about that.  So, fill me in, what else has been doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, nothing really.  I start summer classes on Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well I'm doing two sessions.  So starting next week, I'm doing, uh, writing the comic book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then writing the half hour sitcom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  Now, do they have somebody in the industry teach that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they do.  They actually have, uh, like one of the head editors of DC Comics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that should be fun, and then, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For the sitcom one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know who's teaching the sitcom one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably Larry David.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  That would be cool.  Um, and then, uh, the second session, I'm taking the one hour drama and screenwriting too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's a full summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I didn't realize it was so professionally focused, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's, that's all it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I thought it would be like, you know, writing and everything, but it's really like, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a directive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Now, are you trying to catch up?  Are you trying to graduate on time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well this summer will help me definitely graduate on time, by doing the summer courses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, next May?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Then what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well see, I haven't done any internships yet, but I'm supposed to get one in the fall, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Typically internships lead to jobs.  I mean the way that it works is the department has like big books of pretty much places that have internships that will hire you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I have allergies today, and, um, it's where they just try to help you get work -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Once you're done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  So you're looking to stay in New York and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Try and connect?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And [NAME OTHER], how is she doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're still newlyweds?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I guess so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, what did you take this semester?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I took a, uh, a class about children's films.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I took a just a film, just another film class.  I took screenwriting.  I took a theater class and I took an independent study and novel writing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And how about your book?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm working on it actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, that was what I worked on in my independent study and, uh, one of my professors is trying to like help me get an editor now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And an agent.  So that would be good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So, I'm also doing that this summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what's that about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's sort of like a epic, I guess.  It's sort of science fictiony, but not so science fictiony.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  Um, so do you feel like you're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, normal pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anything going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just bad allergies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but I mean emotionally?  I mean you feel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no problems there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You feel like you're yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like nothing ever happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, sleeping fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no surprises?  And you take the medicines every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take them all in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You take them all in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it doesn't make you tired?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not at all.  The 600 Lithium, 300 Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Okay.  Okay.  I mean it just shows you what a kooky, um, what a kooky world it is.  If people looked at your medicines, they'd say oh no, that's messed up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're supposed to be on less Lamictal and more Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that's not the way it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Works.  Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, really.  I mean they'll say well, that Lithium is stupid.  You know, it's not even at therapeutic level, but they're wrong.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because people are different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And some people, the Lithium, just a little bit, works great.  It gets where it needs to go -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And other people, you know, again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For you, maybe that's why every time we kept going up, you complained of feeling so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it was going too far for you at a modest dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a typical dose.  It was much too much.  So, this is the game, you know.  This is the trial and error process.  So, needless to say, we're not going to touch anything with one tiny exception.  You know, once we arrive at a good combination, then we try and stick to it like, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like glue.  So, um, the one concern, Lamictal has no concerns.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Long term there's no concerns.  We don't monitor you, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even though I'm on the 300, it should be fine.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean we could, we could check your blood tests, but in, in general, I mean, um, 200 is thought to be like the magic number for bipolar disorder, but again, everyone's different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But people are treated much higher for seizures.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three hundred is not like a crazy high dose of Lamictal in general.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but Lithium does have a long term concern, and when I say long term, I don't mean like even months or years, I mean decades.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the concern about Lithium is harm to your kidneys.  Um, people who have been on high doses of Lithium for 20, 30, 40 years, can notice a decline in the kidney function.  So, it's, it's the one big bugaboo about Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, the way to minimize it is minimize the dose.  We're doing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The other thing that, my understanding is to, um, when we give you the immediate release, you know, it probably peaks higher, you know, if you look at -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Concentration versus time, it probably peaks like this, and then goes down.  We might want to switch you to a slow release preparation because it won't peak as high, and they feel that's a little safer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that the peak level going through the kidney will be lower.  So, summer would be a perfect time to try that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You don't think that will affect anything?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I really don't.  I mean, um, uh, I, in the area under the curve is the thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it shouldn't make any difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it shouldn't make any difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But we do have to assess tolerability, make sure, you know, I think you'll feel the same, but make sure it doesn't cause, you know, uh, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did the Lithium ever cause loose bowel movements when you went up higher?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, when I first, yeah, when I first went on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For like a week or two, but then it went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that was when you were higher, like 912?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So I don't think going from 600 of the immediate release to 600 of, of slow release will be an issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, the other thing is, you take it in the morning.  I think we'll be able to keep it there, but if it made you more drowsy, then we might have to look at, you know, if you'd have to take it at night.  I like that you take it in the morning because that's the most predictable way to remember it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it really, I don't feel drowsy at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  All right, so that's, you know, maybe the Lamictal is having a little bit of offsetting the Lithium maybe.  It's a little bit of a, because it did help, you know, when we went from 200 to 300, you were kind of on the down side, and that's why I'm hoping it'll work for [NAME OTHER].  I mean you really are in similar places.  You know, a little bit of cycling, but mostly down is where she's at now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, that's it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, [PHYSICIAN NAME] you're the best doctor ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I thought you were going to say, oh, don't touch me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME] put your pants back on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh God.  All right, they'll be amused by that, but hopefully I can still use it.  All right.  Okay, we're dealing with a creative individual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, what else should we talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How are you doing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anything going on new or no?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, new.  I, um, I hung my diplomas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mom would appreciate that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where did you hang them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Along the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, outside?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know I still -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What is that thing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That thing on the ceiling?  That wasn't here before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It wasn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, it's, I don't know.  It's a piece of art.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I still, I don't know what to do because, you know, everything except for this lamp is hers.  So, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How often is she in here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's here three days.  The thing was when I started here, I was here half a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For two or three days.  So I very much like a tenant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then now it's three and two, so you think, well, really, really more equal, but all her stuff's here.  So, I don't know.  I feel like I'd like to upgrade.  Like I might -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I might upgrade the couch or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think you need just like one obnoxious coaster like right there to ruin it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, you ever see me put the throw on the, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have this like leopard print -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That I put on, on the couch -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It makes her nuts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's an accessory.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It makes her nuts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, you know, it gets dirty.  You know, the dog jumps on it and everything.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dog?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a, other folks have a dog that they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They bring here and [INAUDIBLE] she sleeps in it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  I think I've seen the dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, you know, I, I might take this home and, and wash it over the weekend, but, um, um, no, nothing's new.  I mean I'm sticking with being here two days and doing the other job three days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, some day.  I mean I'd love to retire from there, but it would be like five more years if I, if I can make it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm hitting the wall now, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you do the same thing there that you do here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I do, but it's a very different patient population.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Different -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a community mental health center.  So what you're seeing like [INAUDIBLE] people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like people, you know, with, with more serious problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, in a way, it's nice to do that, but, um, you know, in medicine now has become a bureaucratic nightmare -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that place [INAUDIBLE] times nine.  So, it's tough there.  It's more pleasant, but, uh, yeah, I don't know.  I think if I just make this look nicer, I'll feel better.  So, that's it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, so when's the wedding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have no idea.  I don't want to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, um, is she going to finish the same time you are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's finishing a semester early.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what's, what's her major?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, applied psychology.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, and then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well she wants to, uh, eventually she'd like to get her PhD.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she actually, um, she's been like, um, I guess interning or volunteering in a school for autistic children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I think she enjoyed that.  So I think she said like directly after she graduates from [DEIDENTIFIED], she wants to do that for a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just teach, make some money and then eventually go to grad school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that's her plan.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  Can she establish independence, do you think?  It might help her get funding for graduate school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like her parents are currently supporting her going to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is what I'm hoping for my kid.  I mean if she were to take a year and, and work or something, then she can establish independence from her parents -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She'd be eligible for more.  Hopefully for more grant support, you know, when she goes to a graduate school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She actually, she saved up a lot of money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she was in a, uh, a bad car accident a few years ago and she has a lot of money from that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So she has probably like $50,000 or $60,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And me, I have literally $123 left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's a lot of money for a young person, but, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, four years or five years of graduate school -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Graduate school is so expensive too.  That's one semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, zip right through that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And I know her parents are not paying for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, all right, sounds good.  You want to send in your mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right down this hall.  What did you hung up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three diplomas.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Your recognitions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're my diplomas.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I didn't see any diplomas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they're in the hallway.  You know, I'm still the tenant.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I'm greatly concerned about [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, so, uh, the only change I want to try and make is, um, is switch him to the slow release Lithium because the feeling is that it's safer.  It's not going to peak as high.  He's on a very modest dose, which, which is the key, but even still, it's not going to peak as high because at this point, this is what he's on, you know, and, uh, until they think of something better, uh, you know, we're going to leave it the way it is.  So, Lithium does carry with it a risk of, of harming your kidneys over decades, and typically over many decades, and, and the risk is greater as you go up in dosage.  So the fact that he's on so little is great, but still, a slow release tends to peak a little less high, and so I want to try it and see if he likes it similarly, and, um, uh, I guess -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Are you okay with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, I was going to say if anything happens, we're going to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no, no.  Well, we could always go back.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the other thing is, um, we probably want to do, um, a set of labs as a baseline because if you're committed to being on Lithium, uh, the way to do it is actually to collect your urine for [INAUDIBLE], and, um, and they do a very detailed -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, it's not a blood test?  It's just urine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, we'll do both.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll do a very detailed study of your kidney function, and, you know, then we could do it again in a year or two, and you know, every periodically and make sure that, you know, make sure that everything is fine.  So, that's what you're supposed to do if you're going to be on long term Lithium, which is what we're planning, but otherwise, you know, I mean this is what we should put [NAME OTHER] on.  I mean when I think about it, he was at the same place.  He was having a little bit of cycling, but mostly depression, and bad depression.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you did this.  So, that's what we should do.  We should, you know, put her on that.  So, um, that's it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Have you heard any good jokes lately?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any good jokes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You usually have like doctor jokes and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He hasn't done any in a long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, since he's been gone, I haven't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  That's the old doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, let's think about it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We did the parrot one, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, did we do the Willie Nelson one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Huh-uh.  That's probably the punch line.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's kind of a filthy one, and then, um, uh, well, the Willie Nelson one is, um, is a failure of [INAUDIBLE].  A guy goes in to see the doctor and the doctor says, well, I have good news and bad news.  He says well, what's the bad news?  He says well, you have a terminal illness.  I, I kind of only give you six months to live.  He says, so what's the good news?  And the doctor says did you see that sexy blond nurse that walked in here and the guy says yeah.  The doctor says I'm screwing her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I thought he was a grown up I could tell it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What does that have to do with Willie Nelson?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because Willie Nelson told that joke on late night television.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, okay.  No, Willie Nelson.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He had, he wrote a book about 30 jokes and stories from the road or something and that story stuck in my head.  I don't know.  So, Mother Theresa is in heaven, and it gets to be dinnertime and God says to her, you know, would you like to have dinner, and, and she said sure.  And so he goes and he opens up a can of tuna and he takes out some bread and, you know, he makes some sandwiches and they, they eat together, and you know, the next day, the same thing.  And, you know, this goes on for several days and, and Mother Theresa looks through the grates and she sees everyone down, you know, in hell, they're having lobster and steak and everything.  So after a few days, you know, she says, uh, you know, it's wonderful being here with you and I'm so happy and everything, but I can't help but wonder why is it that down there they're having all this food and we're just having tuna sandwiches and God says, he says well, I figured for just two people, it doesn't pay to cook.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  That's better than the other one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  All right, that was it.  All right.  So, now we're just [INAUDIBLE] so I can turn this off.  I hope they enjoyed the jokes.  All right.</p>

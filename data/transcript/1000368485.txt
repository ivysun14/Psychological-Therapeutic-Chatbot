<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) I've had a lot of things on my mind this weekend and today too.  But I was just thinking how to begin.  And I don't even know how to sort them out.  And I, today anyway, I, well, this weekend too, I just seem to feel so much pressure, I couldn't even be rational about it.  And I think the thing that upsets me most about feeling it is that I think I'm creating it.  (Pause) For instance, today I was, uhm, trying to talk to my supervisor about the reports that I turned in.  And I feel the normal amount of my kind of nervousness about them, that I might not have done them right.  And I think I probably wanted to set up my excuses ahead of time, which was upsetting me too, that I was doing it.  But, uhm, and also the fact that I haven't done them for her before so I didn't know exactly what she'd want.  And I had this feeling there was something missing from them.  I don't know, again it might have just been because I wasn't sure.  But we got talking about the program in general.  And there have always been things I haven't liked about it but I felt relieved, in a way, to think that there are certain things that are expected and there's no choice in the matter so there are limits for me.  And then I've tried to work within them to do the things that I believe in.</p>

<p>And in talking to her, she just, well, I'm not too clear yet exactly what she was doing but I just somehow had the feeling that my attempts to work within what seemed to me very clearly established lines was ridiculous, that the line should be changed, even though the headmaster does feel the way he does about them.  And for some reason it, uhm, just made me feel twice as much pressure, even though it's really falling right into what I believe.  And I couldn't, I was thinking about it, I could hardly think then.  It just seemed that I just couldn't do anything.  And, ah, the only thing I — it seemed to me that having the lines taken away and being given the freedom to do some juggling and reestablishing them is too much for me.</p>

<p>Again, it's almost the same thing as what has disturbed me so much in the art class that I'm taking and that is the question, well, what do you want, what do you believe in?  I just can't answer it.  (Pause) I suppose that's somewhat what was bothering me — I think I was honestly bothered by my reports, aside from all my other tendencies to worry.  And I think that must have been it, too, that while doing them I wasn't thinking what do I believe is the right thing to do with these things.  I was always thinking what's going to be expected and trying to do that or basing them on past reports, what I did last year.</p>

<p>And then the other thing, well, it seems there must have been several other things with the reports.  But another thing that has disturbed me very much is, uhm, how I go about doing these reports.  And it happened that I didn't have the time to do them before a week ago so that I only had a week to work on them.  But I used that entire week and I felt under terrific pressure then.  And the person, the other girl in the other class, uhm, I don't know, she's been thinking about them and probably doing little things for them but she's doing main, the main writing part in a very short time, it seems to me.  And I think this is disturbing to me too, the fact that probably it doesn't have to take me as long as it does, although I'm convinced that it does.</p>

<p>And this weekend MSCZ got very upset at me too because he was saying that I will fill the time I have by doing these reports and if I had longer then I would find that it would take me longer.  And I think just when I was doing them over the weekend it was true, in that I would set a certain amount of time to work on each one so that I would push myself to do it.  And if I found I was going faster, I unconsciously would sort of say, well, now I don't have to push so hard and I would kind of sit back for minute, thinking I was working on them.  But I don't know, I just somehow, I couldn't keep concentrating.  And I think it was this inability to concentrate and just get them done is tied up with the feeling of, what if I'm not meeting expectations and how will a parent take this and so forth, having all sorts of fears on how I'm saying things and if I'm saying the right thing or if I'm being very perceptive.</p>

<p>And this weekend, when MSCZ was so upset at me, another thing that bothered me was the, the reports were the most important thing to me.  And if, even if I could realize that he had very good reason to be upset, it still didn't change the fact that the reports were most important.  And they just seemed to get way out of proportion.  And I'll do this with a lot of things that will become more important than MSCZ, which I suppose is just basically that I'm making myself more important than MSCZ.  But then the thing that bothers me when he is upset at me about that is that it's assumed that a man will make himself more important than his wife but the reverse is not understood.  And I can't accept that. (Pause)</p>

<p>And then on Saturday, when I was feeling just the pressure, anyway, of being afraid I wouldn't get done and that I wasn't doing these right and so forth and MSCZ being angry at me, we had been asked to go out that evening.  And then on Sunday we had been asked to, to his parents' for, for a birthday party for him, sort of informal thing.  It wasn't any, they do it every year so I knew what it would be.  And he wanted me to go to both.  And I knew I couldn't go to both.  Granted I might, I could see that he was right in that I was taking way too long on them but I still couldn't seem to do them any faster.  And so I had to decide which and I couldn't make the decision.  And I don't know quite why I couldn't make the decision but it made me just feel frantic on Saturday.  I just, well, I was acting very stupid and I, I don't know, I just felt almost hysterical because I couldn't make the decision.</p>

<p>And there was something in it about being afraid of making him angry.  And either way he was going to be angry.  But I, I don't know, I felt guilty that I might not go to his birthday party and on the other hand, I felt that if I didn't go to the thing on Saturday night I'd be running away from something.  Because I didn't really want to go either.  And that was also complicated by the fact that it was a party given by the couple I've been talking about before, who met another couple that are friends of ours.  And this other couple had been invited and I think I was afraid of not being there because of what might happen if I wasn't there, to sort of protect my position. (Pause)</p>

<p>So what I ended up doing after waiting till practically the last minute, was to go on Saturday night thinking that I'll see how much I can get done on Sunday and maybe I can go on Sunday too, which was not making the decision at all since I knew I wouldn't be able to go on Sunday.  And then Sunday morning I woke up and, although it still took me quite a long time to finish, I, I don't know, I just didn't find it so hard.  I'd been in an awfully strong negative mood on Saturday and that's another reason why I'm afraid of what the reports are like because I was just so, feeling so negative that must have come out.  And Sunday I could sit right down and work and I wasn't having an awful time.  Or at least it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd anticipated.  And then as it turned out anyway, MSCZ got sick and he couldn't go.  So I didn't have to feel any guilt feeling at all.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: I, I, I know you often feel the way you described about, you know, getting certain things done.  Nonetheless, I'm under the impression that, eh, this time about the reports and the time before that you had to do the reports, that nonetheless, these, there's something special and particular about difficulty of, that you feel in describing them and, and, ah, getting them done.  Maybe even more than some other things.  What are they used for?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, the first ones were, uhm, based on conferences and, or were preparation for conferences and then the write-up on them.  And I don't really know what they're used for, except be—, previously to this year it had just been for the benefit of the teacher and there was no write-up.  And, ah, this year they're written up, I think, just so that the supervisor could know what was done in the conference so that she could have some idea of the child.  And I don't know whether she does anything with them beyond that or not.  But these reports that I had, have just finished uhm, were, are a part of the record and the headmaster sort of gets some measure of the class from them too.  It's not just a report on the children but it's sort of, he wants certain children beyond a certain point and if they're not, then it, then it's sort of, I'm not measuring up, which I suppose is they're not, then it's sort of, I'm not measuring up, which I suppose is a lot of the pressure I'm feeling from it.  And the fact that I put importance in a different place, I think, than he does, especially at this time of year.  Because I'd be inclined to look more to social problems than academic problems since so many of the academic problems are just a matter of maturity.  And some children just aren't old enough yet or mature enough and soon they will be.  There are very few that have a problem that is a significant type of thing to point out.  So I feel in a way I'm pointing out things that don't even need to be pointed out as well as doing the wrong thing and then fear of not measuring up and (sighs) the problem I have anyway when I write anything.</p>

<p>And I was doing something else this weekend, I just thought of it, that I do sort of unconsciously.  And MSCZ was the one who said it but I, I don't think because he said it I'm believing it.  I think I do do it.  When I have something like this, or the papers for my course, or anything of this nature that's connected with school and responsibilities to something outside myself, and if it's something that's giving, making me feel pressured and that I can hardly handle it there's so much, I'm inclined to sort of want to be babied by MSCZ and have him be very sympathetic and sort of tell me how much he feels sorry for me and so forth.  And I think that, well, I know that I even consciously used the having a lot of pressure of work and trying very nobly to get everything done well and all, when I was living at home because that was the only time, unless you were really terribly sick, that my parents seemed to pay any attention and be sympathetic and warm and sort of soft to us.  I don't know how much I used it in high school, although I would plod and work a lot when I was in high school.  Because then they could probably say, "Well, FAJ's working very hard and isn't she good."  But I do remember consciously, being consciously aware of it, in any case, when I was at college.  Because I was unconscious of using the pressures, I think, or I still felt the pressures and I still worked hard and was very tired when I came home but I knew that when I came home I was very conscious of the fact that then I would get sympathy.  And I sort of enjoyed it when I really looked worn out because I knew then that I'd get even more than if I just said, "Oh, I've been working hard."  And I think in turn, I'm trying to do that with MSCZ. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's almost as if here are all these other people writing reports at school, anyway, and it's almost as if I think I'm the only one who feels all this.  Well, I hope for their sakes I'm the only one (laughs) who feels it this way because, while I feel it, I still feel it's ridiculous to feel it like this.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it occurs to me that last week when you felt I looked tired, you had the idea it was because I'd been working hard.  You felt sympathetic for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  Well, it's true.  It's the only kind of thing I can understand too.  (Pause) And sort of the feeling that no matter what else happens, if you have certain responsibilities or goals or deadlines, you should meet them.  Then you could be admired and have everybody feel sorry for you.  But there's no excuse for not meeting them.  Because I was thinking about this girl I'm, who's teaching the other class.  (Clears throat) And she still is working on her reports even though they were due today.  And she never mentioned it to the supervisor and it isn't really bothering her.  And, ah, the reason, one reason that she doesn't have them in today is because her assistant was sick for a while and she wanted to talk it over with her.  It's also because she started them late and didn't realize how much time they would take.  So even if her assistant had been there she might have, well she might have gotten them done, I shouldn't say she wouldn't have but it would have been harder.  So it was a good excuse not to.  And, but she was just very casual in telling our supervisor.  And I, I would never dare do that.  And yet, it doesn't really bother the supervisor either (laughs) and it ends up just bothering me, that I wouldn't dare do it and that I wouldn't even think of doing it.  And I think I feel angry at her, too, for not get—, having gotten them done even though she had a very good reason for not.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's funny.  Going back to having felt sympathy for you when I thought, well, you must have been tired from work, if I try to think of other reasons, the only other reason that I can think of that a person would look tired would be that there was some problem disturbing him like, well, I don't know if it would be called an emotional problem but a personal problem, I guess it — like something happening to somebody in your family or something like that.  But even there I don't feel the same, at least I don't right now.  (Pause) It just made me wonder if that was partly why — (pause) well, I was going to say, when I didn't want to show I was upset over my grandmother's death to MSCZ who was perfectly understanding, if it wasn't because I couldn't conceive that he would be understanding or sympathetic and I somehow felt that he would think I was just being silly.  And when I just started to say that just now, I almost started crying and I couldn't go on talking until I could control myself.  And it's almost as if, no matter what it is, if I think I might lose control enough to cry, even if it's for a very temporary and silly reason, that the person who's there won't be sympathetic and, I mean, even if they seem to be, that somehow, underneath it all they really won't be feeling that this is a very natural thing or very understandable or something. (Pause)</p>

<p>And when I was feeling the pressure that I felt today, well, it was, I was feeling it all day but it just seemed to incapacitate me when I was talking to my supervisor.  I couldn't even carry on a conversation.  And then afterwards, I kept telling myself, well, if I can just go home and think about things and not even try to think about them right now, maybe I'll be able to handle it better.  And then the thought occurred to me that I just wanted to go home and cry on MSCZ's shoulder.  But it would still be the kind of crying on his shoulder of, look at all the pressure I'm under and I'm feeling awful and comfort me, type of thing, which it seems that I was doing in connection specifically with the reports anyway.  And I don't know, it's just like a little girl turning to her father.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you feel it's bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it isn't for a little girl but I'm not a little girl now.  And MSCZ's not my father (laughs).  But I don't know how I would have felt about it if he hadn't been so upset this weekend.  And it just somehow made me feel a little bit more strongly that, despite the time he has responded he's not at all happy responding that way.  (Pause) The more I think about it, the more it just seems so obvious that I'm using him as sort of a father.  Because when I'm feeling confident about things or at least as confident as I can feel, I do become, well, I'll just go off and whatever I'm doing becomes very important to me.  And it's only on times like weekends or vacations that he will become somewhat more important to me.  And then when I'm feeling particularly under pressure or that I can't cope, I'll go back to him for protection, just like a child would do when they go out and see how much they can handle.  And then when it gets too much they come back home again.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Are you trying very hard to keep from crying?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Not now.  (Pause) You know, I was just thinking about this problem at school and it's sort of the whole program, how it, well, how to work changes and what changes I think would be right and what changes can be made and so forth.  And I, I, I don't know, I just don't even know.  And I think the other thing that is bothering me, both about my supervisor's feeling that there should be changes in the program and the way I approach the reports, is that in each case I feel I've exerted as much effort as I can on my part.  Whether or not it's been well spent, I've certainly spent it.  And MSCZ was saying that I do that so I can justify to myself, well, even if it isn't appreciated or if the product is not approved, I can tell myself well, I did all I could.  And I think that's true because when I received these comments from my supervisor and I really — she kept saying, "They're not criticisms."  And I don't think she meant them as them.  I wasn't, she was just saying it so I w—, I think, anticipating I might think they were.  But I think subtly I did take them as criticisms because, again, I've pushed myself terrifically to fulfill what I thought was expected of me in order to keep the program going and then to include beyond that the things I think the children should be having regardless of the program, and also probably killing them as well as me.  But I'm wearing myself out, anyhow.  And I, so it gave me the feeling that not only had I been misdirecting my energies entirely but that nothing was appreciated either.  And it just ended up making me feel absolutely no energy (laughs) left to do anything else.</p>

<p>And I think I'm also struggling right now with whether or not to say, talk much about this with my supervisor.  Because it does affect so much how I handle things.  And I think that part of the reason that I want to talk to her about it is so that I can put her in the position of knowing that I need to be told what to do and then she'll tell me what to do.  And thinking of it that way makes me not want to talk to her because I don't want to do that.  Well, I do and I don't.  I don't want to consciously but I do want to unconsciously.  (Pause) And I think, too, that the thing that makes me not know how to approach her on all this is that once or twice I've tried to talk to her about things when I've worked out in my mind the professional type of questions, trying to get away from the more personal aspect of it.  And I've had trouble talking to her then because somehow, either she hasn't had time, she's been terribly busy and hasn't been around very much to talk to, or else, I don't know, somehow we get off onto a point that she's been thinking about and it's very important to her but yet it doesn't have the direction that was important to me.  And I'm not flexible enough to go that way and it just ends up making me feel very frustrated so that I don't end up feeling we've talked about what was bothering me. (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's funny too because during the year when I've thought all these problems on would I do it if I really had the freedom to do it, and knowing that she's, she and I see enough eye to eye on things so that perhaps we could work out a way so I would have a feeling of freedom, I think if I had it I wouldn't know what to do with it.  Because there're so many areas — I mean, this program is my training and so as much as I say I don't agree with it, I think I'm afraid of leaving it.  Because right now I was just thinking about what would I do if I could have a group that would not be part of a reading program for a good part of the year.  And I really don't have much of any idea.  I know sort of but not enough so I could work with them day by day and feel any kind of confidence in what I was doing.  And that leads me to my, another problem of mine, of just never feeling confidence in assessing situations when I see them and sort of using common sense.  And so it seems like no matter where I think about this I run into another conflict that I have with myself.  And then it just becomes doubly upsetting when I see people around me, who have no more background than I do, handling it so much easier than I am.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just wondering how much this, all these feelings of pressure are due also to feeling very competitive.  When things are going to be changed and I don't know exactly how I'm going to do it, I suppose I'm afraid that this other girl might do it better.  (Pause) And then it was just very distressing to me that, feeling the way I do, I can't, I just am better not having that much to do with the children.  Because somehow I just get the attitude, well, this is the way things are going to be and they'd better shape up.  And I'm not very understanding of them then.  And I'm, I'm not very flexible about readjusting things when it's obvious that they aren't going to be able to shape up.  Or just, I'm very flexible about the idea of making learning fun too as well as with a purpose.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<P>THE SWISH PATTERN #1 - STEVE & CONNIRAE ANDREAS</P>
<P>______________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</P>

<P>CONNIRAE: The Swish Pattern is an amazingly rapid and powerful new submodality method developed by Richard Bandler. Since the pattern has already been described in a fair amount of detail in the book <I>Using Your Brain for a Change</I>, we don’t spend much time on this tape discussing the pattern itself. If you’d like an outline you can find that in the book. This segment demonstrates the standard Swish, which uses size and brightness in order to connect the cues that have led to the problem behavior to an automatic set of new choices. </P>
<P>In this segment, Steve Andreas demonstrates with a client from the second day of an advanced submodalities training in January 1986. While the videotape quality on this piece is not up to our usual standards, we thought that the content of the piece warranted our using it anyway. </P>
<P>You’ll notice on this first demonstration that the client is initially surprised and a bit shocked at the power that the Swish has on her. While this does demonstrate how impactful it is for her, we want you to know that for most people doing the Swish is a very comfortable process. </P>
<P>STEVE: Let’s start by demonstrating the Swish, and we’re going to spend a lot of time in the next two days on the Swish Pattern. There is what’s now called, the "traditional" Swish [Laughter] which I want to start out with because it’s simple. And I like to teach simple at first. It’s how I learn best anyway, and I think it’s how you learn thoroughly. We’re going to start out with that, and then we’ll go and we’ll get fancier and fancier. Because there a lot of really slick things you can do with the Swish and you can have a very, very powerful impact on people.</P>
<P>Now I want to introduce it with a nice little story, one of my favorites. In the army once there was this guy who one morning everybody started noticing he was a bit strange. He’s just going around everywhere, [Searching] you know. He just went around [Searching incessantly]. So they sent him over to section eight [Laughter]. And he’s there at the psychiatrist’s desk, and he’s looking all over the desk, and he’s doing all this stuff. Going, "No, I can’t find it. That’s not it." </P>
<P>"Son, what are you looking for?" </P>
<P>"I don’t know."</P>
<P>"What does it look like?"</P>
<P>"I don’t know. I don’t know."</P>
<P>And he’s looking around like this the whole time. So after several sessions, the guy says, "Well son, I think the army’s been a little too tough for you. I think we better give you a section eight discharge." </P>
<P>And [as the psychiatrist hands over the discharge] the guy says, "There it is!" [Laughter]</P>
<P>Now that’s an example of what computer people call "feed forward." We figure out ahead of time what we want, or sometimes goals—let’s call it goals or outcomes. You figure out an outcome, and then you gear your behavior <I>now</I> toward getting that outcome later. It’s different than feedback. Feedback is you set an outcome, then you find out where you are and then you behave in terms of what happened in the past, rather what happens in the future. And that’s what you have to do when you go for the moon. You can’t shoot for the moon where it is now because by the time you get there it will be somewhere else. So you’ve got to figure out in future time where it’s going to be, and aim now so you’ll get where it’s <I>going</I> to be. </P>
<P>That’s what the Swish is all about. The Swish is very much a feed-forward technique. And it’s basically very simple. And it has many, many, many ramifications, and lots of ways we can get fancy with it. But we’re going to start first with something really simple. And what I prefer to have, I’d like to demonstrate this, and again for simplicity’s sake--later on we’ll get fancy and apply it to a lot of other things--I’d prefer to have someone who doesn’t know much about it, or nothing about it. And somebody who has some simple habit like biting your finger nails. [To a man in the group] I’ll save yours for a little later. You’ve got one like that? What’ve you got?</P>
<P>EARLA: I bite my nails. </P>
<P>STEVE: You bite your nails? Great, come on up. And you don’t know much about the Swish, right?</P>
<P>EARLA: I read one time a little--</P>
<P>STEVE: OK, but you haven’t done it? OK, great. OK, when are you biting your nails, Earla? At what times, Earla? [Steve looks over at her hands and examines her nails.] You don’t bite them too bad; OK, that’ll do. [Laughter] OK. Do you have any idea when you do it? Or what drives you to do it? </P>
<P>EARLA: When I watch TV.</P>
<P>STEVE: When you watch TV. Any other times? I don’t have to have this information; I’m just curious--my fly paper mind.</P>
<P>EARLA: When I’m nervous.</P>
<P>STEVE: When you’re nervous? OK.</P>
<P>EARLA: When I’m bored.</P>
<P>STEVE: When you’re bored. OK, great. Now we don’t even need to know all that, although that’s a possibility for hooking this to those other stimuli. Do you do this consciously, or do you just find yourself doing it? [Steve mimics biting his nails unconsciously, and then noticing.] "Oh my God!" </P>
<P>EARLA: Different things, different times. </P>
<P>STEVE: Different things, different times. So, part of the time. The nice thing about nail biting and starting simple is the hand has to come to the mouth, right? The mouth can’t go to the hand. [Steve mimics bending down to reach the hand.] [Laughter] Pretty much, the hand has to come to the mouth. They’ve got to get together. And that means it has to come up into the visual field. Even if it’s down like this. [Steve brings his hand up as if it is sneaking up to the mouth] [Laughter]</P>
<P>So what I’d like you to do is bring your hand up as if you were going to bite your nails. You don’t have to actually bite them. OK, good. And see what you see as the hand goes up there--as it comes up.</P>
<P>EARLA: When I’m looking at you, or as I would normally do?</P>
<P>STEVE: As you would normally. It doesn’t really matter. You don’t have to look at me; there’s not much to look at. But can you see what you see in your visual field? OK, good. So then can you close your eyes and see the hand the same way? [Earla nods.] OK, great. So that’s going to be picture number one. And we’ll just kind of set it on the shelf now, wherever you’d like it. Tuck it away. And this is what we call a cue picture. Because we need to attach this to whatever it is a person does that they don’t want to do--the <I>beginning</I> of it, not after they’ve completed it--as it’s about to begin. </P>
<P>You see, in this case, whatever stimuli--whether its nervousness or boredom or so on, internal or external--it gets the hand up there and triggers it. We know if she wants to stop the behavior, this <I>has</I> to happen right? So we want to attach it to something that <I>has</I> to always be there--if we can find it. Sometimes you have to fish around and attach it to three or four things because you don’t have an "always there" thing. We’ll get to that later. OK. Second picture, what I’d like you to do is make a picture of the Earla that no longer has this limitation. </P>
<P>And this is not to be very specific, this is not simply you with longer nails, that you would have if you no longer had this limitation. But the Earla--the picture of Earla can be like a portrait. It’s <I>not</I> to be of a specific behavior, like twiddling your thumbs instead of biting your nails or anything else. Think of something that you know how to do well. You don’t need to tell me what it is; I don’t care. Think of something that you do well. OK? Now if you look at a picture of yourself, you know that that person has that capability. Even though in that picture this Earla is not doing whatever it is that you do well. It’s like a portrait. You look at that person and you know that person has this quality. OK? </P>
<P>That’s the kind of picture we want you to think of now. It’s the you for whom this biting the nails is simply passe. You have the capabilities, the choices, the--whatever it takes to not do this anymore. Got that picture? Now as you look at that, does that draw you? Right. Now is there any way you can juice that picture up a little bit? Make it really—brighten it up a little, add a little color.</P>
<P>MAN : I can’t hear.</P>
<P>STEVE: OK, add a little color, make a little brighter, something like that. [Earla nods.] OK, you’ve got that one? OK, great. Now, that’s picture number two. And we have picture number one over here. Now what I want you to do is take picture number one and display it here. [Steve gestures in front of Erla, hands about two feet apart.] Make it big and bright, of the hand coming up. In one of the lower corners, take this picture [#2] and make it small and dark. And then--that’s the set up. </P>
<P>And what I want you to do is take the smaller one [#2] and have it go SWISH like that, really fast, and get big and bright as it totally covers up that other picture [#1]. [Earla’s head rolls back.] And the other one can get dim and shrink. . . . What happened?</P>
<P>EARLA: Eaaugh. [Erla fans her face with her right hand.] Strangeness. [Laughter]</P>
<P>STEVE: When you did what? </P>
<P>EARLA: When it got big and took over the whole picture. Um, it was kind of a shock, or a surprise. And then I just kind of felt strange. </P>
<P>STEVE: Was it strange bad, or just strange, strange? </P>
<P>EARLA: Not comfortable.</P>
<P>STEVE: Not comfortable. Do you have any idea what about that was difficult? </P>
<P>EARLA: It was not difficult--the feeling. What are you asking?</P>
<P>STEVE: Well, how come it’s uncomfortable? Do you have any guess as to what made it uncomfortable?</P>
<P>EARLA: I think it was just the suddenness of it.</P>
<P>STEVE: The suddenness? Oh, OK, great. Try it again and see if in fact, if there’s something--See, here’s ecology possibility time. It may be simply surprise, what happened, shock. In which case the next few times you do it, it won’t be a problem. If there’s some ecology problem there we need to know about it, and respect it. So try it again, and let me add one other thing. You start with the big bright picture of your hand [#1], the small dark picture of yourself [#2] and you go SWISH like that, [Gesturing to indicate the small picture getting big and covering the first picture.] and then you blank the screen.</P>
<P>EARLA: OK.</P>
<P>STEVE: And then you start over again. Big bright picture of the hand, and the small dark picture of yourself, and you go SWISH [Gesturing again] OK ? And then do that about five times. Say, three more times because you’ve done it once already.</P>
<P>EARLA: I just did it twice more. </P>
<P>STEVE: I know. [Laughter] Oh well. Do it a couple more times. </P>
<P>EARLA: [Looking blank] What do you do if you can’t get the picture? [Gesturing with her right hand coming up to her mouth.] [Laughter]</P>
<P>STEVE: OK, that’s fine. So you can’t get the picture? You’re having trouble? OK, great. Now that’s one test. Or I could be more explicit about it, chunk it out. "Try and make the picture of your hand. You know the original big bright picture of your hand?" [Erla shakes her head slightly.] [Laughter] Is it gone?</P>
<P>EARLA: [Smiling] Yes.</P>
<P>STEVE: OK, great. So that’s the first test. Because what you’re creating here, is you’re creating what’s called a <I>chain</I> or a <I>sequence</I> such that every time this [hand] comes up, her brain goes somewhere else. So that’s the first test, that’s in fantasy. In this case we have a nice second test. Would you bring your hand up? [Earla brings up her hand and it stops before it gets to her mouth, and she smiles. Then she puts it down and waves her fingers.] What’s happening? So that’s the second test. [Laughter] </P>
<P>See, we don’t have to have her words. Her words might be nice confirmation, and the first few times you do it, it’s nice to get the words and find out. How many of you noticed a <I>difference</I> in the way she brought her hand up, and what happened after it got there? It’s like--it comes up and it goes, "What do I do with this thing?" And usually, initially when you first do it, it comes up and it’s like right there. It’s ready to go, like "On the mark, ready to go." And typically when you finish like this, it either kind of jerks back down, or goes on hold. It does something that’s very different. And it’s nonverbal [feedback]. And it’s something you didn’t ask the person to do. So it’s a better indication really than any of the words the person gives you. [to the group] OK, do you have any questions of Earla? [to Earla] Or do you have any of me? </P>
<P>EARLA: No. Weird.</P>
<P>STEVE: [To the group] Do you have any questions for her?</P>
<P>MAN 1: I’ll ask her the question. Did you--were both the pictures associated or disassociated?</P>
<P>STEVE: That’s one for me, because I know the answer to that one. She doesn’t need to be bothered. Do you have any [questions] of her?</P>
<P>MAN 2: Raise your left hand. </P>
<P>EARLA: I was thinking the same thing. I wonder if it would be the same [She raises her left hand, which also stops, then waggles a bit. Then she puts it back in her lap, interlaces fingers with her right hand, stretches them and smiles.] [Laughter, clapping]</P>
<P>STEVE: I never thought of that. If someone was really, really narrowly contextualized, I suppose you could fix them on one hand and not on the other one-- [Laughter] I never even thought of that possibility. I suppose it’s a possibility. I haven’t encountered it yet. Usually people are able to generalize like that. Do you have any other questions of Earla, first? </P>
<P>MAN 3: Did the quality or submodalities of the second picture change any as you went through--</P>
<P>STEVE: --the repetitions?</P>
<P>MAN 3: Repetitions.</P>
<P>EARLA: Less intense. Every time I did it was less intense. The final outcome combined. Is that what you were asking? </P>
<P>MAN 3: Yeah, the picture that got larger. </P>
<P>EARLA: Yeah, it became less intense every time.</P>
<P>STEVE: Which is another way of saying more unconscious, I think. </P>
<P>MAN 3: I had a similar experience.</P>
<P>MAN 4: It doesn’t make any difference which picture, which corner you put the outcome picture. </P>
<P>STEVE: As far as I know, it seems to be better on the lower corner. Whether it’s left or right—I’ve heard Richard [Bandler] do it a number of ways. I’ve tried it different ways. You can even have it come out of the middle of the picture. You can do a lot of stuff. It seems to be better having it from down, going up. Any other questions for her? </P>
<P>MAN 5: What was--tell us about the context or circumstances in which nail biting exists.</P>
<P>STEVE: OK. So watching TV is one of them.</P>
<P>EARLA: When I was bored, watching TV, or when I was nervous. </P>
<P>MAN5: Notice the temporal shift "was." (past tense, indicating it is no longer the case.)</P>
<P>STEVE: OK, good one. [Many expressions of realization]</P>
<P>WOMAN 1: What was the question?</P>
<P>STEVE: He said, "Tell us about the context in which you bite your nails" and she answered "was."</P>
<P>MAN 5: And earlier she did say, "when" </P>
<P>STEVE: Yeah. "When I am watching television." [Present tense] This is a lovely way to check your work. It’s also a way to <I>do</I> your work. </P>
<P>EARLA: Do you have any weird things that work on smoking?</P>
<P>STEVE: We have a lot of weird things that work on smoking. And I welcome you to try this one in the exercise, because I have done it. The first time I learned the Swish, I didn’t understand beans about it. I just thought, what the hell, we’re going in and doing some typography and the gal who does typography for us smoked at that time, a couple of packs a day. And I did this thing with her for three minutes and she cut down immediately to one to three cigarettes a day--which at that time was satisfactory for her. That was OK with her. And then it started creeping up again. And then Connirae did some work with her after we really understood how to make this thing go. And when she was done, she has not smoked since. She even <I>tried</I> to smoke a cigarette, got half way through, and spit it out. Now that won’t work for all--smoking is a much more complex one and it won’t always work, and in fact the standard Swish that I’m talking about will only work about 70 percent of the time, for reasons which we’ll go in to in a moment. We’ll teach you how to make it work 100 percent of the time. </P>
<P>WOMAN 2: That’s what I want. I’ve had that done for smoking. It worked completely for three months. I didn’t want one. I just found--it’s like I never smoked. </P>
<P>STEVE: Well how long did it take you to do that?</P>
<P>WOMAN 2: For me to do it?</P>
<P>STEVE: Yes.</P>
<P>WOMAN 2: I didn’t do it. I had it done.</P>
<P>STEVE: Somebody did it. How long did it take for them to do it?</P>
<P>WOMAN 2: Five minutes.</P>
<P>STEVE: See, five minutes every three months might not be too bad. [Laughter]</P>
<P>MAN 6: Such a schedule! [Laughter]</P>
<P>STEVE: No, every three months you go back and you spend five minutes. You manicure your nails more often than that. It probably takes as long. So that’s one possibility. The other possibility is to do it differently, such that it’s permanent.</P>
<P>CONNIRAE: It’s now three months since this demonstration, and Earla no longer bites her nails. In fact, she says that for the first time in her life her nails are actually about a quarter-inch longer than her fingers. The Standard Swish, which you’ve just observed, is effective something like 70 percent of the time, if done well, because size and brightness are powerful submodalities for many people. Once you know how to do the Standard Swish, the next step is to learn how to create "designer" Swishes. To do that, you first identify what submodalities are powerful for the person you’re working with. Then you create a Swish using precisely <I>those</I> submodalities. When you do this, you know that the Swish you’re creating works the same way that person’s brain works. And it’s much more apt to work. [For an example of a "Designer Swish," see the transcript "Swish Pattern #2"]</P>

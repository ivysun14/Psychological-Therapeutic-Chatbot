<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I noticed you let out a huge sigh of sorts as you walked through the door.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I just - I mean I sort of was in my room studying like, because I had a class canceled today so I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - came back, started studying and fell asleep and woke up like 15 to five.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm like oh, geez, I have to - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to go to psych clinic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was kind of rushing to get here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Have you had time to settle yourself and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah no I'm fine. I'm not feeling so rushed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Is that typically how life is for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rushing to get places?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, it depends. It just depends on how busy I am and how - usually it's what time I leave or how much time I have in between when I have to be somewhere and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and when I leave somewhere else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's fine. I don't have the feeling that I'm always running somewhere. Just half of the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just half the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What's typically going on half the time you find yourself...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, I don't know. I try to keep things easy. Um, I mean if I have sort of - I mean if I have sort of like a big block of time - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - until my next class then I'll leave ten, fifteen minutes before I actually need to be there just so that I can sort of walk calmly there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only sometimes do I start doing something and then just completely forget about the time and be like, oh my God, I'm still in my room. I haven't gotten ready. I haven't like gotten ready to leave yet. I have ten minutes before I have to be there. It's in the MLB [ph] which is far away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, got to run! That only happens sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and that was probably the first time I've fallen asleep during the day all year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was different you think about today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I've just been sort of tired. I mean the fact that I wasn't in class, I was just sort of in my room reading - I was lying on my bed reading.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just sort of passed out. Fell asleep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. I'm hearing you that there's a lot going on so you're probably really just tired.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's been going on there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I have - I have two exams next week. And this week just sort of has been busy. Just like outside of class there have just been a lot of things that I've had to go to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Monday was really busy. I had - normally my schedule is that on Mondays that I have three classes like 10 to 11:30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just two classes fill that time. Then I have one and a half hours before my next class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But on Monday I had a meeting for a Grant that I've got.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - and it was like a luncheon kind of thing. And just the added hassle of that - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had to like run to get - like I had to run back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had about 15, 20 minutes like in my room that I had to use to get ready and then I had to leave immediately.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To get there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was just sort of hectic and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - sort of took away that nice block of time that I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you normally use there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Then I had to go back to my room, get ready for my next class in the next half hour window.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it was a pleasant luncheon but it was just sort of one of those things that you just sort of are like, God, I have to get this over with. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's just something to keep in mind. And then I had to - for an English class I had to go to a book reading and today I have to go to one too (2:59). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now that's not going to - how - I mean how do you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Book readings?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the one on Monday was bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because - just because the quality of the literature was... because basically what it was a Greek author from the early twentieth century.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it was like Modern Greek, not any of the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They - I mean there were two professors here had basically spent the last decade translating about a hundred or so verses of his.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean it's - I don't know if it just wasn't translated very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I thought - I was sort of impressed by the fact that it maintains some sort of lyricism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it was sort of musical but it just wasn't very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just sort of angst-y.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, the world is so bleak and I am this tortured artist sort of feel to it and it just wasn't very good. And that was depressing. Tonight's supposed to be better though. It's a open mic night going on at the O'neil pub.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I technically don't have to go to this one but I just want to get it out of the way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I have to go to two book readings over the course of the semester.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, the semester? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just easier for me to go to this one because I know about it and remember about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you write any of your own or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: From time to time. With varying degrees of success. Nothing - nothing that's outstanding by any means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of the time it sort of boils down to that angst-y stuff that I don't really like. Which is unfortunate because I'm writing things that I'm not a big fan of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. What do you make of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I mean it's just sort of something that grabs a hold of me or write something down and then realize that I don't think it's very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It doesn't really bother me because I don't' really have any ambitions to be a writer by any means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, I mean like I doodle and draw all the time. But I have no ambitions of being an artist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being an artist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a painter or an artist of any sort so, it doesn't bother me. It's just a thing that relaxes me sometimes or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just sort of an impulse that I have to sort of just jot something down or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or scribble something on a page.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you do that as a form of coping sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just sort of nice to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To sort of ignore everything else and just focus on what I'm drawing on a page.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also just sort of nice to see how like different pens sort of form different lines and what you can sort of do with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually a buddy of mine gave me a pen recently that just - fabulous lines.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just wonderful to draw with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then - and I lost it today. And so now I'm thinking of just going to Alricht's [ph] on my way back and getting my own box of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Well that's pretty neat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's kind of nice, I mean recently I bought myself a comic book by this artist named Jonan Vasquez [ph] who actually, he's done some - I mean he even had his own cartoon on Nickelodeon for awhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Invaders Zin [ph]. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What cartoon was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What cartoon was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Invader Zin [ph]. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he drew this really disturbed comic book that, I mean sort of once you get beyond this disturbing images of the violence and sort of - I mean it's very irrational violence and based on that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's a lot of really interesting subtext to the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I also kind of like the way that it's drawn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean even the figures like beyond the violence - not the violent images in particular - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like the - just some of the images of just like the free standing characters are sort of fun. So I've been copying those characters sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there any characters that you tend to draw more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not particularly (5:56). I mean there - the main character's sort of written in such a way that even though he's such a disturbed, freakish human being he's still sort of likeable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's not - I don't identify with any character there. I mean there's sort of one minor character that I identify with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, I mean the book is - the comic book is titled "Johnny the Homicidal Maniac" and it's about this guy who just goes around killing people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For a number of reasons. But I mean sort of the subtext talks about how sort of miserable humanity is, how he himself is this warped figure who sort of projects his own emotions onto inanimate objects. Or I mean he's got various strange characters that he sort of created himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's sort of like his conscience. His manic side, his depressive side. Because there's very clear images of sort of that bipolar  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - situation and sort of how his emotions are so strong that as he feeds sort of emotion into these inanimate objects  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They sort of take a life on their own. And they speak to him and just sort of a fascinating way of looking at it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The first time I read it I was just deeply disturbed by the whole thing because of just the images and things that happened. Then - but then when I read it a second time I sort of just pushed that stuff aside, the really sickening things, and sort of looked at what's underneath.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What caused you to approach it again or to reread it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just interesting. I mean I really liked looking at the way it was drawn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was just an interesting thing to look at because the first time when I did read it I mean I was disturbed by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But sort of - I mean the disturbing part is, forms like the first two-thirds of it. And then sort of - you sort of overcome that when you finally get to that last third, it sort of mellows down a lot. And it's a lot less gory, a lot less of that, and a lot more of sort of look on other things. And I just really liked the way that it sort of ended and I just felt that I should go through it again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there any themes in this particular comic book that you identify with in your own life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, well, there's sort of a - I mean, there's sort of an interesting look on Heaven and Hell. And like Heaven is not anybody - is not particularly good and Hell is not particularly evil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just everyone in Heaven is content.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's drawn in such a way that everyone's just sitting in a chair doing nothing. Because they have no - they feel no reason to do anything else because they're all just content.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whereas everyone in Hell is sort of in - it's almost like the regular world. But everyone becomes so obsessed with everything. And like they're so greedy for whatever, for the - for money, for sex, for possessions. I mean there's one character who just wants some free cream cheese. And he just goes insane when he's told - he goes into a bagel shop, asks for free cream cheese and is told that he has to pay an extra 10 cents and runs out screaming. And I sort of see that as a sort of very interesting dynamic that, like ignoring Heaven and Hell as like good and evil and focusing rather on desire versus lack thereof.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. And in Hell, how do you see that fitting into your own world or your own experience?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, happiness I think stems from contentment. Sort of the more I want things the more miserable I get because I can't have them (9:07). Or  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there any things in particular that you've wanted that you couldn't have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well sure. I mean that happens to everybody. Where you want - you want to be able to take a class but it fills up before you can get in. Where you want to enter into a relationship with someone but they're not interested. Where you want to sort of just - I don't know. That sort of thing happens a lot to everyone I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's probably true. A lot of [indiscernible] have to deal with that desire.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it like things that we can't have we sort of want more. And I mean - so I think, I don't know. I mean I think I can identify with that. I mean that's sort of a universal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. You want to share more specifically with me because you know during this time I'm trying to get to know you. Trying to get a clear understanding of who you are and you know what brings you here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if there are specific things that you  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well one thing that I sort of wanted for awhile now is to sort of enter into a steady, stable relationship with someone. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, and I've been sort of - I've been single for almost three years now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Single meaning - because people have varying definitions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I haven't had any girlfriend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't had a stable girlfriend. I mean for about a year and a half of that time though, during my senior year and during my first, like the first half of freshman year of college I - I mean I was sort of in this very strange situation with my best friend where neither of us were really sure where we stood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there was sort of a romantic interest on both sides but we couldn't actually decide on what - where we - if we wanted to stay friends or actually sort of be in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was very awkward, very - and it was actually probably more damaging that there was a romantic interest there than if there hadn't been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean we - during that whole period it was either us not talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of, but I mean not - talking but not actually communicating anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like just sort of like, hi. Hi. What's up? Nothing. Okay. Versus just fighting and just arguing and being like, why is this so stupid? Why are we...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean now we're great friends again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay so it - how long did it take for you guys to repair your friendship after you realized that it wasn't going to go any further?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One or two weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then it was pretty much back to how it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. It is a particularly awkward time you know to  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - to find out that there is relationship interest with your friend and then deciding what you do with this. I don't know. And that can cause strain on the relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There was a year and a half of just awkwardness the whole time. And it doesn't help that she goes to Ohio State and I'm here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In Ohio?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean we didn't even  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's a rival or because of  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because of the distance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we're not seeing each other every day. I mean back home we didn't go to the same high school because I went to an all male Catholic high school and she went to the public school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But we lived three houses down from each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it would never have been a problem in high school to sort of - I mean it would have been, it wouldn't have been easy necessarily just because of I mean not seeing each other in school which a lot of people can do sort of if they're going to the same school (12:05). But it wasn't  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you have that time after school, on the weekends if you're in the same...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean even the - if we were to go to - I mean even - had we gone to the same school there would have even been the excuse, oh, we have to do homework together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we would have been in similar classes or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean going to a different school you can't really have that same I guess situation. But it would've been a lot easier if we had actually entered into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in high school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who's idea was it Kurtis for you all to not move forward?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't so much an idea it was just a - we were constantly not - like we were constantly misunderstanding each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. On what issues?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well basically it was that she always had a stock question, what do you want?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's her name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Lexi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lexi?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm. She always had a stock question, what do you want? And the only answer that I could ever give because this is the only answer that I had. This was just how I felt. Was I just want you to be happy. And I sort of, I mean looking back I sort of know where the miscommunication was and, although I thought it was sort of obvious that I meant you know I think I can make you happy, she didn't get that part I guess. And so she didn't sort of see that - I mean honestly if we had just decided okay, finally we'll just be friends and that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or we'll date and - which, if either of those made her happy I was fine with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought I could make her happy in that relationship thing but if she didn't think that was the case that's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was sort of where a miscommunication sort of arose. Also I mean I never really knew how interested she ever was in a relationship like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like a boyfriend/girlfriend rela - I didn't know if she wanted to be in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship or not or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you ever ask her directly or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I did. And she's like well, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it was always very - it was always very complicated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you all intimately involved, sexually involved?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, there were a couple times where we wound up kissing on her couch but there - nothing really sexual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Is there any particular reason why not? I mean...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No interest I guess in taking - I mean I think that probably would have made things even more awkward than they were, to have some sort of sexual contact without actually being in that relation - in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, in a steady sort of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So you're with Lexi for this year and a half...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without actually being with each other  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And without...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What was it like for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it was terrible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can just imagine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was awful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you describe it a little bit for me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just - the thing that I hated the most about it was the uncertainty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just really want to have control over my own life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um, because I can't and don't really want to control anybody else. And so to be in that sort of uncertainty where I don't know what's going on, and I just hate that. And it's just - it just sort of, it almost felt like I was being eaten away inside just because I...</p>

<p> COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was a very hard relationship to sort of - because on one hand I really - one of my biggest fears the whole time was that if she and I were to ever date  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that, and it were not to work out between us  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that our friendship would be ruined. And I definitely didn't want that. That's - I would hate to lose her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that might have been an obstacle too. Yeah. Probably would have been a very big obstacle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so? Like it seems like your wheels are turning.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean I don't want to enter into a relationship if that's a possibility, you know? I wanted to be certain that that wouldn't ever be a possibility. But there is no  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it not working out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well of in the event that it doesn't work out  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of losing her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of losing her entirely. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I sort of wanted some certainty that that wouldn't happen before I entered into a relationship with her. Before I just outright said look, I want to be your boyfriend. I want to be with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was a huge - that was a huge fear of mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I wanted so much - I wanted certainty about it but you can't really ever be certain about something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No one can ever make that promise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think that's why it was sort of an obstacle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I can see how that would be. And like, that's the question - two questions that come up for me is how had you experienced losing someone in the past? Like prior to that? And how does that fear of losing someone - how can it be influencing why you aren't in a relationship now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean losing someone, I - there have been lots of situations where I had like a girlfriend and we said look, let's still be friends. I didn't say that, if she said it or whoever said it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's still be friends and we'd say oh, okay yeah, sure. And then it sort of just falls apart naturally. And it sucks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To be in that situation because I just - why? Why is that necessary? And it's never fun to lose a friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I've lost plenty of friends before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Under what circumstances?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, well in high school I was very sort of anti-drug, anti-drinking, anti-smoking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And a buddy of mine, good buddy from middle school by the name of Chris.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was always - he was always getting in trouble for having weed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He was always getting in trouble. I mean and he's just getting grounded constantly and so I never got to see him, especially since he went to the same high school she did, the public one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - and so I mean not getting to see your friends is one thing. And then the fact that they're - not being able to see - just because of school is one thing. But not being able to see them because then they sort of go and jeopardize any sort of capability for maintaining a friendship, because you have to see people to stay friends with them really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just kept ruining it for himself. And then every time we did see each other he was just a completely different person. He was always just stoned and sort of in a mindset where it was just not fun. It's not fun to hang out with someone when you're sober and they're really high and just not interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The same thing happened with my buddy Leonard from middle school too where he was always getting high and just not fun to hang around. His parents didn't care, they didn't bust him or anything like that so he could hang out (18:00). But he was just - he was just high all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that just made things sort of...upsetting I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Upsetting for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what sense of the word?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just frustrating to think that you're going to spend time with a person and then realize that you're spending time with someone completely different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean they really were two different people when they were - each of them became a completely different person when they were high.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was friends with the sober one, not the high one. The high one I didn't like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And nobody wants to spend time with someone they don't like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it was just frustrating to - and it was especially frustrating to see Chris always getting in trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it got to the point where his parents didn't even trust him when he accidentally spilled White-Out on a paper. And I saw him do it, I was there with him when he had a bottle of White-Out and he was whiting something out and it just fell out of his - it slipped out of his hand and covered the page.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And his parents thought that he was just sniffing White-Out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then, so he got in trouble for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't there when they found out but I knew what happened, that caused the White-Out to be on the page.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that - it's just very frustrating to see someone sort of ruin their own life. And I don't take that very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you take it? What did you do to...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just sort of was like, look, I don't want to hang out with the guy who's always stoned and always in trouble. And basically I stopped calling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's happened to me a lot where I sort of am the only one putting any sort of effort into a friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where I'm the only one calling. I'm the only one who wants to - who comes up with ideas like hey, let's go hang out here. Let's do this, let's hang out. And a lot of the time people just don't call. And that's sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How have you understood that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It used to affect me a lot more than it does now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it was just always sort of hurtful, it almost seemed like they didn't care enough to want to maintain a friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just shut down after awhile. Now I mean I don't really shut down the same way. It's rare. I mean it has to be sort of a more extreme case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is a similar thing happening now where it seems like you're the one who's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of lost a very good friend from high school. He was my best friend during high school but now he just sort of doesn't really care. Doesn't ever try to like call or even like, even online. If I see him online, on Instant Messenger and I send him like, I send him like, hi or whatever, half the time he responds, half the time he doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm wondering how have you made sense of that in your mind? Why is it that people aren't returning phone calls or aren't taking more initiative?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well half the time - it just sort of seems like they're not interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Any reason why you would think they wouldn't be interested?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have no idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you thought about it at all or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I have but I mean I've never really come up with an adequate answer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never come up with a - I drive people away. Because I try not to. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never, I've never snapped at them. I've never told them like - I've never done anything outright like offensive to anybody to make them angry with me or upset with me or dislike me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To my knowledge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They just lose interest in me. And people grow apart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Especially some people because you had friendships in high school with, now you're in college, that's sometimes  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think I have a very hard time losing friends like that (21:05). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think it's just part of change and I'm not - I don't like when things are changed unnecessarily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I sort of like keeping things the way they are. Like every time I go home and I see something's different it sort of bothers me. Because it just feels - it sort of takes on a different feeling. It's not the feeling of home anymore, it's someplace else. Every time some - like it's more of that feeling every time I go home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of changes have you dealt with in your life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, do you mean [audio gap] six weeks. Or seven weeks. And the ground floor was all painted differently, the stairs, everything was painted. And it was just such a shock to me. It was just - it just wasn't - like I felt like I was going somewhere, I had a very definite image in my mind and it just felt like someone  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [indiscernible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Um, first time I came back from college my parents had completely redone my room. They had moved my desk, they had gotten rid of my bed. They'd repainted the walls, put in new carpet, put in a futon. They changed the bookshelf. I mean it was a completely different room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did they share that with you ahead of time that they were doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or tell you about it? You just came home...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I came home and was taken by surprise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that like for you? To come home to your home room is remodeled, it's not even your room.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was - it was annoying. Like I still don't like sleeping in that room. Like now I prefer to sleep in the guest room in the basement because it's just more convenient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean before it was my room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt at home there. That was sort of where I lived.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now it's not. It, I mean, I come home and everything's just sort of - I mean even now like when I come home and I'm used to the fact that it's different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just not - it's just not my room the same way. I feel like I'm crashing on someone's couch. It's like a hotel room that I've been in a lot of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where I'm sort of more - it's like, it's a temporary base for when I'm home but it's not...I feel more at home in the guest room because the guest room hasn't changed since we've moved into the house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's the most - that's where I feel most at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How um did you respond to your parents or from walking in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just sort of griped about it. I mean it's their house, it's sort of their - they have whatever right to - they have the right to do whatever they want. I gripe about it, I sort of give them a hard time but I mean most of the time I'm kidding. It is their house. But it still sort of has that - it sort of still has that feeling of strangeness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not being what I remember it to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel put out at all or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not - I mean, well, define "put out"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More in the sense of I think of the college student, you know when you come home and your room is remodeled it's like oh, you're moving me out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, it was  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like this isn't my space anymore. What are you trying to tell me? You don't want me here. You know, it's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it was actually, I had a big - it almost seems like every time I come home there's a big sense of injustice (24:04). COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean what - when I first left, about two weeks after I was gone freshman year my parents got a new TV. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of my childhood in that house it was the same TV.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was small, not very good, the quality was sort of fading.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I come home from - for Thanksgiving, it's a huge TV. Flat screen, big screen TV and they got it right after I left. And I mean it's sort of - coming to college I had bought myself a TV that was slightly bigger, slightly better than my old, than like the house old TV. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I brought it with me and I was so happy that it was yes, it's the best TV in the family. And then I come home and they've got this just fantastic TV that I would've loved to use. I mean part of the reason why I never really had party - like, I never had get-togethers in high school where like everybody comes over to watch the game or a movie or something was because we just had a bad TV. It just wasn't the house for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was fine, that never was any problem for me. I didn't care. But then I come home and it's the perfect TV for that sort of thing and that was unfortunate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wishing it was back then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I wish it had happened while I was there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is this about Kurtis when you say that - it seems like there's a pattern here okay. They get the television when you leave. They remodel the house when you're gone. They remodel your room when you're gone. How do you...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because I don't like things changing without sort of my input. I mean whenever something changes in my life, and it comes from me it's sort of like just a - it's almost like on an impulse. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember one time in high school my room was just sort of there and then I finally just decided you know what? I'm going to put things on my walls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to duct tape them, hang them, whatever. And I just started putting things on my walls, things that I thought were funny, things that - and I just did it all at once.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when the change doesn't come from me, it's not my choice, I don't like it. You know it's coming out of my control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, again it's the thing of control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it's - it's hard to have people change things of yours, or what you feel is yours, without your knowledge or your consent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think my parents changed things because they know they can. They've been - they've probably been wanting to for a long time and they just never wanted to with me around because I would always object to it and make things harder. And whine and bitch and moan until either they did it or - it's just always more unpleasant when - and that was my fault.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I always complain about changes going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kinds of things or changes occurred in your family or things that your parents changed or wanted to change that you protested or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When we first moved into the house I was eight years old. And one of the things - when we were moving I don't remember ever moving any of my own stuff into my room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because my parents - my mom took me to Hershey that summer and - as she did every summer until I was fifteen. And when I got back we sort of came to a new house and I just didn't - like they basically hadn't even told me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hadn't told you that you were moving?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if - I don't know if they did or not, I don't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this was what age?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Eight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But one of the things that was new was my dad had basically gone and put a - cut down a ficus - not a very big one, it was - it was sort of dead, too and like this thick around the trunk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And put it in the corner of my room. Had gotten this ficus into my room and put it in the corner. And it was fantastic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean how many kids can say they have a ficus in their room (27:00).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ficus in their room, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I loved hanging - and this was probably - it still is just my favorite part of the room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it just, I mean that's such a great thing to have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The ficus is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The ficus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They wanted to get rid of it when I went into - when I was going into high school. They said you're old - you're too old for it, get rid of it. I was like, absolutely not! And we had lots of arguments about it and then just said there's no way you're getting rid of that ficus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they still haven't gotten rid - to my knowledge they still haven't gotten rid of it. And I was home over fall break because I think that I just wouldn't forgive them if they got rid of my ficus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this is the ficus that's in the room where the sofa is now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They remodeled the room but they kept the ficus. I think they know that they wouldn't have gotten away with that. I mean because that's just - that's sort of the last thing that's left in my room from my childhood. I just absolutely love that ficus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can imagine. When you reflect on the ficus like what comes to mind? What does it symbolize for you, anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh. It's sort of a feeling of comfort. I mean I'm sort of at the point in my life where I kind of wish I was a kid again. Because I sort of know what I could have done differently.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I also think generally I was happier as a kid because everything was a lot less complicated. And yeah people made fun of me, I was a little kid. But everything was a lot less complicated. And you sort of want to go back to that to a great extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was less complicated how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't have to think about girls, I didn't have to think about becoming an adult, I didn't have to think about my future, I didn't have to think about like the massive amount of work that I have to do for school. And about getting a job. I mean even things like driving or - I didn't have to think about living on my own. I didn't have to think about getting my own food. I didn't have to think about doing my own laundry. I didn't have to think about any of those things. I really just had to think about like who would win in a fight, Superman or Batman. It was - it was never a huge thing. Like I just sort of - it could just be nostalgia on my part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could have been completely miserable then and I probably was just wishing I could grow up and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there are - with a name like Czarski - C-Z-A-R-S-K-I - kids make fun of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because little kids always make fun of things that are sort of different and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was an overly sensitive child. Like things like that got to me, when people made fun of my name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what happened, like how would you typically respond to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would get upset. I mean there was a time when I sort of responded, I would lash out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Last out how? Verbally or physically or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes physically. Sometimes verbally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just me shouting and calling somebody a name. Or just hitting them. Being - it was just sort of, I didn't really - I was never really good at handling people making fun of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can imagine, it must be terrible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean little kids are just some very mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kids can be cruel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. They're very cruel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without even really meaning to be, you know. They just sort of don't know any better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was upsetting. I was very, very miserable. And I just, I don't know. I still sort of feel nostalgic because I wish I only had that to deal with instead of a lot of the other things that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you at all [indiscernible] during that time in your life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was - I was usually the smartest kid in my class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember as - in first grade I came into a class where I was by far the smartest kid in the class (29:58). And I was reading at a much higher level than everyone else. I - I mean basically first and second grade were completely unnecessary. And I didn't know that. And I probably could have skipped up to third grade which probably would have done some damage socially but I mean it was - it wasn't necessary for me. For me to be in those years. And I mean the only thing I ever learned that I didn't teach myself...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only thing I ever learned from my first or second grade teachers where how to write a cursive i. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so a lot of that was self-taught?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I spent a lot of - I spent a lot of first and second grade borrowing books from the library and just learning about whales and - I had a really big affinity for animals.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I still sort of like the science shows. Not - I sort of like seeing things on a more macro level. I - when biology and chemistry sort of get boiled down into molecules and cells and things like that I lose all interest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like I mean things, talking about ecology and how certain animals do - perform certain functions in their lives. But I find that interesting. Not interesting - it's sort of like a - it's sort of just like a fun little thing for me to think about or to know but not anything that really grabs me as a passion of any sort. And it was sort of just my interest in science as a little kid that sort of made my mom think that I could be a doctor someday. And - but that's not going to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [indiscernible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because of all of the microscopic things. I mean one of the biggest requirements for freshman year for pre-med is doing organic chemistry. And I cannot think of something - of anything that I want to do less than that. I just hated chemistry in high school. I hated biology in high school because it boiled everything down to that sort of molecular level. And the reality is that's what science has sort of turned into. Everything is all about chemistry on a microscopic level, about atoms and molecules and cells and how they sort of react to things and interact with things. And I just don't care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could not possibly care any less than I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's all the little things [indiscernible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just a chore. Science in high school was just the biggest chore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were your relationships like - I'm going to go back for a moment, I mean - you talk about like the first and second grade when you typically were the smartest kid and studied a lot on your own. What were your relationships like, your social relationships?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a couple friends. I mean it was sort of hard to be friends with people who were always making fun of me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That happened a lot. I don't know. I sort of - I'm not sure. I mean it's kind of hard to remember. I mean I don't really remember that well. I mean I always had like one or two friends that were really close to me. Two people that I was always super-friendly with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that true throughout your educational career too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually it sort of changed in middle school and high school. Sort of by the end of middle school I sort of figured it out. I sort of figured out how to sort of gain more respect on a grander scale than just sort of sticking with one or two people and then ignoring everyone else. I started to have a social life at the end of middle school (33:01). And I don't mean like I was going out and drinking or anything because that's  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that's kind of absurd for an eighth grader to be doing those things. Although there were kids who did that. But I mean like just walking down the halls I could sort of be like, hey, what's up, how's it going? To people that I didn't normally - people that I wasn't like best friends with. I sort of knew how to get friendly acquaintances or sort of like marginal friends. And then high school is just fantastic for that because I went to a Catholic high school and they were very progressive about everything and sort of teaching. I mean they had sort of a series of basically things that they want - values that they wanted to instill in every senior by - in every person by the time they graduated that they would sort of fulfill these goals.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was like intellectually confident, loving, religious, open to growth, that sort of thing where it was sort of - I mean it was sort of - it was a very nice feeling because there was no competition between people. I mean not nearly to the same extent that there was in public middle school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Cliques weren't as big of a deal. I mean yeah there were people with their groups of friends and you could sort of see like okay, they're in that group of friends. The football players, the kids who were all in base, the kids who were all in theater.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But everyone was sort of interacting with everyone else. I mean it was great because during my free periods I would be hanging out in - I was hanging out in the offices of the campus minister. And it was usually about five or six of the black kids who were always hanging out with each other and me and another buddy of mine. And we were all just hanging out and it was perfectly normal which was something that never happened in high school. I mean in middle school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Middle school.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean I went to public schools in Concord where there were maybe three black kids in my entire grade.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was just refreshing to sort of sit there and sort of as compared to - everyone was just one of the guys.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was great. And everyone was treated pretty much the same. I mean not the same because - but everyone was treated based on how they behaved and how they treated other people and not based on any sort of like, oh, this person's more popular than everyone else. This person's - didn't matter. No one cared. I mean by the time I graduated I knew everyone in my graduating class and actively disliked three of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one of them because he was just a racist, a homophobe and a self-proclaimed fascist. Just - he just went through high school without getting it at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everyone else I knew them and was friends with them. And - or at least just we were friendly acquaintances the whole time. And it was fantastic. It was just such a great experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I was  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it was something as I'm able to hear the energy in your voice as you describe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no, it was great. I mean I - if I wind up living in Big Rapids, if I wind up actually getting married and having a family I would send - and if I had a son I would send him there in a heartbeat. Like there wouldn't be any question. Just because of how great of an experience it was. I mean I was dealing with personal issues but they were never related with people outside of me. It was - I was really happy to have gone there. And then coming here was sort of - sort of, it almost felt like a step back because it's a lot more clique-ish, a lot more...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [indiscernible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have to wrap it up now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (36:06).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so just so I'm clear on something sounds like just by something we talked about today there may be - you, I'm not sure but if you want to explore your relationship as far as dating relationships, wanting to date but not date. Is that something you wanted to take more of a look at or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm sort of assuming that one of the things that's sort of making me unhappy is just the fact that I'm really lonely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, and I've never been one to sort of be into the just random dating, the - I'm just sort of ready for a meaningful relationship with someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I mean I've had lots of friends who are like oh, yeah, I've been going out with the same person for a year or two years or even six months is just huge because the longest relationship I ever was in was six months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was - and we only got to see each other once a week because of logistics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's something we can definitely explore, is how to first of all kind of flush out what it is you're looking for in a relationship as far as meaning [indiscernible] how that would decrease the amount of loneliness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay? Did you want to meet next week, same time, same place?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, we can do that. Okay Ted. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's it.  Well how have things been since we spoke last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's been happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [LAUGHING], a lot of things.  I just finished school and work finally last Thursday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, how did that go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good, got a B in my class that was really good and uh, so at, like this week is my first week, [LAUGHING] of the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um and then we're going to Alaska —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like on a vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you feeling about the travel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm excited.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, you like travel.  It isn't something —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Brings about anxiety or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've traveled all my life?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You enjoy that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I love it.  We're leaving on Saturday so this week we've been packing like crazy —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got clothes all over my room —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So your moods have been good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Most days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any down days or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some down days?  What, what sort of things get you down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well it's kind of more like uh, sexual stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  So, looking back on those things have you, the type of things that bother you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you feel if you don't think about that you don't really have too much problems emotionally?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you tolerate the uh, Concerta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, I can tell when I'm not on it, [LAUGHING].  Uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the days that you miss you are giving your self some days off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah but I can tell there's a difference there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well the reason that we want to, you give yourself as much as possible days off is to preserve the benefit of it so you can stay on the low dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thirty—six mg is the typical dose but I have some people that just try to take it every single day because they like the feeling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if you do that after a while you'll what's called attenuate and the dose doesn't help you anymore.  So if you can give yourself weekends or times where its not that important, then if your studying or reading something.  I'll give you a prescription but what I'm saying, if you're on vacation, but I'm saying that try to give your self some days off on days —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That its not as crucial for the ADHD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For the inattentive part and it will preserve how long the 36 mg works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah we were actually going to, I was going to ask if I could try taking 30 and see if it too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now aren't you on Concerta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're taking the 18 or the 36?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we got the 18 —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, oh yeah that's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because you know I tried the free trial —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then you told me to go up to two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like for [INAUDIBLE] one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm going to see like just a day or two to see how taking three goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh do you have three?  Do you have enough to take three?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, just for a couple of days, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay because you'd know right away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you'd have to take a 54 mg dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah but we don't want to get that prescription yet we just, like I just want to see if its too much or if it helps more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you would prefer I leave them to 18 mg —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And give you three of them a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right we can do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least to start off like if it's too much at first then I'll go back down to two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's what's called a partial response.  When you still have some symptoms left over —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're still having, and what's the symptoms that cause you to want to try a little more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well like, like you know, I don't know like you know your thoughts are bouncing all over the place —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like the two helps me but there's still a little bit of that that's still like going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I understand and that is very typical because when you're young and healthy your liver displaces this stuff out as fast as it can —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so you might need more to get the result.  What I'm saying though is to preserve the best benefit of this medicine is give your self some days off and then when you reintroduce it it'll the lower dose will, will still work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I'll give you enough to take three a day of the 18 and that's not that unusual, that's not that unusual a dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has your weight been stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's been your weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, one [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You told me you weighed 167 when we visited the first time —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and it's still right around there somewhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not less than that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to think.  It's been a while.  It's between 155 and 170.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The reason that you want to keep track of it is these kinds of medicines sometimes change your appetite —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're tall enough where that's not unusual a weight, here's the, here's 67 here and so you're right at this range right here —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and even though it says over weight that's kind of leaning towards could you lose 10 pounds, yeah you could but that's still well within a typical weight for a person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, no my appetite hasn't changed, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I think that the big thing is that this needs to fit in to your life not the other way around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I want this to not disrupt your life, disturb anything you want, to do, you know, what, whatever it is that you decide you want to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It hasn't so far, [LAUGHING].  Yeah I can tell, like I can tell when it's wearing off to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the, pardon me the theory of ADHD does that make sense to you?  That you haven't caused it by being, you know, lacking intellect or it's not something —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you tried hard you wouldn't hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You understand that it's probably some developmental problem we haven't yet been able to define but we think it has something to do with, I know this is theoretical but there is a process called myelination of the nerve cells where they, they grow this sheath —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And some people that have this we think don't have sufficient sheath and, of the myelin, and so whenever they have something that they're trying to focus on there's a dissipation or dis uh, diffusion of the impulse so if, if you give them a stimulant it's sort of like turning up the volume of a radio that's got static on it.  It helps that be heard, there's still a static but it's, you can still make out the gist of it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sort of it's way to think about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it doesn't make sense from a person have the [INAUDIBLE] said why would you give a stimulant to someone's that hyperactive.  That's kind of opposite of what you would think.  You would think you'd give them a sedative.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But sedatives obviously make it a lot worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's definitely not going to help you concentrate to take a sedative.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you never get uh, higher than normal.  Like you're the greatest person on the Earth, can't sleep for days, something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any thoughts to hurt or kill yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And [INAUDIBLE] problem and you don't hear things or see things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't feel like people are trying to hurt or kill you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No paranoid type thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We go over all that stuff just because sometimes when you're taking stimulants especially, not this one so much as some of the other ones, they, people get paranoid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but if your taking Adderall, Dexedrine, some of the amphetamines, you know, it can make you feel paranoid.  So, that's why I'm really hoping we can get this medicine to work for you.  What has your family said?  Have they said one way or the other about how you're doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They haven't talked too much about it actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't know that they haven't said anything getting worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're pleased that your schoolwork is getting better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, how's things in the romance department?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fine, I don't have a boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ain't got no romance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you don't, you don't need to I just want to make sure that's not a factor in any of this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Check your blood pressure while we're thinking about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just [INAUDIBLE] machine will do, do that.  Put both feet flat on the floor like that, this on your wrist, if you'll fold it up like this, it doesn't have to be tight.  Let it do it's little thing there.  We do need to watch because sometimes when you're taking stimulants you feel a fluttery feeling in your heart or you get dizzy —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had any of that fluttery sensation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like you feel like your hearts beating fast, nothing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No not, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And no dizziness or fainting spells?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about gritting your teeth sometimes people when using a stimulant your, you find yourself grinding your teeth or gritting your teeth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I [LAUGHING] not that I can think of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I said not that I can think of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you would know.  Yeah I guess you would know that one huh?  Well what questions have occurred to you about this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing really, [LAUGHING].  I've been so busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And no racing thoughts?  You don't have any kind of racing thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean by that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're, you're mind goes round and round and you can't turn your mind off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh a few times yeah</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was, that was before I started taking this stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, when you took this you don't have them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wait, when it starts to wear off sometimes I will, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh, no racing thoughts are typically something that's bothering you and you're thinking about it over and over again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your mind jumps from one thing to the other.  It's a symptom of mania or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hypomania.  We look for it when people are using this type of medicine because we want to make sure there's no signs of bipolar disorder, speed up, you know, doing something to your mood.  It doesn't look like to me there's any problems with this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't seen, seemed to display any, your pulse is normal at 72 and your blood pressure is 104/68.  Those are normal readings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Yeah that, I guess the racing thoughts is the only thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about as far as uh, doing things that you typically enjoy.  Do you find that you can enjoy them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah for the most part.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No problems that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're just like, every once in a while, sometimes I find myself like something I would normally like to go do —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I just don't want to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But not so much —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you don't enjoy it or that you're fearful of being in the social —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Situations?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing like that?  No headaches, stomach aches, nothing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when you're around people you can enjoy things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You said you looked forward to doing things go on vacation, do the things that are involved with —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Going up there and being around uh, Sarah Palin and hang out with the grizzly bears."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], yeah, [LAUGHING] exactly.  Yeah I enjoy being around people.  I like being out and about doing things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I think that whenever you go through something like ADHD it's like your confidence suffers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're, you're feeling like I can do something and you become almost pessimistic about that you can do things, be happy, be around other people, things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I just don't want that for you.  I want you out there trying find things to make you happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But something like this sometimes makes you feel inadequate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and I look for signs or symptoms of depression but if we help you put it in it's proper perspective I hope this doesn't make you feel any different than it would be if I told you you needed eye glasses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It really, I mean, at first it kind of bothered me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but it hasn't like I don't think medications effected me in a negative way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if, if you, if your going through this process in the right way.  In the way that want you to you will see this as something wrong, that has a medical origin —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, or else I wouldn't give you medicine —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but I wanted to change how you think of yourself —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or, or that what you can achieve, what you, what you attempt to do —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's, that's actually where you limit yourself.  When you begin to doubt that you can do something, when you begin to believe I'm just no good at this, I'm not a good student, I can't remember, I can't learn, I need to take a lesser job or not except a responsibility change.  Then you're going to, you're going to hold your own self back.  So that's why I want you to give this treatment a fair chance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It really doesn't have that much to do with depression.  It has to do with more practical thought.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and ADHD has come to be recognized that missed a lot of young people.  Especially people like you that aren't hyperactive —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we catch all the boys that are up there running around the room or throwing erasers —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all that stuff but we miss the girls that's sitting there just day dreaming looking out the window getting a C instead of an A —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because nobody cares so she didn't do the work, that's, that's not, that doesn't disrupt the class but it's not the best for you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we've found probably a substantial percentage of people, much as 15% that have ADHD but do not grow out of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How many, what 50?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifteen percent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So let's say —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you look at a population of say 8% of people that are going to have ADHD in some form —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's as many as of that group, maybe one percent, are going to continue to have it past 18 like you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When they're in their adulthood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so see right now you're in your learning process.  You're in the stage of your life where you're learning new things, you had to take school to learn to pursue the career that you want to pursue.  Well, when you're having to do that, that's when ADHD affects you the most.  When you're doing something that you know how to do and you're doing it repetitively over and over you don't really have as much trouble with ADHD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we want you to be able to do this at this learning stage of your life, we want you to have confidence to be able to take this treatment and then pursue something that may be challenging.  It may seem like you can't do it but if we give you the confidence there's no reason why you should restrict yourself or hold yourself back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, does, does that make sense?  Now a lot of people say well do I have to take this the rest of my life then?  Not necessarily.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, not necessarily, um, it depends on um, is, is it going to be that you have to stay in something where you're learning all the time?  Now, some jobs it is —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But probably what you'll discover is there's time whenever you don't need as much help with the ADHD medicine, you can use other things.  You can use organizers, sticky—pad notes, reminders —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You adapt is what we're talking about —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What this medicine is for is those situations that you don't adapt to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that you're not either able to adapt or it's impossible —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you're, you're constantly learning something different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, which is, in college.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's what college is.  That's all, that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wouldn't even give it to you if I didn't believe that you had at all ADHD —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I would say just study harder, you know, get you, get you a research, research lab partner —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Get you, you know, get you tapes, tape record the meeting and then, you know, just go through the whole process again after the lecture —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But think about how much time you would waste if you can't sit there and focus.  It would take you two and half hours to do something where you just do it in 45 minutes and you can spend the time watching a movie or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's why you want to go ahead and use this treatment as much as you may not like to or want to.  If you use this treatment during this process you're going to find the way that's best for you, whatever that way is.  But I truly believe this is not enough medicine to hurt you.  If you'll let me periodically check you make sure we know what your weight is, your 5'7" tall, is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and we know your weights in that range that's expectable then we don't need to worry about this medicine hurting you because all it might do is make you a little bit less prone to eat —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're probably at your normal height, your adult height —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because there are some people that will grow in to their 20s but not very many.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Relatively speaking.  Most people's growth is over with by the time they're 15, 16 years old.  But what should we discuss today, what, what's on your mind about this or what we ought to talk about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I all ready asked my question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and, and it makes sense to you what Concerta is, it's methylphenidate.  The chemical methylphenidate also known as Ritalin —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's in the form Concerta covers the day better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it makes it where you can study, pardon me can study some after dinner —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not lose the benefit of taking it; because otherwise you'd have to take it and it might keep you awake.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it, I think it's usually around like 7:30, 8:00 when I notice especially —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Between 7:00 and 8:00 when I notice it starts —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wearing off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I think, I think it's agreed with you.  Its introduction like it usually is and we don't really know until you use it how much it's going to help or not help.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did notice like in class um, the days I took it I heard almost everything the teacher would say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The days I didn't not so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well and that, and that's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I wouldn't hear like half of it a lot of times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, why are we doing this if it's not for you to be able to see yourself that it's better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I do believe once you understand it and you see it like it's supposed to be.  This isn't going to bother you.  You're going to look at it like, I didn't know I had this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But after you understand what it is it's truly not going to be any different then if I told you you had to wear an ankle brace for a while —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and it's a health, it's an assistance but it's still up to you what you do and how it turns out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well anything we need to discuss?  Anything else on your mind or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I'd like to do is be permitted to see you right before school goes back —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just to make sure we're not going to need to make an adjustment.  I'm going to give you enough to take three a day of the 18 that should be a dose of up to 54.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay um, okay.  I go back on I think the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let's see if we can shoot for that because we, we'll know by then if you're using it how much good it's doing you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very good I'll see you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

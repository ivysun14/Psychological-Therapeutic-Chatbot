<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Starting from April and this I'd already paid out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I talk to you about the Blue Cross mishagaw (ph) that I had?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn't affect you, so I don't think I mentioned it, but Blue Cross made an error and terminated me from their network.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's probably why those things look like that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could be. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then back in March, it's a long story that I will not bore you with, but they would be reprocessing a bunch of mine from that time so even though—I didn't mention it to you because it doesn't seem to have affected QP (ph) Blue Cross—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Patients I see, but that's probably what it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's probably what it was. Okay. Oh I will not be able to come in either Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, of this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's an imminent mountain lion—the phrase I like to say is droppings. I don't know where that came from at all. But the gold master dropped and therefore I should be in (chuckle)—at some point when they tell us when I need to be around when called to do some training for it so—[00:01:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. I'm actually out Monday and Tuesday of next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause). Let me send you an e-mail if I can reschedule that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sounds perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, oh gosh, since I was in here last, we were talking about, that I had anxiety about porch furniture, date night and planning a long term vacation. Date night was a disaster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In fact, including picking my nose off the floor a disaster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was unforeseen. I decided to spend the whole day cleaning the house, getting everything ready, this and that. And we live near this place, I been cooking lobsters—that has this lobster special right now. [00:02:00]</p>

<p>And they were going to steam one. So I went and picked up two lobsters. It was actually affordable. They're priced very cheap right now. So I was doing this, and I was just showing him how disassemble a lobster. He'd never seen that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mind you, he—if this was surgeries— he deals with all kinds of implants, all that kind of stuff. Giving shots all the time—never seen the inside of a lobster, bam, fainted on the ground.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this was like—the lobsters were already dead and steamed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, but I'm just showing him—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were just taking them apart? Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: he was just—he'd never seen—he's from Kentucky so by the time he sees it it's like lobster bisque or lobster etouffee or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Live lobster is not real common. I mean I haven't had it in years, but I was just showing him how to eat lobster like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, [I get that] (ph). Oh, my gosh does he faint often? I mean you never mentioned it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I remember back in '96 (pause) he fainted once when he got too much blood taken out of him.[00:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But, I mean he's had—he actually has a little bit of a phobia of needles, which is really funny because he gives the injections. But getting past these (ph)—he got over that really quickly, for that part He's actually getting acupuncture for the first time on Friday. So obviously, hopefully, he's going to get past that. </p>

<p>But yeah, apparently I guess he just wasn't expecting the inside of a lobster to look the way it did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was actually not the disaster part of it. Well, that was part of the disaster part of it. (Pause), though yeah, it was just, it started out badly, the whole day. I knew there was something going on because he just—he went off, went out, and tried to drop off the car, and then he came back. And I just couldn't get him out of the house. Finally, I'm like, you know what, I need you out of the house. I need to clean.</p>

<p>And all this stuff. I have like, a whole, I have my whole list of things I need to do, this and that. And at some point, I guess around three or four, he sent me a text message saying, you know, hey, I know that you have stuff going on. Is it okay if I come home? Blah, blah, blah. [00:04:10]</p>

<p>And basically I was talking to him about how frustrating it is because I had to wait for him to get out of the house so I could get all this stuff done. And he seemed weird. He finally admitted he acted out, which in itself was pretty upsetting.</p>

<p>But we're going to still go through with it, at least watching a movie and eating dinner. And then he fainted, and so it was a lot of other little things like that that just went kind of badly.</p>

<p>But I think we're going to at least try again. I think. I don't know. I'm just—I feel like there's so much going on that is just (pause), that it's (pause). I am (pause) just frustrated because it just—as far as I can tell, sometimes he acts out because he just doesn't feel like being a grown-up, sometimes.[00:05:14]</p>

<p>I'm like, so what was going on? It was like 6:00 a.m. apparently. Was something distressing you, this and that? [And more or less he has no idea.] (ph). He thinks it might have been because he was bored. And it's like, (pause), I'm just (pause) really—he'll do it right next to me while I'm asleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the creepiest thing in the world to find out. Yeah. (Pause), He'll get up early in the morning or actually, I am not entirely certain that—because he's so secretive when he's on his computer. He may very well do it very close to me while I'm awake. </p>

<p>Don't know (crying) because whenever I come near he's always hitting buttons to hide windows and all that stuff. (Sniffs), and it's like, that's kind of weird that you do this. I talked to him about that and, in general, he doesn't see it as, the way he uses his computer, as seeming very much like he has something to hide. [00:06:19]</p>

<p>I work with people on a regular basis, not just the elderly. Trust me. The behavior he has, it shows that he has something to hide, when he's doing his computer.</p>

<p>We've discussed this. He's mentioned—he's sort of acting like me. He might do something but not really. I don't know. I just don't have the energy to follow up on it, to be honest. That's pretty much the story of my life is I don't have energy to follow up on it. You know? (Pause).</p>

<p>I (pause), I just (pause), (sigh); everything that's been going on is trying everything that I am. And over the years is the (pause) realization of how much (pause) I missed out on, and how much the—I can't, makes me want very much to change things. I don't know how. [00:07:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have in mind, having missed and changing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (Pause), spending time around people, you know, that kind of stuff. I don't know. I'm just (pause), I am bitter just because of not being able to have (pause) the happy times that I had been hoping for.</p>

<p>Usually when couples don't have kids until much later into the marriage, they at least had some time together. Well, all the time together is dealing with this. You know? (Pause), And (pause) I told him basically that, maybe, (pause)—this is true, that I can't just sit around waiting for this. [00:08:42]</p>

<p>And that, I'm not divorcing him, but maybe we need to look at things that, truly I never really believed in before, of opening up the marriage. Letting me be able to see other people, things like that.</p>

<p>And he was like well, I don't really want that, but I feel like maybe you deserve this. And I'm like (snicker), okay. Not deserve it, but you should be able to. I'm like, okay. It made him upset, but he's like okay.</p>

<p>(Pause), that's pretty freaking devastating. It's not in my rule of play. I didn't say it specifically, I mean I know I didn't say it specifically to get him to fight or—I don't do that kind of crap—like be, I do this so that you can get up, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course you aren't worth (ph) fighting about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't it with that purpose in mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just telling him about being upset, but wanting to be around somebody like, that, you know, (crying) enjoys my company at least or something. And he was pretty passive about the whole thing so (pause), I don't know what to say.[00:09:52] </p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You look like you feel kind of unloved and undesired.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. (Sniffle), (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [That must be saying something] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. (Pause). I mean basically he told me that he would try, to stop this stuff. He's trying. But he can't guarantee anything. I mean that sounds fabulous except for the fact that, I just don't know what to do. [00:10:53]</p>

<p>(Pause). (Sniffle). (Pause).</p>

<p>I mean sometimes he tells me, yesterday, as soon as I got in the car, he told me that he had acted out. I'm like, well why did you go home in the middle of the day? Why didn't you just stay for an extra half an hour before picking me up? You know? (Pause).</p>

<p>I just don't know what to do. (Pause). The thing that just kills me is that I care about him so much (pause). He claims to want to know what's going on, and what's on my mind, and things like that. But really what I have to say, he doesn't want to hear because it upsets the hell out of him. You know? [00:12:02]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As far as what you're going to say about him and the two of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How I feel about things. (Pause), and (pause), I mean I just (pause), just feel so (pause) worthless. I think I threw away an awful lot of my life.[00:13:19]</p>

<p>(Pause). [00:14:25]</p>

<p>I don't know. (Pause). So that's pretty much—I have no idea. Like I say he is (pause), I want to talk to his therapist today, like right now and I have no other idea where things are going from this point. [00:15:21]</p>

<p>But I already know that—the disturbing thing is that it could be exactly the way it was before I said that. He could have easily, conveniently, forgotten it. Or not have forgotten it, but sort of like, sort of forgotten it, more or less. And since I have no idea where it's gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long has he had the addiction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: As far as we can tell, at this point, probably since he was eight. (Pause), I didn't know about it until December 1, 1999. (Pause), that was basically about a year into our marriage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's been (pause) pretty consistently—</p>

<p>CLIENT: He wasn't diagnosed until about a year after that because he had a therapist who,—he was through playing games with, who more or less, in general, kind of just thought that it was just him exploring things he's interested in. [00:16:26]</p>

<p>He was never truly honest on things. So you have to ask these dumb questions, okay so you said you had trouble acting out. Does that mean 20 minutes or are we talking about eight hours? I need scale here. He's never good about scale. We're saying he had some trouble. Had some trouble could be anything in his life. So yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he's pretty consistently and frequently been pulling up pornography?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since pre-puberty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause), and often recently (pause), well I guess often since he found out about it, like for a pretty long periods of time, hours?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I imagine this is kind of always been with him anyway. Yeah, this isn't going to get better anytime soon. [00:17:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I hope it kind of [inaudible at 00:17:45], but it's not going to get better any time soon. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (Pause). So that feeling [that seems to be persisting, helping] (ph) with me? (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause), it doesn't say much for the (inaudible at 00:18:07]. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (pause), I have to virtually inflate myself some days. I mean it's just (pause), it's a loss. (Pause). (Crying). A lot of it I intellectualize. It's easy to intellectualize, that he doesn't handle stress very well, but (pause), I mean because I'm the exact opposite that when something goes incredibly wrong, I don't go to a vendor of anything, you know? [00:19:16]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>I've never liked the thing of, oh I had a really hard day at work so I'm just going to blow a lot of money on shopping or—I've never had that impulse of stuff really. You know? And so (pause) I just, I mean some of it I just don't understand, part of it I do. I mean it's all on a very removed level. You know? (Pause).</p>

<p>I understand it like the way that I understand particle physics. I understood the concept. I understand what's happening, but not too much practically, experience. And it just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, either way, understanding it isn't really doing anything for you. [00:20:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (Pause). And I just feel a lot like (pause)—I am very—the anger and resentment of dozens of people that aren't me as from him, like he's worried about me getting—looking, or doing, or being upset in some way that is triggered by other people's reactions, or by the way that they would have handled something, instead of how I would handle something. [00:21:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause), yeah [he acts sort of meets you and treats you] (ph) and makes you into something that you're not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) And it's just really hard. (Pause) I just, as I explained to him, let's be honest here. Are we going to split hairs on this kind of stuff? We've already talked about it hasn't exactly been held up especially well on his part. I don't know if he just needs some time to get his act together or what but—[00:22:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [talking over].</p>

<p>CLIENT: —watching my life thrill go away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Understand. (Pause), his addiction makes (pause) an emotional and sexual energy in a marriage pretty close to impossible for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean (pause), this was—date night was dinner and a movie at home, right? Kind of (pause) like he couldn't hack it. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I asked him, and at that point in time, he wasn't thinking about that. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's this thing called the unconscious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Snicker). I know. (Pause). Some of it is sabotage, some of it is just, I swear to God, just he never learned [to himself] (ph) and deal with being bored. You know? Or like have a list of things that you need to do when things are slow.</p>

<p>When he comes home, when he's done with a task, I'm okay. Well, there wasn't anything else I can do to start [off work] (ph). I'm like you have to be kidding me. It isn't just that. I mean it's a lot of things. He just—it isn't fun. I'm not very good at it, you know. And (pause). [00:24:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you saw this coming when we last met. You were really nervous. And it was unclear why. And we sort of figured out that (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT:I even told him when he picked me up in the car afterwards, that I was really nervous about this—like the day before. So yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect that this was kind of partly you unconsciously thinking something like this was likely to happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the lobsters. (Snickers). Now that's, I mean honestly, that's somewhat normal for an alien, like yeah. And I sort of made it worse, but I didn't mean too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:24:26].</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's one you just never know until it happens. (Pause). He didn't know it was going to until it happens. But this whole acting out thing and everything else, it just—it's (pause) (sigh) [00:25:08]</p>

<p>I unfortunately have to work in sort of the blind world of things too, because I had to trust that when he's doing things, he's being honest or taking care of things. I have no idea what he says to a therapist. Not a freaking clue on the earth. You know? </p>

<p>I do know that he shades the world the way he wants it to be on lots and lots of situations. So God only knows. You know? (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my concern—</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're the first person I talked to who seriously understands and believes me how very—I mean his own family doesn't believe me, which, I mean makes sense—like how altered he gets in certain situations. (Pause). And maybe it's because I'm the only person around him enough to know him that well. [00:26:02]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But—and it has so much more of an effect on things that happen between you than on things that happen with his family, or—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my concern in this is that (pause) you—I don't think you can help him or that in the short, immediate term this is going to get better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope I don't have any hope at all. I have a hope of finding a way to make this tolerable in some way. (Pause). I'm not, at this point, hoping for him to get better. It's just—it's out of my hands. It's—well I always thought it was, but I just didn't think that I could feel any worse about it than I do. You know? [00:27:00]</p>

<p>And I really, honest to God thought, you know, he could at least get over it—a lot of the selfishness about a lot of things. But that's really—it's so (pause)—the way it is now is a way that he wouldn't necessarily know, until he listened to the way he talks about things. </p>

<p>Everything, as we're talking about it, is about him, you know, things like that. A lot of things are like—it's very hard to explain, like I said, it's very (pause)—it appears that it is not all about him except for it is. (Pause), like when I talk to him about my feelings about things like that, he gets upset. </p>

<p>He gets depressed. The next thing I know, I'm making him feel better about things. So what the fuck would I even talk about the way I feel about it. Because the last thing in the world I need to be doing is consoling him for hurting my feelings. You know? [00:28:04]</p>

<p>(Pause), so (pause) it's just sort of (pause) (sigh), it's a difficult thing. It's a really difficult thing. You know? (Pause), I understand being the domestic one, the person who's constantly in the back of their head thinking what things we need done, that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>That doesn't have to be both people. I understand that, but (pause) (sigh) the worst part is that I don't even necessarily, because of his series of make light of feeling guilty, I don't even think that he is seeing anybody else, because I don't think that would dawn on him to ever happen. You know? [00:29:06]</p>

<p>Just like I have a book of my very (ph) which I written in a year, so I have ten years worth of extremely [inaudible at 00:29:13], sitting out in the middle of anything, where he can ever read it, and has he ever read it? No. I know he hasn't, because he probably would have something by now, or at least acted differently about it.</p>

<p>Why? Because it's never dawned on him to ever look at it. Not because he's trying to respect my privacy, but it just—you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's (pause) (sigh) and this is really hard to talk about because even as I'm saying it, I love this man so much, because when he's not acting out, he's not like this. You know? (Pause). [00:30:11]</p>

<p>And (pause) then I feel like I gave up the very best of everything I had (pause) for him, things, you know, a lot of opportunities if my life had gone—not just career wise but being able to do things.</p>

<p>I spent every cent I had on him. (Pause), and when nobody else believed him, I did. And for the most part I mean, it's true he graduated. He did this. He did—a lot of people did not really have strong towards that, and he did. But, I don't know I was just hoping that (pause) I don't know. [00:31:01]</p>

<p>(Pause). (Sigh). (Pause).</p>

<p>I just really wish that he listens—doing so much for entertainment, you know? And it's not a little bit, it's like video game playing. And part of it is also like, (sigh) he gets distracted so easily on the stupidest stuff.</p>

<p>When I tell you it's a several hours a night, it can also be several hours of him looking up one T.V. show and then following a bunch of links about IMDB and spending all of his time finding out about some obscure movie thing too. </p>

<p>I mean it isn't just that. He gets, when he gets into this he just gets really, really intoscape (ph). (Pause). It just happens to be that the one thing that upsets me the most and is the most common threat is porn. (Pause), it's made me kind of internally (ph) bitter. (Pause), a shade of what I use to be, you know? [00:32:36]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I [had to self-destruct] (ph), and I'm not really one of those people that believes in these non-traditional lifestyle type things but, I view non-traditional lifestyle being, okay so we're married and we live together, but I may be seeing other people kind of things. But I am financially bound up in this situation. And I can tolerate enough to watch television with him so, (pause), (sigh) (pause)—it's just really hard. [00:34:17]</p>

<p>As I told him before and he gets very upset about this, but right now, (pause) and please don't take this as me being suicidal, but it's not. Death is the easiest option right now for me to get out of the mess that I'm in. (Pause).</p>

<p>It'd be the cleanest, easiest option, so he doesn't necessarily have the social stigma and I don't have to deal with the repercussions. (Pause). I'm not looking to throw myself into the river (ph) or nothing like that right now. Just it—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah that's reasonable. That's where your mind goes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the reason I could. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's where your mind goes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's—would really be the easiest way out. [00:35:20]</p>

<p>(Pause). [00:36:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be the next easiest way out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause), probably some sort of (pause) stroke or something where I would no longer be rendered able to handle what was going on day-to-day. (Pause), early onset dementia, I don't know, something where I can have my mind to which I just keep going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (pause) I guess that's probably (ph) the same. (Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll keep going. I always will. [00:37:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) But for the moment, you can't really deal with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean you won't keep going. (Pause). But you'll also look away from what it's costing you, [so it won't hurt you] (ph) so much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't—I mean perseverance is in my blood so (pause)—and quite frankly I can't (pause) can't have (ph) any other solution, and that's not my other solution. [00:38:16]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you could leave, and I'm not, in any way suggesting that you do, but I guess it strikes me that, that's conspicuously not on the list of alternatives.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other than a temporary transfer from work, I can't afford to. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that the main barrier, the money? (Pause). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm just a little bit [inaudible at 00:39:05].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Love, how very much I care. I care a lot. (Pause) but the money, yeah. I thought about it. I can't afford it. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess part of the reason I'm asking about that is because—</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know my [heart doesn't want out] (ph) on this one ever. (Pause), [inaudible at 00:39:29] people like me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) I was going to say is (pause) aside from the kind of real importance of the money as a factor, (pause) I think the money's also a lot easier to think in terms of than your mixed feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do have a lot of mixed feelings. (Pause). [00:40:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the reason I'm saying is well, what if it was about the money isn't because I don't think the money's important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know that it's crucial. It's because (pause) I think it's harder, but also important to sort out what you actually want to do, logistics kind of laying aside, it's sort of a good thing to know I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also something I think is very hard to think about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're so devastated on one side (pause) and [inaudible at 00:41:12] on the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still in love with him. (Pause) that's why I keep hoping for an embolism (pause) or be hit by a bus or something so that everybody gets out easier. He doesn't have to go with all the humiliation of anyone knowing why, and (pause) I get out of this. And hopefully someday he'll get some help.</p>

<p>If I suddenly died then people won't be around to care about him, care for him. Nobody else will care for him if I'm out of the way. (Pause). [00:42:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You tend to be very sacrificing in your thinking about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause). Trust me the whole issue [inaudible at 00:42:41] part of me is also [kind of nice] (ph). It'd be easy to pass out on that one too. (Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're very worried about that one as well. (Pause), how it would come out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What people would—how people would judge the two of you for knowing stuff like that. [00:43:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be bad. (Pause), to be honest, I just (pause), just not really sure if I really (pause), I don't want to be alone. I don't want to have to answer questions. I certainly don't want to have to go deal with things on my own. And quite frankly, I mean there's no one out there to take care of him, nobody. [00:44:36]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. (Pause), actually I think I had a cancellation tomorrow I hadn't thought about. We started talking about it. It's 9:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess whatever. I don't know how long, but I don't know when this coach—I need to keep things open basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) all right, we'll see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:45:11]</p>

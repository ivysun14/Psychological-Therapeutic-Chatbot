<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I have Maude (ph) Perkins today. She's in the kitchen cooking with her favorite staple, Crisco. (Inaudible) to no one in particular. (Inaudible audio) client 442602, (inaudible) number 111 (inaudible) interview. (Silence). Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: Was it very long?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. 

</p><p>PATIENT: How long was it? Four days?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Two days.

</p><p>PATIENT: Two days? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I was back before I sent this.

</p><p>PATIENT: That (inaudible). I haven't had any new thoughts really since I was here before. Get the tape out and play it over. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it all the same for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't think of anything. Yeah, I can think of things in my relationship to the neighbors, but not with Jim and I, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) there are open (inaudible) and things to explore and new kinds of...

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] yeah, but you kind of have to experiment. I think the two of us have to experiment, you know, even before I can even talk about it; to say like this, isn't going to work at all. [2:09]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you haven't (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: No. And so in that, I mean, before we have, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying what you talk about in here is dependent upon how you think that you and Jim can stay together?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's like if there's any hope at all, you know. I just don't know what to; it keeps (inaudible) everything. You know, like why I don't like sex? I don't, you know. Every reason that it could possibly be, I've already thought of, and I don't know what to do about it now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But like given that you know all the reasons, that doesn't make the good life change. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well there aren't even, there's enough reasons for me to feel like that's why I don't care for it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh like they don't really explain it anyway?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't, no. I don't know; maybe I do like it underneath it all. You know, it keeps coming back to this climaxing that I think that I would enjoy intercourse if I could climax, and that seems to be it, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like all the explanations for why you don't like sex is leaning sort of beside the point? You know, the main thing is that it's become a climax (inaudible). [4:06]

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I would. But I don't know the reason that I can't climax. That's what I would like to know. Maybe it's because, maybe I really don't like it and I don't want it. I really don't want to experiment every time we get in to bed, you know. I get really tired of doing this thing and everybody hoping-not everybody; it's just the two of us-you know, hoping that I would climax. It really is a great amount of pressure on me; like you've got to do, and it does kind of bug me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you sort of get fed up with all the experimenting and the concern that goes into the experiment.

</p><p>PATIENT: It just seems like this, is, it's really (inaudible); it's just a simple act. And I just have never ever been able to practice anything. You know, piano, (inaudible), all that I just don't have any stick to it-ness. [6:07]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So the, I'm not quite sure....

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] 'cause I don't know, you know, like just call it why I don't like to, I want to practice. I always want to do things right the first time and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Interposing] like you want to have a climax and that's all.

</p><p>PATIENT: That's all. I don't want to lay around touching. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Lying around (inaudible) is what really turns you on.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's like work then, and I don't like to work unless it's something I want to do, then I will. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you don't want to do it?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's something I enjoy doing, even if it's work, I'll do it. Then I guess it's not work if you enjoy doing it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess you think you don't enjoy experimenting? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't enjoy it. But then I, you know, a couple of months ago I said I didn't enjoy sewing, you know, now I'm thrilled about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So maybe (inaudible) longer...

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] So maybe...no, you know what had happened was I learned how to sew, I could learn, you know, like I feel like even if I learned how to have intercourse, you know, then-I don't feel like there's no hope for me, it's just taking an (inaudible) place. (Inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So what kind of exams do you have?

</p><p>PATIENT: I was just thinking my neighbor showed me how. I wonder (inaudible). It should be like a course or something, you know; somebody that shows you how to do it instead of just getting in there and doing this. [8:33]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Instead of just having the whole thing thrust on the two of you alone.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess he's being quite right. I don't, you know, (inaudible), but then again, you know, like there are a lot of people that don't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A lot of people that just do it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, and like they really don't know how; they really don't enjoy it. You know I am so much happier when I am busy. I am so busy that I really don't have time to get everything done. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hardly (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I think there are so many things that you can find fault with when you're sitting around, you know, looking for something to do. Well like there's always something to do, but something interesting; something that you enjoy doing. [10:10]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well like this last week I really, I had to make my daughter dresses, because she had none. I was expecting my mother-in-law to make them and she sent up the ugliest things I'd ever saw and I had to run out and buy all this material and sit down and really sew, you know, solidly. And I really didn't have time to do anything else. But I was really; I was just in seventh heaven. You know, 'cause I, I kind of, and I couldn't have cared less what Jessica and Jodie were doing; I didn't feel left out or moody or anything like when I'm just sitting, you know, you do the housework and, but I really had something going for me. And then I got, you know, complaints from my family. This house, this dining room is a mess; kids are throwing things at (inaudible). I said, you know I think that somebody should have said, gee these are nice dresses; you really did a good job. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And all they noticed was the clutter?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, he noticed they were nice dresses after I said, I think somebody said these are nice dresses; you did a real good job, and then he repeated that right away-my husband.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: The girls didn't care, you know. They don't really care if they're living in a pig's pen or not. And everyone was (inaudible), but it really just amazing how, I guess it's not really amazing, but to me it is because I've never been really involved in anything, except like bridge or something. But anything that I had really produced some finished product that was really neat and well done and I really felt good about it. [12:27]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you felt really proud and then Jim came along and he didn't notice it; he only noticed (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well he gets really tired of me going over board with different things. But I didn't feel guilty about it that time because I had to get it done. There was no...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Interposing] (inaudible) needed dresses.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So do you think that he looked at this and he said to himself, well there she goes again; one more.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then I kind of had to straighten him out a little bit too. You know I said look, give me $20 or $30 and I'll go out and buy the kids a dress and then he settled right down and watched his TV. But he keeps out, you know, that's the way he is. I mean he never complained about him because, but I was just so happy. I was just delighted because I felt myself kind of slipping back into the old Jodie and Jessica are very close, you know; they both live on the 2nd floor, and I'm not in, you know, because I'm not on the 2nd floor and I have to come down. Really, it's really something when you live up. I heard that on TV last night and I said I know what, like the high rises they're making and people live in. I know what that's like, you know, you're not living next to Mother Earth and it is so completely different. [14:15]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you sort of isolated (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am because like I always have to come down because that, you know, three floors up. And why go upstairs?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why make that effort and you're not going to have any friends.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Except for the person who's going to live across the hall from me, you know; she's not going to go down and have to climb up either. It really is just like your own little (inaudible). You know, like I really think I've been learning so many things this summer. Not only about myself, but you know, like everybody. The plunge dwellers that they put in those things, I know how they must feel; like they probably rather go back to their stacks on the ground (inaudible) up in the air. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you know the (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't really hate it; it would be much nicer to be on the 2nd floor. You know, the next time we move or we're moving out of Chicago-it's nice up there. I bet I appear kind of silly because, you know, like people have studied this and everybody knows this right; that I feel like I'm really living in an experiment. I figured that out all by myself. So I'm just so clever this year. I can't believe it. [16:39]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You make it sound like it's sort of, like you feel like someone who's independently discovered the wheel or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of sheepish about that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, 'cause everybody else, you know, they've already read this-I mean it was, it happened to be on TV last night; it just so happened Jim and I were talking about it earlier and decided that was my problem; I felt isolated. I know I feel better when I'm here. Last night I felt like I was being ostracized, you know, from the people downstairs and I, it just isn't that important here this afternoon, you know. So and I even know all the reasons and I don't think it's because I have bad breath or anything like that, it's just that they baby-sit, you know; one works, the other one baby-sits for the child and they're on the same floor and it's handier to run in and out, you know, instead of come upstairs and borrow an egg, and I do the same thing. But it kinds of, you know, I'd like to be included in whatever they're doing, I guess, if I have nothing else to do. [18:16]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So like you can understand how come you're not included and it has very little to do with you really; it has to do with proximity. Even in spite of all that it's kind of the fact that you know it doesn't change anything about you; you'd still like to be a part of that community group. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And also, you know, like I'm sure that if I were the witty interesting charming person that maybe they would come upstairs too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you were extraordinary in some way.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then, you know, when you're just...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Interposing] ordinary.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not worth the effort. I'm not going to have anything clever to talk about. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you might not have bad breath, on the one hand, but on the other hand, you're hardly some sort of exceptionally sociable one either that attracts a person...

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] yeah, but there aren't very many of those anyway. I mean, there are just very few, and I think that a lot of times, I do anyway; I get tired of people that are so clever and so witty, that you never know them. You know, everything you say, they give you back some funny line and it's entertaining, but I want close friends, and I feel like it's really hard in the city to have close friends unless they live across the hall. There again, it's a lot of work. Maybe it's not the city; maybe you just have to (inaudible). [20:18]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like whichever it is, it doesn't so much have to do with you, it has to do with...

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] environment, I think.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Something really out of your control or who you happen to be.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well part of it is and part of it isn't because we could even initiate friendships, you know, but it is an effort. And I guess if you want it bad enough; if you want to be with people, then you invite them, you know, for a bridge, or something that's not expensive, you know. Like, we have real money problems, so you don't invite them to go with you to eat and like so many of these kids that are in our (inaudible) are going out to movies and to the theater and out to eat; it's unbelievable. We go out to a restaurant, you know, every six months and that's a big deal. But you, you know, like I would like to have both. You don't know what I'm talking about 'cause I was thinking it instead of saying it. I was thinking that what we do with our money is like - -take last weekend, we took the kids to the zoo; we had some money. We spent all day at the zoo and then, I can't remember, we did something with them Saturday, and then Sunday we took them to the movies. And you know like other people would hire a babysitter and go eat or go to theater. I'd like to take the children places, but I would also like to be able to go out. And like we can't do both and so it's all for the kids; well that particular week. [22:29]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But then like in the crunch of finances, you wind up doing things for your children rather than going...

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't begrudge them that, as a matter of fact I feel kind of sorry for the other people's children, and then some of them don't have them, so they don't have to worry about it. But I don't, like I don't think that they can say anything openly to the girls and not to me. You know, like we've taken them out places they want to go because I like to go to the zoo. And I wanted to see the movie whether we took the kids or not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But there's a way, I thought though, Jessica, there's a way in which the kids are really too much with you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: They are, but like you know, I think that was going to be our final plan. I'm not going to initiate them going to, well, I mean like, let's face it, there will never be another child (inaudible). You can only go to the zoo so many times. And so that was sort of our sling before school started. But, and I am (inaudible) that they're in school. You can believe it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You are more what?

</p><p>PATIENT: With them. I mean doing things for them. I am driving or picking someone up at 9:00, 11:00, 1:00 and 2:00. I am in the car all day long with those kids. Unbelievable. But then they're, it's also unbelievable how well socialized they are when you think of Jim and I as children, it's just scary to think that anybody could be that, I mean they're, my children compared to the other kids, which are, you know, average kids, but when you compare them to their parents, they're so much better off. It's amazing. And I don't really feel like I'm living my life for them as much as I used to. When I'm feeling, you know, like doing the same thing, running the same, but then it's going to be over shortly too. My daughter went off to kindergarten and like she's never, she'll never be the same little girl. Now it will be, you know, the teacher is going to be her authority instead of mother, but the teacher is always right. [25:46]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why not? It sounds like a couple of things, like one is you're sort of pleased with the way things turned out, especially considering you guys, and also you're feeling like you really shouldn't begrudging them the time you give them because they're never going to be that age again; they're going to be more or less on their own. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I mean like the raise them to be independent but it's kind of hard to let them go.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) to lose them that way. It feels like a loss.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it does. I think that, you know, you just sort of have to choose between two social lives; that with your children and those with adults. And if there isn't enough money to go around, like you're going to have to choose. And I think for us we made the decision for the children. And you know, like other people wouldn't do that. That's there bag. It would be nice to have adult and time for your children, but you know even time, even if you have the money, you don't necessarily have the time. If you're working or going to school-I'm really quite pleased with our, you know, like the things we've been doing with our lives. You know (inaudible). [27:44]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The way you say it makes it sound like it's different; that it's a difference to what you're doing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I think, you know, like when you have your children too close like we did, but I mean, I really do feel tied down. Like if I had one child, and then when that one was in school, have another, because you could feel differently about the whole thing. But we didn't and I don't, and I'm sort of accepting well we do have them close and so we're going to have to live with that. You know without gypping the children. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) it sort of sounds like you're feeling well the situation was thrust on you and given that you're in the middle of it, like you've really got to make the best of it. Part of making the best of it is not gypping on the children. So, I don't know. One thing (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: That is not really a sacrifice, though. It's like I said, everything we did this weekend was something I think Jim probably enjoyed it. I mean we had a good time feeding the giraffes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I thought that, I thought what you were saying was that the sacrifice part of going to the zoo 'cause you like the zoo, but the sacrifice part was taking them; quite better if you and Jim had gone to the zoo alone. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That would have been ideal, you know. If we would've had time when we, not time, but even a little ingenuity to have done some of these things not even going, yeah, like going to the zoo or walking in a park, or doing anything by ourselves, if we had had done anything before we had children. But it's like we just live together and there was never any money for anything, you know; a movie or anything. But, like, we didn't, well, like it wasn't the zoo was out of town, but you know - -can you think of anything cute? I bet you can. [30:29]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Star watching.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Anything. I mean that's one thing. Or a picnic or you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't think of it.

</p><p>PATIENT: We didn't do anything. Yeah. We're the kind of people that would love to go if somebody would say would you like to go and somebody ....

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Interposing] else do the thinking.

</p><p>PATIENT: I always have to fight. I still have to fight with Jim and say we're going to a picnic, or we're going here; unless he thinks of it and decides it's a good idea. I mean, there's always, if he's spending the money, then there's enough. Funny how that works. And if I think of it, then it's not enough money. But I think like I'd never argue that there isn't enough money, you know if we're going someplace. And it's like it has to work that way with us or we'd be, you know, I think of something everyday that we can do that costs money. I mean I wouldn't go on a picnic. Well that last time I wanted to go on a picnic, I invited friends along and he had a fit because there wasn't enough time to go with people. You can't eat and come back. But then he's like that and he's always been like that even before we had children; like that didn't change him any. [32:35]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Jessica, you were saying a lot of things, but I'm not (inaudible). I thought one thing you were saying that he doesn't like to do anything new. I have to almost stick a stick of dynamite under the guy to get him to go; it's always we don't have enough money, I don't want to go; he sort of grabs that way (inaudible). I want to check out (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. He was kind of a grouch (inaudible). (Inaudible) surprised if it wants to go to (inaudible). We may never go if I don't go get the tickets and hire the baby-sitter, or, you know, but he does want to go. And like, we went to a lot of parties last winter and I said we're going to have a duplicate party Friday night, and then he starts in: What are we going to do for money? What are, you know, all of these things, and I said, yeah, I don't know, but we're going to have a duplicate party, you know, it's sort of like you're talking to a small child. We are going to have it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You have to lay down the law (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well every once in a while, you know, you do, or else he would, and he freely admits to that he would just assume stay home and watch TV and that's all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like given two adults (inaudible). Why did you want to (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't think he needs to go up Al, so, because when I used to work, I used to have people stay at home because you're not there very often. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So for him, being at home is some sort of different experience.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's relaxing for him because he is around people all day, and I'm not. But I think like we should go anyway whether he likes it; he can relax (inaudible) and go on.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you really need it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do. Even if I don't want to go, I need it because I have a good time. I mean, I can go to a dog fight and have a real good time; getting out. I don't know, maybe I feel guilty about wanting to stay home, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible-muffled voice).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well you know, like I sit here and say we have got to go some place; you know and I'm tired and I, a lot of nights I just assume stay home and watch TV, but I feel like I should. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Should, but because you're going to be stagnated with the girls? [35:51]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's nice to have a new experience every once in a while to think about or to plan for. I can't come tomorrow. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). Do you play bridge?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Everybody that sits east and west at every table plays the same hand (inaudible). At the end of the evening we figure out who played it the best; who bid the highest; who made the most (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're not playing against the north and the south (bad audio - inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't think of a word. [37:00] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: For you (inaudible) good for them. 

</p><p>[Blank audio at 37:14]

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't say anything except, you know, that the (Audio dragging/blank audio - inaudible at 37:47). 

</p><p>PATIENT: [Duplicate audio beginning at 39:57] east and west at every table plays the same hand and everybody (inaudible). At the end of the evening, we figure out who played it the best; who bid the highest, who made the most (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're not playing against the north and south, you're just playing (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: And it's much more challenging. I mean, I like it because I'm like the best bridge player in our group. I love to play bridge and, you know, everybody likes to be very good at something. (Inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It really feels good to be on top. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes it does occasionally. You know what feels better than like being on top is having people come to you from all of these places to ask you what they should do or what they shouldn't do. That makes you feel good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Various tips ask the expert sought out by others. [41:00]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, and these (inaudible). Some of the men, they spit out these rules all the time, you know, for anything you would do like well, you don't know how, just anything you want to bid or do, they have a rule for and they're down there at the bottom every time you play. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like a smart alec; that's really all they are, are smart alecs. Because when the chips are cashed in or whatever.... 

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] I had another friend who said she would always sit down and say I just have fantastic luck at cards. You know, and I'm like, you don't have luck at bridge, in duplicate because everybody that sits the same way you are is playing the same hand, and that's not-depending on who you're playing against, somebody who doesn't know how to lead-then you can lose. But we're all pretty even. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like it has to do with some ability of yours. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that's skill; skillful in some sense.

</p><p>PATIENT: It does. And I just like to be (inaudible). It just thrills me to no end. I'm happy if he beats everybody else other than me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. We (inaudible) half (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How come?

</p><p>PATIENT: How come? Because he does everything else better. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Aaah. So this, is your area of confidence.

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just one thing. Yeah. And it's, you know, if I don't have (inaudible) he's going to be better than I. He will read a bridge book and he will know the rules and he will also know how to apply them; which I think what some of these guys maybe are very good bridge players, but if you're playing against somebody that doesn't know the same rules, you are, there's no sense of using them. [43:15]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It serves like a different game they're playing.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So there was also implications with saying they know the rules, but you know your cards. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But they don't, they lack common sense. But then I think I don't know if it's true of all men, but they are very very confident, and I bid and play conservatively and they're always playing to make the extra chip. But you're not supposed to in bridge. If you can bid and make the contract, that's all you're supposed to get. I mean, if you see that you're supposed to make it, then you make it. And they're always playing for the extra one and they go down. I mean there are two of them that I'm thinking of that do it this way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Good. It sounds like they kind of come on. I don't know if you can do that in bridge without the paper to come on like Errol Flynn sort of swash buckling without the under pinning to make good on it. You kind of go on playing the steady intelligent game with out none of that show off (inaudible) and you wind up with (unintelligible). [44:29]

</p><p>PATIENT: But even like the fruit, there was one fellow who is just not a very good bridge player, and like he'll say I'm not a very good bridge player, and I was so pleased to see him; his points were up there, you know, above the two that know all of the rules. It made me feel so good. He was quiet about it, you know, and he didn't, the others, the two fellows want people to think that they're really good. And they'll tell you anything you want to know about, they'll tell you. And I sit and ask. I'll play that game too, ask the questions, and think you look up to them. But I always beat them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you feel, what, power (inaudible) for with all those rules (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't even use their rules. I had a bridge teacher once that said that all you were supposed to do is play hands, and I think that they really don't know that yet. Maybe some day they'll learn.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the price now is incongruent to your paradox that they see you that way. I guess the picture of you sort of sitting there kind of wide-eyed taking all these rules from them and at the same time, (inaudible) you know, well, someday they'll get to the point where I am where they can rely on common sense and not have to show off with all those fancy rules. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't even think they think they're showing off; I think it's just a matter of masculine pride. [46:22]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What I'm getting at is that there's a way in which you must, I don't know whether you do that then but talking about it now, anyway, there's a way in which you (inaudible). You ask them, I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't even care if it's me that, you know, Roy who doesn't know how to play bridge to win. I just hate it, and I don't even know if they're showing off, really. It just seems to me that they just know these rules, but they don't ever apply them. So what's the sense of knowing the rules if you're not, if all you're going to do is talk about them? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: And then we, you know, like you play with people who don't want to learn anything new and they so oh, well, what do you want to learn that for. Well because I would like to some day have my master's. Get your master's in whatever you want to; I'll get my in bridge. And it's a great; it really is a nice, you know, like it saved my life in a number of pounds to, because you're always looking for somebody that knows how to play bridge. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) new people. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It really is a great social breaker (inaudible) something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds almost (inaudible) that it must be great instigator too, like it gets you out (inaudible) with people.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes you.

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) about my first question to anybody I meet. I don't even care what kind of personality they are (inaudible) warm body. Consequently (inaudible) it's terrible because I was a little loser when I first started, but I get to play with them now, unless it's my idea. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean it's your idea? Like you were asked (inaudible)? [48:56]

</p><p>PATIENT: But I hate people that, and I've played with, you know, a number of them that sit down and think they really know how to play bridge and you find out, you know, after the first bid that they've only played a couple of times before. You know, like there's no shame in saying I don't know how to play bridge; just say it, you know, and surprise me with your skill or something, but don't let on like you're good and then blow it. I guess I like modest people. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well on the other side, (inaudible) curiously braggers (background audio noise).

</p><p>PATIENT: But that's not only in bridge, but it's especially nice to know, you know, who you're playing with in bridge. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well like if the people don't know how to play, it's nice for me to know that they don't know how to play so that I'm not bidding sky high thinking that they have, you know, 'cause every bid tells you the points. I bid and your response tells me how many points you have. And if their bidding up, then you know, I'm really...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you're really in trouble if you're taking them for ten points and they've got six. I mean, that doesn't seem like much but it is. You know, I get so mad (inaudible). I'll tell you all about it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you talking now about your partners?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So, I guess, it's especially important to know that your partner (inaudible) an empty bragger because if he is, then you're really in some trouble. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's why I like to see you play. I've only played twice. [51:12]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you could play with Roy?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he, you don't, you play conservatively with Roy. I generally do, but when you see that you've got all the points from the deck, you know, you have to bid them, but with Roy, I'm just a little more cautious because I know he doesn't know how to play. But he tries. He's in there trying and he's not afraid to ask a woman and the rest of the fellows, not the rest, but you know, like the majority of them wouldn't think of asking a woman. They're like I was born with cards stamps and go right in; take you down five trips or something. It's a real difference playing with men and women. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) so men at least in your (inaudible) are mostly, would be (inaudible) book before they got in a subservient (inaudible) before they look up to you or ask you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I think if the (inaudible) we are really stupid. We are really stupid. And I admire a man who does not know and will ask. Like Roy will, and my husband will, but that's about it. The rest of them go in, you know, just jump in with both feet and don't know what they're doing. And the women will always get up and ask somebody, even if the person they're asking doesn't know anymore than, you know, two heads are better than one. You know, ask somebody at a different table. Although, you can't do that at duplicate. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the point is that women have common friends when they're one down to (inaudible) and ask somebody. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. They don't know the answer; they at least try and find out. [53:40]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the men kind of come bullying in and they don't know anything, but regardless they don't ask and wind up making really (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: But it's funny; they don't even know. I don't think it occurs to them. Maybe they go home and ask their wives after it's happened what they should've done. I don't think it occurs to them to read a book or anything like, and these are all students. But they, I think somehow they feel like bridge is beneath them and they wouldn't waste time reading a book or asking their wives, you know, what does she know. She knows how to do the dishes. And yes, they're all great on women's lib. Get that woman out working. Let her do her thing. But I still don't think they respect them. And I think my Jim even does more than these guys that are always talking about everything for the women. And I think they really hypocrites. [55:02]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) is a (inaudible) great game, but when you see them close up and they're interacting (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: But, and I feel that with so many people. It really is disgusting to me that so many people are hypocrites. You know, like out of our chapter there are like three couples that are, you know, kind of on the even keel and aren't too much either way.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean, male dominate (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. They're just nice ordinary not putting on a show people. You know, I guess, is that a good number? Depends on how many I know, huh? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like to you that you're judging too much. (Inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I sometimes wonder if you don't have to be a little something to be working on your Ph.D. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Abnormal, is that the way you see things?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. You really have a bee in your bonnet or you'd be satisfied or something. I mean the guys I know that are working on their Ph.D. are all a little rock scientist, well not all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're talking about being driven.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Something and it kind of makes me wonder if I want Jim to go to therapy until after he has his Ph.D., he might never go. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Jim may never get his Ph.D.? [57:02]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So he'll always be (inaudible) by the desire of getting that Ph.D., right? He better not wait. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I said he shouldn't go to therapy until after he gets his Ph.D., otherwise he may not want to get it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I was on the other side of that. I understand what you mean. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess (inaudible). Maybe he doesn't want to go, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what I thought you were saying; you prefer that he not be so crazy possessed and get therapy and not get a Ph.D.

</p><p>PATIENT: How does one make any difference either way, except that we're here to get a Ph.D., and I'd hate to let everybody down? I guess it really isn't everybody, but it's...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like at least for the kids and for other people too, there's a way in which experience Jim that seems very single minded and praise is not the word, but crazy in terms of he crowds you out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No I think what I don't know about the other people, but with Jim, he has to prove himself to himself. He wants to take things for himself, not for anybody else. Maybe to go back to his old home town where they said he'd never amount to anything, you know. And it never occurred to me. I wonder if everybody, it would be interesting to find out why people would go on for their Ph.D., you know, like teaching when everybody knows there's no money in it. That's not the motivation. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm not sure that is what the motivation for what he does that do to you, and it sounds like it's coming from inside, not (inaudible); kind of single minded. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm rather proud of him, but he would want, you know, I mean, I never thought I'd be married to a Ph.D. When we got married, he didn't have his bachelor's. And that was kind of a pleasant day for me to see. But, sometimes I get real, say something in school and being without money, but then I didn't like it when he was working and unhappy either. So, and I think maybe when we're, when you're closer to a Ph.D., I'll feel like a little more worth it. It's a long way off right now. You know like I'm going to, not only me, but he's got to be middle-aged before he gets his Ph.D. and he'll probably be too old to get a job. They won't be teaching that when he gets out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it will all be useless? Maybe?

</p><p>PATIENT: I, you know, everybody could be in the same boat. I guess I do look to, you know, try to keep up with the Joneses. I don't try, but, you know, I'm envious of the people around us who have money. And like it's whether they're happy or not, you know, they still have money. I'll never be a hippie, I don't think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to have money?

</p><p>PATIENT: I think I would. I don't know. Never having had any, whether...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Interposing] You'd like to find out?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd like to find out whether there is anything in it or not. Whether it really buys happiness. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Joking aside, from the size...

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] I wasn't joking. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Besides the (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd think that it'd be a much easier life if you had some money. If you got set up with your kids, you could hire a baby-sitter and go out and enjoy yourself, you know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The other side of that is sometimes you feel quite depressed.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes and I get really tired of it sometimes. Well when I think about it, you know, there's so many things I'd like to have. Well there's one thing I'd like to have, one thing Jim would like to have and one thing the girls would like to have. And if somebody would plop us $1,000 we would be satisfied for, you know, a year, until we decided something else we'd like to have. But these are, like they're very important things, a camera, a good camera we don't have. Our kids are going to grow up and we're not going to have pictures of them. We get a camera, a $10 camera and every time you want to work the flash bulb, you know the batteries get burned out or something. And we waste rolls and rolls of camera film and flash bulbs every time we try to take a picture, so we threw the thing away. And then encyclopedias, my daughter asked me all of these questions, and I never have an answer. I mean, she doesn't ask you simple little things. She's a (inaudible) sometimes. You know when I think I didn't even ask my folks about where I came from. She did not care about that lousy speech; she wanted to know how it got in there. And I was just floored. I must have been 20 before I figured that out, or it even occurred to me to ask. Not battled. [1:04:36]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The party but it's huge (ph) is a really bright child.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I think so. She's probably, yeah, probably normal. But as long as, you know, some days she's not going to ask; mother never knows. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you need money, really in some ways, for your children.

</p><p>PATIENT: An encyclopedia.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or a camera for pictures of (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well like everything you get, like every appliance is for your family; it's not only, like I'd like to have a dishwasher so I wasn't always saying, I have dirty dish water half the time, and I think it's a health hazard the way I do dishes. Everything you get is for your family. I rationalize that to keep from (inaudible - speaking away from microphone). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you doing that right now?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right now? Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I beg your pardon?

</p><p>PATIENT: You don't think I'm selfish, do you? I know I'm not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you uncomfortable? 

</p><p>PATIENT: With?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know. I wondered if I've been taking what you're saying too seriously, you know, but I thought you, you just said to me something like what I just said was sort of half true and half camouflaged because I didn't know...

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] I did. Yeah. Jim just mentioned that he wants to get the girls an encyclopedia and I know that I need one. When you're asking me the question, I feel like the dishwasher is not first on our list. It isn't, but nothing I ever want is first on our list, and so this time, selfish or not, it's going to be next on the list. [1:06:55]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're both insistent now that it's sort of uncomfortable; feel a little uncool about it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You mean Jim's decision about the dishwasher?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, no, no. You're right back where you were. Not the encyclopedia, right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I thought, you know, on the one hand you were emphatic about that, but on the other....

</p><p>PATIENT: [Interposing] whether it's good, I feel like next year we can get a new encyclopedia and it's not going to be that bad. You see the price (inaudible - background noise)?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No. Lately (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). They don't. That's the first time. Well I mean they do obviously (inaudible). Twenty cents though.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What was it before?

</p><p>PATIENT: Ten. In a cup; single not a pot.

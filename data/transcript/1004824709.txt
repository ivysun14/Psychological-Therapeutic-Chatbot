<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: No big deal here. Felt like my hair freezes in the morning. Nothing I can do about that.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's been cold, but I'm inside all day, so I haven't really had to deal with it. I'm good at this job and in some ways it's good for me and some ways it's not. Yeah. I've been just completely drained and miserable and like it happens every day. But I'm just (inaudible at 00:01:02) emotions.</p>

<p>You can't just like, I wish I could just be like okay, now I don't have time to feel sad. Okay. Now I do have time to feel sad. Go! But (laughter) I can do kind of the first one, but the, it's like I get home and it's like I really want to cry or something, but I can't. I'm just like miserable and stuck. So, not much has changed. [00:01:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People have asked about the scrapes on my arms. So, that's awkward. You know, they're talking about me being very visible with this stuff and, you know, it's very vindicating and way more visible than I even really think about. As in like I won't be thinking about it and then somebody will like ask me and I'm like oh fuck.</p>

<p>Even in like I, like I, I spilled a bunch of hot coffee on my hand yesterday and like burned myself. You know, the guy at the counter is like "are you okay"? And like the transfer would have been like no, it fucking hurts. Like, I have a burn, but I don't have time to stop, so I'm just going to keep going. So I was like yeah, no, I'm fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it doesn't seem to have been very bad because you know, I left and went to work, but like I thought I was going to have a blister there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I was wondering. [00:03:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Yeah, there's this whole thing with like, if it looks, if it seems like I'm having a bad day, that makes, that means my customers don't have a good day or you know. I guess it's just like throwing in to sharp relief, the ways in which I work anyway of you know, if I am having a bad day then that brings down the people I care about and so like I just try not to. Then I'll be starting at 11:30 (ph) tomorrow. I really would like to be with her and like at a huge party and I didn't. [00:04:50]</p>

<p>But I have today and tomorrow off, so maybe I'll see her. Unless I have a showing the apartment to people today and tomorrow. So, that's going to be fun. I have like eight people coming. Which is good. You know, lots of people want to move in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think like eight or something or ten.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you have to show the apartment to eight people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I'm not looking forward to it and I have to clean it which is also kind of shitty. I'm not looking forward to it, but—. I just want it to be over, but it's not going to be over until I do that. [00:05:50]</p>

<p>But it is good to have; it's good to be employed. It's good to be doing work that I think is in some sense valuable. It's good to be doing work for the test (ph).</p>

<p>I think that they design it such that there is no way you can actually be good enough. You know, the store manager is not allowed to staff enough people to actually get everything done. Well, because that makes their costs more, you know. So, they just run everybody in to the ground, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:06:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether, you know, it's like remarkably like every other choice of job that I've had. (laughter) You either burn out fast or you find some way to do less than you can be doing in each moment and be okay with that. Or be okay with the fact that even if you are working flat out the entire time you are there, you're not going to get everything done. You're not going to get everybody's order on time. You're not going to have everything clean all the time, etc., and that's hard for me. [00:07:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So, it's arranged the staffing such that you can get enough done, but not really be on top of things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But, everyone higher than you will tell you that you ought to be able to get enough done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get, you mean—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get everything done. Yeah. You know, so the store manager is telling us that we ought to be able to do all of these things and, you know, be on top of everything. Brew a hot pot of coffee every eight minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: God. These beepers go off when it's time to brew coffee. Every eight minutes all day and when you're working the register, you're supposed to also be brewing the coffee, but you can't do it because there's people in line all day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All day. I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Like a line. [00:08:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's like a maybe an hour or two in the early afternoon when you have a little bit of down time, maybe. And then sometimes like there's a floater and you're supposed to be like filling orders for you and bringing coffee and stuff, but like you just can't do it and they just, the fucking beeper just drives me insane.</p>

<p>Yeah, so the store manager is saying we should be able to do all of these things. She's actually very nice about it and pretty good at her job. I think she's new to management, but is, or to being like a managing a whole store, but is doing pretty well with what she has. But then talking to her like she's getting shit from her boss who won't let her work overtime, but also wants her to have everything done because, you know, over time is time and a half, of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she's working all this fucking unpaid overtime which I think, you know, it's not my business to tell her don't do that. Like, it's like adjuncting. It just plays in to the system, but—yeah, it just like breaks my heart. [00:10:05]</p>

<p>But—you've got to learn to live with it. You know, the other people are good enough that I feel like they're in this with me rather than getting in my way, which is the important thing. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>I'm still reading (inaudible at 00:11:05). I'm on like page 700. God, it's so fucking long, but it's good. I, you know, it's really good. You know. You're really like right up in my head which is, you know, the way good books are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's up in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday I was reading the, a description of the mother in this book. It's talking about the style of parenting that's like, you know, lavishing affection and very loving and refuses to believe that your child could lie or, you know, or could do any of these bad things and is clearly working really, really hard to show the child that the child is loved and ends up with, you know, and all of her kids grow up hating themselves, (laughter) and yeah, that, that feels like my mom. [00:12:40]</p>

<p>Of, you know, just lavishing affection and love and care in a way, but somehow it feels like it was or is very much about her being the person who cares about her children rather than about me. I think Wallace writes like value versus valuable being the key distinction for the, what the child feels.</p>

<p>And then, you know. Well, then like also, it's just like Wallace like goes off in to these like spiraling loops of thought that are pretty devoid like what I do, actually. It's like oh, good. So then, how do you, how do you talk about responsibility in a case like that? You know, where she's clearly not aware that this is what she's doing and would be horrified to learn that the things that she was trying to do for me were making things worse, but they are, they do make things worse. [00:14:40]</p>

<p>Yeah. It's more clear when where at like for like, like graduations or board ceremonies or shit like that, and places that are, you know, that are like saying hey look like this kid has done something. You know, my mom would just—less so anymore because I told her she had to stop, but she just can of kind of talk and talk and talk to my teachers and coaches, et cetera, et cetera, to the people who knew us about how wonderful we were. In the way that was clearly haven't I have raised such fantastic children? You know, haven't I done a good job as a mother? Please tell me I've done a good job as a mother. [00:16:20]</p>

<p>You know. My immediate thought is like you weren't fucking there for any of this. It doesn't really, I mean I'm not going to say it doesn't have anything to do with you, but I think your contributions have been negative rather than positive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess, I guess to me the similarity between the mother in the book and your mother is this sort of, of deceptiveness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way it pretends to be about the child when it isn't. The difference seems to me to be that it has more to do with self-absorption. Like it gives the appearance of being about you when it's, it's—. Whereas, the mother in the book from, you know, my distance and review from the actual book. It seems like the mother disowns her own hatred for the kids and ambivalence about them</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and just is like one side of her ambivalence and the kids wind up with the other side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes sense. Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:17:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although, when you put it like that, I'm not sure that is not happening with my mother. His descriptions of depression are pretty good also. Not—you know, I think he draws lines where there are spectra, stuff like that, but—. [00:19:25]</p>

<p>Have you read (inaudible at 00:19:34) yet? Really? Okay. Have you talked to somebody who has read it? Wow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like one person I can think of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Just wondering. You know, next time you have like a hundred hours to spare. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, should I read it? [00:20:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think you would like it. Although, now I can't think of any specific reason, but I think you would like it. I just think you would. So, you know, maybe you should read it because I like it. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe I should read it because then like in a certain way in which it would be easier for us to talk about. I don't mean you can't talk about it because I haven't read it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't think maybe you shouldn't read it. I, I just tend to—interesting. So, I, I sort of like to talk about books, but I only really like to talk about books with some people. So, I guess I'm worried that you wouldn't be somebody that I wouldn't like to talk about books with. Interesting.</p>

<p>Like I don't much like to talk much about books with James and that's really sad. I guess it feels like he's vaguely color blind when it comes to literature, but I think that might just be that I'm—I see more colors than most people. Yeah. [00:21:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel bad saying that, but, you know, basically I like to talk books, about book with Amanda.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that's about it. I'm just good at them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She is too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. [00:22:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's me whether I hope I would be good at them, but the the possibility that I would be not good at them or not—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that I would be a bit color blind somehow and that then you'd be disappointed and feel guilty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know, it feels like I, I get trapped in to expecting things out of people that it's not reasonable for them to be able to do and yes, that does apply pretty broadly also. (laughter) I'm thinking that this is more or less like minor thing or a harmless thing. [00:23:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obviously I think sort of mulling about something else then, the generality although I appreciate what you are saying there. Rather, I was thinking like as long as it's clear whose fault it is that you're disappointed. Like that you're expecting things of people that it's not reasonable to expect of them. Putting the blame squarely back on you. Yeah. Where—[00:24:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why would they do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because they're aware it's, it's much safer. I think you; you generally prefer that to the guilt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Prefer that to the guilt of blaming other people?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or yeah being critical or blaming, stuff like that. [00:25:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, nothing comes to mind. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You look like you're thinking hard, but it's more like your mind is blank?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like I'm, like I'm trying to hit bottom at some point or hit something solid, but, yeah. I didn't go to church on Sunday. I was tired. I had stuff to do, so I just stayed home. You know, then the last couple of weeks have been painful in one way or another. I don't think I'm really that happy there which is too bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the church? [00:28:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That whole thing is we don't share. That's very important to me and Jessup. You know, and he is glad that it's a good place for me, but I think doesn't understand why and—. Or yeah, doesn't, he can't quite wrap his head around it and so that makes me worried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what way does that (inaudible at 00:29:30)? [00:29:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't—he tends to pay a lot more attention to the sermons than I do which I guess I kind of. That's the part of the service where the priest stands up and kind of speaks for that community or speaks to that community and for that community. He's kind of representing that community. And, you know, I grew up listening to papa preach and knowing that he had woken up at 6:30 in the morning to write that sermon. Or like having had him like run ideas by me and like tweaked it with him or just not listening, because you know, kids. I, you know like, Amanda or my siblings and I, like we would go to church alone. Like we wouldn't have anybody to sit with, but like sometimes we'd sit with friends, but we kind of preferred to sit alone because then you didn't have to pay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like a plan. [00:30:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's good. Always late to church. Every single day, year, week. But, you know, so I guess I'm more used to the idea that like the ceremony is just is not actually that important. If it's good, that's awesome. That's something really special. That's a gift, but there are, there are not that many good preachers out there and I don't, yeah, and so—. And James also doesn't, doesn't have the same sense of kind of—. The liturgy is not important to him. [00:31:42]</p>

<p>I mean he grew up being taught that liturgy or like that like ritual was bad which is hilarious because his, from what he describes, like, like his family and their community worship services were like pretty well ritualized. It was just ritualized around like more or less chaotic structure or like there was like was a very formalized way to be spontaneous (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:32:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It kind of—it's sort of like, like a Pentecostal service. So, like speaking in tongue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, shit like that. Which I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What denomination did he say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's kind of cult actually. It actually was classified as a cult in the 70's but I don't think it is anymore. It's called The International which is like hilarious. Like seriously? (laughter) You know, basically people who, founded by some people who were, felt really alienated by the churches that they grew up in and tried to like basically redo the reformation and like go back to the text and like study the real text without, you know, anybody getting in the way. And they did some good things and then kind of got stuck and, you know. So, now it's like they know three words of Greek and so it's hard for me to take them seriously because like come on dudes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, there is this whole field called physical scholarship that like does linguistic studies. Like there's stuff you could, like there's other stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. Like if you want to go back to the text, that's great, but why don't you go ahead and actually do it. [00:33:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And once you actually do it then you start to realize that there are problems inherent going back to the text, but there is no more text. So, yeah, so I have a hard time not being disdainful of a group that was actually very, very important to the whole family, to their way of thinking. You know, his parents were basically religious leaders within that community, and are really wise and good people and so I've got to respect that. But at the same time when they start talking about like what they actually believe, I'm like, this is, let's talk about something else now. (laughter) [00:34:40]</p>

<p>But, you know, honestly the same thing is true in the Episcopal church. Like, it's all, you know, the reason I'm an Episcopalian is because their fundamental principle is if you want to show up, we want you there. Like, that's it. You know, because they say community is more important than the then—the community is the principle. So, like yeah there are doctrines and like we a catechism installed, but we don't, it's pretty okay if you don't buy it. [00:35:27]</p>

<p>I just don't buy it a lot of the time. But we're not also, but we're also not going to say it's not important because it's really important. We have to keep working on it. It's a, it's a very strange thing. You know, so I mean I'm there mostly because I grew up in it and I know it and it feels like home and people want me there and that makes a difference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:36:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I really, I, I find the liturgy very, very important and powerful and it—yeah. Like being at church in a church service worshipping with other people is what it's about for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah and I can see how with what you're saying is important to you the sermon is a less of a big deal than the sort of liturgy that—the ritual of being here together, kind of the community.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But— [00:37:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that this is a bit of a tangent, but I, I meant at some point to bring up your having said a while ago I think that that you thought I had said that like I was an atheist and sort of—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you didn't say anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You really didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I sounded like something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You kind of said something like "oh, I don't really know anything about that".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think just like religion in general. It might have been Christianity, but I think it was just religion in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. It sounds like something I would have meant. I mean (inaudible at 00:37:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. But, there's also like, so there is that and then there is this, I—. Like, I feel like religion and psychology are both completely inseparable and really probably shouldn't mix that much. [00:38:08]</p>

<p>And I don't know how to say both of those at the same time, but I'm going to do it, so whatever (laughter). I, yeah, it feels like they're I guess two competing models in some ways for what's going on with, for what happens to people. And, you know, outlooks and from when I started review and I'm not sure if it's true at this point. I don't know. It—I have a very clear idea that they, that they were different. [00:39:10]</p>

<p>It was also, I just, I find it very, very difficult. I find it much easier to go see a therapist than I do to ask somebody for spiritual counseling. Like, it's not like I've basically never asked somebody for spiritual counseling. Well, I guess (inaudible at 00:39:28) with Wade, but that was a long time coming and I was expecting a follow up to that. Like, he just never got back in touch with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have the impression that something you actually really want which is totally different from there being anyone really comfortable asking for it and so forth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it sounds like something you're kind of—hurting considering for the lack of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? [00:40:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there just aren't that many people who are—. There just aren't that many people who could can both keep up with me intellectually and are okay with the things that I'm thinking and believing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. I didn't mean like why does it hurt to find the right person and more so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Why do I want to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What hurts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm very lonely. I, in that I feel like the any question of God is, you know, my relationship with God is pretty central to my life. Pretty, pretty much the thing that is going on or one of the, the big things, but it's like nobody else is speaking the some language as you or nobody else that I actually meet and talk to and so I, but then also I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the question? [00:42:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like whether there is a God. That doesn't, that's not very important. It's more like where is God in my life? Or is God in my life? But—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is a pretty central question. [00:43:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But everybody who seems to find that question important and feel like they have an answer or feel like they know God to be in their lives in an important way. Yeah. I know they can't keep up or they're not interested in talking to me. It's probably not true, but it's what it seems like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I'm understanding you right, are you saying people who wrestled similarly with that question or for whom it's had a similar importance in their lives and who because of that you'd want to talk to. Especially if they're pretty smart, don't seem to want to. Is that right? [00:44:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Although I'm sure, you know, I know much of that is I don't know how to ask, but not all of it. You know. Intellectual giants don't really go in to the priesthood. They go in to academic theology I mean as a general rule. Which is, I can't believe that just came out of my mouth, but it did, so, oh well. Or they don't tend, maybe they go in to the priesthood, but they don't go in to ministry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess I was surprised although this is something I don't know a lot about. That, like the ones who go in to academia wouldn't have to wrestle with that question for themselves?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they, they do. It's just that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just that they may not write about it. [00:46:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, they do. They write about it. It's just like they're not going to sit down with you and talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like they may talk about your research idea. [00:46:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they're not going to talk about the role of God in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I'm not a theologian, so they're also not going to talk to me in the same way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. We're going to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

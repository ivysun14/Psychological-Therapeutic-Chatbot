<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:06) you don't want to talk about today. It has been a hard day. And unfortunately it sort of, I'm in that fixing everything mode sort of, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I got into work and, you know, put this barrage of messages from my husband basically that he (inaudible at 00:00:27) somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but this is kind of common for him though so we don't, he doesn't get real expensive phones because (inaudible at 00:00:36) sharks attack them or something. But this one had been working for awhile but so that's why I was like were you giving yours like actually buying a phone on Amazon. Like 35 bucks or something like that because it's like it doesn't matter what he does it can only make phone calls at this point. So, yep apparently dropped into a puddle and (inaudible at 00:00:55). Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It probably didn't have a chance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So it just, you know, it's one of those things where I feel like right now all I'm doing is trying to keep things from falling apart. So, it takes up a lot of energy to do that though, you know. I cannot -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - entirely figure out why it is that, our finances are as tight as they are right now, not completely certain. I need to go over some things because although, I mean we haven't really been like ... it's weird because it felt like we were eating out and a couple of things I use to have pay off every month I finished, so I'm trying to figure out where this is. Is it I'm working less, is it, you know, that we're spending more on whatever, I don't know. So, we aren't spending much money on gas because the car has been like, since like the 20th it has been stuck out in our garage, it's like December so. We have had a lot of zip cars but that's not like a lot of money so I'm just trying to figure out what's going on right now. (0:02:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really couldn't do the (inaudible at 00:02:10). I have a pretty good, to be honest, I don't think he really knows how to spend money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Any more, I mean like he knows how to like use a credit card to like get gas but that's about it. So, no I don't think so. I let him look at, when first go online ... none of it, none of the things he's spending money on looks suspicious at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is good, but I don't know. So, it's mostly just figure out where in the world (inaudible at 00:02:42) money from so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really in general February has always been kind of hard for us, he just tends to get really depressed in February. And things are (inaudible at 00:03:01), he doesn't make things that much easier, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I'm sure it doesn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, trying to find ways of keeping, you know, afloat. And that's pretty much about it really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh like what else option do you have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a whole heck of a lot really. I have been amazingly like, you know, trying to just keep everything on the steady and narrow, you know. It's, I know the drama is kind of like exhausting so. I, oh gosh, (inaudible at 00:04:02), may possibly have to talk about is the fact that (inaudible at 00:04:05) going (inaudible at 00:04:06) doctor again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I went to go see my PCP after I started having hearing loss and I went in there and I had been told that this is a really good doctor but he does not seem to want ever make a command decision of my health ever. Like if I need something it's like from like maybe allergy medicines he will not prescribe it he will always send me out to somebody else but it's always someone within the system in the building which is a gigantic building.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:33).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which only in the (inaudible at 00:04:34) Center.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so like he's just a giant pain in the neck because he just and the worst part is on top of it he's like giving me a lot of crap about things that I understand that it is that way but I went in for hearing loss and I was told I had a lose 50 pounds, you know. That was not what I needed that day. (0:05:00)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. If I don't and if I don't get my blood pressure down which I don't normally have high blood pressure, apparently they're going to have to take me off the last pain killer I have right now, which is just (inaudible at 00:05:17) analgesic. And since it is known for causing high blood pressure they want to take me off of that. And so, and it's not, I'm just bitter because it's not my fault that I gained all this weight, I was on steroids for a long time. But no doctor seems too really, they don't, I get the feeling that they don't really think it's like the steroids. I'm like you do realize I've gained 90 pounds in less then a year, you know, and they're like well you know but you're not on them now. I'm like yeah I know but I can't move around so much I do my best.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean getting exercise is kind of tough for you to get out of bed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I do, do things anyways. I feel like I've just got totally shamed into like doing things I didn't want to do when I came in to have hearing loss issues, you know, it was like yep no (inaudible at 00:06:12). I'm like did you really just call me in here to be seen if I had ear wax, really? But no (inaudible at 00:06:17), I mean you received this specific type of audiologist, that's fine but it's just like, I don't even know why I even bother going in. You know, if you're going to give me a referral why can't you just write it over the phone, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's just very frustrating. And, well, I do think that it is important that they explain to me and it's something I know more then anything, that my weight is terrible for my joints. I mean I just, I know I walk around and it hurts like hell. I don't really think (inaudible at 00:07:03) nutritionist probably. I really don't think that sending me to a nutritionist where I write down everything I eat all day long is really going to do anything because I'm extremely self-aware. I've done this before, you know. I'm not one of those people like oh wow I guess I do eat more during the day then I'm expending or something ridiculous like that, it's not like that. But I'm just angry and frustrated, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. (0:07:29)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. (Pause at [00:07:31] - 00:07:39). I understand that he doesn't want to have much to do with the fact that's like a huge liability of the fact that they're pretty sure that I'm having swelling in my ears due to some sort of audio immune phenomenon and like everything is like pretty much that's what happens is I go to the doctor, like wow this must be some mysterious (inaudible at 00:07:55) phenomenon because you're swollen but you don't have any infection, and I'm like yeah. But I feel like, the rheumatologist doesn't really take it seriously if I can get in which normally takes about eight months. (0:08:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eight months?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's all, I mean it was not even up here in general it's hard to get into a rheumatologist, if they're any good. If they're, I've eventually gone to ones that would see me immediately and they were crap. But yeah, it's very hard to get in. But at the same time it's like, you know, I, I'm just frustrated because this has happened before just that that whole shrugging your shoulders and it's like saying okay well we don't know what's wrong with you, like thanks. I could have stayed home and like figured that on the Internet, you know, (laughing). But, it just, right now it's feeling like everything is breaking on me I mean I've got like something in the house is broken that I've got to figure out how to fix, I, you know, I've got myself that is broken and I've got figure out a fix, you know, all this other stuff it's like I hate the fact that it always seems like it happens all at the same time, and so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound pretty frustrated and I also imagine like you're awfully sick of having to be so responsible for everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, pretty much. The worse, the thing is, is that honestly it wouldn't be so bad if things weren't that tight because if we weren't like literally trying to make sure that we do not spend money that we do not have. When things got bad like this before, and this is sort of weird, okay, so in Massachusetts you can't do this, however, in other states you can, where if you take your prescription to, I get a lot of prescriptions, I mean I'm talking like 12 prescriptions a month. So if you take the prescriptions to the drug store and, you know, you're transferring from somewhere else you get like x amount in gift cards, that kind of thing. And so it brings out really bad, I would just switch pharmacies, get a bunch of gift cards, get food for the, from the, you know, whatever I needed, you know, from that gift card that you got from switching, you know, pharmacies and then sort of survive off of that if we needed to. We can't really do that here and it is kind of making me very grumpy because I feel like a lot of, and it wasn't like I was doing it all the time, but when things were really hard it became like somewhat of a relief on that, but not so much here. Apparently that's like I guess it's verboten over here (inaudible at 00:10:42).</p>

<p>But, I just really feel like the world is just pressing down on me all the time right now and I just wish it would stop, you know. (Pause at [00:10:59] - 00:11:05).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, here's a terrible question, would your parents help you guys out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. My impression is that they're quite comfortable, they usually are, I know that right now they have, some changes are being made that are might or might not be able to so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're basically right now they have been doing a lot ... how to explain this. Financially they have been investing in some things where things are not as liquid right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it may or may not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It makes sense, I sort of didn't understand why all of a sudden they wouldn't be able to, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no it's more along the lines of like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Liquidity issues now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - a liquidity thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Amount of assets issue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So, maybe but at the same time I just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, it's (pause at [00:12:00] - 00:12:03). I already let them pay our cell phone bills not only because of the fact that they claim that it is not really true, it is actually cheaper for them to pay for four then it is (inaudible at 00:12:13). It's sort of true kind of. And if they are all the same bill then it doesn't cost anything to call each other, therefore, it is in theory cheaper, but it's not like that much cheaper. If it is it may be just slightly more, but the point is I let them do that. And I let them pay for a country club, but that's about it, you know. I think, the thing is that it sort of reminds me (inaudible at 00:12:40) to his parents, pretty much just don't care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean if your parents help you it reminds you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It bothers me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that is part of why you don't have any help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit yeah. (Pause at [00:13:00] - 00:13:04).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would assume it's because you really don't like asking for help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like asking for help either but then it becomes like a, you know, how obvious is it that my parents are the only ones who are willing to help if I asked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like you've been confronted with something that you both know full well is true already?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Honestly, it sounds like expensive denial.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not just expensive denial there's a lot of other reasons too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I would speak really with other parts with his parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:42).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean just things about it too, you know. This is not anything they do specifically but I feel like if I ask them for money that if, that I have some things that strings along with it, you know. Like I can't say mom I'm really having a bad day, if nothing, you know, today, not today, but like right now if I, mom calls and she says hey what's up and she sounds really chipper, I say mom I'm really honestly not in the mood to chit-chat, you know. That's okay, but having just taken all that money from her I would feel really bad about that, you know, saying gee mom I'm just really not up making small talk, you know. Is somebody bleeding, no, okay then can I call you back tomorrow, that kind of thing. (Pause at [00:14:32] - 00:14:41). So, that same thing. Unless it is all me, it is all me, you know. They have never, ever, well once but it was totally justified, reminded us that, you know, they stepped in and helped us out with something, so. And, you know, it just, I just don't feel comfortable. I think when they give me, I think (inaudible at 00:15:15), getting less sleep at night and more anxiety then running from creditors, you know? But that is just me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why we're talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to talk about it or do you want to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not that. It's just (pause at [00:15:53] - 00:16:02). I just don't know I mean I don't want to put them through any more stress in having to ... at the moment probably having to liquefy things (inaudible at 00:16:09), you know, cause more stress for them. My dad has a really stressful life still, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (pause [00:16:24] - 00:16:30). Here we haven't thought about this, but I imagine a lot of it is (pause at [00:16:38] - 00:16:44) frankly maybe wanting to pretend that things are different then how they ... not just in terms of Mike's family but also in terms of, you know, your health and how much you can work and earn and how much control you have over all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't lie to my parents, I tell them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Straight up. (0:17:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't, I didn't mean it like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I'm saying that the thing is I never, the thing is that I never go out of my way to try because I know people who have had no money at all and have sort of been living this, you know, fake life, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean (inaudible at 00:17:27) not that way at all only that like it's incredibly hard for you, I think that to admit like how much you can't do and what that costs you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not in control of it, you are because that is so, so different from who you have always been and absolutely different from who you want to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's a terrible thing. I think you know in any case. And, of course, I don't know all the ins and outs. (0:18:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:18:02) parents with that, but.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's just that it's a lot of different things, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just (pause at [00:18:08] - 00:18:12).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not even like making a recommendation that you do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no not saying that at all. It's hard to explain, I just.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think like you said, you know, being (inaudible at 00:18:27) parents they make me feel sad, you know, in terms of that I don't want to take from them right now, you know. (Pause at [00:18:39] - 00:18:42). It just (pause at [00:18:43] - 00:18:47). I don't know. It's very hard to explain. I just ... more about the concept and the money even if you know what I mean? I mean what we're talking about, regardless of it, I just, you know, I don't (inaudible at 00:19:04) I don't want anything. Don't buy me anything, don't give me money, don't do this, I just don't need it and I need it but I don't want it, you know, and. (Pause at [00:19:19] - 00:19:21). Really, I've never been (pause at [00:19:23] - 00:19:31) and I don't know the person that likes to live outside (inaudible at 00:19:33) to begin with, I mean there are times in your life where you have to take a loan against, it is an investment to do something. That's very different but I'm not like go out and buy a television, I don't even own a television, you know, that kind of stuff. (Laugh) But it's just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:19:53).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (inaudible at 00:20:02). Really go into it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:14).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. (Pause at [00:20:17] - 00:20:22). I just don't want to believe it. I always held myself at a higher level of, higher standard then anybody else, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so like, when it comes to things like finances or things like that and people are always like saying like oh these poor people they're under water, their mortgage and I think to myself, now maybe this sounds (inaudible at 00:20:53), but there is no way in hell anyone should ever borrow, you know, if you don't have the money for a damn deposit, you know, there is no money down then you certainly don't (inaudible at 00:21:04), like it screams that idea, I don't feel bad for them. And these things like oh these people are like getting (inaudible at 00:21:09) out like, you know, obviously I just, you know, gone without and kept going, you know. And maybe I'm very lucky that I have had (inaudible at 00:21:20) but I don't like people who cheat the system whether by their own stupidity or by their (inaudible at 00:21:28). And so I have never wanted to like, for example, now do anything but, you know, earn things by own, you know, labor, you know. I don't want to go I mean I don't, but I especially do not want to go on some sort of instability program. I think that that would kill me because in my head that is for people who lost their arms in like a combine accident, you know, that kind of stuff. As long as I can keep pushing myself to get going I can keep myself going. I didn't even like (inaudible at 00:22:09) going into surgery but I did have ... some people sat me down and talked me into it so. That was like through my company, it's part of the insurance you pay out of your paycheck for that, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, I just ... unfortunately I really believe that, you know, that you shouldn't, you take what you can earn, you don't look for other people to take care of you, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:51) entirely believe that because you certainly didn't care of many people I mean most especially your husband.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing) (0:23:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is, no, no (inaudible at 00:23:07) principle on this. It is, oh gosh what's called when the difference, this is going to drive me crazy, I was reading about it in Dan Arley's (sp) book, it's social norms versus fiscal norms. What things you will do for people socially versus what things, once you bring the actual monetary things into it is different. Bringing something to a potluck versus taking in $35, you know, that kind of thing. But I mean, yes I take care of other people that's true but quite frankly he takes care of me, he takes care of me pretty well, you know. I haven't been to the grocery store in six months because most of the time I can't limp through the grocery store, so I mean that's great. Most of the times he goes and runs errands that I can't do, you know. It's a pretty good division of labor. (0:24:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, well then terrific.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) (inaudible at 00:24:08) and just say it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing). I do I was thinking like this principle of, you know, you don't rely on people and you do for yourself and (inaudible at 00:24:21), I think it pretty much goes one way with you. Like you were taking care of him in ways, well before you guys were married, especially financially.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sort of embarrassed to tell people that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you feel bad about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:24:42), like more on the lines of friends, that kind of thing, or family, you know. (Pause [00:24:48] - 00:25:00).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my question is do you see like in your instance, principle as being sort of going both ways or more something that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh this is only, this only applies to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will certainly judge a lot of people but that doesn't necessarily mean that's just the people here or something like that, that's not real life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will certainly judge other people but that's not, for the most part I have a standard for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why because honestly when I do this I feel terrible inside, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You feel guilty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not even that I mean yeah a little bit but part of it is just the fact that (pause at [00:25:44] - 00:25:49), I feel like I'm even being dishonest with myself when I sort of take advantage of, you know, things, you know. (Pause at [00:26:00] - 00:26:06). Most of the time when I have let myself be cared for it's only because I've been lazy not because of the fact that I (inaudible at 00:26:16) and/or, you know, I don't know I just feel bad about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do, I really feel bad about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I always (inaudible at 00:26:28) and the problem I have with that is, is that I have an extremely conflicted because when people do things for me it is also how I have been raised to be gracious and so there is a thing of not feeling good about it but at the same time I know that that is impolite and, therefore, I can't need you like switch over and try and be grateful damn it and, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. (0:27:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a really tricky balance I mean. Neither one of them make me feel especially great, you know. (Pause at [00:27:13] - 00:27:25). I know that, well, no I mean it just. There is a couple of ways out of this for me at least financially and I bet I'm going to do it and I'm not really sure why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Beside from that I do have a decent bit of Microsoft stock. I sold a decent bit of it over the years too, but I still have some Microsoft stock and if I sold like quick it could very well pay a decent bit of it off if I needed to, but. (0:28:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To pay off like debt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Debt. I don't know why I'm afraid to, I think it's because the thing is (pause at [00:28:12] - 00:28:17), it's the last bit of identity I have with the old world of Microsoft, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not some stupid thing stocks that I physically don't have the stock certificates for, they were issued, you know, in the early part of the 2000 years, it sounds like they are sentimentally value but they are, I really have good value, a good reason to want it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:28:17).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that relieves some things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's all greed, there are a lot of people that hold on to, you know, hold on to something that makes a lot less money when they are out tracking with, you know, their interest rate is higher then the evaluation of it, it's not about that, although it is valued out way tracking the interest rates and all. But it's more about (pause at [00:29:08] - 00:29:12), you know. When I was very young I said I wanted to grow up and work for Microsoft, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my god yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing). I didn't know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:29:26) anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not for retail probably not but I don't know, probably. And I definitely wanted to work for Microsoft for many, many years. So, this is like 1987, 80, like 86, 87, 88, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:29:50).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Very strongly tied to the company so it is (inaudible at 00:29:57) to me. When I first started working at Microsoft, a few months after that, I don't remember exactly what it is, but I had some boss sit down with me and they were like asking me questions about what my future plans were, I don't know exactly what it was, this was years ago, and asked me like where do you, you want to see yourself end up in the company and I'm like oh, Chief (inaudible at 00:30:17) Officer. And she's like how high really (inaudible at 00:30:19) and I'm like no. That's exactly what I see myself as doing and it was like okay. So I don't really have a good plan for that, in terms of making that happy, I'm like that's okay don't worry I'll figure it out. So I had like, I had a lot of strong feelings about Microsoft well before anything bad happened, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but I feel foolish for holding onto something that could make me a lot better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you start working in when you started there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I just, the same thing I do now, teaching. It was, my store was the prototype store for training so it was the first, you know, training program that probably original. (inaudible at 00:31:12) say yeah they probably today, seven, eight years ago now so. I've been promoted briefly and got demoted because I had an asshole boss. But for the most part I've consistently, more or less, had the same job the whole time, just a brief stint when I was a manager in which I wanted to have a nervous breakdown beside that. (Pause at [00:31:39] - 00:31:46). The, I don't have anything else to say about that really other then the fact that I had field days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you have? (Pause at [00:31:59] - 00:32:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Colored people, how easier things used to be. Part of it was the fact that, you know, we were doing something so new that like very ground breaking stuff, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the training?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The training or just making like, if we had some idea we just sort of did it, you know. We still just do it now but there isn't like stores calling you to ask you how this was done any more, you know. So, it's big, it's a big freaking company now. Not that it wasn't big before but retail has just become a lot bigger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (Pause at [00:32:37] - 00:32:43).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, yeah. (Pause at [00:32:49] - 00:32:52). But still of it is bits and people. It's not that I don't like doing the work but it just ... when you start literally a store that hasn't even been built yet, literally hasn't been built yet, and you've got this new prototype and you're doing this and you're doing that you spent a lot of time with one another and you would have a lot of bonding, you know. And now it's like I quite, I already have (inaudible at 00:33:25) really bad memory for me extremely bad memory for (inaudible at 00:33:29) but it has even gotten worse now because I'm like okay I don't even know if I've met you before. I mean in my one store we have over 100 people now, that's a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people never see half the people that work there on that shift at that time and so it's like I don't know who you are, it's nothing against you but I probably will never know your name. (Laughing). Like I said it's a different world on that, you know. (Pause at [00:34:01] - 00:34:14). In some ways it's the same, I mean a lot of what we call ship from one store to another will always be the same, which is nice. Honestly I would love my, my job if it wasn't so freaking far away, you know. In theory it's not that far away but I, I'm a stage dweller I don't like having to go out to the suburbs especially not on a long bus ride, so it's inconvenient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause at [00:34:55] - 00:35:04).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, I'm just exhausted both physically and emotionally. I just feel like my life is passing me by and either working or sleeping or doing something to keep the world from falling down apart, you know. It's kind of frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds pretty bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't like to admit it's bad. Not that I'm in denial it's bad, it's just that I want to not wallow in it, yeah. A biggest part of that trying to skirt people if I'm a drama queen by saying that, you know. (Pause at [00:35:52] - 00:36:02). The sky is falling, the sky is falling kind of thing, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're just not a drama queen. Like, I don't know what it's worth like, I know you (inaudible at 00:36:15) I know other people who perceived it that way but.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't necessarily at this point believe it, I'm just been so afraid of it that now it's kind of engraved in me, you know. Yeah, I've been known to be loud and obnoxious, yeah. But, you know, and there are certain things that like I don't ever let die but it's not necessarily like a bad thing, it's just I'm silly, you know. I've been (inaudible at 00:36:58) this concept called Fuck You February. I don't swear a lot, I really don't. In fact, most of the time all I'll swear is a, in this room actually, it's really weird. But we were discussing how like there's not enough, for some reason there isn't enough like, I don't know whether it is conscious awareness of language or something like that and like well, you know, me being the kind of person why use a four letter word when, you know, I can use a perfectly good ten letter one. And so like well we're going to decide that, you know, me and a couple other (inaudible at 00:37:26) like we need to make sure that like you don't do in front of customers but in all things that you do you need to make sure that, you know, you're supporting your, you know, your curse words so they don't go out of the English language. And so I've been, you know, (inaudible at 00:37:41) okay so have you actually been like keeping up with your goals, your swearing goals for Fuck You February? (Laughing) I mean it's silly, I don't think it's dramatic but it's silly, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it going? (0:38:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know we'll see. But yeah this has been sort of a running joke because (inaudible at 00:38:10). I don't remember how, oh I remember now because we were discussing how us computer dorks like to have understand parts of speech so that we feel superior to other people. Like we can discuss things like (inaudible at 00:38:23). We do this because it makes us feel like although we don't own computers we can out dork you English people too and so yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that's where it evolved from, the ongoing discussion about that, yeah. So but the sort of, it's not even like I'm like (inaudible at 00:38:50) about it, it's just like I said I was raised that, you know, that this is why you use a four letter word when there are lots of other ones that are much better to use and actually are more insulting. (Laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39:02).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like almost (inaudible at 00:39:02) it's the lazy way out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To use a four letter word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not even (inaudible at 00:39:23) even I don't really care.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean like in a moral sense it's more like a work ethic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Work ethic yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So why not take the word that is precisely what you're trying to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. But the so that's sort of, you know I have these weird things at work that I will do it, I think that they like me because of it and not just in spite of it. There are quite of few people that find it hilariously the things that we have been doing but yeah. I just, you know, I have to keep (inaudible at 00:40:06).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's, especially because I can get very (inaudible at 00:40:13) I don't do things, I don't do this, I'm not interested in that, I have no idea what you're talking about. And they get kind of like sort of I don't know snotty about it like yeah I have like, you know, I only work 12 hours a week and I can't find any utility that's going to, any of my day watching like this television show. I don't know what year ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, at least (inaudible at 00:40:40) being funny about it at least it I think it's a little better. I think so we'll see. I just I feel like my life is constantly like and again talking about, you know, using big words when I shouldn't, necessarily, it's very (inaudible at 00:41:04) and it's very much like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's exhausting. Even when it is so great it's exhausting, you know. You have to deal with so many other things, you know. I really would like to have my life just be bluff, I can handle that, you know, nothing. Nothing breaks but don't let anything either, you know. I can handle that for awhile. We'll see. But (pause [00:41:33] - 00:41:40). They said, I feel like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sounds weird to say this but I feel like so much of my life is like revolves around managing my spouse's mood which sounds stupid because it's like I don't really want to, I don't really, I mean I go out of my way not to but I feel like so much of my life is I have to, if that makes sense like I'm not like wanting to like control him in any way, shape or form but it's like. Like for example if I want to be able to make a phone call to him right now I had to go buy a phone (inaudible at 00:42:10). It's not like I want to have to do it I just happened to know he doesn't have, he's so pissed off right now that his phone was run over by a bus and went in a puddle (inaudible at 00:42:19). And that he just, you know, he can't put this, you know, put the things together to do it, that kind of stuff, you know. Or just things like that, you know. And it's not like I really want to have to do but I assure you that I did not want to but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he'll get (inaudible at 00:42:39) oh god what in the world is going to happen, I don't have a phone, it's in pieces, what do I do? And I'm like well how about you get one? Okay. And then he'll get stuck looking for the phone thing, you know. And I feel like in my life if I want productive at all like here have a phone. Okay, now you've got past that mood now let's try and like focus on laundry or let's focus on vacuuming (inaudible at 00:43:07) like if he gets stuck in that it will be hours. And I feel really crappy about that because I don't want to have to do any of that, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, he's getting more and more sensitive now, he's really a lot more sensitive. And I don't know if that is just because he's in therapy or it's a phase or what. I feel a lot more sensitive to everything. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stop for now. We'll go on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds great. I'll see you Thursday.</p>

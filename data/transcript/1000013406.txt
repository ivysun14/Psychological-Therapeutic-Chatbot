<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (audio begins at 0:00:14.9) Thank you. Did you check your bank?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't gotten my statement yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I couldn't check that. But yeah it's been cashed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't get the check back but (inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:00:33.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good. Then they have a record of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I was afraid because when we were here I wasn't a 100 percent sure because I went to physical therapy as well in (inaudible at 0:00:47.1) Israel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that's what the check for (inaudible at 0:00:49.9) bounced. Was for the -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're here twice in one week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why this week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the second time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In two days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:12.5) I feel like I've just been here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now it feels like fresh. (Pause from 0:01:25.6 to 0:01:40.5) I know last time I was here I said quite a lot. A lot of information. And it's true that a lot of things, a lot of different things actually, they all have to do with decisions and change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. [0:02:00.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Happening in my life. But in a one way, the way I react to it is, like it almost doesn't happen to (inaudible at 0:02:08.7) I think to me. It's not -  "A," I don't know exactly what I want to happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like, it's not that I have a clear goal or a clear choice. What I want. And it's like, many, many times my, before facing something that's big, for many times I'm a little numb. Like I'm (inaudible at 0:02:52.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I mean it's so funny that you're saying this now. Because if I can interrupt for a second, the last session is also fresh for me. And I thought a lot about it. And I thought a lot, it's really two different things. And the first thing is that you're saying that you feel a little bit numb or that your decision feels a little bit disconnected from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. From me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it strikes me as interesting that I actually, as much as you said last time, you know which was a tremendous amount about your past. About your present. I felt actually very disconnected from what you were saying to me. I was trying to find a way to speak and be present. And the second thing, it's not only that I felt disconnected but that I felt very tentative and cautious about saying anything to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure why. I'm still thinking that through. Because you just kind of opened with saying that you felt numb, it felt like an opportunity to share with you what I was feeling. Because it's very important to me to feel connected and not numb. [0:04:13.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's actually just how I felt last session. So I wanted to know what you thought about that? And see if we can make some use of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (long pause from 0:04:24.8 to 0:04:32.2) Um-(Another long pause from 0:04:32.7 to 0:04:40.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did I feel disconnected to you or did we feel distant? Or -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Last time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes, a little. And I guess it's -  and it also brings me to the fact that you asked me before what it is I want from you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't really have an answer for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Even though, I get the feeling, I'm not sure, I get the feeling that there is something, even if you're not sure what it is, I feel very much that you want something. And like I'm not quite -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Sure what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that I'm not quite giving you what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you would want. And I've been aware of that feeling for some time. And it strikes me as interesting in the context of you trying to make a decision in the context of relationships and similar feelings might be there. [0:06:17.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. (Long pause from 0:06:18.7 to 0:06:45.6) I think it's hard for me to be clear. I think for myself and for a lot of people around me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To send a clear message. Because almost any kind of message. If it's bad or good or when it's -  I don't really know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was just going to ask you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't. I don't really know why. I'm trying to figure, thinking about why. I can see it's almost, well in many aspects of my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Let's stick to the moment for a second. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. [0:08:01.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems what you're saying is that to communicate clearly with another person -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - about things, about anything that's important, whether it's difficult or positive or whatever it is. Is very difficult for you. And you, my sense is, what I feel, is that I'm not quite sure -  Let's see, how can I say this? When somebody communicates clearly, you have a sense of who they are. And so here I am feeling a little bit distant. And I think it's not only because I don't know what it is, right? It's not only the content. But I'm not quite sure who it is. If you know what I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And my sense is, that this is the way that I can help you in these sessions. More than figuring out the content of the decision. That if this is the way in which you might have difficulty making decisions. I can help you look at that process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what it's like to interact with somebody in the process. That's my sense of things. But I'm interested in hearing your feedback. And I'm aware that for the first time I'm talking a lot. And you're not talking so much. So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really know what should I do next. Like I understand, I hear what you're expecting from me. I don't know. [0:10:07.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you hear that I'm expecting from you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think to change. But I don't know exactly I'm supposed to do. Or how I'm supposed to speak. Or what -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure what I'm saying or what I'm asking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I hear what you're saying. But I'm not sure exactly what -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So let me back track.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand what you're saying. I just don't understand what I'm -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How you should respond.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:10:43.0) Yeah. Or what I can do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how about this? Instead of you worrying about how to respond, which now I could be wrong, but when you say that, that you're worried about how to respond, I think, my feeling is, that you're worried about how to respond. About what to do to give me what it is that I'm asking for. Whereas really I'm asking for something different. Which is simply for you to say what you feel. What you feel in the room. Did you feel disconnected the last time? Were you aware of that feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that something you talked about that as something you felt with James. So I'm just saying let's look at the moment. And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you, even now, this is a different kind of interaction for us. We haven't had this very often. What is it like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (long pause from 0:11:33.0 to 0:11:55.0) It's true that I am -  well last time I felt disconnected. [0:12:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes I know that what I do when I feel that I'm disconnected, I'm talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel the air.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Do you know why you felt disconnected? Did you feel that in the session? Last session?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I felt it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We both missed the opportunity to discuss it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt it, but at the same time I was, you know, driving and discussing, and talking, talking, talking. So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I was caught up in that also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. So but I did [feel that at various times] (ph). That I'm disconnected. And I think it's also a situation, I think familiar to me to be in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's what you were talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's where I am with James.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so here we are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What feels -  I'm sorry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know it's very hard for me to be completely authentic. Or intimate. And this is a (inaudible at 0:13:54.9) being married. Intimate. [0:14:00.5]</p>

<p>(Long pause from 0:13:57.8 to 0:14:29.0) And I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, as you were sitting there, the thought came to my mind, because you had used the word driving before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the thought came to my mind that in sessions like the last session, you were driving with a map. I wasn't quite sure what it was. But I could certainly kind of get caught up, I was in the back seat, if you will.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were driving with a map. And I feel like asking you these questions I just took the map away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you're stopped on the road. And where to go now? Does that in any way describe?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's fine. Because I was also talking about physically driving. Literally driving. Last time. Yeah I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if you can, if you can put into words, any of what it is that you're feeling right now. That's the place to start. You feel it's a familiar space.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a familiar space that I, this is not familiar space. Where I was five minutes ago (inaudible at 0:15:47.0) familiar space.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Familiar space is when I can be detached from my feelings and pretend that I'm talking about it. [0:15:59.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. And now what's the -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I can't pretend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And what does that feel like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Scary. Uncomfortable. And confusing. But at the same time like I feel uncomfortable, but it's not necessarily that I don't want to be there. Right. But what I was saying now I'm, it's also what I always do. I always look for something positive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look for something positive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To convince myself. That it's very hard for me also to make decisions. Because I try to convince myself that there is, that it's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That there's something positive about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whereas -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not to [necessarily convince me] (ph) what it is I really want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Try to put other people's voices or different kind of -  I think very much it's like I don't trust my own feelings. Or my own instinct. In my mind I do. In my heart I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well it would be hard to trust feelings if you're disconnected from them. If they're far away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. I know that I'm (inaudible at 0:17:55.9) But I'm afraid of expressing negative feelings. [0:18:03.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there something you were thinking about saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even like to be, confront, like it is you confront me with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm feeling, I'm a little bit mad. And I'm a little bit confused.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? About what makes you mad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I don't want to be in this situation when I have to confront my feelings. Because it's, I don't know how to do it. It's so hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's very hard to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess I have a lot of negative, a lot of aggression, which is something that I don't know how to execute or to express my aggression.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes I do it just being a little bit cynical. Or being a little bit, kind of denial. Kind of like I'm putting myself away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's interesting, because we had a discussion in my school, three days ago, with a social worker that I work with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we were talking about my director. Since there are a lot of problems. And all of a sudden she told me this," You know you're very angry. And I'm surprised because it's not what, that's not the message that I got from you before." And it hit me that I'm angry and nobody knows that. [0:20:07.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not even you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No not even myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a good example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it just happened three days ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm really afraid of expressing these kind of feelings. Especially when I feel, oh my God, where I am now in my life. And it could be in control. Or -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a paradox, though. You know? Because in some sense it's the only way to be in control. Or to make a real decision. Is to allow yourself to be confused.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And misdirected for awhile. Or I shouldn't say misdirected, without direction for awhile. That's hard to hold on to, I think. That information.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like after so many years almost in everything, there was no like misdirection. I know, like I know where I'm supposed to go but I'm not going there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you know where you're supposed to go? What does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It means that I can't constantly put my feelings on hold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear one word in there you kind of what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Put my feelings -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You put your feelings on hold.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On hold. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes it very hard to make a decision. [0:22:00.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And it also (inaudible at 0:22:04.0) Yes. And it's in every aspect of my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. I believe that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I don't know what is right and what is true and what is not true. And I'm afraid that you know, in 15 minutes I'm going to be numb again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll come back on Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but I have life in between.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do have life in between. What you said, in 15 minutes, do you mean something in the session might happen or just because -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No just because -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - you're going to revert to the way you've been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's true. That will happen. But you have a moment now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's like, I feel like I have no idea what I really want. I have no idea. But it's-[0:24:00.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I mean a moment ago you were talking about feeling mad and confused. And my suggestion is for us to rather than think about all the decisions you have to make in your life, let's stay in the moment and deal with the feelings that are here right now. And that might put things in perspective a bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there anything else that you're feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pleasant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um. (Long pause from 0:24:37.4 to 0:24:54.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, when you look off -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought about the fact that that so many times -  that okay - I just saw myself walking on the street. Just on the way here or [somewhere hanging out before I go inside] (ph) to work. Thinking almost everyday that walking here is not what I'm supposed to, is not what I'm supposed to do. Or supposed to be. I'm not happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Walking anywhere?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Walking, yeah it's more, I think it's more familiar to me with going to work. Going to work. Yeah. I'm not happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not happy. [0:26:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then what happens?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so many times, on so many occasions I feel (inaudible at 0:26:10.5). Sometimes it's stronger than others, but the voice, that I'm not happy (inaudible at 0:26:18.4) change. But I don't do anything about it. Like time goes by.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what happens when you feel the feeling? When you're aware of being unhappy, what happens next? Inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm really aware of it I'm getting aggressive. I feel like my body. Is I'm getting edgy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tense. Edgy. And I'm tense with the people around me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Edgy and I feel very judgmental about everything as I do it in (inaudible at 0:26:52.2) And (inaudible due to crosstalk at 0:26:54.7) about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Like why do I do it. And also with my private life. It's the same with James. When I'm all the time aware of it, I'm not happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's the same. I became very edgy. And cynical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And critical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also with myself. But that's the rare moment when clear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not always that clear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Most of the time it's not that clear. It's just in between. Like the twilight zone when I feel that something is wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Something's amiss.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something is missing. I've missed something. But it's not that obvious that I can react -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can pinpoint it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can say okay this is what I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you think that James has a sense when things are amiss with you in that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think it is. [0:28:00.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sometimes you have this aggression or edge -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that he has, he has his own issues with. I wish, no (inaudible at 0:28:13.1). He has, he know when I'm aggressive, we call it, that I can be disconnected from him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He has said that though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then he is aware of something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No he is aware of that. He's not aware, he sees that completely as something that always has to do with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's not the case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in a way, that must be very frustrating to you because really if it's true that in the moment you're disconnected, really it's much more about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. It is. And when we do get to, when I do get to talk to him about it, most of the time I'm really frustrated. Because I don't get what I want. I don't get what I want because I'm not very clear. To him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's very easy to get too emotional.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And too emotional in a way that I just don't want to have the discussion anymore. Not necessarily emotional and crying. Or emotional like because that actually might be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not even that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's more like I just don't want to -  I'm frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was just going to say that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he's very quickly frustrated. And he's much more -  he's emotional.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And for him there's always the bottom line. (Inaudible at 0:29:52.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. But really the bottom line would be that the two of you could express clearly what it is that you wish.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's very hard to do. [0:30:04.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also, you know, I just think in a way I just separate from him. I (inaudible at 0:30:10.0). When you say the two of us, I'm like two of who? In a way I, physically not very much in the picture. And that is true in the last month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Since we came back. And he's on my mind as an issue. Or as something that I have to deal with. Make a decision about. And not partner. Not a lover.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say he doesn't sound like a lover.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And it's almost, and I remember those times, and it's almost like when we were away last weekend, and when I like someone or I don't like someone I really don't care. Which is, I don't really care what people say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry. When you like someone -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I felt like I really need kind of like the -  I was looking for a group because they were (inaudible at 0:31:21.5) people. I was looking for the group approval of him. In a way. Which wasn't the case before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was talking to [Cheryl], and I said, what do you really think about him? Or what do people think about him? And she was, and everybody always tell me that I'm, lately I'm doing such a harm to him in the way I describe him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're doing an injustice to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do an injustice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not fair to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well maybe the group's feelings are substitute for your feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well, and yeah that might be true. But I really don't know how to, I think I really don't know how to reach a point where he can understand me. It's like I don't know how to reach you. [0:32:24.1 ] (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that I'm not understanding you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I do. I feel that you do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've reached me today. (Long pause from 0:32:32.0 to 0:32:51.0) Did that, did my comment send you away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Maybe in way. It is but I was also thinking about the fact -  I feel like we haven't really, I'm having about everything I have this time frame that's (inaudible at 0:33:07.4) on Tuesday. I'm feeling there's so many things that I want to be able -  And you know I just need in a way to let go. To let things happen the way they are. But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you feel it, you feel the pressure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Now I felt it, I don't feel it that much. I'm more, I'm truly looking forward to it. Almost in a way that I feel it might be a denial as well. It's going to be all nice and fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's not necessarily that's going to be the case. It's going to be part of it. But if we're also going to talk about the future, having kids, or if we're going to work it out. Or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm numb about that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know it's like also I know when people -  it's so easy for me to, I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to say, but it's so easy for me to see other people's problems and what they're supposed to do. But it's so hard for me to see my own. And that's a shame. But how you can be so stupid about one thing and so not about other things? [0:34:23.2]</p>

<p>And you know I felt about it like, I don't know how often I talk about it here, but I always say to myself that I need structure. That I need frames.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The map.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Map. Working with people. Doing something that basically just will let me not think so much about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. I wonder if it is that good structure and being around certain kinds of people you have a positive interaction with, if all of that kind of keeps you from feeling numb and scared and indecisive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does. When I'm with the right people, when I do stuff that I like, it does. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You even chose a very structured therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um -</p>

<p>PATIENT: The way I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know you chose something with a very clear ending.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah which I'm not so happy about. [0:36:06.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) Can you say more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm definitely afraid of the fact that in 20 sessions it's going to be just a beginning and all of a sudden and I would feel more attached to you. And I would feel more the need of you as well. Not just the attachment. And all of a sudden I'll be, I don't know, it's going to be back to where I was before. But I don't feel numb here. And not necessarily more secure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a risk. It's certainly a risk. I think of any kind of an interaction but of an interaction that will stop a relationship when you go in knowing that the ending is in sight. It's a real, I think it's a real risk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But my sense is, is that even if you might be attached or lonely at the end, that hopefully we can have made something of the remaining sessions. So that you're not back where you started.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. It might be hard to imagine that now. But I agree it's a very hard part of this therapy. Maybe even the hardest part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't really thought about it till now. Because it's still, it seems to me we have a lot of sessions to do. [0:38:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We do have a lot of sessions. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I, it's true in so many ways I'm looking for a frame. Structure. In my own, when I'm supposed to do my own things. Like when I'm creative with my art, I can't do it if I don't have a purpose. I can't do it if I don't know how, what is it that I'm supposed to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. I want to say to you two things. On the one hand, you know, I mean everybody needs structure. I don't want you to think that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody needs structure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that. But I put so much in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And so the other thing that I wanted to say is, for you, it seems to me that one of the questions is what is it that's so, you know the word that came up to my mind was terrifying, I don't know if that's what you feel - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what is it that's so threatening about lack of structure? You know, what is it that's going to happen? Or does happen if you don't have structure?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually I just don't do anything. That's the case. And when I don't do anything, it means that there are problems in different ways. You know. Technically there is no work. There is no money. Then ABCD (inaudible at 0:39:56.3) think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just stay in bed all day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can be there. I can stay in bed. Watch TV. Be extremely passive. [0:40:07.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does it feel like to you when you're that passive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like myself. At the beginning, I'm okay. After awhile, I feel pretty bored. I feel pointless. Almost like death. In a way. In a dramatic way. But I feel like there is [nano] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sound a little hopeless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No wonder you want structure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (long pause from 0:41:07.3 to 0:41:33.7) But it's also, I feel like I have the need to -  Because what I feel now when I'm talking about it, it's so many different areas in my life. I can talk about work. I can talk about James. I talk about (inaudible at 0:41:47.8). I feel like I need to stop to focus. Or to try to, because what happened to me then is I'm getting confused and I'm just getting tired of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that brings me to be passive and numb. [0:42:05.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well I'm glad you told me. So here's a focus. Here we are. Okay. What does it feel like to have me ask you all these questions? In a structuring kind of way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At first I rejected. I felt that like my first reaction would be, don't judge me. Don't interfere. Don't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Do you feel judged?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I felt, in the beginning, that was my impulse. Yes. I felt when you started talking about the fact that you felt disconnected from what I said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your experience about it but that doesn't touch me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean it as such.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it feels powerful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels powerful. So meaningful. And it helped me. That you're asking questions. I'm not used to it. Also in my life. I'm used to people, my friends, expressing their opinion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a bit different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't necessarily used to -  Yes and no. I mean I'm much more vocal in my relationships. I'm more the one that see and said. And talk about it. What I see. With my current relationships. First with James and [Anna]. Colleagues are different.</p>

<p>But it's a, and I know that my first reaction always when people say to me that, express their thoughts or feelings that surprise me. Judging. It's a judgment. [0:44:40.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then it doesn't really feel that way for too long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's the first.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the first thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm actually I'm happy that you're doing it. Because I'm not necessarily happy at the moment but I think and not because of you, just because of what it brought up to me, but I think I need it. That's what I feel. I need, help to make myself in a point where I haven't. And it's very hard for me to do it without someone from the outside as you are, challenging me about it. Asking questions. Tell me what you feel. [0:46:19.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, unfortunately, I have to interrupt you now. And time is up. But we can try and pick up where we're leaving off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On Wednesday. On Wednesday we're meeting at, Wednesday the 20th, we're meeting at nine. And then the 27th, I hope that we can, I'll have to confirm with you next week, but I'm hoping that we can meet at 12:30? The next week is nine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the 27th, let's try it for now at 12:30. [0:47:07.6] (end of audio)</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence) Well, I'm thinking about uh, FDO who started today, but I don't think I really want to think about her, in that uh, (sniff) things are working out, if what has happened today is, is indication, well.  And uh, I think she'll be good.  Uhm, I don't know sometimes, if I, if I start thinking about it, I mean, she had promised us she'd stay until June.  If she decided to take the job, she'd take it with that understanding. </p>

<p>But then I, I might have mentioned I found out she's taking a course, uhm, on Saturdays, and well, it's something to do with uh, IBM and, and uh, the IBM, punching the IBM cards.  And uhm, anybody, I, I asked one or two people if they knew about it, and apparently it's not that well-paying.  So it might be something she wants to do, either on the side, or (sniff) just to have something she can turn to. </p>

<p>Uhm, but, well I mean, it's just not something that has to be an immediate worry for me.  So, I think I think of anything like this today, and even just think about FDO, because things are going well, so there's really nothing to think about, except I'm glad things are going well.  Uhm, because of something, well, s—, a main thing that's on my mind from over the weekend, and uhm, (sigh) well I've been thinking about it a lot until now, when I get here I just find that it's very hard to think about it.  Partly because I feel very, I don't know whether it's guilty or, that I did something wrong, or uhm — (Sniff)</p>

<p>Well, it must be, it must be guilt, because I, well, whatever it is, I feel as if I did something that really had nothing to do with people involved, and it wasn't very nice.  Uhm, (sigh) but I convinced myself that it had to do with the people involved at the time.  Uhm, and it was c, connected with the BFMs.  And I've had ups and downs of feelings connected with them, but I've always hidden my feelings, and I think maybe I've had more with them than with most of our friends.  And uh (sigh) generally I've — I don't know how well I've actually hidden the feelings — but I've, I haven't expressed them directly, in any case.  And I, probably in most cases I've hidden them, which isn't, which I don't think is good. </p>

<p>Partly because, I think that's one reason why on Saturday night w, when we got together, in the end uh, with this feeling of not being able to express feelings, there were some I could of expressed that I uhm, had every right to, that I didn't dare to.  And then, I just sort of, well I didn't exactly explode by shouting and all, but my actions were in a way for me, exploding.  And uhm, some of it was, I, I mean, I think I used something that happened as an excuse, and that it really wasn't.  Something that happened to cause it.  And so then I felt awful afterwards. </p>

<p>Uhm, but, well I don't know, it just, it all seems so petty now, so I can't quite, I haven't been able to get at what it, what it all really is.  But uhm, well I think very much was on my mind uhm, the feeling I had when I had been thinking about my IQ the day before, here.  And uhm, I hadn't been that aware of it, or I, or at least some aspect of probably what I'd been thinking about here, was on my mind.  And then it, then something happened that triggered my remembering that feeling, or feeling it again.</p>

<p>Uhm, but i,i, in any case, there were lots of little annoyances, some of which I feel are really petty, and I suppose I would have ignored them, except everything kept building up.  And one was that, when FNI asked if we could come there for dinner, uhm, at that time I was expecting FDO to come by on Saturday, and I didn't know what time, so I told FNI I wasn't sure.  And said, "Well, I have to know," so I said, "Well, I'll call FDO and I'll see if I can get a baby-sitter, and then I'll call you back."  And when I called FDO, she still didn't know for sure when she could come.  And she was being a bit vague over whether she could.  And as it turned out, she never could.  Uhm, and she, but she did call to let me know, finally.</p>

<p>But in any case, I had to arrange with FNI that we couldn't come until 7:30.  And she was kind of upset at that, and said, "Well, how can we make it an early evening?"  And usually MW likes to make it an early evening, because he is quite tired, uhm, by then.  And this is a sore spot with me anyway, because it always seems to me, MW stays up for everybody else, and he always goes to sleep for MSCZ and me.  So, I've always had kind of a feeling — it's probably because he feels more relaxed with us, but I always feel insulted, I think.</p>

<p>And uhm, so anyway, I was all for making it an early evening, because I knew I'd be tired, myself, and I had to go to the dentist on Sunday, and uh, didn't bother me.  And so I said, well we'd make an early evening anyway, but that I'd try to get there earlier, and I'd let her know if we could.  And so when FDO called to say she couldn't come, I got in touch with Mrs. BBG who was baby-sitting, and she could come earlier, so I called FNI.  And FNI said, "Well, don't come earlier."  Well, it was understandable, because she was just having to take MJ to get some stitches that — she'd already had it checked by the doctor, but he said it probably should be stitched, and so it wasn't a real panic situation.  But she did have to go right away, and she didn't know how long she'd be out.</p>

<p>And so I said okay, I'd call before we come.  And then when w, we went over, uhm, everything was very pleasant.  Nothing had ever been said about playing bridge, although sometimes we do play bridge when we're together.  And it's always sort of coaching MW into playing bridge.  Uhm, that's usually the way the whole thing evolves.</p>

<p>Well, nothing was every said.  It was just suddenly after dinner, uhm, it's sort of announced, "We're playing bridge."  And I think I, then I felt annoyed, because I really didn't want to play uh, Saturday night.  And uhm, I j—, I think I was feeling annoyed that we weren't even asked if we wanted to.  But I could have expressed the fact I didn't.  And I didn't, I didn't.  I mean, this was one of the cases where I did not express directly my feelings that I could have.  And uhm, so I, I don't know, I just sat there and, and we played bridge for awhile.  And I wasn't playing well, and I don't know exactly why.  But I didn't really, I didn't want to.</p>

<p>And then it was almost as if I were playing poorly on purpose.  And worse, yet, I was MW's partner, it just happened because of the way we'd been sitting at the table.  And uh, he's, he gets very ir—, he's erratic in his playing, then he gets very upset at plays, at his own and at what other people do.  And uhm, sometimes I mean, he really goes around sort of throwing a small tantrum. </p>

<p>And so finally, I made a very stupid mistake, which upset me, in a way that sometimes it hasn't before.  And MW threw one of his tantrums, but he was directing it at FNI, not at me.  Because I had asked a question about bidding that the opposite s—, partners are allowed to answer.  And uhm, FNI answered it very much to her advantage.  And uh, but she said what I wanted to hear.  And so I didn't even consider things I should have considered.</p>

<p>And uhm, and, and also the thing that really — that, that was sort of when I kind of, reacted, uhm, because I felt really stupid.  And I, I that was when I had this feeling that sort of reminded me of when I was thinking about my IQ here, or whatever else has made me feel very inadequate.  And what happened right at that time, is almost before MW even reacted, both MSCZ and FNI leaned toward him and as, as if to pat him on the back, and say, well what can you do when somebody makes a stupid mistake like that?  And uhm, FNI said something to him immediately about in effect, be a good sport, MW.  She didn't use those words, but that was her meaning. </p>

<p>And so, I j—, I just felt awful.  And then MW started carrying on.  And so when that hand was over, I decide I don't want to play any more bridge, and instead of accepting it, uhm, — and it was getting on anyway, for an early evening for them.  Uh, it was 11:30, so it was already late, as far as their idea of an early evening.  And uhm, but I think, if that hadn't happened, I probably would have stayed longer.  And they would not accept when I said I didn't want to play any more bridge.  And so then I had to go further, and say "And anyway, it's time for us to go home."  And they would not accept that, either. </p>

<p>Uhm, and so then, I don't know, I kept being, I felt as I were being forced further and further into taking a more and more poor sport and uh, unpleasant stand than I — it was my way, I guess, originally to express I just didn't like what happened.  I didn't like doing something stupid and having everybody (Laughs) recognize it so clearly.  On I, I felt very petty, afterwards, and I, I don't know, I — MSCZ got upset, and I felt upset too, in a way, because uhm, it did look as if what I was reacting to was MW's action.  And I don't think it really was.  I mean, I had that feeling, but it, it wasn't MW's carrying on that made me feel so terrible.  I felt terrible by the time he started to.  It didn't help, but uhm, I don't know, it's just sort of like a lot of little things.</p>

<p>Then, then I would start thinking that night of uhm, how the BFMs always leave our dinner parties early, and sort of spoil them, because they always leave so early.  And so then I kind of got feeling — although I've never done this before, and I didn't start out with this in mind, but — as they would not accept that I didn't want to play bridge and all, then I think I began to feel almost spiteful, I guess, of well, you leave us so early, I'm going to leave you early, kind of thing. </p>

<p>And uhm, well, and I felt badly too, that I made a very strong statement of something.  But it wasn't a very constructive way to do it, or uhm, I mean it wasn't, I mean I should have directed my feelings at what I didn't like in the situation, and then not carried anything over into it.  And I feel as if I didn't do that at all.  So then I'm feeling, I mean,it's almost as if I st—, shouted and screamed and said things that I wished I hadn't, a minute later.  (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>And I felt very upset with MSCZ, but I don't know exactly why.  I felt as if I could not turn to him and uhm, I mean, I had to turn away from him.  I felt as if I again, had to be alone and sort of well, literally curl up my body and hold myself, almost.  And uhm, (Pause, Sniff) I, one thing MSCZ kept saying, which uhm, I think annoyed me too, is, I was already feeling that I had, the whole thing had seemed to be directed more at MW's action than it really was. </p>

<p>Because really, what was going on in my mind, were all sorts of feelings and, and aspects to the relationship that I had never expressed anything about before.  And uhm, although early in the evening I was able to make a joke about something that's always bothered me.  And again, it's petty.  But I don't know why I lost my ability to continue doing that, because I could have made some kind of a light remark that indicated my feeling over what happened in bridge.  And I didn't choose to at all, or the feeling was just too strong. </p>

<p>But, uhm, whenever we're together and MW's pouring wine, he always pours wine for everybody except me.  As if you can't drink, so, you ca—, either you can't hold your liquor, or you clearly don't want much, or I don't know what.  But uhm, I al—, I don't know, I always feel as if he's treating me as some kind of, well, less than the others.  And I don't know whether it's a baby, or, or just what. </p>

<p>But anyway, I've never liked his doing it.  And so when he did it again Saturday night, I was able to make some joke about it, referring to some time when we had gone out to dinner and it was the nature of the place that th—, you got as much wine as you wanted with the meal, it was a price fixed.  And uhm, we had all had a lot to drink, and it's been one of those evenings that we've always joked about afterwards.  So I kind of use that as a way to indicate to MW that I felt sort of funny the way he always handled it, as sort of FAJ you too, are you sure, kind of thing. </p>

<p>And uh, well I don't know what I was leading to with that, but (sigh) one thing I was just thinking about is something that's been very much on my mind, since.  And that is whether I should call up and apologize, and if I do, for what.  Or what I should say, because I know mo—, I mean, I'm not even sure I completely know what I'm feeling.  But I'm not sure what I conveyed to them, because I was trying to hide everything, even in leaving, and pretend that the situation was not what it really was, for me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I guess I don't want to admit too, that a lot of it was being mad because I'd made such a stupid mistake.  Uhm, although I th—, ma—, somebody, I mean, I'm just such a bad bridge player, and I always make stupid mistakes, and I've never gotten to that point before.  So that's where I guess, I don't know exactly what was going on.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But we—, then I think, I think I was starting to say this, and I didn't.  Uhm, (sniff) that in, in o, one way I was in very much of a hurry to leave, because I had this feeling I would explode, if I didn't.  And that I'd make a scene, and I don't make scenes of a very obvious type.  I made a scene by leaving the way I did, so, but it was uhm, (sigh) a different type.  I guess I was afraid of making a scene like MW did.  And I don't know whether I want to just do it differently, so I wouldn't be copying him, or I mean, I always feel very much that he's being very mature.  And I think I was feeling too, the whole feelings I was having were very immature. </p>

<p>And uhm, but then when MSCZ kept — he didn't keep saying it, but he did enough so I felt as if he kept saying it — uhm, that he felt that I'd done something unfair.  And that he said, "You don't understand the pressure MW's under right now, because of his being in the position at the firm where, in the next year or so, he'll either be made a partner or be passed over."  And uhm, I think it's a pressure for anybody, but particularly for (stammers) MW, because of the way MW thinks and feels, and so forth.  And then, with his father so ill, uhm, or possibly so ill, MSCZ was saying, that, that too, you just don't know what pressure he's under.</p>

<p>Well, it may very well be that he really is, but at one point, FNI — I think it might be he's just blanking out.  Because at one point FNI was talking about something that they didn't know if they could do.  And MW said, "Why?"  And she said, "Well, because we don't know about your father."  Because he's going back in for tests, and I guess, an exploratory operation.  And uh, I mean, it was as if MW just really had forgotten, or something.  So then I guess, I w—, I was wondering, well does he really feel anything, or is he just afraid of even looking at it because he, of what he'd feel.  But uhm, and I, and I admit that MSCZ's right. </p>

<p>But then when he was saying that on Saturday night, all I could think is why is MW always the one to be allowed to show feelings, and I don't know, in, in effect, hurt other people?  And, and so then what I was saying is, I want my turn.  And then that makes me feel (sniff) uhm, well immature, petty, or I don't know.  I mean, I don't like having that feeling, but that was the feeling I had. </p>

<p>It's almost as if I had to turn from MSCZ, because I'd be—, it just made me, I mean, I was thinking of it enough myself, but if I had anything to do with him, then it made me feel even more how badly I had acted, or how bad my feelings were.  Bad, in the sense that they just aren't appropriate.  Or, uhm, nice for other people.  Or uh, (sigh), I don't know.</p>

<p>And then, then what I was thinking about is, Sunday, and still feeling very upset, it was almost as if I'd think — and I don't know how much this enter into the whole thing of my getting mad to start with, but, uhm — it's, it was almost as if I were thinking, how could I have finally expressed strong angry feelings, which I've not only, I mean, that's not the first time I've had them.  Maybe not quite so strong.  But I've always suppressed all these feelings with the BFMs.  And uhm, they're good enough friends so it's kind of surprising that I always have, and have not found some way to express them to some degree.</p>

<p>Uhm, and it w—, it was almost as if I was thinking, well here they've been so generous, giving us things like clothes that FYH no longer needs, and then FSO uses.  And all sorts of things that, i—, I mean, they're giving them to us because they don't want them and FNI likes doing that kind of thing.  But they still have been generous and it's helped us.  And uhm, so it's, I don't know if, if that has played a part in my, first of all, feeling that I can't afford to express my feelings, or if it played a part in making me feel more angry.  Or uhm, just what.  But it certainly seemed to be part of my thinking when I was thinking about, should I apologize, or, how could I have done it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And hmm, thinking about something el—, r—, i—, a—, in thinking about it, I'm sort of seeing myself from maybe FNI's or, not so much MW's, because he was too busy being angry himself.  But FNI's point of view, because at that point, she was trying to play the peacemaker of that particular situation.  And I think she thought I was just reacting to what MW had done, too.  And uhm, I was just thinking of how I must have appeared to her.  And, and how, I don't know, uh, I would not like it if somebody appeared that way to me, as I think I must have to her. </p>

<p>Because wh, what I was thinking of is a remark she made when MW was carrying on and throwing cards, and so forth.  She said, "MW you're not being," — h, he did this at the very end, after having played out and lost the hand — uhm, she said, "MW, you're not being the perfect host."  And he had already gotten up and went off swearing.  And uhm, I don't know at what point I had said that I didn't really want to play any more bridge, but that uhm, I think right, right around that time.  And anyway, it was on her mind, having used the phrase of MW not being the perfect host.  And so she said — maybe it was when I said, and I really thought we should go. </p>

<p>Well, I think I said that uhm, in part, because sometimes MW really does continue to just be awful, and so it is better to leave.  And we've never really just quickly left before, and it's sometimes been a very awkward situation for awhile.  And uhm, so I th—, I said, "I think we'd better leave."  And it was a combination of feelings at that point, where I wanted you, to make a point, I guess, and then really sometimes you just don't know with MW, so it would be better.</p>

<p>And uhm, so FNI said, "FAJ, you're not being a perfect guest."  And I said sort very, uh like, in a very s—, in a superior way, or something, "Well, I think I am."  And hoping that she would take it, because of MW's mood, it's better for us to leave.  But when I think of the way I said it now, it's, comes out all sounding v—, rather superior.  And uhm, well, expressing I'm, anger, but not being able to do it directly, which, I think that really bothers me.  Uhm, or I don't know, maybe it bothers me that i—, throughout it all I did express anger, and here I was trying to hide it, and whether that's it.  Or just, if I'm going to express it, I'd rather do it a different way.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know exactly what I'm thinking.  It's something to do with uhm, (sigh) well, feeling there's something that has, pos—, that could, if I don't apologize, I was thinking again about apologizing, I guess.  Or doing something to acknowledge the fact that I either am sorry for the way I behaved, or that uhm, that I really did do something that I think everybody saw, that I wasn't admitting I was doing.  Or, uhm, I don't know, something. </p>

<p>Uhm, because, because I don't know, I think of it as, well, I mean, we've been through an awful lot with MW and, and never reacted.  And I think only once did FNI apologize, and not exactly apologize, but — I can't remember, it was one time when MW really, I mean, I thought then he was in serious trouble, because he, he just went wild.  And he started throwing light bulbs, and uhm, he was just doing some wild things.  And we, we did leave.  Uhm, that we were together at a, their summer place that time, and we were sleeping in a different house, so we just went to bed.  Uhm, because it seemed better to leave.  He didn't do some of it until after we left, but FNI did mention something about that in the morning.  Not very much, but something. </p>

<p>And uh, just, I mean, that was the only time I think, when MW's done anything that just acknowledged that there is his behavior.  And uh, but I don't know, somehow, I, I think I'm feeling that in what appeared to be — and I just can't judge how much it was in reaction to him — but anyway, it appeared to be a direct reaction to him.  That uhm, (sigh) even if everybody else had been fine, and I'd suddenly blown up, it would be different.  Than, than to have some kind of a interreaction (sic) as if some—, something in our relationship has been spoiled by my uhm, being petty in return.  And — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, then I went to thinking about a boy, one of the boys that I've talked about.  Uhm, this one's MGJ, who — I don't know if I've talked about him — but anyway, he has a lo—, he was — well, maybe I have — he's the one that used to bite last year, and this year hits a lot.  And sort of squeezes them until they hurt — the children — because he's very big and very strong.  And he'll do things  nobody else would even think of doing. </p>

<p>And uhm, I was just thinking, because today he tore a dog that another child had made out of paper, and had used — well MJ, and MJ had been using it sort of like a security blanket during the day.  He often will do this.  In the morning make something, and then have it with him during the day.  And uhm, MJ became extremely upset. </p>

<p>And I was just thinking about how the children who have little to do with MJ, since he turns them off right away, really immediately sided with MJ, in that they, or at least felt sorry for him, because they knew they wouldn't like it if MGJ did it to them.  And they, and they, and they didn't make unconstructive remarks, they made very constructive remarks, about how they did not like MGJ doing that.  And they didn't want to have anything to do with MGJ, if that were the kind of thing he was going to do.</p>

<p>And uhm, it was, it was fairly good, because MGJ paused and really seemed to be thinking about it.  And probably, because the children weren't being just aggressive and, and nasty, without, I mean it was just seemed like a very constructive thing.  And uhm, (sigh) I guess maybe I thought of that, because I was thinking first of the fact that uhm, one of my reactions too, on Saturday night, was when MW was carrying on, my sitting there thinking, why do I have to keep putting up with this?  Uhm, why do I always have to be the understanding one?  Why doesn't MW sometimes have to face up what his actions can make other people feel or do?  And then when I reacted that way, I wasn't thinking in turn what my actions and reactions were doing.  It was sort of like, I'll teach MW a lesson.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I, I, again I was thinking too, wondering about whether to say anything or not, or apologize or not, or whatever.  And uhm, feeling, it's almost as if, I'm hoping if I apologize too, that uh, well, it's like, it's hard to do, so then it would be undoing what I did do, which can't be undone.  And, or I don't know, it's sort of like my punishment, and then uhm, (sigh) well, somehow, it seems like not accepting responsibility for what I did, somehow.  I don't know exactly how it is.  Uhm, well, because it might be in the way I think of doing it uhm, like saying something, I don't know exactly what happened, but I'm sorry, or something like that.  Which isn't then accepting responsibility for it.  And, I, I, I don't know, it just seemed to me there was just almost an element of, or maybe totally, uhm, well, it's hard, I mean, I'm thinking it now, but I just don't quite see why I would think of it uh, but of look at me, kind of thing.  And I don't, I don't know why I think of it in that way.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, must have thought something before this, but I'm thinking now about uhm, what I'll say with FDO regarding housecleaning, and just how she's going to be, too.  Wondering, because uh, oh, I didn't say some things when I left this morning that, so she didn't do them.  But uhm, I'm just, she'd noticed one or two things that needed to be done,  FMC never suggested doing, so, I, I think I'm wondering is she going to be cleaner than FMC, or just different in her cleaning, or uhm, not as thorough, or, or, I don't know, the same, or just what.  And then just thinking about I have to discuss with her uh, how she wants to go about doing it, telling her what has to be done each week, and then she can do it different ways.  And uhm — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uh, I was thinking back again to what to do about the BFMs.  And I think maybe I've had this feeling of I came here, uhm, and  thought about it here — I mean, it is something that's been on my mind and it ha—, did disturb me very much over the weekend — but I think I've also hoped I'd have a clear feeling about how I wanted to handle it.  And I don't feel I do.  And I don't know whether to get that clear feeling, I wanted you to just tell me something, or, if uhm, I hoped I'd think things here because of just thinking differently than I would if I were thinking it on my own, at home.  But, because I think even when it was really bothering me before, and I kept thinking, I've got to do something right away, uhm, but then I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And uhm, (sigh) I think I even thought then, well I can wait until after Monday, when I come here. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Do you have anything in particular in mind that you wanted me to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, the thing that just came to my mind when I was just finished talking before you asked that, was something MSCZ said.  And at first of course, I felt like denying it very strongly.  And then I began to realize, I think he was right.  Uhm, because he said, it was almost as if you set it up.  Well, I even said this, I guess, earlier.  That it was almost if I did on purpose this stupid play, or had played stupidly all evening.  And, and then, but then it was almost if I set up that least scene.  And uhm, and then was just playing it out.  Everybody was playing it out, the way I knew they would. </p>

<p>And uhm, I mean, I can say to myself, well I really didn't mean to do what I did, because I hadn't thought of it i, in the way I should have thought of it.  So that was what made it stupid.  But somehow I have this feeling, maybe I really did do the whole thing on purpose, or setting something up.  And then, uhm, I don't know, then, then I, I guess what I was wondering is if I then want you to tell me why I was setting it all up, or just what I was doing about that, or uhm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:    Well, if that's the case, it's not clear yet, I think, why.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  Except then, I think of something else that uhm, seems to be very related, but then I, soon's I think it, I'm not sure how.  Uhm, when I was out with FSO today, at one point I had to go by a hotel.  And I imagine i, it's got a lot of residence as well as probably some normal hotel-type business.  And in any case, there was a woman standing in the doorway — and I couldn't tell whether she might live there or not — who looked very poor, and uh, I don't know, maybe somebody who would be a drunk, I couldn't quite tell.  But also she had a bandage over her eye, sort of on the eyebrow, and then a blackened eye. </p>

<p>And wh, what I immediately thought is some man beat her up.  And then, the next thing I thought was, but she must have set it up so he'd beat her up, so then she could come out looking like that, and sort of assume everybody would feel sorry for her.  And so maybe that's why I got mad at MSCZ, because he didn't feel sorry for me.  In fact he made it clear that — at first he did not berate me with it, but he, he very clearly did not agree with what I'd done.  And uh, (Clears throat) so I guess maybe I'm wondering if I played stupid to f—, have people feel sorry for me.  And when they didn't, I got mad.  Or just what, I don't know. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Maybe it's connected with some of the things you were saying last week.  But, uh, we're out of time now.

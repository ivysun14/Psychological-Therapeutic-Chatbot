<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay so now we just do our regular thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you have to put today's date there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it the [DATE], [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what's been happening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well things are fine.  Uh, [LAUGHING] um, I have to retake my medical shelf again because I failed that by one mark so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you're kidding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so it's next Friday.  So I just finished my surgery shelf so that exam was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you feel confident about that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that I felt much better about taking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When was the medicine one done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, Feb.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh they gave me the results a couple of weeks later or so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you think happened there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, probably just didn't do enough questions, I guess.  Maybe just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't finish it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean, I mean in like of terms of my preparation, I guess I didn't do a lot of questions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like it was -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, didn't ask a lot of those questions, which I'm doing now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and also like I mean shelf is the one for everybody.  I mean like everybody barely finishes it so.  Uh, sometimes like towards the end you know, like when I'm reading questions that you know like, reading at a really fast pace or tend to skip a lot of things.  So, I don't know if that happens with everyone or not but that's something which I guess is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, well how's the medicine impact there?  Because um, you know there's a couple of issues.  One issue is whether you should, whether there's any rule for you getting an extended time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because uh, is this going to be an issue on the boards too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I was able to finish the surgery shelf but barely on time.  But I guess you know like, just like two minutes before the time -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But again like, um, maybe I think the best way for me to gauge this, like I talked [NAME OTHER] about it, uh, like the dean for student affairs.  So she also [INAUDIBLE] but she can find out I did good through the whole process of getting extension; because that is such a big hassle; because you have to get tested and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a big deal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a big deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I've had student's do it and, and the testing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is expensive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it may or may not be covered under -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Insurance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly and that's why she said, so she said you know like uh just see how it goes again.  So, I will take it this next Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I mean uh, you know I think that you'll knock this exam off -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But my, my concern is the board exams.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened with the first part one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, part 1 I got passed it, but not with flying colors, like I had an 81 I think.  So like 196, my 2 days at school was 196, 197.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had 2 days of 81, 75 is the passing grade.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It was all right, I mean nothing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not sensational but that's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's the issue.  I have had student's go through the, uh, neuro psych testing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And uh, and get approved for extended times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it something that's out there, if you, you know if you felt uh, that it would be helpful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah I mean that's, I mean, I mean like I was able to finish the step 1, I guess it, it didn't seem that uh, stress.  But the shelves for reason, like every shelf that I've taken, like even psych, it was like I barely even finish on time.  Like it just shelf, I mean the psych 1 was like really hard I mean, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, anyway, but yeah I mean like, uh, even surgery like I wasn't even that confused this time.  But um, I like had like 5 minutes to spare you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what percentage of your grade is, is, is the shelf exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, medicine it's probably like 30%.  Like I did like great on the other part, like my academicals was like uh, a 90.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my I failed the shelves, so it was like 30, I mean stupid.  I can't, like the uh, my clinical part was much better -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So when you were being observed they thought your knowledge was good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you did lousy on the exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and usually it's less than half -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it takes you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] cycle, it's like 50, 45%.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Psych is like a big chunk of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it's hard to, I don't know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And these are the same like everyone across the country gets the same exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's the same shelf.  I mean, I don't know how they do it but everybody takes the normally takes the same shelf.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't know.  It's like 100 questions and you get like 2 hours and 10 minutes.  It's like 130 minutes.  But, I don't know I just find it hard to like finish it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I guess that's the case with everyone.  Like everyone barely finishes it.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, do you try to time medicine so that it's working nicely when you're taking the exam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, now like I'm taking those time tests.  Like I've signed up for the uh, you know these, the [INAUDIBLE] online.  So, when I take a test -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know like a 46 uh, set question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try and see how long it takes.  So, like at least now I'm trying to time myself and do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean is the role taking, I mean certainly your take the Adderall so, so that it's, it's, it's working ideally during that time frame.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, in other words.  How long does it take after you take it for it to be maximally working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would say one hour, one and a half hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how long does it last for maximally?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two to three hours, like two hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you should probably take it an hour before hand?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's what I did for surgery, is took it an hour before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I felt like I was at least able to focus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now have you ever taken more than the 10?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just, oh, at the same time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I always take 1 and then if I need it I take another one.  Like today I took one in the morning and one right before because I'm trying to go back and study so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see, I mean if you took, just theoretically.  If you took 15 at a time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> First of all you should never do something the day of the test differently -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right, exactly, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you wouldn't.  But I'd be curious for example if you took one and half -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you tried that a couple of times -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you felt like it didn't rattle you, it didn't, you know have any negative impact -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you felt you where a little better able to focus.  Whether it be a role for doing something like that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For you know, on an exam day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I can probably try it tomorrow morning anyways and see how it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean, you might do it on, you know several odd days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And see if, if you feel it's too much -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you feel rattly, or you feel uh, counter productive in anyway -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know causes anxiety or palpitations or something like that, then it's out.  But um, it's just something to try -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But short of that I would say yeah to try and time it so that the medicines working.  Makes it easily during the exam and have your, you know maximal benefit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, okay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll try that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, when, when's the make-up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, this coming Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A week from Friday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah a week from Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A week from tomorrow, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, if it where tomorrow I'd be freaking out right now, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, that's a short time frame.  So for this exam it might, it might make more sense just to do what you've been doing -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And just prepare more questions and everything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but it would be an interesting experiment for fu, you know before your next exam to see if there's a role for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, because you know 10 is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So does -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Adderall, the typical dosage, you know might be 20 to 40 a day and, and you right in there, right.  You take -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Twenty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You take 2 or 3 if it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it's a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah sometimes I mean rarely everyday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why like I have so many left over because you've given me like prescription for 3 times a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I said you take it 3 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I only take 2 times so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine, that's fine.  Okay and you just filled the April one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because you, you had like postdate it so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, okay.  That's fine -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you, if I could have another postdated one, I guess that would be better, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I can give you another postdated script so, you still thinking about med and neuro as possible options?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum, yeah everything else has pretty much, [LAUGHING], dwindled down my radiology is probably going down the tank, I think.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why because that's extremely competitive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because it, I mean I was told that you need to honor your medicine and surgery; which is not happening so um, I guess that's not an option.  But I'll still go and speak with the radiology uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Program director and see what she thinks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but those are the two you think you might be interested in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you do neuro yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, uh, I've been doing it the first block of fourth year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so that will give me a chance and then I take my step two -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe after that in August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's my only chance to make up for everything else I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where did you do surgery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, at the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Horrendous I mean, I mean it was just the time that it took because it takes like one hour to get there and you're supposed to show up there at 4:30 in the morning -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you've got to leave the house at like 3:45.  You get up at like 3:15 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four thirty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they make you see like 3 patients and they start rounding at 6:00.  So, it takes you like an hour, hour half to see three patients and write notes and then present it at 6:00.  It was like crazy, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Six weeks, I know that's crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's worse than, what's iron, ironic is I think that's worse than the people who do it here.  You do at [DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean they also show up the same time 4:30, 4:45 but I the thing is this is really close by here, I mean you don't have to drive on [INAUDIBLE].  That is a killer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like you have to drive down -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't remember having to get there that early.  Maybe 5:00, 6:00 I don't know they keep moving it earlier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean the team rounds at 6:00 because the surgery started at 7:30.-</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So they have like 20, 25 patients there to see in like 1 1/2 hours.  So, it's up to you, I mean you can come in at 5 or generally I would be there by 4:40 uh, because it takes me like at least, an hour 2 to see 3 patients and write the notes and have everything ready so yeah, it was crazy, 6 weeks was just.  I didn't enjoy it at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus the surgery was fine it was like and then like 7:30 surgery started.  Like sometimes they would keep you in the OR, which I found probably should go and speak to, uh, [INAUDIBLE] social director, it's like our shelf for this test on is so different from what they make us do there.  They're just sitting in the OR for like 8 hours.  Okay, once you've seen enough appendectomies and, and [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's only so much to do there, you're just pretty much assisting and like retracting and so I didn't see what the learning was there and you know like the test is all geared on the preop risks, the postop risks.  I'm like and you get no exposure there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I spent a lot of time pulling back on a retractor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean that's all you're doing.  For, and especially, the one procedure I hated was the thyroidectomy, because the thyroid, I mean like retracting the muscles there, the uh, [INAUDIBLE] it was like crazy.  I mean I get literally exhausted after the three hour session.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  I'll bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I mean it was like crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I, I never seen that surgery before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like so those are the three main ones there.  The thyroidectomy, [INAUDIBLE] and appendectomies, everyone was getting those so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a hernia repair was the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they do laparoscopic or regular uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the appendectomy or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it's, it's like a surgeon for us because the papers don't make uh, or give one or the other one preference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, just uh, generally if it's a kid.  They try and do it laparoscopically because most of the kids where having indirect inguinal hernia, hiatal hernia other side too.  So, laparoscopically you can see it and you know do it at the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, but it's crazy, I mean like it's a really different [INAUDIBLE].  This is part of it or not, but um, we had this guy come in with like a ventral hernia.  So the ventral hernia they need water for some reason laparoscopically.  Okay, fine, if you do it with the open incision it's done in like one hour.  This thing because you needed to put a mesh underneath it so can you imagine like, [LAUGHING], take a mesh so the surgeon had to role it, role the whole mesh with uh, threads and the staples on each side, each four ends, push it in unfold the mesh and then push it up laparoscopically.  It took one and half hours extra just for that procedure and there's no additional uh, like benefits.  So I was like it's just a waste of time and waste of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He didn't want, want the scar.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other dollars.  What's that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He didn't want the scar.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I mean the scars not that big anyway.  Laparoscopically you're going in like, you're making 4 holes anyway.  One on the umbilicus and one here and one here or so but the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old was the person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifty-five or something like that, I was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was like you should have seen the much time the surgeon spent.  She had this process down, it was nice nice.  That it was like, it was basically if you have a piece of paper and how do you curl that push it in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then uncurl and pull it out with the right [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It seems to me that the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is crazy, it's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It just seems that there would be so much more you're operating like blind, it seems like it would be easier to do the surgery.  You know they didn't have laparoscopic when I did that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I mean, don't get me wrong.  For uh, as a cholecystectomy I would say laparoscopically is the best because what they do was once they make the incision they put in carbon dioxide so that inflates it.  So they can actually get a really good picture, like a regular picture.  It's good for something's but you have uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but isn't there uh, 1 out of 100 they cut the common bowel duct and it's a disaster.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah, I mean that is something.  Oh it's very [INAUDIBLE], which is because the, they have these they call it a [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.  So, you have the uh, cystic duct and cystic artery of the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, since they are all covered by the uh, peritoneum it's hard to see so you have to be very careful when you do it and you don't uh, clip it so that was one issue and like everybody in there, because everybody was an intern doing it.  They would uh, [INAUDIBLE] duct so the bile would be everywhere -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ewe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They would flush it and it was like, oh so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was a fun experience, [INAUDIBLE] I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see [INAUDIBLE] and doing five years of cellular [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well some people love it but I mean fortunately I guess but yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just not my cup of tea I mean it's like, and the amount of stress that it create.  Like some of the surgeons are so rude.  It's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my God when -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Unbelievable like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They make you feel like crap, I mean like you have been doing this for the last 30 years.  I mean like how do you expect me, like a third year student doing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I did surgery at [DEIDENTIFIED] my first rotation and I had this other guy, who I didn't know well at the time, another classmate.  We were scared out of our minds.  First of all we had the infamous attending who terrorize all the medical students and then we had this crazy Texan uh, um, resident who is this older, he wasn't you know like a typically like 30 year old guy he was like somewhat older like 40 something year old guy from Texas like, like a crazy guy and I remember the first time on call it was a woman who was in a motor vehicle accident.  She was fine, but we go down there he says, "Why don't you get a blood gas on her?"  And I'd never even seen it done.  I said, "Do think that's a good idea?"  And he said, "Just do it."  I'm like freaking out, you know and then months later, like at the end of the year uh, I was in an ER and he would super, you know he was there was with one of my classmates and you know a guy was screaming, the patient was screaming hysterical and, and combative and he says to the medical student, "Why don't you put in the Foley?"  [LAUGHING].  He was just, he would just torture the medical students.  We were scared out of our minds, for, for the whole you know, whatever six weeks or eight weeks.  We were just scared out of our minds, it was crazy, it was crazy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess, I mean there are some surgeons who are very good, like there was one surgeon, you know like because I wasn't able to talk, you know tieing the square knot, they have these weird knots and all these things.  So, she like you know held the retractor, she made me do it everything, so she was exceptionally good, very patient and like made me, and that gave me a lot of confidence.  Then there were others who were just, uh put you down.  Like how's that, what's up with, [INAUDIBLE] I'm like here to learn.  I'm not here to be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, it's just.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The one saving grace when I did it was we had a chief resident who was interested in teaching and he switched places with us sometimes so we could see what's going on, you know, made it pleasant.  You know but that attending and that resident were you know, it was crazy, absolutely crazy.  All right so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So does Adderall come in like uh 15 mg or would I have to cut the medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it would make more sense just to keep the 10s -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you could take 1 1/2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not, I'm not, I'm not pushing that idea.  I think there's a good possibility, it'll, you know won't be anymore helpful and you'll be jittery or anxious -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So maybe after the exam I could try it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, try, no on some off time or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know when it's not going to hinder you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you might try it once and say, "This is totally wrong and that's that."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, if you found that you really do feel a little uh, uh, improve, you know further improvement and benefit -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you felt it would help you on, you know on critical occasions when you have to an ostomy or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or uh, like a written exam.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, ostomy is coming up 9:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, then there might be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A role.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I, it might be that it's just, it does nothing further or, or it actually hinders things so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just something to try I think.  You know I just felt bad that you didn't, you know you had so much time pressure because you know, that could have been the difference between passing and failing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there was just one mark error.  I remember there were like three or four questions I just over thought it and I just put the wrong thing and so, I don't understand.  I'm bothered to take the whole thing again -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because the medicine shelf is pretty much like taking the step two, [LAUGHING], because it's everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So why don't I put the [DATE] on it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you planning to stay in this area?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.  I mean if it's internal med, I'd probably do it here at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No she is fun but, you like just feeding her and all the time thinking about the next step and because now she's like [AGE] and like she moves around.  So you just kind of leave her on the bed and just go because you know, you careful all the time.</p>

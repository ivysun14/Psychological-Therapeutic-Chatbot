<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Coughing and clearing throat) Fall allergies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But your nose looks a little red.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm under the weather again a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you have West Nile?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't—hope not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They say that 98 percent of the people who have it don't know they have it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That it's just like a cold.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you're in fairly good shape, young and healthy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm (chuckling), keep talking (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Virile (other chuckling). Oh Lord.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's from all those like Pilates classes and organic foods and you know there are things that I apparently [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . partake in. [0:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's obvious (ph) because I have been having practice on Monday and Tuesday, and it's like the rest of the week [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I've got to try and—and I've switched and I've been doing these exercises, these Hindu squats and Hindu push-ups, and the guy who showed them to me suggested I do them in sets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did them in sets yesterday and hurt myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my quads were killing me all the day long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean kind of hurt in a good way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like—oh, okay, like you knew what you were doing so just like you were really sore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got ya, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just really sore. Not that bad this morning but (coughing).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know with a Hindu squat inaudible at 00:01:42], right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was given these on the turnpike in the little food court.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a wonder that I can [inaudible] (breathy sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the push-up, you need to close your legs this much. [0:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you sort of like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you should come up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go like that, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They seem to be working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know really some muscle growth and I find that I'm not as sore [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . as they had been you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just feel better altogether.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well good. Like Herbies (ph) do, a kind of Herbies?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, no, [so as a child] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, it's another exercise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Could you just show me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure (clearing throat). You start like this and like this, that's one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those look intense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're already worn out (both chuckling). I don't know if my landlord would appreciate me jumping up and down on his floor. [0:03:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Clearing throat) But there's some [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're really good for cardio, so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is some school of thought that those are the only two exercises you need to do, is the Hindu push-up [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and the Hindu squat, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . that it kind of covers everything. Though I don't know how you get much of a bicep workout.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I can imagine doing those with pull-ups.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, yeah, and that's—the guy who showed them to me, he does pull-ups.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what he does is he takes a deck of cards and he pulls them out and just randomly does the number that's on the [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . cards for each exercise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then it's each exercise is given a suit or something like that and he [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . effectively (ph) goes through the deck of cards to do a workout.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See it's all too, too much for me. I'm trying to just squeeze it in and get it done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Better than nothing. [0:04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Now that's all pretty common.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But especially when fall leave is over I'm going to need to do something to keep me in shape, do through the winter, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . which would help in the spring. I might even find out maybe if I go off the Nortriptyline I'll lose some weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've just been eating non-stop. I mean most of it's you know vegetables and whatnot but still [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . eating a lot. So I need to pick up not Ian but Lucille from daycare [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . on Wednesday. And I've yet to pick her up from daycare so it's been months, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . a long time since I've picked her up. And, um, she got upset and cried for her momma as I took her out the door. She's crying, like (clearing throat) going "momma, momma, momma" and I put her in the car and she stood up in her car seat and started going "no, no, no". [0:05:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Crying (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I dropped her down and strapped her in. And during part of the ride she stopped crying and I kind of put my hand back for a high-five and she wouldn't give it to me. And I said "rub palms (ph)" so she gives me the palms.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, so it seemed like everything was okay. And then when we get back to the house and Jess wasn't there and she just stood in one place and cried "momma, momma" for like ten minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like a first pickup from daycare in a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just wondering whether, you know because Ian was very, had a lot of you know separation anxiety and I'm wondering if it's just normal or something that Jess's done that has caused this you know, (pause) and part of it is my lack of interaction. [0:06:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound really striking to me. I mean I don't specialize in that age pretty fairly, but it, you know you haven't fit this totally. I mean you haven't picked her up from daycare, private daycare or daycare like for a few months, and you know you're with her during the week, but not as tonic (ph), is my impression. And [I'm putting this down] (ph), off the wall, to me, I'm not trying to [take haste] (ph) during the early ride or anything right, right, just from Lucille's response, which I'm concerning. [0:07:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like going over Sunday [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's difficult, you know it's hard to [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . infer, but not worrisome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I went over Sunday right as she woke up from her nap and she wanted nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I went back after the football game and she was fine you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Come and sit down next to me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know well [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . I don't think [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . [not much more] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . that's unusual. I mean you're going to do a really big impression evidently (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because apparently she says my name all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you said. [0:07:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know what "all the time" means but (long pause), so. It's Friday, I got to go on the registry. And, uh, it's like, uh, (clearing throat) 1986, for some reason they have those files in storage, so you have to order them for the next day. And I ordered two of them and should've realized that there was a third. So now I got to go check the two because you've got to check them out in five days or they cut you off. Then I got to order the third and go back Monday. And I'm just not getting up in the morning and going, you know which is making my days unproductive, you know as far as driving up or just [overlapping voices] [0:08:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . not getting a whole day of work done. [And even] (ph) you know I've got the pass (ph) game on Sunday, so I'm going to wake up you know hung over on Monday and I know I'm not going to get up and go in early, and just got like little things to do. And I don't know I'm just (long pause), I'm tired of what I do. I got a new title order (ph) and I said it came in a little more regular but what can I do. [0:09:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got this title problem. I helped this guy buy a condo and, um, there's an affidavit you file for estate taxes, to release the estate lien, and it didn't say state, it only said federal. So now I have to go and either hope—I've got to check the probate file, hopefully they got an estate tax closing letter from the DOR in the file, or I've got to find this woman and get her to execute another estate tax, and this was all done six years ago so it's kind of a pain in the ass. [0:10:02]</p>

<p>I wrote the title insurance policy, so there's a chance that they would accept you know an indemnification for me to be here with the company, but I've still got to make the effort to find this woman. At least there's a law firm involved that did the probate that I can at least contact them and see if they were, you know have been in contact with [inaudible at 00:10:26] with this woman, (clearing throat) but still it's just a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something I'm technically getting paid for but something I just, that I fucked up myself. It's my own fault you know. You know I've always wondered how much of this stuff is lying out there, you know the little mistakes I've made that are you know (pause) not easy to fix. [0:10:55]</p>

<p>And I need to take issue because the statute says only—they never change. This is what happened was, is the state estate tax was coupled with the federal estate tax. So the state's estate tax was a million, so you would tax on the first million, and then federal was everything over a million. And then Bush came in, in 2003, and changed it and moved the federal up higher and higher.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they were no longer coupled, they were decoupled [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . in 2003.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you might pay federal on two million and a half and the state starting at a million.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, um, you know then when that, at one point, was all the way up to five million in 2009, for 2010 and '11, and then one year there was no estate tax. Um, so, at that point, it started putting state, in the wording, that state and federal, and you just say you know "the estate does not require state or federal estate tax filing". [0:12:02]</p>

<p>But the statute that allows you to do this affidavit has never changed, it just says federal, it doesn't say state, it's just a practiced standard that's changed. So it's like you know theoretically I'm in compliance but (ph) the statue [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . is not in compliance [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Not with the practice] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . with the title standard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we always write the title standards and do the purchase and sale agreements [inaudible at 00:12:31] so. I tried arguing but to no avail. And I (loud breath) I got to go in, and now maybe I'll be able to do it today, but I got to go in to the city and check the probate file. But at least I can check from the docket, to [see if it is done] (ph), an estate tax closing letter was filed. So you know but I've still got to go in and get the attorney information and her information and hope she's alive and that inaudible] [0:13:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . is cooperative; people are not cooperative about things you know. And then I got to get this off by the middle of October, so. And then I've got to explain it to my client how it's [inaudible], who's you know kind of a friend [inaudible] so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is it actually going to cost your client anything? I mean it certainly makes more work and it's a pain in the ass for you with all the paperwork but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well theoretically they could not accept the owner's policy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's been six years, so after ten years they go away on their own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the buyer would be crazy not to move forward with or at least some [overlapping voices] [0:14:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . indemnification on that there were estate taxes that it would be covered, by myself or the title company you know, and, um, you know just wait out the ten years when it's gone. So there's not a lot of real risk there. If there had been some estate taxes they probably would've shown up by now but you never know. So but the nice thing is, is I was able to, uh, (clearing throat) get in some language making his purchase subject to his sale. So if this sale falls apart he gets out of his purchase. And, um, but I'm given (ph) an extra 30 days, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . which will help get this document according to the purchase and sale agreement [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . right (ph). So I don't know. There's some more stuff I got to do in [0:15:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . my assessment damages hearing on Thursday, that she wants to continue, but she asked me (sighing) [for her] (ph) to assent to it, and I know my clients don't want me to assent to it so I said "no". So I know she's going to file this thing at the last second but I've got to be prepared and ready to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like now I've got to deal with this thing you know, even though I know it's most likely not going to happen. The clients are going to be pissed off and just (pause), it's like two separate worlds you know. At closings they're just, they're happy you know getting a good rate, for the [guy that's] (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . going to buy a house. And then this other shit that should (ph) just never happened, they're not satisfied because you can't make people roll (ph), you can't do it you know [inaudible] [0:16:04]</p>

<p>These cases you hear of people making money, millions of dollars, and you know that you infer (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . [inaudible] (pause) and I guess there's a point where I ought to get used to it but I haven't gotten used to it yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm exhausted. I don't feeling like doing anything today. [Silence from [00:16:35] to [00:17:07]—and clearing throat] </p>

<p>I'm wondering when I'm going to find a woman. I know if I did one of these online things that (pause) I would find women unnecessarily (ph), uh, so I'm not having good luck. I can't afford to go on multiple dates to try and find the right person you know. I would imagine that it would be [hard for me to date with a date] (ph). [Voice getting lower and lower].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can barely excuse (ph) myself [much longer] (ph) to go to some restaurant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have to shower and shave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Silence from [00:17:47] to [00:17:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's [an area] (ph) that I pray (ph) for my business to pick up. [0:18:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [Silence from [00:18:02] to [00:18:15] How "having to finance a romance", like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess that's true. [Silence from [00:18:20] to [00:18:34] and sighing] And then just theoretically I could stumble upon something or someone but I'd still have to take them out at least once, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . one time. [Silence from [00:18:45] to [00:18:53] And I'm no great catch or anything like that you know let's face it. [0:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you always sell yourself short? [Silence from [00:19:02] to [00:19:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You don't know] (ph)? [Silence from [00:19:10] to [00:19:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be nice if I could find someone who plays Ultimate and that way they would, you know wouldn't care that I play and you know they'd even have their own [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and there's not many people my age.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [On a team] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Women you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . tend to drop out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas the men, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . well you have a family and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . they have babies you know. Men will kind of drop out for a few years but they come back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't drop out but separated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. [Silence from [00:19:52] to [00:20:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I ever tell you about the [sweet bunch] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess this is just like you can [see sound and not the shape and how else you could put it but in the fall] (ph). [Silence from [00:20:29] to [00:21:27] Anything you want to talk about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever's on your mind. I guess it does sound like things are less kind of dire than they were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, to some degree, yeah. [0:21:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it sounds like your feeling rather good but you have a little more breathing room than you had?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I signed my tenants up for another year, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . even though the new buyer really did not like that, and, um, (pause) so I have that much money coming in, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . always (ph) [inaudible at 00:22:41] but you know. And, um, (pause) work's not too bad. And then I got this chunk of money coming in from an inheritance, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . which I wish it would come so I could pay some money to my landlord, because instead [overlapping voices] [0:23:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . of paying, the money I got for August I paid off my car insurance. And, um, I've got estimated taxes due. These taxes are killing me because somebody from the IRS or the post office, which I haven't opened, so the acceptance was rejected, a rejection of the offer and compromise. I don't know what, um, what I do to get rejected but. It may end up going, go to 200 dollars in penalties for the partnership because we were involuntarily dissolved years ago for not paying our annual fees. [0:24:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, you're supposed to file your final return within two and a half months of being dissolved and, if not, it's 500 penalty for the state and 1,000 for the federal. And it's only something that they've started paying attention to recently, so it may happen and it may not happen. But you know they made me go back and pay 500 bucks for each year that I was supposed to file an annual report and clean it all up [on the spot] (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . you know, it's just there's always something hanging over my head that, uh, [just to kind of deal with] (ph). [Silence from [00:24:51] to [00:25:18] and clearing throat] I mean the DOR is somewhat manageable to ask, you know honor (ph); it's 315 total so half of 315, 157 bucks and that's manageable. And what we had with the IRS is 435, so that's another 217.50, which makes it a little unmanageable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have to pay my student loan because I haven't been paying it (ph). One of them is only (ph) paid off; I only owe like 1,000 bucks on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could pay that off just to stop them from calling (pause), but I just send them a little bit of money. [Silence from [00:26:05] to [00:26:22] In October, if I do have these closing, I will make a nice amount of money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like between the purchase and the sale, probably about 4,000 dollars, [a bunch] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's if I can even put away a few hundred for estimated taxes in January and I don't know. [Silence from [00:26:49] to [00:29:19] (Sighing) One thing I really wish I could do is get rid of my gut. I think it would make everything a lot easier for me, as far as practice and my back would hurt less. I won't feel guilty about splurging. It's like I don't eat all day long and then I just come home and you know it's mostly vegetables, maybe a sandwich, but I eat a lot. [0:30:02]</p>

<p>Though I did go to the shop and get a bologna sandwich with chips last night, I forgot about that, and a Sprite. If you add it all up though you know it's probably I'm not eating probably more than a day's worth of calories, I'm just eating it all at once.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [Silence from [00:30:40] to [00:31:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty soon Ian is going to start swimming and I'm hoping that starts but I have to take him every Tuesday, on Tuesday night (ph). Even though I never, I used to, where I'd go into the office and I'd just, and if I had nothing to do at night I'd just work as late as I could because it saved time. I can't do it anymore. It's like two or three o'clock I got to leave the office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what it is, just—and then there are times I—like last night I went home and I did work. You know it's not as if I left the office and I said "well I'll do work at home", [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . which I did do some of what I needed to do. But, um, I know I can't stay in the office anymore. Maybe it's boring because there's no people there, just me; before I had people. [Silence from [00:32:13] to [00:32:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine it should get to the point where you're kind of done working, like people don't have any [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's like I'm not even getting into the office till like 11 or 12 [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . you know and so it's not like I'm there for a long time now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. [0:33:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's getting worse with trends (ph) and you know it's just—and maybe it's that, that I feel like I have a lot of work to do but I really don't have a lot of work to do or I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine there's sort of like a gap in the tame (ph) thing. Like if you're enjoying yourself in other places, everything's going well and there's money coming in, or you know practice is going well, whatever it is, and things are good. And then you know you feel like you have taken all this like you know fuel like out of your tank, and you can get to work and pay attention and do stuff, or take care of the kids or you know, like you can kind of spend it that way or you focus on [inaudible] in those ways. But then it gets to the point where you tend to say "ghee, here's what I've done". [0:34:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but it doesn't seem like I really ever have anything you know. It's like I'm [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Closing down] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . closing and I absolutely have to do it you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very busy (phone ringing); those are all words with friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and I think you're nice to people then you're going to finally have money coming in. Maybe you don't have anything to feel good on any of those. I always have thought that you'd needed to kind of growing (ph) something. [Silence from [00:35:15] to [00:35:23]</p>

<p>When you feel worth it's usually in terms of having kind of a last pit stop coming in and more in demand. And then you feel better, it tends in part, the next time you do it the opposite, knowing like there's more coming in or more that's sort of sustaining (ph), nurturing, and [fewer demands] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Taking Ian to a game, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I didn't even bother asking him. Like oh it's 7:30 at night, you know she's going to say "no", but she actually forwarded the e-mail to me and said [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . "You guys should go." [0:36:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean when he stays over, he stays up till ten o'clock anyway, nine, ten anyway you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you might as well go to the game.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He had a lot of fun at the last one didn't he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He hasn't been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I thought you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you had a lot of fun and [you still kept going] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But we got a deal on the tickets. They were only like 16 bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, I don't know exactly (clearing throat) what section we're in but they're probably decent seats and, if not, we can go stand in the forward, which is behind the goal; it's where people stand up and go crazy. We'll see what he wants to do. You know it's soccer so everybody wears their scarf. That's the big thing in soccer is people have a scarf for their team.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and so they have these scarves.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know how much they cost but I have a feeling I'm going to end up buying one for him. [0:37:01]</p>

<p>You know like in Europe, they'll just have like the striped colors of their team, and that's how the hooligans know who to beat up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (slight chuckle). [Silence from [00:37:18] to [00:37:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm getting tired of doing all these title exam patients (ph) you know, just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I shouldn't be complaining because it's like they're, you know it's a constant source of [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . income and work. But for the amount of time I put into them and the amount of money I make on them you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, yeah, there is consideration (ph). [Silence from [00:38:05] to [00:38:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That one with the probates is, they've had the deadline up today but they gave it to me like you know on the fourth. I guess ten days is long enough but they're not getting it today. [0:39:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should send an e-mail (pause) to explain my ineptitude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm (ph). We'll need to stop for now and [somehow figure] (ph) out your time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, yes, (pause) and actually 50 minutes Thursday (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wednesday. [At least it's not Monday] (ph). [See ya] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a little sick, again, so I won't [be able to take a cab] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. [0:39:48]</p>

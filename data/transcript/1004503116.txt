<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got nothing done in my research project all week. My advisor expects an update tomorrow and I got nothing. And I'm not done with my homework assignment either, although I worked on them, worked on the homework at least yesterday and today and only got two more problems to do. But I'm still just incredibly angry at myself and frustrated that I didn't make better use of my time this week. Just not only do I need to send updates to my advisor but I need to publish a paper or at least have something in the pipeline before I can get my thesis closer since my advisor said she didn't want me to send my thesis until I had something publishable, even though that's not technically a requirement of the program. So I have this paper deadline, March 15th. I really should be scrambling to get my paper together but I haven't yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that when the thesis is due?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's the publication submission deadline for the journal I'm submitting to. The thesis isn't actually due until late April but still I should be scrambling, yes, and I'm not. I'm just screwing around this, that and the other. Some of it is stuff that legitimately has to be squeezed in at some point, like job hunting, but some of it is just crap, so ridiculous. So there's this game I'm playing, and the developers of the game is [inaudible at 00:01:54]. They're going to be changing up a lot of the way the mechanics work in mid-March. And so somehow I got into my head that I need to max out all of the possible extreme plans, get the highest level possible, get all the achievements before they do that so that I can have more resources when they change how all the mechanics work, which is completely dumb because it's just a game and the thesis... But I've been spending a lot of time on that which for the most part I don't even enjoy because the game has gotten boring to me but it's almost like a compulsion... [00:02:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you do in the game?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to keep doing all these repetitive tasks to - it's a non-combat game. It's basically a game about capitalism and domination of the marketplace. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't sound like combat? But, yes, I know what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so what I've been doing basically is trying to amass a hoard of ten million of the in-game currency but the best way to do that right now and of course it's got some interesting economic mechanics in there, a pseudo free market. And so the way you gain resources is by selling things that other players want but don't want to collect themselves. And there are various ways to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are you doing, spending your time doing when you're spending your time playing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wandering the world and collecting resources that are in out of the way places where other players don't want to go to because it requires too many skills that they don't have to access those parts of the game world. It's really repetitive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it clear what actually appeals to you about the game? [00:04:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are badges for collecting X-thousand of this resources or performing this action X-thousand times and I really, really like it when I earn one of those achievement badges. And I even on some level understand the neural chemistry of what's going on. There's this reward that is offered not at a predictable time interval but every so often I'll get this - there's a graphic flashes on the screen and a change in the music and this, that, and the other and it's unpredictable because there's no counter that the player can access to see how far along they've progressed towards winning these badges. So it's totally an unpredictable reward [inaudible at 00:05:09] it's all of that. And I know this and I don't actually enjoy playing the game but I still want to earn all the badges available in the game. It's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're actually quite disciplined in the way you go about playing the game that you're willing to do boring, repetitive things that other people aren't willing to do in order to - I mean this is the way you were supposed to be able to do school, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, except school isn't boring or repetitive. Instead it's actually enjoyable. Some of it is, but not all of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, sure. You told me that too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is why I don't own a Wii or a PlayStation because I'd never do anything except play games. It's terrible. So yes, there's that. Yes. Also yesterday between the time I left here and the time of my interview, I had three different conversations with three different groups of people about sexism in the tech world and how women can't be scientists. It was awesome. Best thing right before an interview for a tech position.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:06:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does sound like sort of a gender (ph) thing, sexism and contact. Do you mean like - well what was depressing about the conversation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so one was a conversation with a friend of mine who works in tech and how - and she was just having a really rough day with a male vendor she was dealing with just treating her completely disrespectfully and ignoring her and talking to her male co-workers and she was venting to me. Another was an e-mail that got sent to a mailing list I'm on that's administered by the Department at Harvard. It's the Jobs List and simply it's where if you're looking for a tech founder, co-founder for your start-up or if you're looking to retire, or if you need a tutor, it's a catch-all for jobs, freelance, et cetera. And there was this one job posting that was just horribly sexist. It was a bad job posting in a dozen different ways. And even apart from the sexism no one with any sense whatever would ever go work for this company. But one of the things was About you, you are a tech god; you're a rock star - all of the usual crap that people who don't know anything about diplomacy say - you might even be female; I would be very surprised if you are but encourage you to apply anyway. I was just like seriously? [00:08:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seriously? So a lot of my friends are on this mailing list also and we're all on a chat server maintained by Harvard, a bunch of us are alums. And so there's a wide ranging discussion involving 30 people on Skype, that's the name of our chat system, about dissecting this, which was - it was a good conversation but still not pleasant to print that right in my inbox. The third thing was a friend of mine who's a poet actually made a blog presumation (ph) - I shouldn't have been reading blogs before my interview but anyway. She made a blog pres about how she was a math whiz kid as a child and her parents had her studying above her grade level at home and by the time she was in sixth form she was studying high school level math.</p>

<p>And then she had a horribly sexist math teacher who would repeatedly say in class that science has proven that girls don't have the same aptitude for math and science that boys have, even though she was the head of the class. So yes, it was just enormously frustrating and I'm sure you're familiar with stereotypes or read some of the research that's been done around that. So knowing that, because I also read some articles about stereotypes [inaudible at 00:09:35] reason for the thesis, I went to the Ada Lovelace web page and read a bunch of stories about women in industry before my interview but then still...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So I don't know how well the interview went. It's kind of frustrating because the guy said he's not the hiring manager. His job was just to figure out which hiring manager he should give my resume to, figuring out which groups in the company I would be a good fit for. And that they weren't going to send out rejection letters and he couldn't give me a timeframe for when the various hiring managers would act on the resumes he gives to them, so fuck if I know. [00:10:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was this then - I see. So he was going to simply farm your resume out to one or more groups, the managers of which either will or won't get back to you in some indeterminate period of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. See I don't think the interview went terribly but I was totally unprepared for when told about a situation where it turned out that your approach to a technical problem was wrong and you had to re-evaluate. And I wasn't - I don't know. I was just generally not prepared for standard entry questions. It's been a while and I didn't do any mock interviews beforehand, which in hindsight was kind of dumb. I was also expecting a technical interview and this wasn't a technical interview. It was a tell-me-about-yourself interview, which I'm much more soft. So yes, I don't know how it went.</p>

<p>And I've got a full interview with the [inaudible], still in the process of being scheduled but probably sometime next week. And I'm not even sure I want to work for them because the job is primarily software and I want to do hardware except that I've also been - I have a growing interest in linear systems theory and control systems and imaging and [inaudible at 00:11:56] ballistic problems over the last two years and they do a lot of that but it's all in code, not hardware and I don't know. I don't think I'm smart enough to work for them because they're awesome and... [00:12:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're awesome?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are awesome. They make SMARTAB. They do some really cool stuff taking some theoretical results or some results that various academics haven't been able to implement and actually being able to implement them in a computationally efficient feasible way so that people can use them. They do cool work. And SMARTAB is a pretty cool piece of technology.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I don't know it. I've seen it and probably use it but I don't know it myself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is a fantastically powerful tool for numerical computations. So yes, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they do any hardware anywhere in the company or is it mostly all software?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all software. I really want to get a job at the Laboratory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They exclusively do prototyping and proof of concept so there's none of the horrible, boring, we're going to repeat the same calculations a zillion times on new data sets without changing the design that I had at my last job. You're always working on something new. Turnaround on projects is relatively fast and some of the projects have a three to five year timeline, which is not super fast but it's still - you get to work on new things every couple of years, which is nice. When I was at Celluon there were some people who had been working on the same thing for 20 years and that's terrifyingly depressing to me. [00:14:46]</p>

<p>They're also affiliated with Harvard, which means that the Lab employees are Harvard employees, which means you get to take a free class at Harvard every semester for professional development. If I decided I didn't want to do a Ph.D. they'd let me draw 85 percent of my salary while I was in school. They have a lot of really nice...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet the benefits there are awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The benefits are unbelievable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And once you're there, once they've hired you, you're in forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. They still got pensions for God's sake. Who does that anymore? And they do a lot of really, really interesting work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In mostly defense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. They do not do any weapons related work. And so they do a lot of sensor work, which you can have ethical arguments about where is the line between offensive and defensive with sensors. If your sensors are going to be mounted on a missile that's not built and you're designing them for the purpose of being mounted onto a missile, does it really matter that you're not designing the warhead? But they also do a lot of stuff that gets spun off into civilian applications in addition to military applications. They are a Federally-funded center. All of their funding comes from DOD.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know that. [00:16:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. All of their funding comes from the U.S. Government through DOD, pretty much. But I mean they made the really awesome imager for the Observatory, which thanks to various international regulations even scientific research biologic life has findings in military programs. God I can't believe I said that. But yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, really cool stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other places that at least at this stage of things you'd be excited to work at?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm waiting to hear back from this other place as to whether they're going to interview me. I'd be super excited to work for them. They're another research lab. They at least independently just got appointed. So there's that. If I could get a job with these devices that would be fantastic. It just seems really, really cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do they do in there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't make full CPUs but they make integrated circuits [inaudible] that you then use to build other electronics with. So for example they made the accelerometer that made the [inaudible] (ph) possible. [00:18:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You know, I told some people that and they're like so what, it's a remote control. I'm like but you don't understand. The micro accelerometer is there and that took a decade of research and design. They've been working on that since the early 90s, more than a decade, to get that to work. It's amazing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. What makes it so hard?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's an accelerometer and most accelerometers work on changes in pressure. As you move the thing there's usually a weighting mechanism of some sort and springs and some sensor to calculator how much force is being applied to each of the springs. And then the change in the forces off the different springs tells you what direction you're moving in and how fast. Doing that on a microchip scale with micro mechanical components...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the computer chip is on the scale of a few micrometers in size. It's utterly amazing that they got that to work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So these accelerometers, like the ones in phones now work similarly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Of course your accelerometer in your phone doesn't have to have anywhere near the precision of the accelerometer in a Wii. Accelerometer in a phone or in a trump block stack counter thing in a car GPS telling you how fast you're going, I don't know if GPS units have accelerometers; they just sit there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You just have to have a rough idea, whereas for the Wii you need very forming grains because you're controlling it. A high-resolution character and skin and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you've got to know whether you jumped over the logger pin or not. What fun [inaudible at 00:20:15]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So [inaudible at 00:20:23] excited turned out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one of the reasons that it's important is you wondered if you'd actually like doing this kind of work. And it seems to me this and other evidence indicates yes. I mean, not that you'll get stuck, not that you won't be miserable sometimes, not that you'll want to beat the shit out of yourself sometimes, I know. But I don't know. You certainly sounded excited about certain aspects of it when you were talking about it to me. I mean in a way that doesn't sound like it's just about pleasing somebody else. It sounds like it's just genuinely enthusiastic. Which is good I think. Are those places recognizing that they're always opening some - they're big enough, they're always opening up some place and you just kind of grab your stuff and wait and see or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know about the devices. I know [inaudible] is aggressively hiring right now. They had recruiters at the career fair last week. I haven't seen [inaudible] at the career fairs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't say the buzzword?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it was somebody in the wrong office. All right. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: These things happen. I don't know about [inaudible]. I applied for them twice before and got rejected both times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else is coming to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm terrified that I'll start a job sometime over the summer and I'll hit another depressive episode and be completely useless and dysfunctional for some span of time and I will get fired or be put on a performance improvement plan or something that will just sour the whole environment for me. I tend to house this one-strike-and-you're-out mentality that if I ever disappoint someone even once or mess up even in a small way that's it, you're done; reputation is shot. This person will never want to work with you ever again. Never write you a letter of recommendation; you might as well just give up and quit. Certainly my dad had that but in the opposite direction. If someone at his workplace irritated him even once, he would just stew over it and become increasingly bitter until he couldn't take it anymore and he'd quit, which is why we moved around so much when I was a kid. I don't know if I told you but I lived in 12 different houses by the time I was 18.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, you said it was a lot but I didn't think it was that many. [00:24:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, a lot. He never got fired, that's the thing. He would just get pissed off and quit and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was this about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In one case it was the Director that gave a senior doctor in his department more vacation hours and gave him better on-call hours. And my Dad got crappy on-call hours. I was like this is his first year in the department. When it's your first year you always get the shitty on-call hours. Another time it was one of his colleagues came to work hung over and Dad thought he should've been fired and instead he just had a disciplinary note put in his file. And clearly this department doesn't care about the well-being of patients because they didn't fire this drunkard and I'm just done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So relatively minor stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Another time...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess all - go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another time it was, oh God. There was this doctor - I can even remember his name - who made some comment once about how Asians were taking over the department. And it was a really crappy racist comment to make but Dad quit the job over that. If I quit my job every time I heard a crappy racist or sexist remark, I wouldn't have a job ever. Ever. So yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it was also over things that it sounds like potentially felt like insults.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, perceived insults.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God, his most recent job that he quit; he was at that job for three months. That's why he quit and it was because he was hired, it was the summer. He started his job on July 1st and the one IT guy who supported his department had taken the 1st and the 2nd off for the long weekend. And his computer wasn't set up when he got there and it was something like his first day of work was a Friday and it was July 4th weekend and he wasn't going to get a computer or his security badge until Tuesday, when everyone came back from the long weekend. And he just threw a temper tantrum about how this department is so poorly run and everyone is incompetent and nothing is ready and why did they bother hiring me. And of course that pissed off everyone who was at work that day.</p>

<p>And then it was he yelled at one of his residents and made her cry because, I mean she screwed up instructions to a patient. She gave the patient the wrong instructions, which is bad and should be corrected obviously. But, he made her cry. A couple of weeks later, his secretary was slow on making copies for him and he bad mouthed her to another doctor, saying she's so slow and stupid and she moves like a whale or something. It was just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and so of course everyone started acting out in whatever ways their jobs would allow them. Like, technicians would deliver lab results at the last possible minute before they would've been reprimanded by their supervisors; nurses gave him just the barest attention; the other secretaries would delay his paperwork, and so he quit. I just - and I definitely, I don't think I'm as abusive and jerkish to my coworkers as my dad is and I certainly - when I'm the one on the receiving end of some kind of disagreement doesn't tell me I want to quit. But if I feel like I've let anyone down or disappointed them, there's this instinct of now I need to find a new job, oh no. [00:28:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and my impression is that you don't feel identified with him in this way, you feel like sort of you're on the other side of it, like potentially he's your co-worker.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But a lot of the behavior of not sticking it through and bailing and thinking of leaving a job after a short span of time as being an okay thing to do, that's a similarity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is that because - is it preemptive? In other words is that because it gets intolerable for you to feel like you're going - like you've fucked up forever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where does that come from? Because you feel like you're kind of working for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For my dad?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you might want to keep an eye on his - you have been talking about places you want to work and things you'd enjoy doing. And on the heels of that I think you started anticipating things going badly at a job and thinking about sort of working with your dad. I think the thing I'm kind of worrying about or I think it might be a good idea for us to keep an eye on is whether that's a transition you often make from thinking about enjoying something where something may could go well, and close on the heels of that thinking about how things are going to suck because that's sort of how your dad comes into the picture. I don't know. I guess this might be a little more, I wonder if it makes you a little worried to enjoy, anticipate enjoying or feel positive about things because you worry about I don't know getting smacked down, having the rug pulled out, having it all get sour, something like that. [00:32:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just remembering something about how [inaudible at 00:32:11] it is. Starting with fifth grade my parents - also we had moved from Missouri to Alabama right before the third grade. I went to one school for third grade. Parents decided they didn't like our neighborhood, sold our house, bought a house in a new neighborhood, different school district. Went to a different public school for fourth grade. My parents decided that school wasn't as good as the first school I went to so they yanked me out of that school, put me in the local private school for fifth grade. Yes, until high school I never attended a single school for more than two years. High school was four years at one school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yes, so fifth grade we went to the school the day before class was started and we, I don't know if the doors were unlocked or if my mom broke into the school, but somehow we ended up in the classroom because I was very anxious about not knowing where the classroom would be and so my mom wanted to show me where the classroom was. And we saw that there were already worksheets on the desks. So we picked it up and read it. And my mom made a photocopy of one, put it back on the desk, and we brought it home. And it was an impulse writing exercise, you know, tell me a little bit about yourself, what's your greatest strength, what's your greatest weakness, what do you like to do? And so my parents had me fill it out the night before so that I would have the right answers for the first day of school to get on the teacher's good side.</p>

<p>And I remember, I can't remember everything I wrote, but for one of the questions I wrote I'm a chatterbox, which in hindsight I find that really weird because I certainly don't remember having lots of friends or talking a lot as a kid. But my 10-year-old self felt compelled to write I'm a chatterbox. And my parents just called me onto the carpet, literally, and they had me come into the living room and stand in front of my dad's armchair, which my dad always had a big, floofy armchair every house we lived in where he would bring it into the house. So I stood there while my parents lectured me about making a good first impression and I don't want the teacher to think badly of me and put my name on the board on the very first day because I don't want to give her the impression that I talk during class and I'm not an attentive student. And I absolutely should not tell the teacher that I'm a chatterbox because there'll be a black mark on my permanent record - they actually said that, black mark on your permanent record. [00:34:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Scared the Bejesus out of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet it did. The day before you were starting a new school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. My private school at that. And my parents had already spent most of the summer giving me lectures about how religion is a cross (ph) in these schools and they expect me to get an A because they expect me always to get As. So they expect me not to pay any attention to it and certainly all of this religious stuff was all wrong and don't forget you're a Muslim and they're religious teachings and they're wrong; you have to pretend enough to get an A. And it was all just very horrible. Also it really sucks to be the one non-Catholic kid in a Catholic school who's beating the pants off of everyone in your religion class. Even worse than being a geek in any other subject.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened as a result of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Beating the pants off of everyone and coming off in the class as the only non-Catholic? [00:36:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bullied, teased, I mean...the teacher would praise me after a test or a quiz. She would actually call me up in front of the class and say look at her, she got an A on this quiz from memorizing the Nicean creator, whatever, and she's not even Catholic. She's not even Christian and none of you can remember it. What's wrong with you? And then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the way to boost your social life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At a new school, where you're already the only non-Catholic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think there might have been a couple of non-Catholic Protestants, but I'm certainly the only non-Christian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're kind of going to get it any which way, I guess. I mean even if you snag the assignment a day early so you could be prepared for something you were supposed to be doing on the spot, you were going to get yelled at, from what you said, and terrorized over that. And for doing the other thing you were supposed to do, which was the best in your religion class, although you weren't supposed to believe any of it, which was confusing and screwy, you're going to hold a bunch of shit for that. I'm not really seeing the upside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was at that school for two years and hands down the best part of it was convincing my bitch of a math teacher that instead of attending math class I should just get sent to the principal's office and work my way through a seventh grade textbook. [00:38:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the best you could do eventually was give up the [inaudible].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Which reminds me of another story. I'm sort of tangenting off a tangent but, so after sixth grade we moved from Southern Alabama to Northern Kentucky and I started at yet another new school. And this was the first school I attended where there were actually class changes. It was a pretty typical junior high, six periods to the day, and my English teacher was a big believer in learning styles and she would [inaudible] some educational pattern. But she had desks and tables and a couch and a beanbag and feets on the floor in her classroom. And she interviewed each student and the first day of class saying where would you be most comfortable sitting, where do you learn the best? Which is kind of radical if you think about it.</p>

<p>And I told her that I was used to sitting alone at my last school and I'd like a desk not next to any other student's desks because I assumed most kids would want to sit on the floor or on the couch or in the beanbag. And so I figured most of the desks would be empty and - there were nine desks in the room; there were only four of us who wanted desks so, I sat in the very back corner desk against the wall in the back of the room with all the desks in front of me and to each side of me empty. And how is this not a warning sign for a teacher that a twelve-year-old wants to sit entirely by themselves isolated from their peers? [00:40:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I chaperoned stuff for the middle school and high school kids at my church before. If there was a kid who said I want to sit on a bus seat by myself with no one in the seats in front of me or to either side, I'd be having a conversation with their parents about what is going on in this kid's life. This is not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I think...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing happened. No one said anything. They acted like it was totally normal. It's possible she called my parents and my parents told her to fuck off but I never saw any kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no reason she shouldn't have talked to you too, even if she had offered that talk to your parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was also the class where we were required to read a book a week [inaudible at 00:41:15] card. There's a bingo card in each slot. It had different exercises like write a summary on the first five chapters or write a one-page short story about one of the characters, something they might have done after the book ended. Just various reading comprehension exercises. We had to pick five that formed a bingo. And I was consistently reading rated R criminal thrillers and legal thrillers because my parents just exercised no oversight with my reading materials. So I was reading my book and [inaudible at 00:41:52] Full Disclosure and John Griffin and Tom Clancy as a 12-year-old and some pretty racy serial killer, mystery novels, basically stealing all my mom's books because those were the genres she read. And the teacher never said anything to me. Writing a book about a gay double homicide suicide investigation, no question of your parents consider this appropriate reading for you? Should we have a talk about... [00:42:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is bad. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in hindsight I just can't believe how badly so many of my teachers failed me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see why.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wrote a short story that year, my seventh grade year, that actually won our regional writing competition about a kid little bit older than me. I was writing about a teenager so there was a lot of not really understanding what it's like to be a teenager and [inaudible at 00:43:21]. A teenager who was constantly on the outside looking in and was convinced that they were actually a space alien who had lost their memory of outer space and just couldn't connect with people and ended up committing suicide by the end of the story. And I don't recall ever being asked anything about are you okay? Do you need to see a counselor? There was no reaction other than this is a really interesting story. Wow, it's really well put together; you used some great vocabulary; let's submit it to this contest. What the hell?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's total craziness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What the hell?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. We need to stop for now, but that's nuts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know it's nuts and I'm angry that no one caught any of this...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why wouldn't you be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm angry that it took me until I was about 28 years old to realize that that's totally not [inaudible at 00:44:29] I'm comfortable and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's fucked up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. [00:44:44]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Morning. Oh gosh, I think I've mentioned before I feel like I want to talk about two things in here and one of them is the chronic pain. I'd forgotten how sometimes when it gets really acute I get to be really extremely like extreme (ph). My big personality change — I don't mean like hurting people or anything like that but my temper gets very, very short.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I don't — things are very — I just get frustrated very easily; that kind of stuff. I — I've been sort of very — my fuse has been very short this week because I've been in such pain. And although I do sleep a lot, I don't — the quality of sleep isn't very good, so you do this whole like I'm getting a lot of sleep but I'm not getting enough rest kind of thing and I just get very mean. You know? It's almost like — it's not really like this but it's a little bit like — almost like — not really exacting revenge on other people for not being in pain but sometimes I take the easy way out and sometimes say things that I don't mean. You know? So — I hate that about myself; I really do. [00:01:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's been hurting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, my joints in general; my leg in particular. There is — knowing what it is doesn't really make it any better but there is a particular joint that when it gets inflamed it hits this one nerve and then I feel it all down my left leg, so — and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it feel like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually it's just a dull ache but right now it is so — this thing's so inflamed I'm getting this pins-and-needly thing and occasionally it becomes kind of numb so when you walk on it, it can buckle underneath you, which is very disturbing. He checked it out. It really isn't like anything dangerous; it just — it's like having your — basically from like the entire leg asleep for days and it's ... [00:02:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has your leg been asleep most of the ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's OK now — well, not OK but it doesn't feel asleep but it feels like — it's achy right now but it was like pins and needles mostly yesterday, which is not cool. So it kind of comes and goes. I (pause) — it's very difficult to find a position that's comfortable to sleep in or sit in for very long or anything and so it makes you very agitated because you have to — you don't want to move because moving hurts but you don't want to not move because it could get a lot worse and just nothing makes you happy. You know? And it's sort of — I don't always act like this when I'm in chronic pain but whenever this particular thing happens, I just get to be nothing makes me happy; not even like — you know, like everything is wrong. I just miss — like something where it's not even a big deal that something isn't — it's too hot or too cold or too this or too that, it's not that big of a deal, but everything becomes like a big deal. You know? And so I don't like being that person. You know? [00:03:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get angry when the phone rings because I was taking a nap and this or that. I get angry because of this or I got really frustrated because of that fact that when I was sleeping I was sweating like crazy and so I woke up full of cold, wet sheets on myself and I was just, you know, couldn't do anything to get rid of them so I was just frustrated. You know, stupid stuff like that. You know? How dare my dog want water. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing. So I just — it doesn't happen that often anymore like that but it really — I just hate myself when I get like that. And so I usually try and isolate myself from people as much as possible, anybody, because I just feel like I don't want anyone to have to deal with that; one, because that — well, they — I mean part of it is just because of the fact that I just want to keep them [out of the firing line] (ph) but ... [00:04:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of it I think is you don't want to be the one shooting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because it's not their fault. You know? It's really not. But — it gets so bad sometimes that I just — I get a little irrational, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any sympathy for yourself for this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Keep that up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. (pause) I have a really hard time because of the fact that I want to (pause) — it's really, really complicated, basically. The problem is that — and it always goes back to the fact that I feel like in so many situations I know better than many other people do but yet, at the same time, I am not an actual expert; therefore, I start to doubt myself in terms of wanting to believe that I'm one of those pain-in-the-ass know-it-alls that think they know everything but yet I feel like I do, on certain things. Like being told, "Oh, well you ..." — I won't be told by certain people. Usually not a physician; physicians occasionally do it but primarily usually other type of support professionals telling me that keeping moving is going to help and this and that. Like I haven't been using my car for two months. Trust me, I'm moving and it doesn't help. And I know it doesn't help. I can tell the difference between something where it's going to be helpful and I have these times where I can tell if I just stretch it out it's going to be better and not. [00:06:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, you've been living like this for years.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I just ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course — I mean of course you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just get so angry. But yet, at the same time, it's like you know, this is someone's career; they're supposed to know more than that. And I get frustrated when people do that to me; when they — where I've actually occasionally said, "Do you want to be right or do you want to get something done? We can pick one or the other; we can get one of them to happen in this hour or not" — and I've done this because they've decided that they're right but I know that they're not and they want to get something done. And so — I mean I just can't always be right. You know? I don't want to be a megalomaniac. You know? [00:07:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:07:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So right about a lot of things, you know? And it's just — it's annoying as hell. So, it's ... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like that happens here at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. Nope. Actually it's sort of overwhelming that I don't really get a whole lot of — what's it called? — "This is what you should be doing" kind of thing. You know? And it's kind of awkward. Kind of so used to being told by just about everybody, including the people that bag my groceries, what I should be doing with my life and I'm just like "Yeah, whatever" most of the time but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I can think of at least recently when I just told you I think you should make sure you keep having sympathy for yourself. (chuckles) And I'm going to stick to that one. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's really hard though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The only thing that I can control about my life is the way that I react to it; like all these things that happen to me, to react to it. So I almost always try and have a positive spin on things because of the fact it's the only thing I can do. You know? I can let it make my life miserable or I can grow from it and learn and keep going. And (pause) — I can say it's kind of a (pause) struggle; it's really a big struggle. (pause) But it — (heavy sigh) We'll see. [00:09:31]</p>

<p>I (pause) — I don't know. Just — I don't want to be that person that's like, "Well, this doesn't bother anybody else" but for some reason I have to be able to indulge my own desire to (inaudible at 00:10:03) for myself." You know what I mean? Like (pause) — that may seem like it's just something where the anecdotal evidence says that other people, that they do not have as much trouble with something and therefore — but I'm the one that does, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, [I'm behind] (ph). Like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, let me give you an actual, concrete example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the medications I take (inaudible at 00:10:34) is called methotrexate is actually a type of chemotherapy. It's very, very low-dose but it is a type of chemotherapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, yep. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ninety-nine percent of the population does not get nauseated by this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. I finally found a doctor who — basically I explained to them that I've done everything I can, I'm still nauseated from it, I need — you know, and I specifically came in specifically saying, "Hey, I want to take Zofran. I know that Zofran works for me in nausea situations."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that an anti-nausea medication?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's an anti-nausea for, specifically for, chemotherapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, yeah. (Overlapping conversation, inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was actually — I had a really — I'm one of those people that I just don't do very well with nausea at all; I'm extremely vulnerable. Like whenever — some people are just like, "I'm a little bit queasy." I can't keep something down with the same amount of nausea. [00:11:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So a long time ago when I had some sort of stomach flu something or other, they gave that to me, I wrote it down, I knew it worked really well compared (ph) to other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Got you. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now — you know, I — when I go to the doctors now, people are like, "Why are you on Zofran?" I'm like, "Well, because I get nauseated" and then it becomes like this discussion about this, "Well, you're not supposed to be nauseated because it's low-dose." I'm like, "You know what? I don't care what everybody else has but you know ..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Sure. "It makes me puke." Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "It makes me puke." Yeah. And I only have to take it once a week and blah-blah-blah but I just — you only do it once a week when you take this stuff and — but I do need it. It's like that kind of stuff. Most of them are shocked; they've never even heard in their career of anybody having nausea from this stuff and I'm the one that does. It's like that kind of stuff, you know? It's like, "Well ..." — you know. And a couple of them ask me if I had thought about the fact — is it the fact that I think it's chemotherapy that's making me anxious and therefore nauseous in terms of that. I'm like, "No." I'm sure that I could probably run some sort of sugar pill, like [trail it] (ph) it in my house — which, disturbingly enough, would be kind of not all that strange — but the thing is when all is said and done it really is that I'm just vulnerable to nausea more than other people are. [00:12:50]</p>

<p>And so I have like — I have the stockpile of somebody who's like on tamoxifen or something like that in their house of nausea medications and so that kind — but that's a completely solid description of that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But there are other things like that where I have some sort of situation where I have an outlier experience than others and having to justify it to myself. It's like how many outliers can I have before they start to sound like it's all in my head. You know? To me I'm starting to think it's all in my head because I have all these outliers, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's all in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know. But the point though is that there's just something that can't be — it's improbable. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I understand. Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So — and if I really, really wanted all the attention of being sick, I probably would have actually been to my rheumatologist in the past year, probably; as opposed to being like, "Yep, I don't really feel like dealing with that right now." Because I don't, you know? That's you know — or the fact that I just — as much as I — I do have to tell certain people in my life; I try really hard not to tell anybody about this kind of stuff because it's just too complicated. You know? So ... [00:14:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and you told me you don't want to be that person who like who you're worried will be perceived as complaining or as trying to get special treatment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Yeah. Yeah. Or even just the person that it's too difficult to try and have to deal with it; therefore, "Let's pick somebody else for this." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am — I'm in the process — my boss sent me an e-mail with another job for Microsoft that's another one of those, "Get me out of the store, get me into corporate training" kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I am concerned that they are — I may get passed up because of health issues because people do know that my health is fragile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I have to worry about that, you know? So we'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look like a good prospect otherwise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think there's anybody has as much experiences with this as I do. I do need to change some things but I think that I really can, if I make some big changes in my life, actually do really well with this job. So this one actually is a pay raise, so ... [00:15:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. That would help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it would be nice. I assume that because my boss sent it to me that that meant that she felt as if I was qualified for it, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also I imagine that she'd support you in pursuing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She's — I have a lot of bosses. I have, officially, six. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:16:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But this is the boss of all those other people. And she is self-aware enough to tell me when things are kind of — when I'm off, which both makes me feel both vulnerable and gracious, I guess. At one point she's like, "Yeah, you're a little hyperactive today, 'M'"; you know, that kind of thing. Like, "Yeah, I know. I've had way too much like ..." — it was the day that they had given us all this sugar and candy and all this other stuff. I'm like, "Yeah, I know that's why I'm kind of not eating much for lunch today because I just need to calm down," which was helpful. But most people don't do that with me. You know. Which I guess — it's an unusual relationship because most people will not tell me, when my behavior is like that, that they — they normally just find it weird. [00:16:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They won't say like, "Oh," as opposed to, "Yeah, every, single one of my customers showed up with hot chocolate for me today and this morning at the morning meeting we all had ..." — you know, they feed you like we're all like 18 because they're all 18. (Therapist chuckles) And so Red Bull for breakfast is not like a normal thing for me; so yeah, I was a little hyperactive. So — but Microsoft's a — it's a unique place. I just found out that my management team did their bonding activity at a shooting range. [00:17:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) I guess it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I did a bonding activity where we learned how to make a type of soufflé.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yep. The concept being is that it is something that is very delicate but yet sometimes you need to have coordinated processes together (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They really think out of the box.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the shooting range thing, it was less actually about the shooting and actually learning how to assemble and clean and learning how to — for them, they were learning what you can delegate and what you cannot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So they thought very carefully about ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have a lot of very — they think very deeply about their bonding activities. So ... [00:18:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the job you'd be applying for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the regional trainer job. It would be basically for the — everywhere from Philadelphia up, training when they — coming in; taking their trainers to train those trainers, basically; monitoring how they're doing with these things, what's working what's not sort of — it's a supervisory role without a direct report. Like there were no people — I will not be (inaudible at 00:18:46) people; I'll be acting more as a mentor — though the word "mentor" at Microsoft means something different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's going to be like regulating the way that we are doing certain things so that they're very consistent, which I think is really important; although ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:19:05) training?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I think it's important to still have their own individual flair, there are certain pieces of information that need to be communicated the same whether we're in New York or in London.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So I really do — it's something that is very — I'm very passionate about. I think it would be great. I'll have to work 40 hours a week but it won't be as bad, I think, because at least some of it's going to be office time, which could either be a home office or at — you know, across the street. Think I told you about the secret location. [00:19:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned it. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's above (inaudible at 00:19:43). It's not secret; it's just nobody knows it's there because there's not a sign in front of it. It's not a secret.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, there's an executive briefing center there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that would be a really big help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One, for my self esteem but also ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I do that I have to do a lot of investments in myself, though, and I think that the things I've always wanted to do — one of which is that unfortunately I'm going to have to — well, not unfortunately but it's going to be a pain — I want to do it but it's going to be a pain in the ass — is I need to actually go through and get elocution and diction lessons so that people can understand what I'm saying. [00:20:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — I have found that in this town people have more trouble understanding my language than anywhere else. I had some trouble in Kentucky but not so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I don't know why you'd be that hard to ...] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... understand but maybe we're also in a setting where I'm just focusing on listening; there's no strange noise, blah-blah-blah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Also I think that it's — you deal with people who are — you know, you yourself are worldly enough and deal with people who are — you have a little better listening skills than someone who has actually, possibly never left (inaudible at 00:21:09) in their entire life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just discovered how to pronounce that, by the way. (Therapist chuckles) The — and so they, having heard nothing but a very distinct dialect that is all they understand ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. Yep, got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I will probably need to invest in such things. I was told that by an academic advisor anyways, years ago. He himself lost his — he did this because he — he has two PhDs and he lost his accent when he was at Dartmouth, specifically to have a wider appeal towards many people. Basically, when he spoke at conferences and just in general, off the cuff, he said it was the best thing he ever did. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see. Yeah. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: His colleague who was next door to him is Australian; you'd never know it. Again, lost the accent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so he basically explained to me that was possibly the best thing he ever did and he was very passionate about that and I believe him. Because sometimes when you're expressing ideas, being able to speak in a way that is impactful is not just about the way you pronounce the letters; it's a lot of different things. You can't really change the way — whether or not someone's going to fund something or not. So they may not see your — they can't hear the way you speak when you send in a grant application but if you see them at a conference, they can be impressed with how well-spoken you are. So ... [00:22:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That being said, he is also an alcoholic and has never woken up before noon, so I'm not necessarily saying everything he says should always be followed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think he's — I don't know if he's an alcoholic. He has a problem with drinking in that every, single thing he does has to involve alcohol. But — so — but you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's made it into his 70s now so whose really — and he's functional most of the time, so who cares?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I would like very much to get out of the stores.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have — because of the fact that I've been doing this for so long, I have now a barrage of stories of things that are just terrible things that customers do to people, including one that happened this week. I was told I was being infantilized by society. I'll explain in a second. But I'm just so sick of that. I'm sick of people just trying to help with something. I had my hair in two pigtails. Why? Because I had to go to a combination yoga/massage class type of thing afterwards — you know, one of those basically get-yourself-in-better-shape things — and if you have a single ponytail behind you, when you lay down it hurts. So I had them back like this. [00:24:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right? I was told that — she felt it was really sad that I was being told by society that I had to infantilize myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before I forget, I got the name of that physical therapy place. If you want it (inaudible at 00:24:33).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Yes. Love that. Yes, please.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I mean I'll — can I e-mail it instead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it OK if I do it now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I mean for some reason at Microsoft, people have — I'm not sure; I used to know what part of the brain it was that kept you from saying things instead of just thinking them and people seem to have that part disengaged and they will tell you all kinds of stuff; things like — one of the girls that I work with was told that if she didn't get those tattoos removed she was never going to find a husband. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's a lesbian in a committed relationship for the past 15 years (therapist chuckles), so she really didn't mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It couldn't have been less applicable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It couldn't have been — like seriously. And on top of it, all the tattoos are covering terrible scars that she had.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They're actually very meaningful to her. Very sweet girl. But like little — like you feel the need to tell people that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the physical therapy place is called [Inaudible] and is in Cambridge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect. [00:26:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And probably if you maybe didn't tell them you — just don't mention my name. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. Of course. I won't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it wouldn't matter but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm a big believer of separating things out like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So. I hope that helps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've heard that it's very, very good and is decent at getting money out of insurance companies and, apart from that, has a quite low rate. But he's very experienced and good and (inaudible at 00:26:55).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So anyway, OK I'll ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But yeah, you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am not one of those people who believes that because a practitioner is expensive it equates necessarily with skill.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But you were explaining someone saying ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just like sat down and she's like, "I feel so sad that society pressures you into infantilizing yourself like that." And I'm like, "Thanks. None of your business but I'm going to a yoga class after this and ..." — not really yoga but it was easier to say the word "yoga" because it's hard to explain to them —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: — "after this and I need it to be about my hair back. But you can feel free to not comment on anything that doesn't involve you on our lesson." You know? It's just like it happens all the time. We constantly get people who felt the need to — I don't know what it is about at Microsoft but people feel comfortable enough to say things that they really shouldn't say. You know? But they do. And it's kind of — it just — it blows my mind. And so I'm just ... [00:28:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It has to affect you over time] (ph). Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of it — OK, the majority of it is so weird it doesn't affect me, but the stuff, the things like, "Oh, I know a nutritionist that you should go see" — that kind of stuff is like, "You know what? I'm sick of being judged." Luckily, when it comes to intellectual things, I usually put people in their place pretty fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And that's pretty — that doesn't bother me. There's a lot of people I work with who people ask them, "Oh, what are you going to do when you grow up?", that kind of stuff and, "Oh, were you laid off? Why are you working here?" I'm pretty good at that with people. And so that's not really a big deal but it just — there's a lot of completely, completely inappropriate things that are said to us. You know? And it's just because — I mean we talk to them about their lives; we talk to them about their trips to Vegas and their whatever. And so — because we usually have bump-up (ph) tickets and so I guess they feel like they can say things that they can't say to anybody else. [00:29:16]</p>

<p>We've got this woman that comes in regularly who she's in a wheelchair and for some reason she finds it completely — she is — the word "sexual harassment" is not the actual word because she has no power over any of them. But she makes sexually inappropriate comments and all kinds of things to some of the men at our store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or like she asks them for hugs and this and that and they're like, "Well, this is ..." — she's like in her 20s, she's in a wheelchair, I kind of feel bad. But you know, she refers to them all as her boyfriends and this and that and — yeah, it's kind of — luckily I don't have to deal with her much but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there is just so much crazy that comes in that store that it's just — it's overwhelming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And after seven years of the aggregate of it, it's getting to be more than I can really handle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like especially when you're in a lot of pain, these kinds of — I don't know, it's like (inaudible at 00:30:28) or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This stuff is actually easier to handle than my old store. My old store had, quite literally, the weirdest group of people I've ever met because they were right next to Eastern State Psychiatric Hospital. So — and therefore we would get the weirdest — like little ladies with buggies full of baby dolls and all that stuff. I'm talking about like the actual schizophrenic people would come there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they'd go to their appointment. And it was like, for me it was something where I would explain to especially the really young kids there, I'm like, "You know what? It is amusing but do not do anything but treat those people with the utmost respect because but for the grace of God that could be you who's hearing voices in your head." [00:31:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's easier for me to deal — you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's annoying. It was really stressful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, at the very least some ways — that's actually, in some ways, harder, sometimes not as hard, than the people who are just — the people who feel like, "I need to start drinking more aloe or something like that."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now, where I am out in Burlington, it's more the people who — there's pet psychics that come in for lessons. I don't know how you can have a job as a pet psychic but apparently you can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Crystal healers. I'm talking like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's stressful because it's like — they're on that border of — they're not completely (inaudible at 00:31:51).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation, inaudible) personalities. Personalities, not other kinds of issues.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Oh, I forgot to tell you this. If you ever go to the Microsoft store to get something fixed, don't tell them what you do for a living. We're extremely biased against people in the psychiatric and psychology realm. [00:32:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) I will keep that in mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly because we deal with pet psychics and — who claim to also be from that realm of things. So what do ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. So don't ever tell them what you do for a living.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stupid but true. So it's — you know it's a weird — I just need to get out of it. I'm not saying get out of it permanently — and for that job I will spend a certain amount of time doing observation, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you won't be that close to the front line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I won't — and I won't have to go through the depressing aspect of seeing how much the mental degradation happens at the end of life, which is — actually that's the thing that affects me the most because I start going and comparing it to my family, which isn't that bad but seeing that extreme makes me a little bit hyper-vigilant towards my parents, being an only child. [00:33:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I'm kind of — I don't want that to happen. I don't want that to happen to my parents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it would be very good for me to get away from that for a bit. So it's weird, though, working with the public since in the past I really — every other career I've had, I really don't work with the public that much. You know what I mean? It's not like I was selling missiles at the missile store or anything like that, you know? (therapist chuckles) I mean yes, you talk ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would have had some interesting customer experience there, though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They actually did have — yeah, there actually were things like that but not the same thing at all ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... most of the time. There are some small countries that are strange but I never had to deal with them directly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was — you know, it was much more removed ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... in terms of the customer was usually something (inaudible at 00:34:01) filter to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And on top of it, the expectations were not irrational. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's — you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it'd be nice to be more insulated again that way. [00:34:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It gets to be — and again, because my personality is this way, you can only take — you know, I believe that you can't change people but you can change how you react to it, so — and I even tell other people, I'm like, "You know what? Honestly it's because we're Microsoft, it's because we're awesome." Nobody else would have these irrational expectations. It's because we're awesome that people have this idea that we can do more than we can, so we're usually flattered by this. While it's great for me to tell this to an 18-year-old, it's really hard to believe it — I mean I believe it but to have it keep me motivated still, you know, at 36. You know? Because it really is — it gets to be exhausting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Like, "What? You're not open on Christmas Day?" "No, we're not open on Christmas Day." I mean that's not even all that strange of a question that people ask us. You know? But ... [00:35:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it gets a lot stranger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the thing is that nobody else — I mean because of the fan base of it, people keep amping up the expectations. And so it is — you get some pretty darn irrational expectations out there, you know. Like well, you know, things do break. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, there are things we cannot do and it's not because we don't want to; it's because it's not just possible at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? So — but it's — it would be good to get, like I said, get removed from the public; at least for a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? So ... [00:36:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. And yeah, the money would be a bit more if you were working that many more hours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but that I imagine would be pretty helpful for [your stress level] (ph) as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It would definitely — the money would be nice to be able to pay off some more debt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Potentially have (inaudible at 00:36:38). (alarm or phone goes off) So I just sort of have to think through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically today I have to think through what I need to do to make myself into the best candidate possible and sort of put together a plan, apply obviously, that kind of thing, see how it goes. [00:37:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel up to getting application done? I think, for the job in the fall, that was ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was too much. I've got the next three days off, so I can do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This one also isn't making a multimedia video about who I am; this is just filling out my education. Thank God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like some creative expression of who I am as a trainer is a lot harder for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So I definitely think I can do that. So, because I look a lot better on paper than I do creatively. Just because I teach people how to do things does not necessarily mean that I have the skill as an artist and that's something that most people don't understand. I can teach people video editing very, very well. Do I have the eye of a video ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... editor? No. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually, yeah; those are two totally different things. [00:38:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people do not understand that. And I explain to them it's like, "Well, I don't have anything in my life that is really intriguing that I am significantly doing [any videotaping of] (ph). Quite frankly, I actually don't have a video camera, which everyone's always shocked about. I'm like, "Oh well, I just don't," you know? I don't really have a compelling need for one. Of course then they find out I'm on TV and they think that's even funnier. So yeah, I don't feel like being killed by all of my plants (ph) just falling down on me one day. But the — you know, so I mean what I find to be really interesting and different, though I have a typography — kinetic typography project that I may want to complete in time to add along with it. So — do you know what kinetic typography is? [00:38:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I was going to ask, actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is when you take words and then you animate the words such that they — and you hear it with a voice over but they show meaning along with it. Go onto YouTube, type in "kinetic typography," you'll see it. It's usually they do something where the actual physical characters are animated in a way that expresses meaning to it. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: By characters you mean like the letters?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Letters, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is something that is supposed to be exuberant. The words are specifically [emotion of it] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's done very slowly. I have been sort of — just to prove how to do this kind of animation, I've been slowly going through the first sentence of A Tale of Two Cities — which is a lot longer than you think it is (therapist chuckles) — and doing that. And so if I finish it, great. You know? [00:39:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because most people read it but they don't really get the emotion of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. It's a neat, little — you've seen it; you just don't realize — once you see it you (inaudible at 00:40:10).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Yeah, I feel like I've seen commercials that do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like they put out the slogan in letters that do things or I'm thinking of like a children's book that might have letters dancing around [as they're dancing] (ph) or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Yeah. Yeah. It's more — it happens more — it's animated but it happens more than most people realize. So it's interesting. So most people, when they think about it they think of italic because italic tends to evoke certain types of feelings with it (inaudible at 00:40:39) something else. But — so we'll see how that goes. But I mean that's not even remotely a requirement for it, so ... [00:40:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think they're more looking for people who have insight in terms of coaching people's behavior ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and how to be able to coach how to effectively teach. So we'll see. But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's just helpful to have something like that to kind of work on and be focused on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I always get these micro-projects of my own just because it's just — it's something to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I don't think [that it's the job] (ph). I mean like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I go back and forth between thinking it's going to be overwhelming and it's going to be great, that I can handle it. I unfortunately seem to be one of those people that only do things well when I have too much on my plate. [00:41:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so you need one thing and I'll forget about it. Give me five things and I'll have a master plan. So but I have tried very hard to change myself and I don't think I can. It's just how I'm wired that I seem to do better with more work. So — which is why outside of work I make these micro-projects because it helps me focus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — but [I'm going to get that done] (ph). You know, we'll see. But just (inaudible at 00:42:21) focus on (inaudible) it's good to have a certain amount of pity for myself but at the same time it's very easy for me to just feel like, "Oh my God, my world sucks." And doing that for eight hours at a time really is boring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — I'm a doer. I don't like being in situations where there's things I cannot — where I feel very unable to affect the outcome. So — I don't like being able to [have that kind of thing.] (ph) I don't like that at all, so ... [00:43:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, passivity, not so much your thing. And I think it's one of the things that makes (inaudible at 00:43:16) so tough and one of the things that makes it's helpful that (overlapping conversation, inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish I could just be diabetic or something like that because then I'd have something to do. I could chart the amount of this and that, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even high blood pressure; I could start taking my blood pressure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it makes us alive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd feel like I'm actively doing something to change the outcomes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This one, not so much. And so it's (pause) — it's hard, it's really hard. I tried very hard to buy into what (inaudible at 00:44:02) what my family thinks about the whole thing, which is basically that this is something that's been put in my way to make me grow. It's hard though, you know? There's only so much providence that makes you feel OK during the day to hear about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. So I think it comes from that, you know, we come from Germany and therefore everything that is terrible makes us stronger. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. Okey-dokey, well I will see you next Tuesday. [00:44:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right? OK. (pause) Thank you so much for the e-mail for the ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you're welcome. Hope that's helpful.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sniff, 2-minute silence)  First thing I thought when I came in here, was something that, I don't know, it occurred to me today while I was feeding FSO.  I don't, it just seems to be in support of things I've been saying about my feelings toward her.  And, but it, uhm, I don't know, just suddenly I began thinking about the fact she was born on a Sunday, and that had been the day I'd sort of hoped she'd be born, because it was convenient for MSCZ.  And, I was feeling extremely ready, and very much longer than that I would have felt depressed if she hadn't been born.  So, I was sort of thinking of that. </p>

<p>And then I just became, I don't know, the feeling I had when I went in, is, is one that I hadn't, I hadn't thought I'd react quite the way I did.  Because I wasn't, I don't think I felt afraid at all, or worried, or anything.  I was just sort of excited that it was finally happening.  And, I don't know, it just, I didn't really put this into words, but I think it was very clear to me that I was excited because I was anticipating that our son was about to be born.  And, I don't know, I, I was just wondering if the reaction I had after she was born, feeling everything was so uncomfortable and that that was the hardest part for me, physically, had anything to do with that.  That it was after I knew she was a girl. </p>

<p>And, I don't know, because, of course whatever it would have been, it was born at that point, so that everything I was working toward was over.  And everything the class had prepared us for was over, and nothing much had been said in the class for what you'd go through once the baby had been born.  And I don't, I don't know how much they have to do with it.  But it, I don't know, it just seems to me that I would have felt differently if I'd had a boy.  I mean, just physically right, right when my stitches were being sewed up, and things like that. </p>

<p>And I, I, and I was uhm, hmm, it was on my mind a good bit in the first week I think, of how strongly I'd reacted after FSO was born.  Or how uncomfortable I'd found it, and all that kind of thing.  And, I, I'm just wondering now, if that a the way to redirect my disappointment.  So I, then I didn't think about, that was when I would have felt most strongly the disappointment, I should think.  Or In that that was when I knew the way things really were, and I couldn't imagine that maybe it was a boy or anything.  I, I knew what had happened.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Though I still think my feeling I, I, I don't know, saying that I wanted a boy rather than a girl, and all the other things I've said about my feelings, the fact that I did have a girl, and toward FSO, anyway, uh, I, I, still think I feel that I would have been more complete if I had a boy, or things would be better.  Because I, I'm still going through this thing of thinking to myself, why do I feel a boy would be so much better, and trying to figure out why a boy would be better, in a, in a ineffectual way.  Because it's, I mean, I'll be looking at FSO, or thinking about what she's like, and then wondering, well, how would a boy be better than this? (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Then what do you think of, then?  I mean, how do you answer that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sigh) Well, I remember I was saying yesterday about, I don't know, thinking that I would turn to a son to — and have, I don't know what kind of relationship exactly I'd have with a son, except he would be there, and he would be my, it's almost like, male plaything.  And because of our relationship, and because I was older and therefore, the stronger one for many years, I think I, I would imagine the relationship would be the way I'd want it.  I'd have control.  He wouldn't go away from me for a long time. </p>

<p>And, but, but just in thinking about the feeling I had today, when I was thinking about this, I mean, this isn't really thinking about why I'd feel a boy would be better, but just the feeling was in thinking about how is a boy better than FSO, just was emotionally more satisfying to think of a boy.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because then I was just thinking about my relationship with MSCZ, too, and uh, it, this almost fit in together, though I'm not sure I see exactly how.  Uh, I don't know, sometime I think I resent him right now.  I was, well, we had intercourse last night and I didn't react the same way I had before — crying — which I did twice.  It happened twice that, because it happened after I had mentioned it here again, that w_ we were having intercourse and then suddenly I'd start crying.  But this time I just felt angry.  And it, I guess I, I s—, har—, I don't know, I'm — right now, anyway — I'm finding it hard to remember back to times before when I used to always feel angry and want to hurt him.  But I imagine it was the same kind of feeling, in thinking he had no interest in me, he was just feeling sexually aroused and well, all he wanted was intercourse.  And then he wouldn—, not be aware of me after that.  And, uh, uh, that whole frame of mind that I think I used to have a lot.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>And it, what I think when I think of that, is that I'm trying to pretend I don't want something or need something that I really do.  Then I get angry and I take it out on him.  But, I don't know, at one point, when I was thinking about crying, especially about crying that first time after FSO was born and we had intercourse, I was thinking it must be part of trying to have tight control over everything, and that I was losing it by having intercourse.  And I don't know whether feeling angry is part of that too, just another way to not want to lose control, or if it's something more than that, or different.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Hmm, this is, I don't know, I (Sigh or Crying), there must have been something I thought first.  But I just realized I was thinking about well, 2 different things connected with the BFMs.  First I was thinking about uh, th—, well I was mainly thinking I'v—, I know, of their son's room, and uh, I started out by thinking of the fact when we were there Sunday, FNI was talking about how messy FYH, their daughter's, room was.  And she had a, w_w_ FNI was actually babysitting for a girl who's FYH's age.  And the two them had, I guess, taken out every toy FYH had.  And I then just started thinking of that the rooms are always messy, because that's sort of the kind of housekeeper FNI is.</p>

<p>And then, but then I ended up thinking about MJ's room, their son.  And I don't know, I s—, was sort of doing it in the uhm, way of wondering how I would, or how I will keep FSO's room when she messes it up, and how soon you can get help from them cleaning up, things like that.  And then, then I started thinking about an incident that happened — I've forgotten when — I think sometime a—, I think shortly after Christmas, right before New Year's.  Uh, when they had a friend of MJ's down for several days.  And this friend has been told things about sex way back from when he was about 2, when his sister, his first sister was born, and apparently his mother told him a lot more in detail than he could really handle.  And, and he's had times when he's gotten kind of upset. </p>

<p>And, then this time, he was apparently thinking he could impregnate MJ, and was trying to.  And this upset MW very much, because he found them.  Actually MVB, this is the boy, was urinating, and uh, thought that was the way he was going to impregnate MJ.  MJ thought he was really going to be pregnant.  (Sniff) And MW got so upset that he wouldn't let MVB sleep with MJ that night, because they — MJ has 2 beds in his room and that's where he'd been staying.  And so then I was thinking that they put MVB in with FYH, which we were laughing about, or, MSCZ and I were laughing about it, because it, I mean it was a solution in one sense, but in another it was just sort of funny to think that that's the way they solved it. </p>

<p>Uh, and that was when I realized what I was thinking, as if that were the (Sniff) — what I was all — thinking about all this for, or something.   
ANALYST: What made that funny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Interrupts) Well, the —</p>

<p>ANALYST: The solution?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they put h—, MVB in with a female, where he could really — except that because of his age, he couldn't do anything — but otherwise — (Silence)</p>

<p>W—, thinking about that, the fact that it was — the thing that made it funny was the fact you could imagine MVB do—, really doing something with FYH.  I mean, just because now there was the male-female setup, as opposed to when he was with MJ, thinking he was doing something he couldn't possibly do.  Uhm, it just made me wonder if part of wanting a son on my part, is just because then I can have fantasies that, even if they're not fulfilled, and even if they couldn't be, because my son were just, like an infant.  Still, the fact that he'd be a male would make it possible to have the fantasies.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uh, I was just wondering if, uh, I suppose to a lesser degree than it would be if I had a son, but still, if, if, such fantasies are part of why I find getting along with any male, hard.  Because I really am having those fantasies all the time.  And I was just thinking of MJ BFM again.  And, uhm, part of what makes me feel awkward with him now, is some type of feeling of his being superior to me, and knowing it and letting me know it, and I don't know, looking at me as if he really knows what's going on with me, and I have to hide it better.  And then, I have to please him, and, and this feeling of, am I going to please him, or not?  Which is true f—, of my relationship with any man, but I was just thinking of it with MJ.  Gets in the way of my being able to feel relaxed and natural or comfortable. </p>

<p>ANALYST: How old is MJ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think he's just about 6.  I think he'll be 6 in March.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What is it you feel that he knows about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, it's kind of hard to explain.  It's just occurring to me, but, I don't know, it's almost as if he just somehow knows I'm in a weaker position than he.  In the sense that he's superior, and I'm sort of implying he'd know fantasies that I'm thinking now maybe I have.  But, al_ almost as if he knows he can give me something that I want, and he can choose whether to give it to me or not, and I have no control.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And when I think about w_w_ what is it he'd be giving to me, I mean it could be a sexual relationship, or it could be just attention, or liking, any—, anything. </p>

<p>ANALYST: What kind of sexual relationship do you think of?  I mean, what, what do you have in mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think from just simply wanting to be with me, liking my company, to actually having intercourse, though I, I sort of shy from that.  I mean, I shy from saying that.  And I've always, I don't know, been aware of it before, just in terms of and only vaguely then, of uh, feeling this way of his returning or wanting my company. </p>

<p>And I think, I think actually my feeling toward him changed, because I used to find I, I think, as I remember, I used to feel very relaxed with him when he was smaller.  And I think even after FYH was born, I did.  But think what's changed it is he looks very much like a boy now.  And he's lost all his baby fat, and everything.  And I think it was when he began to thin out and not look like a baby at all, and uh, I suppose, act older, too.  But, I mean he was always progressively acting older.  But I think it had something to do with his appearance. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, how would that work?  I mean, that's what I'm trying to get uh, what in your imagination, what — I mean, you're a grown woman and he's 6, and so forth.  H—, how would this, uh —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just because he's masculine. </p>

<p>ANALYST: But if you imagine a real situation, what would happen, literally?  How would it work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this is impossible, but I immediately thought I'd put him inside me.  I mean, almost like him, totally.  (Silence) And then, I'm getting confused again, mainly because I, I suppose I'm trying to keep everything very simple, and it's, well, if I'm right, it's not.  But I immediately thought of, uhm, I don't remember when, but fairly recently, I guess before I went to the hospital, uhm, talking about my mother being pregnant with MLWZ, and my father seeming to become more attentive to her.  And my noticing it.  Maybe I noticed it when she was pregnant with FNA, too, but I haven't recalled that.  And, I don't know, just wondering right now if after I say that about MJ, of, is part of this just feeling of if I carry a male child — it has nothing to do with my having a son, as much as just carrying a male child, as my mother did, that then I'll be complete, and I mean, she was getting from my father what I wanted.  So it was as if, then I will.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was just, I don't know, I was just thinking of his reaction when he first saw FSO.  And, and I was thinking, in the exactly the — well, not in exactly the opposite way, but in a very different way than when I saw him reacting to her.  Because at the time I was thinking, why he really is pleased with her.  And he likes playing with her, and he, he's interested in her, and he isn't feeling awkward or anything.  I used to always think he was very awkward with me, and I felt in a similar way I think, with the other two, FYC and FNA, too.  But certainly with me. </p>

<p>And, and so I was thinking, goodness, he's not awkward.  But just now when I was thinking of it, I was thinking, well he was pleased with her.  Because she's a granddaughter, I mean, she's part of his flesh and blood, in a sense.  And he's pleased about that.  But, I was just thinking, but there was something distant, and if he'd, if, the baby had been something like MDI, then I th—, he would have been much more, sort of immediately involved, or proud, or emotionally involved, in any case.  

And i—, I suppose I keep thinking of MDI, too, because not only was he the first baby born of my generation of sisters and brothers, but uhm, I mean, it was his first grandchild, but it was also a boy.  And so it was his first grandson, which is, uh, I don't know, somehow I think makes it more significant to me.  And maybe my father's reaction was stronger, because it was the first.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was just remembering feelings about MSCZ again, and ever since I've come home from the hospital, and I'm not sure if even I was hiding it from myself in the hospital.  But I was feeling it even then, to an extent, of sort of, I don't know how much I feel angry at MSCZ because we didn't have a boy, but if I'm so terribly disappointed about it, or had such strong feelings, I must be feeling angry toward him, to an extent.  And this, this seems to be a feeling of sort of, he, he's not proud of all these things, and he — somehow he doesn't really belong — I don't know, as if he's an outsider.  And it seems rather strange.  (Sniff) Or I suppose, it doesn't seem strange in light that I was questioning who was the father.  And now I'm finding that I'm concerned about my father's feelings.  And whether negatively or positively, I'm concerned about FSO and, and about myself.  And we sort of form a triangle and MSCZ's outside that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it just makes me think of something that I sort of denied when he asked me.  Because I, I know even f_ from when I was in the hospital, I was always sort of encouraging him to pick up FSO or do things with her, and I was kind of telling myself, I liked to see him liking to do things with her.  Although, I don't know, after awhile of pretending this at home, I think I began to — it, it got much more if it were convenient to me I wanted him to do things with her, and I (Sniff) think maybe I was feeling some feeling, I don't know whether it was jealousy, or what, otherwise when he would be playing with her. </p>

<p>But uh, one time he said to me, "Why are you so anxious for me to pick her up or to play with her, or something?"  And I denied it, I just said, "Well I just, because I'm feeding her, I have to sort of sc—, work your playing with her into the schedule of feeding her.  So I like to let you know, you know if you want to, and when, when it would be good to.  But I don't know, it seems like I really wanted him to, because somehow I'd be reassuring myself then, or telling myself I really wanted it, was a way to reassure myself about the fact MSCZ really did have a place in all this, and was important, and did belong.  And the fact that I had to reassure myself, just makes me think even more, I was really feeling he didn't.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And, I was just thinking again of that incident I told you about yesterday, when I got so angry at my mother.  And uhm, I was under tension that whole time they were down here around Christmas.  And it was partly because I was tired, because I'd, I was doing a lot, or just the fact there was company around a lot of the time, and I couldn't re—, rest as I was used to, or FSO was more restless, and so forth.  And I don't know, I was kind of attributing my general feeling at that time to that, plus knowing I was sort of having some emotions I was trying not to admit. </p>

<p>But right now, I'm just wondering how much it had to do with wanting her to be outside of things too.  Feeling she wasn't part of things.  Because I didn't feel that way toward my mother when she was there alone.  It was only when my father was there too, that I did.  Or, I don't know, I mean, at least it became more acute when my father was there.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just, well, first I was thinking well, it really seems strange when I think of what my father is right now.  Uhm, that I can attach so much to our relationship, although I know it comes from years past.  And, and then I was just thinking of how I saw him in years past, and he was always the one that was fun, that would laugh and joke, and I mean, if he were in the mood — he could be horrible too.  But if he were in the mood, he'd be the one that was fun to be with.  And he was the one that, if we had any family outing or anything, that livened it up.  And my mother was always sort of supplying all our daily needs and being kind of steady, in that you knew exactly what kind of mood she'd always be in.  And she never really played or laughed or anything, and she never went into the other extreme that my father would do. </p>

<p>And then I was just thinking again of what, I don't know, the roles I think of my having and MSCZ having with FSO.  And of his playing with her and I mean, sometimes he'll help do other things too, like if he happens to be picking her up to play with her before I'm going to feed her and she needs changing, he'll change her, and things.  But I generally think his place or his part in the whole thing is that he can play with her, and that that's when she gets played with.  And I m—, I realized this before, too, that I was not thinking of myself as somebody who could play with her, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And at first when I realized I'd (Yawns) done this, uhm, I was thinking well, it's a matter of time.  That I'm spending time doing other things with her and so I don't have the same kind of time that MSCZ does to play with her.  But it's really not that, it's — I mean, when I think well, I could make time.  Then it's a matter of being in the role of playing with her, as well as taking care of her needs.  I, I don't know, when I imagine myself that way, I feel awkward.  As if it's a very foreign thing and almost like I wouldn't know what to do.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about when uhm, FSO was first sick with her cold, and we had to set up a vaporizer, I found I was incapable once I knew, once I'd called the doctor and knew what we were supposed to do, of making any further decisions about, I don't know, like where to put it, and how close to have her to it, and so forth.  And I made MSCZ decide all that.  And even if I knew I didn't like the way things were — we had it one way and then we changed it later — I, I was incapable of thinking about where else to do it.  And I don't know, I was just thinking now, that was just part of, maybe I was afraid to because of my wish to get rid of her.  And if I started making decisions, I might make some really awful ones.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because then that makes me wonder if, aside from the fact that I was seeing those roles of the father plays and the mother takes care of, as my parents did, uh, fr_ from being familiar with them that way, I was just wondering right now, too, if that isn't part of this feeling I have toward FSO, of keeping a very tight control of myself, and just doing the things that are the necessities. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Is it all babies that you feel this thing toward, about playing with them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure.  Uhm, it's seemed to me I played with MDI, as I recall.  And if it's somebody — a baby outside our of family, then I th—, well I don't know, I mean it, uhm, I have found — and especially before I was teaching, but even after I was teaching, I — it took me awhile before I felt comfortable with any child.  I didn't immediately come into a room where there are children, or a child or something like that, and feel at ease and know what I wanted to do, and all.  So maybe it is.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But then again, r—, if I think about MJ BFM, with whom I'd had quite a lot to do and uh, my experience with other babies was not either very lengthy or very much, so that I, I don't know, it's hard to judge.  But uh, I think I used to feel very relaxed with him, and play with him, and so forth.  And I don't know whether it was because he was a male child, or because I wasn't his mother.  I don't know which it was.  Or both, maybe.    

And I played with MDI.  But then, uh, well I, I saw MDI the most of any of FYC's children, but — and I saw FHB the least.  But I don't, I don't know, I think when MDR was a little baby, I didn't feel like playing with him.  But a_ again I should imagine that there would be some babies you'd feel more like doing it with than others, anyway.  And MDR just was not an attractive baby to me.  I, I don't know if physically he was unattractive, but he was crying a lot, and he made, he had a very strange kind of voice.  And, I don't know, just generally he was not appealing to me.  And I imagine too, part of it might have been, it was alright for FYC to have 1 boy, but f_ for her to have two is kind of overwhelming. </p>

<p>And actually, I don't know, I can't remember now what MDR looked like as a baby, but he's definitely a better looking boy than MDI.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 14, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're missing all the (inaudible at 0:00:04.3). The street cleared and microphone out and have the unveiling of that sculpture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was unveiled yesterday (inaudible at 0:00:12.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, really, going to do it again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they got a big (inaudible at 0:00:16.7). Yeah, I mean it. It's really (inaudible at 0:00:22.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, thank you. It helped a lot. It helped me figure out some things. 0:00:31.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually - well, let me just tell you what I've decided since then. Oh, by the way, I decided, well, I'm going to fool around now for a little while. I keep telling myself all summer. So it's been a couple of days since I found out. And I've already got my mind on something else, you know, that I want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's to work on this - well, this swim the City of New York is going to sponsor this summer. And I can really see getting involved in that. And because - you know, it's only been a couple of days since a super big hurdle, huge accomplishment has been passed that already I'm thinking of the next one. It's quite clear that I live and breathe to suffer for the agony of it just to have some very substantial worthwhile accomplishment. Well, worthwhile, (inaudible at 0:01:19.2) clearly my own.</p>

<p>But I don't know that being worthwhile in my eyes is very well defined, other than the fact that I take pleasure in other people saying congratulations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, it's really great. But I'm not (inaudible at 0:01:39.4) exam. It's really great having finished and having done it and having earned it, you know, it's not important (ph). And I guess that's pretty much what I live for, that type of accomplishment and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being able to do something well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and not necessarily enjoying doing it at all. I mean, I really didn't like it. And not necessarily doing something that I've decided I'm going to do. But somehow or other I ended up doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:02:13.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least that's how I feel about physics. Like, right now, you know, I can't feel bad about it, I passed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I proved myself and now I've got an opportunity to go to Germany and with my work in physics. And did I mention that to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I'm quite pleased with it and I'm going to get in the lab again. I don't have to study anymore, and wouldn't be required to be study. So there was a time when, you know, when it was really, really distasteful to me, and yet, I see that is going to always be part of my life perhaps. If I get into something that I decide I'm going to do, it won't matter to me at all whether doing it - whether I don't like doing it or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like any kind of training, which I don't mind too much. I certainly don't mind training as much as studying because training puts your mind on something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you mean you don't like the process that you go through?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't think I have anything to do with the process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My - like, this swim, I have no idea what I'm going to get into if I become the director of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, official title rather than just a - somebody that talks to the guys in charge. And the opportunity is there that I become the director. And I - you know, I'm probably going to end up hating it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think I'm going to take it just because - and all I really care about is a successful swim. I don't care (inaudible at 0:03:40.6). I don't care if I get any money for it really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you care about is making the swim come off...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, this is just - yeah, I mean, it's sort of idea formulating now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it seems to be in me to always have something pending that (inaudible at 0:03:58.7) be a good accomplishment. I mean, a lot of people are already thankful that I was able to get the people of the City of New York interested in swim, which they haven't been since the thirties.</p>

<p>So yeah, I think I know now by virtue of the fact that I have gone past another hurdle. I know now what my life is going to simply revolve around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, which is always working towards something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, something that I not myself necessarily have decided is at the time the most worthwhile thing to do or the best investment of my time. But it's something that at the moment of passing one hurdle, I have, you know, groping for another because I always seem to have to have that - well, that goal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's something that comes along that you take up, not necessarily you choose?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, yeah, I mean, I look back on it and everything is that way right from kindergarten when I used to have to be the first one in line to go out to recess (inaudible at 0:05:03.2) boots fastest (ph). You know, like, all morning that's all I'd worry about. Where are my boots, how (inaudible at 0:05:10.5) slip them on quickest, how was I going to buckle them so I'd be first in line because you had to be clever with your boots.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that, yeah, way back that it's always going to be something. And I also think it's going to be very well defined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It certainly has been now. It couldn't be more well defined than the difference between one grade and another, a passing grade and a failing grade or making the swim or not making it. Or a successful (inaudible at 0:05:36.9) what is clearly the determining factor, whether it will be continued in other years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I mean, it will be very clear who made it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you see, the - Colonel Riley, the guy that's in charge of (inaudible at 0:05:49.5) you said that if it's successful we'll continue it in other years. Well, there, you know, is my well defined, major goal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To keep it continuing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and the thing that seems to be driving me into it is - well, since I finished with the test and (inaudible at 0:06:05.2) other groups of people because, you know, I had more time. And the people I've been fooling around with are the people that I've met in swimming. And therefore, they know what's happening with the swim and they're all saying, great, great, tremendous (ph), keep it up. And I revel in it, you know? So I got to work with that, that's all. I mean (inaudible at 0:06:25.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's part of you that you now understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:06:30.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, the problem is, you see, that's just sort of like what I'm doing, what I'm spending my time doing. And I think it tells me a little bit about the way I think about things. But it doesn't tell me much at all other than by relation to personal - my personal life, you know, how I react personally to people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is what's going to drive me and what's going to occupy my time and my mind or my body. (Inaudible at 0:06:59.5) mind. So I think I got to try and figure out - maybe I can say, well, if this is what's driving my professional life and my time. Devoting my time and really my energies to, I mean, I could see there always being something going, and it might not be the thing I devote most of my time to. For instance, if I were working for years and years and years somewhere, and then I got going on some committee or something, I could see that that would be the thing, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just lately when I've been a student and been young that I can - when my thing that I'm working is all consuming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so you can see that throughout the rest of your life it won't be all consuming?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it won't be all time consuming; it will probably be always in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, at any rate, I - so, and those things are not - well, number one, they have to be defined. Number two, they're not defined by me. They're defined by circumstances and they're defined by what other people think about them. I think other people would really be pleased that I could (inaudible at 0:08:02.2) test, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And people are pleased now, you know, (inaudible at 0:08:06.4) word gets around, congratulations, you passed your test. So I must behave personally on a reasonably similar basis I would think. 0:08:20.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're wondering if you don't. (Inaudible at 0:08:24.2) trying to see if you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if I do, what would - all right, if I do, what would this imply?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it seems perfectly clear that - a hard sentence to end. I keep going back to why I came in here. I came in here because after personal relationships, I didn't like the way I did behave and it didn't seem honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know, I just don't know what to think about it other than anytime I confront a person, I consider, you know, that might be a - anytime I confront a person, I consider that person to be a challenge to me to make myself like to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:09:17.3) I want to win that person. Only two people in my entire life that I knew I was going to know for any (inaudible at 0:09:22.5) amount of time, that I ever decide not to try to make like me. And one is the reason who made them, there was another girl in high school that - where relationship deteriorated. I never had anyone I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When anything that I didn't do to him or for him wasn't in some way designed to please him. I mean, only in long standing relationships - I mean, like (inaudible at 0:09:46.9) my roommate now that I've been with for two years (inaudible at 0:09:48.8), I'm still doing things when - our relationship is - you know, I mean, we see each other quite often. And there's nothing I can really do to change his opinion of me because, you know, we used to live together for a couple of years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:10:03.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet, I still seem to be doing things...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you still spend your energies (inaudible at 0:10:07.0)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not - well, yeah, and it's not really a conscious thing. It's just like I seem to be drawn in to this swimming thing now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just seems - you know, at this point I could very easily say no to these people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, it's almost like you aren't doing it sort of (inaudible at 0:10:27.3). It's not exactly that you aren't doing it voluntarily, you are doing it voluntarily, but you aren't pushing for it. But you almost see yourself getting into this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See it happening to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's the same thing, but now rather than - well, the ultimate goal is to please the person. You know, I guess it's nearly as well defined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But are you saying in pleasing the people too, it's almost like you just see yourself doing that rather than you set out purposefully to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I'm drawn into it. I think I've just gotten - done so much all my life that there's, you know, there's no thought involved (inaudible at 0:11:10.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CLIENT: No thought at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you see, now unless - if I can ever get to the point now - well, here's an example. I'm meeting people now. There's a new roommate next door. And I'm meeting him in the group and I haven't been, like, introduced to him for the purpose to know him. I've just sort of seen him and he's going to be the new guy living next door.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:11:30.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's the way I might develop a reasonable relationship with the guy. I mean, if he only sees me, like, when I'm interacting with other people or just fooling around. But if I'm introduced to a person - and that always has happened when you're fixed up on a date or if you're meeting someone in a committee or something like that. You're really conscious of how you're interacting. Then I really am - you know, I'm doing a damn good job of acting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unfortunately, most people I'm meeting (inaudible at 0:11:59.1) there have (inaudible at 0:12:00.0). So that it's been a very dishonest...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're in a formal situation with them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't necessarily have to be formal in the sense of etiquette wise or anything else, but socially, yeah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Organized?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or something, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the confrontation between us is organized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So - and if I'm going to - I think it's, you know, it's something that's got to be lived with pretty much. There's not a lot of change in that (inaudible at 0:12:34.8) unless you want to try.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's something that you're - like you're trying to reconcile yourself to, say yes, this happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. And then trying - well - but, you see, I can't feel good about it, I really can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, it still bothers you that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, here's a good example. The people that know me well, people that - I mean, and of those, there are very few. I mean, you know, I know some people. But people that have lived with me for a couple of years or people that, like, I went through college or through high school with. When they see me interact with another person, they can tell that it's stilted (ph) very easily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they could tell I'm acting differently. And - well, I just don't think that should be. I just don't think it should be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really would like to act the same to everybody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just not consistent. It's not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think I'm going to have - yeah, even though my macro life is designed around - and I'm talking about the - you know, the goal thing is designed around pleasing people. I would very much like to change my micro life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To something that is a little bit more honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then it's awful hard to, you know - that's like saying you're honest in one part of your life and not honest in another. Because - or else you're not good enough at defining your own goals. That could be too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, it could be that - you mean part of the reason that you find yourself in goals, but you're not sure you want to be in is because you haven't clarified your (inaudible at 0:14:23.5). It's hard to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:14:27.3) because it seems to be the thing at the time that I'm drawn into.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, what's ever there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, without a lot of thought other than the thing that right now I'm chomping at the bit to do something. 0:14:41.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Three days of rest I can't get along with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like getting restless and wanting the first thing that's there (inaudible at 0:14:48.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's not something that I'm going to do that's not going to be recognized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is - it's not too disgusting. I mean, you know, it's not the best way - best state of things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, hmm, but you mean it's not too bad either?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because, you see, I think that I have my standards defined well enough so that I won't be doing anything that would comprise the standards (inaudible at 0:15:18.2) my personal life. Now (inaudible at 0:15:18.2), this - you know, this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything that would what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, wouldn't comprise my standards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Compromise you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Compromise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Excuse me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, in other...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the physicist tries to use big words he gets into trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words, it's like you do things for which you know you can get recognition.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't do things which violate something you (inaudible at 0:15:38.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like this - I mean, there are better things I could be doing with my time than organizing a swim, there really are. I'm sure I could find something. I could start to work on my thesis. I can do some good work in the lab. I can do some, you know, better things. But, you know, there's nothing really bad about organizing the swim. It's not like I'm, you know, becoming a crook.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:15:58.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or selling pornography to schoolchildren or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And perhaps I could do better, you know, but this is going to be okay. It's not harmful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, so I can live with that part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I could live - I'd be really fine now, I'm very happy and content with myself if that part of me were the same. If I were still (inaudible at 0:16:19.2), but I could be honest in personal relationships. Although I think it's almost the same phenomenon that is the same part of me that's striving to do the same thing. It's seeking the - well, seeking other people's - you know, other people being satisfied than me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, rather than you being satisfied yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I think I can put up with it on a macro level, but I (inaudible at 0:16:47.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you really want to change it is with people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, now the point is, though, is it possible to lead one's life - (inaudible at 0:16:59.3). I might as well - I think it boils down on both levels too, being honest to yourself and honest with other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:17:05.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other way I was not really honest. It's dishonest because you're being dishonest to yourself. That's not true, that's not true because you might be honest to yourself. But that doesn't matter because the important thing is the initial premise, the reason you're doing it is not honestly for yourself and honestly with other - you know, for other people. Well, (inaudible at 0:17:23.4). You know what I mean, I don't have to (inaudible at 0:17:26.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, well, what you're trying to decide is, is it possible to live honestly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it possible to live honestly on a micro level and not on a macro level?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is what it boils down to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's just too much to change. I mean, I live and breathe for, you know, sitting for six months and studying and passing an exam. Or training for six months, you know, just digging into something and killing myself and swimming the channel. That's it, I mean, that's what makes me go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So what you're saying is can I split it in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, can I personally...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, can I keep doing that, which is just so much a part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which - and yet, on a personal level be honest with people and not try to always do the best for their expectations and meet their expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. 0:18:18.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's sort of like saying you don't want to complete (inaudible at 0:18:27.2), just clean the points and a [lube job] ph, just want to run a little better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you're disappointed when you think of it that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know if that's a good analogy or not. I - well, I - going back to the old thing, if everyone ran their life that way - the way I idealize now - an honest micro level, maybe not honest macro level. It (inaudible at 0:18:55.7) get along I think.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think so, I don't think there would be any major problems (inaudible at 0:19:06.5). But is it possible for me to be honest on a personal level, effectively not honest in my life?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you split it like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I don't really know what honesty is in my life. I know how I want to be honest on a personal level, it's very simple. Just at any given point, not to think what that person wants to hear, but say what I feel. It's very simple to do, it's the simplest thing in the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I - when I'm here with you; just tell you how to do it before, tell you what I want to do with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The hard part is to do that you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. 0:19:44.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's easy to know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where...</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: My friend was saying that to me. She woke up at 7.30 and she was like: "Jodie, it is 7.30." I was like: "Oh my God!" She is my best friend since college - Paige - and she just got an internship at the new art library. She is my age - she is 32 years old - she is sort of indulging herself a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She is following her path. She has been in art school for the past number of years and I really am starting to feel that things are starting to come together for her, you know. She is hiding away a little bit at school I think. She has this story around money - like never had any money. So everybody, like, supports her. I feel for the first time her commitment is really starting to gel into something. She is getting a lot more confidence in her ability, probably figure out ways to make money from her talents and skills. I think it is really good all the people she is meeting at the museum and things like that.</p>

<p>So she is staying with me and we were up chatting - we had to really catch up. She is the person that precipitated me moving out to Arizona. And the whole time I was out there, she had a boyfriend so we didn't spend that much time together. We lived together when I first...that is who I moved out there with, when I first moved out there.</p>

<p>So obviously we were up chatting and I just couldn't fall asleep. I had a hell of a lot of work to do and I didn't really want to do...like expedited terms with real time (ph) all this week, every day, 200 pages (inaudible 2:13) I was wiped but I had a cup of tea to get through some of my reading and I have been sweet. Sorry - I am not entirely but I am a little groggy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is it like having her visit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is wonderful. I mean, I guess sometimes I feel like I had had a lot of visitors and I was starting to feel I was a little taken advantage of - I don't want them going in my space. It is a little different with Paige - she is like my sister. I am a little bit concerned that stuff puts some pressure on our friendship because when I come home - I really dislike my job so much - I come home pretty...like I was complaining a lot last night. I just wanted someone to feel sorry for me. "My God Jodie, you poor thing that you have to work so hard at this terrible job."</p>

<p>You know, we have both grown a lot - Paige and I - and a lot of it has to do with just maturing but it also just looking at life a little more spiritually. You know, we do the I Ching every morning. We are looking for some answers. I am proud of both of our accomplishments but like we were talking about it last night, like: "Paige, yeah I have this career that I can have a lot of money and that is great but I hate it. And your choice is, you are doing something that you love and you are not making any money out of it right now and it is hard for you at 32 to not feel like you ever had an accomplishment or a career but that is really the western way of thinking." I said: "In a way, you are already a step ahead of me because you are following your passion and then things will gel." I said: "I haven't even given up the fear of having my financial security to let the things I am supposed to be doing come."</p>

<p>So we both have the same problem - just from a different angle. You know what I mean? So that kind of gave a little bit of...shed some light and some perspective on the situation. At least we are not out there pursuing the "goal" of getting married, having kids, buying a house, getting that car. Instead it is about fulfilling our destiny - what we are supposed to accomplish when we are here on the planet. I said: "As we are doing that and as we are in action to do it - our service as God intended or whoever intended - those things will come into our lives."</p>

<p>So for me my biggest frustration or fear is that because I am not letting go of this - the court reporting; I keep pointing because the computer is in my bag - I am wondering if I am blocking myself from the other things to generate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is very much like what you were talking about with Pete last week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in my love life too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you were hanging onto that, then you would be blocking the possibility of having something new come into your life right now. You are holding onto something that feels secure at least in some ways and uncomfortable in other ways. It is preventing you from achieving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it is funny because those are the two areas...and you know, if you really think of it that way it is the same thing for my apartment. It is the thing that I know so I don't want to let go of it to make the whole leap to go to Arizona because I don't know. So maybe that is a pattern that I have built. Do you think a lot of people do that? (6:09)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hold on to something that is safe as opposed to taking risks? What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it is probably normal human behavior.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You prefer the safe to the risking? It sounds like it causes you a lot of distress sometimes to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well I feel stuck, you know. I think I am stuck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It also sounds like you feel like you shouldn't be doing that. You are asking if it is normal or not. I am wondering what is behind that question?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I am only me. My frame of reference is me. You see a lot of people maybe who have a lot of the same concerns or issues that come up so if they do then my frame of reference could be: "Yeah, most people feel like that." I just wonder if it is my life experiences that keep me stuck or if it is human behavior.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean if it is something that you can do something about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe something happened to me that I don't even remember. Something happened to me...like I was talking about this to Paige; she was talking about meeting someone who had a lot of money. She met somebody that she really liked and she goes to a learned psychic, a person that said: "What is blocking that is a big class distinction." He makes a lot more... you know, he is really like a trust fund person. So I tend not to be able to be so connected with people who have had so much because I come from nothing and I have had to really struggle and fight for everything. And thank God with my exercise program I am learning to give that up. I have just been letting things comes to me as opposed to like, with desire and force things to happen - like push my way into something and make it happen. It is more like letting things come to me more.</p>

<p>I said, you know: "All our experiences mold us. I come from a blue collar background. I mean, I come from a certain level of sophistication at home. My mother is French and she is a bit of an elitist but...my father was educated but he was too sick to have a real childhood. He was going to be an English professor but he went the route of his father - he was a stage actor. My father could quote Shakespeare. My step-father is a police dispatcher. I don't come from a white collar household but Paige does. Her parents hated her things. She inherently had a trust foundation in her make-up. (9:20)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you have mentioned that about her before. A number of sessions that you talked about her having a basic trust.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was my friend Ana. Ana has a trust fund. She trusts that life is going to take care of her and she behaves in a way that it is going to take care of her. And you know what? It takes care of her. I have the groove in my brain. "I work really hard to make this money, to take care of yourself." And what I am is a little gerbil - "ch,ch, ch, ch" (makes noise) - like on that wheel. I am trying to stop the wheel - get out, enjoy my life, get into the wheel, do a little bit of what I have to do, get out of the wheel. You know what I mean. So that is one of the reasons that I am here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I want my life to not be spurts of enjoyment while I am doing all this stuff. I just feel like I get up every morning to do the grind. I am not getting up every morning to enjoy my life. After I do the grind, then I can enjoy my time a little bit. It is like I am putting in my time. The courtroom is like that. It is also like a labor, in terms of a job. It is like a well paid civil servant. That is how I see myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that how you see yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just think I am far brighter and have many more talents that I could utilize and I am just getting tired of trying to make something happen to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There seems like there is a real gap between how you think things should be and how things feel like they are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess. I think that is over simplifying it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Defining it - I am not satisfied with maybe choices that I have made and my life is at a place where I am aware that things could be different and I don't know the steps to...I am not sure where I want to go therefore I feel a little stuffiness and inertia and it has sort of been the same thing over and over and over. It isn't like a new topic we are discussing. We are both aware of my issues and I don't know why I feel so...like I had my independent writers (inaudible 12:12) last Wednesday and everyone is telling me what a great thing I am doing and I am like: "Yeah, but where is it getting me? Yeah, but what good is that?" It is like if they have good intentions maybe something will come. But I was sitting there going: "I don't even know if I want to be in this crazy industry. Look at these people: none of them are working; none of them are making any money."</p>

<p>I actually have a date on Sunday with somebody whom I admire. He is the guy that is responsible for the book I am reading now. That is not why I admire him. I admire him because he is an artist. He is just really smart - he is a really smart guy and he is interesting. For some reason I like him. He is so cute. He is passionate about his work. He does big sets or something. He works for a company that builds sets and does creative things. We were talking and I was like: "Ethan, do you think you could come over to my apartment and help me pick out some out paint colors and things? I have been overwhelmed; I have this really cool apartment - old cove moldings (ph) and things but I can't decide on my color palate. And he said: "Absolutely, that is what I do for a living." And I said: "I know - that is why I asked you." (chuckles) And he said: "Yeah, let us do that and grab breakfast or something or hang out." And I said: "Okay, I have been meaning to call you to do something but I have been really busy. Since the new year I have had one job after another blah blah blah." So I don't know if it is like a "date" date. I don't know if he thinks I'm pretty or nice or wants to get to know me on any kind of level or as a friend. I don't know, I am not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. The beer will kick in I am sure. It gets there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about that process - the beer kicking in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is never really conscious fear - I just call it that because there is a fine line between keeping someone as a friend you know. It is much safer to keep Ethan as a friend because of his position, the business and where he is going. If he owns and runs these Chicago studios over in Lincoln Park and I am in the business, we need to have a nice working relationship. I am going to be doing some of the things that I think...if I...I just feel: "Am I going to follow my exercise path or follow this movie path?" And I wanted to talk to you about that too. Do I proceed on going after one or should I just wait for something to happen? But anyway, I don't know. I should just wait and see what happens - I have no control. Let us say I like him a little bit. I am afraid to risk it. (15:30)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what are you afraid to risk?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am afraid that if we get involved and we start to spend time together, and we date, and he gets to know me and I get to know him. And he may not like me once he really gets to know me. And then if we don't see each other any more I may still have to deal with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if he spends too much time with you and gets to know you; first of all he won't like you possibly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there is always the possibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the fear comes up sometimes. You mentioned it before - worrying that people can see behind the surface?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I am a really beautiful person and I know I am good but, you know, I am not perfect. There are definitely aspects of me that are, you know...I don't know, we would have to get to know each other but I am just afraid that in the process if things...I would always rather keep so much as a safe distance as my friend so that they do like me as opposed to...you know what it is when you go out with someone and you really start to care about them and then something happens and you don't like each other and you break up. It is usually a very uncomfortable space. Although I think as I am getting older - it is not like I am a teenager anymore. We are pretty much two mature adults in a relationship. But that is what I am here for. Needing him in a certain way as a professional contact and somebody that I would do business with. And why not? To feel comfortable and clean - and so maybe not wanting to invest that risk. Who knows? Maybe we will fall madly in love and spend the rest of our lives together. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there are a number of things that you are afraid of in this process. (17:57)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is funny because my friend Ben who I went out with last...Saturday I think I told you I was going out with him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: M-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is my friend who has been in AA for 15 years. He is so wonderful and we would make a powerful team together. I said to him: "If you and I were together we would be healing the world." Because he speaks like three times a week at AA meetings. He is a personal trainer and got really into weights. I think I helped him. I had a friend from Canada who called me yesterday to tell me she was taking up exercise courses. Obviously I am affecting people around me in a positive way. I said: "You know, we would be like, dynamo." But I sense that when I talk to him about certain things, there are fundamental things that we don't click on. I was on the phone with him and I was explaining to him how profound exercise is for me. That it moves moves me. It is a profound experience. Almost every time I go to class it really just...it moves me, maybe in the way like when Michelangelo was painting. He was just so inspired but that is how I feel when taking a spinning class. I was telling him how much emotional feeling I had had and how I cried and things like that. He was so insensitive. He is like: "Hey, are you one of those type of girls that cry when you orgasm?" I was like: "Well if I do, you will never know. And you will never know." Because right then I completely shut down. I was just like: "I can't believe this. Here is my friend who I have known a long time, telling him something very important to me. I was being very vulnerable and he just, like, I can't believe that he said that. I thought it was so insensitive and mean. And right there and then I knew I would never trust myself to be involved with that kind of man. That one thing. I was like: "That is it."</p>

<p>And then he said that one of his guilty pleasures is he watches wrestling. And then we had a conversation and I was supposed to go out to dinner tonight. He mentioned some place and I was like: "Do they serve any vegetarian food?" And you could tell, he got like: "Would I take you to anywhere that wasn't a nice restaurant Jodie?" Just little things like...we don't click. So it is like, it is not just he looks great and I love him and he is all these things. Fundamentally, on an organic thread somewhere, for me I don't feel like we click. So never presume anything with Ben. I need to trust my instincts on that, you know what I mean. Trust that we are not that connected. (20:57)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds clear for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then on the flipside of it, is that wrong?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Explain how you would be wrong? What would be wrong?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe if I pursue and let him get closer (inaudible 21:15) all that stuff would go away. It is like a choice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On one level you feel you should trust your instincts and on another level you think you can't trust your own instincts?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not like I don't think I can, I think...maybe I should trust my instinct because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let us take a look at what that maybe is for a second.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the thing is with my exercise and things - my meditation - I am learning to feel things on a gut level that I have to just go with and I am really straight. So even when I have dinner with Ben tonight, I was going to tell him because he is pretty self-actualized. I was going to say to him: "Ben, as much as you like me - I think you like me..." Because he has always had this crush on me. "...I am getting this feeling that the more you see of me, the more you are seeing that we are not..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you think he is seeing some of the things you are feeling about him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that he is seeing me for who I really am and maybe seeing that it is not a good fit either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is how you feel about him. You feel like you are beginning to see some things about him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have always felt like that. I have always had him at a sort of arm's distance. He has objectified me a little bit and had me a bit on a pedestal. Like the night we were going to go out to dinner, he was like: "Oh, I can't believe I am going out with Jodie." It was kind of like he was so excited about it. I guess, to know me. I don't think he likes to be around such an intelligent woman. He says he does but his old girlfriend was not very smart. I think he likes to be able to eat good cheese.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in this case, then why..you have been getting to know some of your strengths might be a bad thing as far as the two of you connecting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am okay with us not connecting as long as we can still effectively be friends because I really like him and admire him. I love him - he is a great person. I don't want to jeopardize that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to jeopardize? You want to hang onto what is safe and comfortable and protective?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I value it for what it is and I want to protect it for what it is. I think I am pretty clear. I should be friends with him. And if later on I start to feel differently I will approach it. I think that is what I should do. But anyway, that is neither here nor there. I feel like I just want some answers about stuff. I want Prince Charming to climb in and sweep me off my feet and carry me away on the white horse (chuckles). You know? It would be nice to fall into somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about that - falling into?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, to kind of rely on somebody once in a while. Be vulnerable - show somebody (inaudible 25:05) Just...come when you are ready. Your soul mate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you believe in a soul mate? Do you think that is a reality?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Believe in a, sort of, ultimate connection with this one person for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There may be more than one but there are certain people that you have really connected to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am not sure I understand exactly what you mean by that. Why don't you tell me a little bit more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you ever heard of the term "soul mate"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have a definition of soul mate?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do I have a definition for soul mate? I guess so. I am kind of curious to know what you mean by that. One of the reasons I am asking is we talked last week about a sort of a felling you have - and you mentioned it again this week - that there is a certain way things are supposed to be. This morning, we talked about the feeling like a way God - or someone - thinks things are supposed to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where I think we are too much attached that it is supposed to help. I mean, we could say the way I want them to be, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am a little frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what are you frustrated about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel we have been going around and around with the same stuff. And I am go around and around with the same stuff. I just can't, you know, figure stuff out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me more about what is happening right now that you are getting frustrated? (27:00)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just tired. I am frustrated. It is like I want some big epiphany or something. Maybe everything in my life is great and I am just a big whiner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You also asked me a direct question and I didn't answer it. How do you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckles.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You came right out and asked me what I felt about soul mates and I tried to turn it around and get a little more from you. How did that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just felt like you were doing your job. You have a different agenda than I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You talked about that being frustrating for you. I just do my job when I keep a professional distance. I wonder if you are feeling that a little bit now? Something about the way we are relating is frustrating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I jut accept it. You know, however it is, whatever goes on in here, however it is. As me not necessarily knowing what is happening and just trusting that something is unfolding here. It doesn't feel like other types of therapy that I have had and I am just hoping that it is going somewhere and I am just trusting this process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the things we talked about at the end of last session is that sometimes you do get frustrated with the process, with me, with the way we are relaying and how we can talk about that, then that might be helpful. That is one of the ways in which this therapy works. And you mentioned that you are sort of reluctant to do that sometimes because you don't want to hurt my feelings or make things difficult. I am wondering if you are feeling some of that now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit but what am I going to do. It is like...I can't...I am just trusting you to lead me somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me a little bit more about the "what can I do?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know Tom. I don't know. I don't know. I cannot define it but I am starting to feel like I am not making any progress.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mentioned a number of times today feeling like: "Well we have already been here. We have already talked about this. We have already said this." So are you really beginning to feel that we are going over the same ground again? (30:03)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in a bad way but I just am feeling...all this inertia that is stuck in my life - now it is coming into the room. I just would like life to not feel like it is a grind. I would like it to feel that it is pleasurable. I have less depression maybe so that is good. I feel like being (inaudible 30:42) places was good for me. It is like staying in one place, things could happen around me. It is good. That feels good because I am able to...in September I will be able to go to Arizona. And maybe do what I want to do. A lifestyle choice. I told my mother not to be surprised if I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pack up and leave?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And make it a real move and not a knee-jerk reaction from my divorce and that I am not running away because I am unhappy here and that I am running away from my feelings. It is like a real conscious decision. As much as I love Chicago...there are things I hate about Chicago and love about Chicago. There are things I love about Arizona and hate about Arizona. And if I changed my career I think I could pursue it in Arizona with less stress. Because the things that are important to me are, like, the garden and doing outdoor activities and being able to ski. I could probably start a gym practice out there - really in a nice place with a garden. Here in Chicago I live in a box. There are great restaurants; the people are interesting; and be by myself all the time but never be lonely. There are pros and cons to these places.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am just noticing; we were talking a little bit about your immediate frustration. Your frustration here started when you asked me about being soul mates.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like really, where I land, where I am supposed to, is going to come again but I do really feel that people are pulled to be in certain places. Like they love the mid west and would never leave Chicago. They know emphatically. Or they want to be this or they want to do that. Look, I don't feel as so much emphatic about anything and picking a place to live is important because from that springs lots of other things. I am tired of being a nomad. I would like to meet someone. I would like to have a family in a traditional sense yet have other interesting things going on in my life. When I talk about a big place to settle down, it is not going to happen. (33:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am wondering - connecting that to some of the other things you have said - if one of the things you would like is that somehow I could give you an answer to that question of where you should live or whether you should...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not even an answer but maybe a way to sit down and figure out how do you make such a decision on where to live? What do you base that decision on? Some people base it on because they love their career, their job moves and they have to go somewhere. Or with some people it is just because that is where they were raised so they stay. Or some people hate the cold and they have to be in the sunshine all the time and they go. For me it is like my roots are here, my great apartment - I have a good apartment here with good rent. Money keeps me form leaving court reporting and a decent apartment here in Chicago keeps me from leaving Chicago because I don't want to give either one of them up - the fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is kind of how we started talking about the session - safety versus the risk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think that is pretty fundamental. I think that I know that on conscious level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No big revelation about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. It is like: "How do I pass that point?" To feel good about my decision and confident that the decision is right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds to me like one of the things you are really longing for - really wishing for - is for someone to take a little bit of that burden off of you. I think the way you put it today was to "fall into someone" - the Prince Charming, the kind of...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but that is just...that is not serious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A bit of a playful fantasy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, my mother raised me to take care of myself and not lean on anybody else, which could be part of the problem too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because I don't allow anybody usually. I think my mother probably emasculates people. I know (inaudible 35:23) I sort of make it appear that I don't need anybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is a part of you that wants to be very independent - very strong, not let people recognize that you need them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there is a part of me that is very strong and is very independent and that is who I am. I don't need people - I have a lot of friends. I am very close to a lot of people - I just don't have a significant other. (36:08)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In this situation - in a therapy situation - a lot of things get brought into the room. Issues about vulnerability, opening up and also getting yourself up from the process for a lot of the things you have been talking about. I am wondering if there is something you really want or something you really need from this process that you feel you are not getting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe it is just today - I am not in such emotional pain. I guess I should be going to a career counselor, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So talk about more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know Tom. I think that in 45 minutes it is just so hard to get to any deep core issues. Maybe the fact that my sister died when I was eight years old and then my father went crazy after that is something that keeps me getting into a healthy and serious relationship with a man. At that level I am afraid of loving someone that much. I don't know, I am speculating but I would like to explore those things so that I can have a healthy relationship. I mean, I don't know if it is just because I haven't met the right person or there is a way of who I am that prevents me from having all these beautiful people - something gelling with them. You talk about a soul mate. Pete is like the only person that crossed my path that I was, like, it just gelled and it happened and it all fell together. I was really open - I was this wide open when I met him. Now I am this closed shut. It is really hard for someone to get in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are a lot obstacles?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So that is what I really feel. I need to get in there. And I have a strong spiritual life so that gives me hope and strength. I am not as fearful. I have worked through a lot of really deep-seated fear. Of being a middle class housewife living in suburbia, driving a station wagon - which I was. Like I know it is never who I am going to be. Even if I did live there, I still have my inner world that is very rich. You know, to ever have an intimate relationship with somebody the way I did with Pete? I don't know. I definitely...when I was vulnerable because I left my marriage, I would throw myself in and try it. Now it doesn't seem so much of a possibility. (39:18)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems impossible for you to let your guard down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems unsafe. It doesn't seem prudent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel like you are risking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like sometimes other people are not good enough. You know, I think my standards are a certain...I don't feel a connection. I don't know. I don't think there is (inaudible 40:14) As much as I think I want it to be that way. That is why I am sure I am not because we wouldn't be having this conversation. I certainly have met my share of interesting people - I just haven't met the right person. It is almost like I have a key.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that key would...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would make me feel comfortable enough to get closer. Spend more time with them. Put something else on hold to do something with them. You know, like make them a priority. Nobody is a priority right now except me. I am the priority.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am wondering if you feel like it is difficult when you come here to open up either way? (41:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I find it a little bit more difficult to open up here in our inter-reaction for some reason than I normally do. I really am pretty open. I just think that the more grounded I get and the less...I am not as vulnerable so...I guess because none of my issues seem to be desperately pressing. I mean, come on, there used to be a time in my life when I left my marriage I was rocky - guilt and remorse and pain. I would just come in every day and break down. I wanted to live in my therapist's office - I wouldn't even want to leave because it was the only place I felt safe. I am pretty self-sufficient I just feel dissatisfied in certain areas. It is all cyclical. Sometimes I come in here and I feel much I am much worse than others. I am just like everybody else - I want to be loved. I want to love. I want to be loved. And have a life with somebody. I just feel like I am (inaudible 43:19). Maybe I just have to be accepting of that. (inaudible 43:26) I have been in the growth period for a long time. Now I feel like I am...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not sure which way to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am sort of like on the runway, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Waiting for clearance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do I go to Bermuda; do I go to Europe, do I...? You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the things you talked about just now is the sense that there are some things you want to explore. You talked about: "Is there something about me that makes it hard for me to make these decisions." There is a way in which you want to explore. There are some things that you feel are holding you back. Some things as concrete as the time limit. And other things that are more nebulous. And that seems in a lot of ways pretty similar to things that are bothering you in your life. You want to explore relationships; you want to explore jobs; and there is something that is preventing you from doing that. I think it might be helpful for us to continue to talk about what is it that is making it difficult here to explore some things that you really would like to explore. What is making it hard to talk about those things? Because I have a feeling they are probably similar to the things that are making it hard for you to explore outside. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is all the time we have got for today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is our session number today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Twelve.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, thank you. (45:07)</p>

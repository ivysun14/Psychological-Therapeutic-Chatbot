<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________
THERAPIST: Hey.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:01:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I read through your e-mail. (PAUSE) What’s on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You didn’t reply. (PAUSE) I really feel upset. (inaudible at 00:01:51)</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:02:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it’s for other reasons but it’s not (inaudible at 00:02:27)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m sorry that I didn’t reply.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you do it to provoke me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I wouldn’t do that.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not sure.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I’m not sure that (PAUSE) that you didn’t read it because (inaudible at 00:03:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, why didn’t you reply?</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um... (PAUSE) Hmm...</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Believe it or not, like it wasn’t meant to provoke you. (PAUSE) That would be manipulative. [00:06:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So? (PAUSE) It also might be illustrative. (PAUSE) And it might... There might be a... I guess there might be a bigger risk to replying because like really what are you going to say, than to not replying. And also not replying could be useful and illustrative and... (PAUSE) Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:07:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I guess the two thoughts I remember having were, one, I remember intending to. And another one was it crossed my mind that I was going to see you today.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (PAUSE) When you smiled at me yesterday (inaudible at 00:07:45) a lot of thoughts went through my head as things that you were thinking in your head? Will you tell me why you were smiling after I tell you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably not. [00:07:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you should.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it’s the nice thing to do. (PAUSE) So I was thinking (PAUSE) Jeremy thinks I’m your most difficult patient which I think is possible. So that comes up for me sometimes.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:09:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: “Of course I didn’t get you extra time fucker. You were late and you didn’t talk the whole time.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: “Get out of here!” (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Am I that easy to read? No, I kidding. That’s not what I was thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think that’s what I would be thinking. And then the other thing I was thinking is like what I think when Jeremy asks for a foot rub after getting an hour long foot rub. Like he asks for one like ten minutes later or he asks for a third foot. I just think, “You’re such an ingrate!”</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:10:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sometimes that comes out really strong for me.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. But I just... (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:10:59)</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:11:00]</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:12:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (PAUSE) I guess it seems to me that it sounds like you feel a little guilty about it, you also want some like indications or assurances of ways you’re getting to my by pushing on me. Like that... [00:13:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like indications of being that you give me extra time or that I provoked you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to not give me extra time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...I have a reaction to you’re asking me about it yesterday that indicates that the question which is sort of a push on me and then the asking me about my reaction which is another sort of a push on me like gets to me and gets me stirred up even if it’s critical, even if I think of something critical towards you.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it’s important to me to...</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you want to get to me one way or another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I get to you even if you think it’s critical...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you were critical. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don’t know that I care that much that you’re critical about it. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like the negative kind of part of it isn’t the important part so much as the sort of like immediate personal reaction on my part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn’t ask you to provoke you. I think you think that too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was really surprised that you had such a, that your expression was so strong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So naturally I want to know what that was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was observing...</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:15:00]</p>

<p>I was just observing that you didn’t give me extra time and that felt bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a little more accusatory than as you say it just that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn’t express that feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it came out as like, “And why not you fucker?”</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) But then immediately it was like, “Of course I didn’t get extra time today.” That was not an illogical jump because I’m sure it has nothing to do with how I feel the session is going. [00:16:03]</p>

<p>I don’t know. The whole thing was very charged and it just came out. Like I saw the clock...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I just said it and then could sort of... It has driven me a little crazy and you got in the way and (inaudible) in a way that in the last day, also by not replying to the last e-mail, that I feel is... (PAUSE) I don’t know. Like turbulent and things don’t feel right. (PAUSE) And plus (inaudible) that things normally do feel right. I think they do. [00:17:09]</p>

<p>(inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, I’m sure you hadn’t thought about the short sleeved shirt to my dad to the extra time comment, like the contact switches and that’s sort of been on my mind too. [00:17:57]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I’m smiling because (inaudible at 00:18:03) (PAUSE) I was mostly thinking about the short sleeved shirt comment that it seemed like a nice kind of bringing together of like me being less covered or you being less covered. (PAUSE) The question about the extra time seemed to me to...</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You didn’t give me extra time today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I heard it thinking back now, because we’re talking about it, I think I heard it as like, “Hey, am I not that special?”</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it... That’s what I felt when I looked at the clock and like it’s 9:15. Really?</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:20:00]</p>

<p>It reminds me of when like my mom won’t lie sit that much and just like hang and chat. She loves it. She’ll do it like when she has time and peace of mind but, you know, like a weeknight dinner or something. I’m the slowest eater in the family. And so she’ll like get up and there’ll be like a semi reaction. “Mom! Like it’s 8:30. Where are you going?” Like, “No. Don’t go! Don’t you want to sit here for longer?” [00:21:07]</p>

<p>And she’s sort of like, “Okay.” Or she’s like, “No, I’m fine.” I guess this is like after she will like (inaudible) and not join the table when everybody’s eating. She’ll join later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She’ll get up early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying that that sort of similar instance where you feel like a bit ungrateful because you’re done all this stuff and you wanted to leave? I’m not sure what that means.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I didn’t make that connections but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>And you also do, I guess, with her in that instance as well sort of turn it around but... (PAUSE) With it switched from, “Hey, I’m hurt because you’re doing this thing to me,” to like, “What are you doing?”</p>

<p>CLIENT: What’s wrong?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (SIGH) Yeah. That’s right. I don’t know. I don’t like it going the other way around for some reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean where it starts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, like where it starts. It’s more comfortable turned around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I’ like... I’m happy to be the one who like wants more time. I don’t feel uncomfortable about that. I feel uncomfortable like being the one who’s hurt and then it’s like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think passive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That’s a pretty passive thing although it leaves the option for me saying no. And then it’s like much sadder. It’s like incredibly sad. [00:23:59]</p>

<p>It’s much sadder for you than for me. Plus like who wants to stick around and spend more time with a hurt person? It’s not like I’m hurt. Spend more time with me and soothe me. It’s like, hey, I’m not done yet and I’m hurt that you would leave now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that in itself would make me not want to spend more time with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was the thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I’m done talking about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:25:00]</p>

<p>I can see, I’ll just say one more thing, how my not responding to your e-mail kind of reiterated some of what happened then in that hour yesterday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it’s dumb that... It’s dumb that things that happen outside of here have to matter. It’s not fair. I don’t feel like it’s fair to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know that. It’s not as though I imagine that they don’t or... You know what I mean? I’m not saying like (PAUSE) you’re irresponsible you could think and not appreciate that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I would especially when the days feel like so long because like everything is like this really hard practice. It’s hard. It’s just really hard and then like meditation is hard. So yesterday’s day was like, “Blah, blah, blah, hard, hard, hard,” but like biking to the 6PM sitting. [00:26:11]</p>

<p>They’re all good things but I feel like they’re the right things to be doing but it’s like we sit for 45 minutes and I’m like, “The day is still going on?” I think I feel like a different person often at the end of sitting so it’s like hard. (inaudible at 00:27:45) I painted for three hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Much of that as fueled by being upset.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:28:00]</p>

<p>(inaudible) I mean, it’s not like (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This can be extremely hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This can be extremely hard.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:29:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think you’ll be able to (PAUSE) like use the things that I wonder about you? Like analytic like... [00:30:05]</p>

<p>Instead of like constant confrontation with the boundary? (PAUSE) Do you think you could help facilitate that?</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Well, there is a solution and that way you can (inaudible) instead of whatever is on your mind. [00:31:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it makes up a lot of what’s on my mind and I feel like sometimes the focus is on like whether or not you’re going to answer and like how that makes me feel and... (PAUSE) I wonder why you did this because I told you once that I don’t like it as much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn’t remember that. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s okay. But it was in the context of like if you asked me if it’s because you feel like, I feel like you’re like setting things up for me, arranging things for me or something. [00:32:21]</p>

<p>That was like... I remember getting upset about like the fact that there are tissues here, the fact that it’s like, “Here’s a tissue.” (LAUGHTER 0</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you didn’t remember that. That makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I, in fact, did not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I completely forgot what I was talking about. [00:33:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Questions and boundaries...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wanting to ask things and mostly being upset or worried I won’t answer, upset if I don’t answer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like part of that is your response. It’s like sometimes all I get from you is that like you’re sad that I’m asking it or that it’s sad or like you say, “I won’t answer that,” and then it’s like the end of the conversation. [00:34:01]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>And I think there’s more to be done with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Well, I’m... (PAUSE) That feeling where you’re mentioning your sadness is being kept out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It’s really sad. But I think it’s also, I think there’s something (inaudible at 00:34:39) that we could pay attention to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, perhaps I’ve been mistaken but one thing we could pay attention to is like why you’re asking about such and such at such and such a time. [00:35:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which you don’t do that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. We don’t. I would think that, you know, what would lead you to know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like what do I imagine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And I... Those are all in my mind like very reasonable potentially useful sort of questions to follow in context of what we’re talking about (inaudible at 00:35:39) generally not to pursue things like that because I imagined, perhaps wrongly it sounds, that you would feel like I was sort of trying to avoid your sadness and frustration with me. [00:35:57]</p>

<p>Do you know what I mean? Like if you say, “I want to know such and such,” and I say, “I won’t answer but I wonder why you want to know or wonder what you imagine,” I guess my assumption has been that you feel like I was trying to kind of sidestep having upset you or, you know, where the intensity is in that moment. But I may be wrong about that. But I just was trying to explain...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you’re right. I think you’re right. I think it would seem like that. I think we’re spend quite a lot, quite enough time acknowledging that it upsets me. I know that you know. I’m wondering if it would be comforting to talk more about. [00:37:09]</p>

<p>I mean, just to like have more space because (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you’re right. My not asking those questions also has the effect anyway of shutting it down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean... Yeah. Not that you don’t care about it but more...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do I go with it? Where do you go with it/</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:38:55]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just now went to the like big garden of like things I wonder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) was like I wonder about the difference between your daughters and (inaudible) a lot more than the other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:39:51) in particular.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wonder (inaudible) one of them is like one parent and the other changes a different day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now I wonder if one of them is a lot like you and I wonder if one of them doesn’t smile as much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean I don’t smile very much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean, maybe as a kid. (PAUSE) Maybe as a kid there was heaviness.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:40:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if I had been like serious as a kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s such a good question. I think this is already very useful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. (PAUSE) Well, if you say so then I’m quite sure it is. (LAUGHTER) I, on my own, wouldn’t have been able to say that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think you would be really, really different than how I was as a kid. But I’m wondering if... [00:41:03]</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>I’m wondering if that’s just the way my family and environment was like to it made me feel and think that I was sort of like an unhappy kid. I would feel incredible compassion (PAUSE) for you and want to hold your hand and hug you.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s very kind.</p>

<p>(PAUSE)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I also feel scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those are things that would make me feel very sad and scared for you that you had to fight them or be with them.</p>

<p>(PAUSE) [00:43:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that makes me wonder if, well, on one hand, I have no doubt those things are really really true, but it also makes me wonder if you are all three of us, both my daughters and me, my daughters in a sense of the happier one who smiles more and at least, externally, looks like you or at least (inaudible) and like the other one who maybe is also like you in certain ways that you weren’t aware of and also like me in that I think you’re both sort of afraid for and caring for, you know, those ways you were that weren’t really acknowledged. I don’t mean that to negate what you said or to untrue it. They probably are true. [00:45:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. (PAUSE) Alright. Ready to decide when to say we should stop. (inaudible at 00:45:31)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. I think we should probably stop.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me know if that's - the sun's in your eyes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, it's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That can bother you in the morning sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have to go to bed this early, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, yeah. So I ended up walking because of the buses, so anyway... And I was a mess, that walk (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As long as it's not raining so I stay warm (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And it's not too humid, so... Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:00:50] to 00:00:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something I was thinking about actually a lot on Friday was about how I was talking about, umm, that - you know, how the wife and I are, you know, managing this process pretty well. I mentioned that, you know, she's not thinking as far ahead as I would like her to be, you know, the past several weeks. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:01:31] to 00:01:34)</p>

<p>CLIENT: In some ways I see it as a problem only if I choose it to be. I mean in some ways I think I'm almost envious of having that - how do I say this in a positive way? Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:01:54] to 00:01:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The presence of mind to be focused on the here now as opposed to what needs to be done in the future.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:02:08] to 00:02:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want - you know, of course, there's things that you balance. And I think I'm far tilted to this way and she's generally tilted to the other way. Yeah, sometimes she surprises me (chuckling), when she picks something up that I didn't think she, you know, would think of, whatever. But...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:02:38] to 00:02:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:02:44] to 00:02:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm trying to think about that in a way that it's an asset. I don't know how they (ph), umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:02:59] to 00:03:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't call it a flaw, but just something that...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:03:03] to 00:03:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something that I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, when is it [you're slow] (ph) and when is it a bit more?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Uh, hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:03:15] to 00:03:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's useful or it's even healthy I think, when, umm, we're trying to spend time together, and I've got my mind on all these things that need to be done or I haven't thought of yet or whatever. And I guess it gets in the way when she doesn't think of things that are - that only affect her, like her prescriptions for herself (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's not on your list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, it's not... Everything on my list affects me and affects both of us. And I think I'm trying to compensate for the fact that I'm thinking for the both of us. And it's my trust that - I mean I don't know. If I were - if I could trust that she would think of these things...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:32] to 00:04:37)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I don't know, I think the pressure would be off of me some.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But how do you communicate that someone needs to be forward-thinking about things that they're not used to thinking about, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:49] to 00:04:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know, like yesterday... I know I do this, too, because I have witnessed it. But yesterday, you know, it's like the second day, when she was taking these financial documents and tearing them off like this as a way of shredding them, and I said, "I don't know. It's going to take you forever. Let's just put it in a pile and we'll take it someplace to shred it," you know. "No, I like shredding." You know, like really.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:05:30] to 00:05:34)</p>

<p>CLIENT: When we're supposed to be packing our bins to know exactly what to tell the shipping company that she's handling, you know, today, what a lot of our dimensions are, and she got so far on that, you know. And then when I got home last night - I don't know where I'm going with that - she was going through old letters from friends and cards and things like that, that, you know, she can do that after. She'll get two weeks when she can actually go through the stuff and decide what she wants to keep and what she wants to throw away, because she's going to send them off to her dad anyway. And so at that point, I get to home, I say, "You know, so we need to tell the shipper tomorrow what is going, right?" "Yeah." And "So is everything in that room going?" "Yup." "Are you sure? Because there are some things in there that look like they're, I don't know, not going." She was in there. [00:06:33]</p>

<p>So she spent an hour into the night having to go through things. And so there's this kind of like extreme this side - I don't know, extreme this side. And when I suggest, you know, something, it's almost like - and I know she needs that time to just do something mindless and useless in order to just kind of be... And I do it, too. I mean I was - I obsess over how clean the - or how organized the screws are for the bracket that holds the TV that I'm selling, because I want to make sure that that - there's nothing that will stop this person from buying this product from me, you know. And it's like I could have thrown it all in the box and said "It's all in there," and they probably wouldn't have known the difference. [00:07:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think - so again, I know I - I obsess about these things as well. And I don't know if it's just a need that we all have; that sometimes you need to just kind of be, like, in [meditation in] (ph) something, and I don't know. So I guess that's the only thing that... I don't want to make it seem like - like from last time; that she's doing this a certain way and I'm not. Or she's not being helpful when you're right there at times when a (inaudible at 00:08:04) and times when it is not, and so... [00:08:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and you think as a general trait you guys have this different style?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there are times when, you know - meaning your way - is probably more useful than maybe her way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And may - you know, this is probably one of those times when being very goal-oriented and detail-oriented is really useful here; packing up your - moving to another country. In the moment will probably be really useful when you get there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All I've ever done: Packing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckling). That's hard, and it can be hard to watch someone with a different style at a time when you feel like your style would work more efficiently at this particular time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or you're trying to compensate for their style, you know, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so one of the things that might help: You're not going to change her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially not this week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling). No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, you know, one of the things that you've been thinking of is what would makes it - what would make it easier for you to cope with the fact that she's gotten to do it mostly her way? What's the worst that will happen if the estimate is off or the - oh, yeah, or you give your estimate daily?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trying to give a - all right. So if it goes her way, what's the biggest disaster? [00:09:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have thought of that, and, you know...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:09:33] to 00:09:37)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially in terms of I'm trying to keep things as small and efficient as - a small footprint of things [that should] (ph) as possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think, okay, what's the risk again? It costs an extra 50 bucks, 100 bucks? I don't care. But in another example, I asked her a week ago to find some sort of international health insurance that we can get because our insurance ends tomorrow, and she hasn't found one yet. And it's like this is - because I've been there - where you're not covered; you know, overlaps. I've been there, where it's impossible to get insurance. [00:10:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And anyway... And so for me, I think for her she hasn't seen the worst that can happen, so the consequences aren't there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think if she - I don't know if it needs to happen, where it just, you know, falls through the cracks in order for that kind of awareness to be learned. I don't know, but I - kind of like this one; I don't want to risk it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well, so that's sort of a good exercise to think about what are the worst-case - you know, what are the worst-case scenarios of her doing it her way? And then it's thinking but which tasks are you guys better suited to handle? You know, maybe, you know, like weeding through and sorting out. Maybe that's something better for her to be - you know, for it to be on her list, because if it doesn't go the way you want it, it's a monetary inconvenience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it's not going to make or break you. It would be great if you could be as efficient as possible and save the hundred bucks, but - you know, or whatever. [00:11:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's - you can deal with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like insurance if you want to be on that today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's not the consequence you want to cope with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know, stuff like selling stuff on Craigslist. That would be great if you could sell the more valuable items.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if - you know, if you hand that over to her, and some of the stuff that probably you could have sold doesn't get sold, you can donate it, take a tax write-off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I mean everything - just thinking about what makes - what's easier for you to cope with, watching it get done, not your way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Well, and part of it I think is a control issue, because I don't - she's never posted anything on Craigslist. She's never posted anything on eBay. She doesn't know how it works, and that - [00:12:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She could probably figure it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She could, or I could show her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't have to do it, but at the same time, it's like the whole scope of what we have, she doesn't even know what it's worth. She doesn't know, you know... And I just - I know it's my fault because I've kind of handled all these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been your domain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:12:32] to 00:12:38)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it would be empowering for her to be able to get a glimpse of some of the things that have become, to her, your domain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, when I handed over the finances to her, which I had maintained through all of her graduate school and, you know, up until the point where I started school and said, "This is yours now," and...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:13:01] to 00:13:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a learning curve.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was and there still is. And, you know, I just - and suddenly I think it's just not being present, because it's...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:13:17] to 00:13:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, her vice is reading People on her phone, which, fine, you know, whatever. I do Scrabble. We have our vices. But, you know, it's - it's hard for me to accept that when things are falling through the cracks, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So anyway, I guess as I say these things, I began to realize that, you know, goal-oriented means stating the goal and the deadline for it. And, you know, I may have said to her a week ago, "Can you find some insurance February (ph)," and now we're at the end of the month. I need to say, "Can you find insurance by the end of the day," you know, because I don't think something as remote as the end of the month is - just isn't pressing. [00:14:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and the way that your awareness of - today's the 30th, tomorrow is the 31st, or am I off by that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She might - because she is more in the moment than you are, she may not realize that the month is about to turn over on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she has a vague idea, but I think it's - yeah, it's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. But for you it's not vague.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so that might be - you know, part of it is just - yeah, she might look in her cabinet. "Oh, it's August 1st. Aw, I was supposed to get insurance by today."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Darn. Yeah, yeah. And so I think I'm just carrying a lot of headlines in my head, a lot of goals, and, you know, she might say, "What's wrong?" And I'm like, "I'm just thinking about something, you know."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you sort of - you think that she should think the same things. [00:15:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, absolutely. But I understand that we're different people, different experience, and different methods, you know, and...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:15:23] to 00:15:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:15:31] to 00:15:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't - I don't like having all these domains.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Too many to juggle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's also - I mean I don't like the way she drives, and so I always drive. Now I don't have a car, so it's great, you know. Now I'm complaining, but it's just like she put the brake on and then turns, and I'm just like, you know, anyway... But, whatever. So I think that was definitely a control issue for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Then I'll drive."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, "I'll drive." I'm going to tell you, "No, I'll drive over there. But...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:16:12] to 00:16:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I only have myself to blame in terms of some of these. And no, she doesn't like to cook. I don't necessarily like to cook either, but we have to eat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I would like to say, "Hey, when we get to France, you're going to do a lot of the cooking, okay?" You know, but I think it will be cereal and toast three times a day. But it's - I don't think she quite gets it that there are things in life that just aren't fun necessarily all the time. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:16:50] to 00:16:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they do require planning, and they do require maintenance, and they do require acquiring certain skills. But anyway, so I guess my crime here is that I don't want to be carrying all these burdens. I want to push some off to her and... And not just have it be the consequences of being limited to what she doesn't cook, or, you know, having things her way, because I don't know quite how to balance that. I always say I don't want to cook, but I don't want to, you know, be eating, you know, mac and cheese or whatever. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:17:45] to 00:17:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we can define some gray here, because you were (ph) - you're cooking every night here after (ph) her cooking every night in France.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. She owes it to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). Is there another option three?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there certainly is, but at the same time, you know, she would...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:07] to 00:18:13)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm going to be commuting from Paris just about half an hour, so I could be leaving the office, but I'll be leaving something there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:22] to 00:18:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just bothers me a bit, and maybe it's my problem that she - you know, when I go out of town, she just eats cereal and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and is happy with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:40] to 00:18:42)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you won't be if you get home from the office and that's dinner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's not so much - yeah, every once in a while, fine, but, umm, it's just to me it seems like this stubborn resistance to learn some basic things, you know. I mean and it doesn't need to be, you know, main dish and a vegetable and something else. It just - I don't know what to me... It's just...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:21] to 00:19:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to see her take care of herself with or without me, you know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:37] to 00:19:43)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your definition? What would you feel comfortable with? What seems like taking care of herself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, you know, not limiting herself to the ingredients that kind of [come in] (ph) to put in the food, you know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:01] to 00:20:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, picking up skills allow her to prepare foods that are healthy, you know. Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:17] to 00:20:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she have any interest in doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In theory, but I don't think she - I know she doesn't like doing it so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:29] to 00:20:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:39] to 00:20:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean how do you communicate to somebody, "You need to care more, you know, about yourself," or...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:50] to 00:20:57)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if some of it is a confidence thing, whether she thinks she can do these things, or if it would be also a little bit intimidating to try because you're good at a lot of this stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it could be. And again, I fault myself because I have allowed myself to get better and better and better at these things from a lot of experience and I've left her stagnant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it suits me, not because it's good for her. [00:21:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Well, it works to benefit you both in some ways, and it works to your hindrance in some ways, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it means that you've become more responsible for these things, so it's not so great for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's no special incentive. And it might be - and tell me, I don't know. Of course, I haven't talked with her. But it might be intimidating to try.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I think it is. I think it is. I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially when she knows you don't like - you know, if it's a failed attempt, it's displeasing. [00:22:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I've never not eaten something that's cooked, you know, but I think it is a confidence issue and I think she's...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:22:11] to 00:22:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I think her standards are so generous, but if I cook something, it's amazing, you know, and I always think it's really simple and I messed it up. But I just think for her it's like, you know, sort of magic that happens and she doesn't know how to wield (ph)...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:22:39] to 00:22:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we're supposed to take a cooking class together, but spring semester got underway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that's something that she might do on her goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, she did. She went to one - the first of two classes - and learned a lot. [00:23:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, there's only so much you can learn in three hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't why. That's why I took on some... Anyway, that's that, and I think</p>

<p>it's - I think it's important to remember and understand that certain methods work at certain times, and other methods work at other times and...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:23:29] to 00:23:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to be able to let go of things without seeming like I'm doing it out of anger, you know. Like I say, go ahead and do it, you know. That can communicate, umm, that you're on your own and I'm not going to help you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Handing over rather than showing her what you've been doing and how she could help alleviate some of the burden.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you mention like it [probably is the same] (ph). You know, she's not used to posting stuff she doesn't know she'd have. So to be giving it, like, lump sum, and it's like being an intern and first day of work and no idea what you're supposed to be doing with this stuff. [00:24:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Um-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you maybe said, "Here's three things that I've been trying to sell," sit at the computer with her and show her how you - you know, how to log on, share your password or whatever. And, you know, go through one with her, and she could probably list the other two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm sure of it. I'm sure of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it might feel more of like a - rather than sort of like dumping it on her, like I'm done with this stuff, more of a feeling of the shared endeavor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, yeah. I think that's - that's wise, and I think...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:24:52] to 00:24:56)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me flip this on. The sun looks a lot brighter. Over here, where they can't see you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:25:04] to 00:25:10)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's also a matter of giving up the things that I don't necessarily enjoy and reaching in the things that I, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:25:18] to 00:25:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, yeah. So I guess that's all I have to say about that, unless you want to know anything else. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is important for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:25:42] to 00:26:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just trying to remember the things that I've been thinking about, and I wasn't thinking about all of the things necessarily to move (ph). Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:26:16] to 00:26:35)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:26:35] to 00:26:50)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, one thing you should really think about is the fact that you have three sessions left. And I know we've talked in the past about trying to figure out a way to I guess sort of outline what your goals were when you came in and where you are in relation to those. [00:27:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How to sort of package up what you've - what you've taken away from this experience and bring it with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, um-hmm. Well, umm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So big questions you don't necessarily get to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think - I mean I remember I have some, you know, visual memories of how - kind of just blocked I was. How I couldn't, you know, take away anything when I first came in here and I was just - kind of mentally just stuck. Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:27:41] to 00:27:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's the kind of thing, I think, that I'm more in control of now, but it's still something that it's just in the back of my head that can, you know, spring up at any time if I let it. And it's almost like if I think it - in the past, if I think it, it just happens; that is, seize up. Now, if I just try to keep momentum. Even right now if I just keep momentum going, I will make it through and get the point across without stopping, without all the pauses, and, you know, that's kind of been the trick I've been using. And they're getting better, but again, right now, it's like I'm trying to fill up the gaps. Let it all... You know, try to - it's like I get less seize (ph) up and then I wonder what was I saying, what was my point. You know, "Look at this long pause; it's getting longer," and "Wow, it's really getting longer now," and "Oh, my God, you're just, you know, in trouble, that's all." That's one thing that I think I've definitely noticed. I think...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:28:58] to 00:29:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think also my depression has certainly been lessened, and I think the medication was helping with that. But I also think that the awareness that you pointed out as far as the need to escape and why; what are the influences there, the, you know, input in the tie (ph), impetuses, whatever for that. And...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:29:34] to 00:29:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now that I think about it, there is something recently that I did want to mention really. You said - something about on Fridays... Uh, what is the point of it? I can't remember what I was talking about. Do you remember?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we were talking about sort of the parallel between stuff and goals and what you get rid of, or expectation, what you hold onto and what you let (ph) go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Thank you for having a memory (chuckling). And I was thinking about it with behavior, you know. What is behavior that - what is the point of it? Do I want to hold onto this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And whether it be, you know, looking at some woman on the street... And I thought to myself, "what's the point of this? What am I really getting out of this," you know? Is this a behavior I really need, is it something I want to hold onto to, or can I get rid of it? Or will I get rid of it more often than not, but not necessarily be able just to learn that from my life (ph). And so, umm, I'm surprised I didn't remember this earlier because it's kind of a pain to get over (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it's a really interesting way to extend that idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes a lot of sense. I'm glad one of us thought of it. [00:31:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling). You can use it for your next patient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, but I mean (inaudible at 00:31:16) okay, so what is this going to get me? Well, what am I really going to do with this? How far am I really going to take this? And in some ways, it does come down to trust and what, you know... Do I trust that I'm not going to miss this, you know, accordion (ph) or whatever it is, you know? And do I trust that I'm not going to go down that road with - whether I'm, you know, staring at it. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you miss having the fantasy? Is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, you know, that's a good question, because I think some of the times we buy things with a fantasy in mind. Like I can see me using this pasta maker, you know, or whatever, you know, and you never do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah. But the idea of having the time to do that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you need it. Yeah. Well, that will be a nice idea. That will be nice. You know, it will be fun. Of course, that's very safe. But the idea of...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:32:25] to 00:32:29)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The reality is I will never use that pasta maker. I may use it once, and that's a big "if." That's a big "might." [00:32:40]</p>

<p>But the fact of the matter is, even in my day-to-day life, there are certain things that I need and I count on and that sustain me, and that's not one of them. If I brought it over to my - to the fantasy, you know, I might fantasize about something and not act on it, and I might fantasize about having a, you know... If I talk about kid (ph) - cooking all the time, I hate cooking, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been a big topic for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I have always -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're selling a lot of cooking things (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm selling them all, just thinking, my God, I often (ph) use that and use that, and so there is this side of me on this theme of thinking I want something and getting it, and then not having it. They're not - not having the fulfillment that I thought it would have or whatever, and I think that's okay. But I think as I, you know, look at this array of stuff, I say, "Well, I think it's gotten out of hand to an extent. And so when I look at something like fantasy on the street, I see now that it's okay, as long as I don't act on it. And, umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:33:57] to 00:34:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:34:03] to 00:34:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think if you go too long, then I think you need to ask what is the point and what is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what is it that you're really trying to fulfill?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if the cooking thing is not totally random, even though I... Because as you said that I was... A book by Carolyn Knapp called Appetites, usually geared toward women, but it doesn't have to be. But it talks about what are the basic appetites that people have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what do we feel about that. Well, hunger and sex are two instinctual appetites that people have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think, you know, when you talk about, you know, buying a pasta maker, it's kind of a luxury food item, right? It's not really a basic, umm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's kind of a fantasy about how to fulfill an appetite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the same thing about a fantasy of a woman on the street. It's not your basic need; it goes beyond that, so luxurious fantasy item, and I wonder if there's not something there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, I think you might be right. I think - yeah, I think it goes to the same core of what is the life I imagine myself living. [00:35:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like what is - what is the life of this person who has a pasta maker?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it must be just like so much fun, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so extravagant, and living the dream and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, and so much more exciting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, far more exciting than I would imagine, rolling out your own ravioli, you know, and yet...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:35:33] to 00:35:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet it's right there for me and I don't - I don't capitalize on that, you know, and so...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:35:44] to 00:35:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what is that life that I think about living or I imagine living that it's so much better than my own, and why is my own less than what I think it is? And, uh, I don't know. I think that's kind of what I need to dig out a little bit and...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:36:05] to 00:36:10)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, at the same time, well, I think - anyway, when you go to the grocery store and you buy all these vegetables and you buy all those things, and you get home and you're like, "Yeah, I think I'm just going to make, you know, veggie burger or something." And the fantasy of eating healthy and being - eating it and using vegetables before they go bad and all these dream ideas... And I think there is something to that, too, but still I have - I don't know. It's like - it's almost like the healthy side of a fantasy, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fantasy can be really healthy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the - kind of like you want to live, and it's the rest of the life that seems unattainable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And it's all a matter of degree, right? Because to a certain extent, you know, somewhere on that scale, it's healthy. And you think about what is the life you want to live, and you take a step toward that. [00:37:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If the fantasy is too far out, then instead of having you move toward it, it feels unattainable. You feel like that's not your life at all, and you take a veggie burger out of the box.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel guilty about all the vegetables you bought that are going to waste, and you admonish yourself for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you scale it back a little bit, then maybe you will, you know, chop up some, you know, tomato from the farmers' market and put it on your burger, and you've got a little bit of that piece. So that's the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's sort of a small step really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Scaling - yeah, scaling back of having the fantasy, and scaling it back to what actually is obtainable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you can move a step in that direction and feel good about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. That is true. Yeah, yeah. And I think also just having some realistic ideas about it. Yeah, and I have I think scaled some of those back. It's like, okay, I'm not going to buy all the things I usually buy, because I only plan on making meals twice this week, so what does that really mean? Why am I going to set myself up for disappointment?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I - if I thought about it, I could really make an [honest formed] (ph) decision that wouldn't be so painful (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. And then when you achieve that, it feels good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rather than setting a goal that's too high and you can't make, that you just feel badly about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So I guess that's what I'm thinking about these things. And, umm, I mean there are a lot more things that I'm, umm - you know, that I'm aware of as far as the progress I've made in here on things we've covered that I hadn't talked about before; things that I think I was able to talk about with you because you're a woman, and attractive, and I don't think I've been able to work through those things with people in the past. So... [00:39:14]</p>

<p>And I guess I would want to ask you, and this - you don't have to answer this now, but, you know, before I'm done - what - where do you see me now as opposed to when I came in, and what, umm - what are the things that I need to be aware of as I move on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. It will definitely happen, so some words packaged up for you at the (inaudible at 00:39:38).</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. All right. So yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:39:42] to 00:39:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:39:44] to 00:39:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's all I have (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you've done a lot of work, and we're probably just about out of time for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we're meeting next week, same time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah. I know it's Monday, but I don't know what time it's on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it was at 10:30 (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Early, early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it's too early - I might have possibilities... Is it too early?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's probably better if you can -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Get you up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get me out of bed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I don't really have anything else to offer you that day anyway, so you've got to get up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling). Thank you. [00:40:23]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have the ah, sessions for was that 5 or 5:15.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we said 5 but we told we might both be late.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I, I usually I doubt if I can make it by 5, because </p>

<p> they are uhm fooling with the road out there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah it's going to be a hassle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 0:00:48.9), that's not I want some myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, so how long do we go today then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm, I'm not, you know, I don't have that same push tonight that I had last week so ah, you know, quarter past six, 20 after something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, alright. Uhm, is this ah one thing I may have a question, you know, about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, like, like in your therapy work do you like do you try to structure or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Structure in what way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, in directions we take or anything like that or is it pretty much left up to me or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I would prefer that you do it yourself yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Because I, I don't ah well it kind a says something I guess about myself because usually uhm (0:02:00.0) I, you know, I guess I don't take the initiative so and this incidence I guess I don't have to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Much to your chagrin, hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't really like that idea. One thing</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One thing just kind of an isolated incidents, uhm, well actually there's a couple of things but a thing happened like I think it was on ah when the heck was it today is Thursday, it wasn't Thursday, Tuesday, Tuesday night it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was down in this bar ah and oh ah it's kind of a it seemed like where I knew one girl for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have known her for about a year. And the other girl there was another girl that was a good friend of mine that was also down there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah the girl that I had known for a year like we had been ah just mostly sex we and then when we talk, you know, but it's I hadn't been dating her I just see her down there now and then and we go home now and then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah I think I like her to, you know, ah but anyhow this other girl was down there, this girl that I just recently met.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At another bar and I've known her for about a month.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anyway uhm I got, you know, I think there was a little bomb that was kind a like timed to go home. (0:03:59.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was standing I was standing by the door and I was talking with the second girl, the one that I was going to go</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The more recent one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I had we had never been together, you know, in bed or anything like that so I, I had asked her if she wanted to go home. She says yeah. So I says okay, you know, she was going to go get her coat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So she went to the back of the bar and she had been talking with this other guy in the bar which is no big thing but ah the other guy had been talking with the girl I knew for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they were dancing back then. Anyhow there is a third party involved which is ah or another party involved which was also a friend of mine, another girl. And ah something happened with I better call them by name Susie, Susie is the girl the newer girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, Kathleen is the, the older girl. I don't know what the guy's name is. And the other girl is Emma. Emma is the informant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anyhow, Susie went back to get her coat and all of a sudden Emma comes up to me and ah just then also Kathleen came up to me. So I said oh God, you know, this is it was a (inaudible 0:05:18.9). Anyhow, Emma, Emma didn't talk to me she said that this Susie had come back and stepped between the guy and Kathleen who were dancing at the time which is supposedly socially bad and said, said something to him and that Emma ah was furious because of this, you know, like this shouldn't never be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah Emma is telling me this and giving me this whole routine like she has been at bars since she was 16, you know, she's really dirty and bad and terrible thing to do and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It hurts Kathleen and all this and ah (0:05:59.7). Right and this is what I mean my reaction was uhm it was weird because, because when Susie came back. Susie from what I know of her she teaches 4th Grade uhm she is not a game player. She is very honest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, and above all she usually doesn't take the initiative in breaking something or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of pulling the stunts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is my impression of her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anyhow, when she came back, you know, was totally unaware that </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That Emma</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somebody had rotted on her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Supposedly, this is my reaction to it and so I was, you know, I says are you ready to go and she says yeah so I was I, I said we were going to go to my place but, but ah something clicked and this is this is what I can't understand in my head uhm so that I knew right away that something was wrong although I wasn't, you know, I didn't know what was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But something, something ah it made me react to her, you know, like ah cold, you know, very cold. I'll bring you home now and I wasn't very talkative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun. Well what was it that, that made that click for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, this, this is the thing I've been trying to figure out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way she spoke to you or.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no she came back she, she had not she the exact same expression as when she had gone thinking we were leaving then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She did talk with Kathleen a little bit. Kathleen had come back. Now</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was Kathleen there with Emma when Emma told you that about Susie.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No Kathleen see Kathleen, Kathleen had come back and I had a few words with her, then Susie had come back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Kathleen and Susie started talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They probably would get along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: While Emma was talking to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: While Emma was, you know, filling me full of all this stuff. Well I get back to, you know, to the to trying to (0:08:00.4) figure out what that was, you know, that hit me. Well anyhow I was so I drove her home, you know, and I hardly said anything. She only lives three blocks from there. So I drove her home and ah finally I was walking her up to her door. Well I knew enough to know that something was wrong with my, you know, with my reaction, but I didn't know what it was and so finally I just said, you know, uhm, you know, the reason I'm acting weird is because this happened, you know, I, I didn't know what happened and she said what happened was when she walked back there see all of this is beside the point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When she walked back there the guy came and talked to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, forever it's worth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she, you know, she hadn't broke in on anything or anything like that and then she had come back. Well then, then the thing that ah the thing that struck me is that, you know, like I really it wasn't so much like uhm oh I guess it was distrust but I think there I think there was something more that, that ah I had I was thinking about it before and I had a word uhm, you know, to kind a describe it ah it wasn't, wasn't only distrust a few well anyhow I'll just finish the story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't, I can't get it now. So we went back we ended up going back to my place and that is something weird too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After, after you talked about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, after we talked about it and then I said well it's foolish, you know, but I, I, I felt bad that, that ah now only so much that I had hurt her feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:09:58.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I felt bad because I was such a dumb ass.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you haven't trusted her and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't trust my intuitions, my intuitions </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were that she was an honest, open person and wouldn't do that and yet something that Emma said to you (inaudible 0:10:09.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The back of your mind anyhow. Wonder whether you maybe part of that was that if indeed Susie had done that to some other guy, you know, maybe sometime she might do it to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it were true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. God I, I can't I don't know why I, I blocked it out because I, I was driving this morning and I thought about this a couple of times, you know. I don't think I thought about that so much but like when we went back to my place what really nailed me now she has been there once before that I didn't remember she was there once before when I first time I ever took her out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We had uhm well I came back from a party and I was half bombed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I, I have this standard it's becoming that's what got me it has become a standard thing. I show people my apartment and I have a stereo thing and there is about two records that I really like because it's ah a Beatle's record where you can almost see the sound go from speaker to speaker, well that's, that's what I really got I have never blushed in front of a girl alone before but ah I turned on the record player I says hey have you ever heard this thing, you know, and, and then something dawned in me and I said somewhere, you know, I have done this before with this girl, you know, and she, she just, you know, looked at me and I says oh no, you know. I've done this before haven't I. And then I said something about ah a seductive thing this is a seductive thing and I couldn't I couldn't make the connection but I, I just got utterly embarrassed, you know. (0:12:03.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you have been there before and you didn't even (inaudible 0:12:06.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't remember yeah. I didn't remember. And ah (inaudible 0:12:14.5). That's something that I, you know, maybe I didn't like it's a format.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a format and I would never want to admit to myself that I would have a format.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's really something that you pull on every girl that you bring to the apartment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For the first time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it's a first time thing and turned out this was Susie's second time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and oh God, you know, I just really I turned red neck plus, you know, before, you know, you know, it I think she's a, you know, a girl that </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you on your toes from before anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah with this other thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all I had ah uhm well what I think she should have done before is told me to go to hell if that's all I think of her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she didn't which I think she should have, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, and I oh and then this thing this kind a compounded it with ah but that, you know, that really I to just usually I could slough it off and get out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that time I couldn't, couldn't get out of it. But I think the thing like when we were in the bar the thing that got me the most was that uhm, you know, I really was ready to believe anything that anyone else would tell me and I didn't, you know, like I didn't trust.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your own judgements.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My own judgements of her. You know, that still doesn't explain the whole (0:14:01.6) I, I can't. God, there is one word that describes the feeling I had or, or kind a gave me an inkling into ah and it was something I knew I was going to forget.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because I it, it, it ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure enough you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I knew I would. Oh God I can't think of well maybe it will come back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you want to remember.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But knew you would forget.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now you have forgotten it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I know I would forget, you know, maybe I, I didn't want to get into that I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it's convenient to forget hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you looking for a word to describe yourself now hun, how you felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Because</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about embarrassed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The word isn't embarrassed it would be too easy a word, hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no it's not embarrassed, it's, it's a ah uhm the coffee pot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, it's the tape recorder. (0:15:59.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why, you know, the question I have is why, why would I it's, it's not even a rational thing to react to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so what if she would have ah uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If she would have talked to somebody that was that was dancing with Kathleen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other person comes back and tells me about and I react very coldly to this other person to the, you know, to Susie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gullible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think that yeah it comes close that's not it but that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That comes close to uhm. There was one thing the other girl said that ah that Emma said about ah what's going uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really having trouble remembering.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no it's not so much remembering it won't it won't come, you know, it won't come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean it won't come out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it doesn't want to, you know, it doesn't want to surface like I it isn't very spontaneous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun. You know what it is but it's difficult for it to come out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was there yeah it was there for a second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah I don't know if it's, it's so much ah (0:18:00.1) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to have a mind of its own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Boy, it's like things are just </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's do you have trouble going to the john if another person is watching you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, which I do, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah it's like that sort of thing, you know, if you're going to the john and somebody is watching you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Okay. So like you can't tell me about this because uhm I'm watching you or hearing you and it's not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel embarrassed about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I don't know, you know, it was like it was like last week uhm it was like I was on I was on two levels there are a lot of things that I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, were, were going to come out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, or no I became aware that there were things that I knew ah were fluttering around down here but they, they wouldn't necessarily, you know, come on out and uhm I didn't ah I, I think it will come back because this, this one I had, you know, I had in words.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and it was something what I had said. It, its, you know, it's like I got a I uhm (0:19:59.5). And he said, I'll see, you got it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just it flaked away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it came too close.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has got to be it has got to work off the work element.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it seems like, you know, when I said gullible and hit something close I kind of exposed you it's like I was in the john with you watching you urinate or something </p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which would stop you from doing it hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well but actually ah I play a game on that I see if I have the will power.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, so if I'm in the john</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, most of the times I can beat it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, uhm I guess that's what I'm kind a trying to do now</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is to think of what Emma said something and that. She said one thing the phrase you she the Susie wants to have her cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, (0:22:00.7), foolish maybe ah maybe that's </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She talking to you about Susie or about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Susie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Susie was foolish for wanting to have her cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No that Susie was a conniving woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that I she didn't say anything about me being foolish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That she came back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She started telling me all of this and I said, you know, what the what I told her is what I didn't get to talk to her, you know, I just accepted it and then, you know, the whole thing happened and I distrusted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, Susie</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Susie.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm even amazed that I even I even reacted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, usually I don't even nobody down there means that much to me I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or at least I, you know, kind a don't like to </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well except that you started this all off by saying that you think maybe you like Susie.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe that's why I reacted that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, on that on that kind of thing I kind always got to say halfway that I like somebody but, you know, its when I say the word like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The word like to me doesn't mean, you know, get upset. I, you know, alright, you know, when I guess it's usually in this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This coldness, you know, with without knowing why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And to me it's, you know, it's, it's prime thing to ah to, to get at to tackle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To try to understand what was going on there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, you see I talked to her last night too, this is Emma now. And I says, you know, and she I says, you know, you're all wet, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:24:00.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I got in a discussion as to what are the facts, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, Susie says another thing which is still saying, you know, I'm looking for somebody else's ah judgment in the matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not using my, my own judgment in the matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My own ah my own impressions and my own ah like</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your own feelings about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My gut feelings, yeah. Or my, you know, well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not trusting yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And so then I was getting mad at Emma. Now Emma is she has had some psychiatric background she worked in a in a hospital so, you know, like I kind a respect her intuitions into people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that weighed even more, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I put her in ah, ah a thing on that. And ah I says what the hell was your hidden agenda in coming storming back and telling me about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what, you know, what's the deal. And she said well it was because Kathleen is a friend of hers.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, well I guess I was saying, you know, why mess around with my head, you know, when I don't understand why you're doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said that Kathleen was her friend and uhm this other girl was a bitch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't explain it for you yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, uhm see I started to argue with her on the facts because she then she said that, that Susie was lying, see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah but why see it's all beside the point why, why should this disturb me either way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, why.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, you know, I can't ah I ah (0:26:03.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it because they're fucking around with your judgment about how well you perceive people getting conflicting statements about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, yeah because see I took it personally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, so that has got to be part of it ah I don't think I was so upset that, that, you know, Susie was called a bitch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that ah Kathleen is a sweet kid or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that, you know, my judgment on Susie would have been, you know, would have been thrown out of whack.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, I try on the, you know, like the oh boy well that, you know, to, to be made foolish, you know. I think that ah and it's something even more though it's like ah I can think of other incidences that would be a typical reaction for me (0:28:01.2). Uhm, of distrust, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, many, you know, like many times uhm I got I can think of two this year where I, I really like a girl back in May and she had this she was, you know, she really liked another guy too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She had a habit of coming in late on Thursday mornings and it just and I knew why because, you know, Wednesday night, you know, at this (inaudible - 0:28:39.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that usually I wouldn't talk to her for a day, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I tried, you know, I try, I try to break it but I couldn't, you know, but I just wouldn't talk to her. Uhm, and, you know, I don't think I ever trusted her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trusted her about what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, okay what. I mean distrust must be around or trust must be around I'm not okay the feelings I would have in both incidences would have been somewhat the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My reaction would have been of not talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So that the consequence of this feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, trust doesn't sound right, you know. Maybe I'm, you know, maybe I'm way off on a wrong tangent. Getting even maybe that would have been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. What, what</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of punishing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess your feeling was that she should have just have been interested in your and not in this other cat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right. You know, what the hell she ah </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why was she running with somebody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-hum, yeah, like ah (0:30:02.3). Yeah, either, you know, I don't satisfy her or she confirms a lot of things I might about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, those are guesses now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But maybe they are ah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you weren't enough to satisfy her so she had ah get somebody else on the side.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And, and my uhm </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Confirm some feelings of in... inadequacies that you're have yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And, and my way of evening it up, yeah, evening it up is ah I, you know, more and more a couple of other things that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the wintertime there was ano... another girl that I really liked. One night she was engaged</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To another guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one night uhm oh she broke her date she had washed her hair and forgot so I was furious at her and I was very polite for a whole week and then we had to go on a ski trip, I didn't talk to her for a whole day on the ski trip, you know, or I was polite she is very easy to be, you know, just cordial.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's really a vicious kind of uhm, you know, way, way of hurting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah, you know, that was the whole God oh it has happened before too, you know. It's like it's really almost like a pattern that ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you punish people is not to talk to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It catches it but it's not what I would like to say I don't want to admit it to you I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind a like screw you I won't screw you. (0:32:02.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you know it's ah, you know, or, you know, there are a whole see things are slipping away now must be getting into something. Uhm, ah now I can see even when I was I never started dating until I was 23.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, now I see I don't know if this is backing off I got a feeling I'm backing off now because there for awhile it was ah. Well I'll back off for awhile. Ah, I, I think I've just, you know, I want to tell you some things so that maybe connections will click that I might not be able to see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I, think, you know, if I can use the word used that's, that's the kind a thing that would be helpful for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, you know, if you can pick up those connections along the route ah like, like when I was in high school my attitude was kind a like uhm I like to excel in all things, you know, even though I don't know now if I really believed that I'm thinking maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All the things except I can probably do away with dating. (0:34:01.1), you know, which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's ah </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't understand how you thought that now hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I, I can't I kind a conceive but, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, you know, I read psychology books if you have got to love working and friendship, you know, without those things you are inco..., you know, completely incomplete.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well anyhow I went through college without dating. I think I had one date. Never kissed a girl until I was 21 and then I always told the guys okay you guys if I ever start watch out because then I was going to go to the reverse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, you know, which I did. And well, you know, an embarrassing statistic is a thing like uhm ah, you know, you read stuff on masturbation. 99 point something of the population masturbates, male population. Okay, now I was honestly in the God damn percent that didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can remember one time in my whole life and I never masturbated until I was 22 years old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was by accident, a God damn accident, you know. I didn't even know what an organism was, you know, it was strictly by accident. I probably to this date wouldn't have known it except, you know, I started when I was 25 I finally went to, you know, to bed with a girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, and I don't think I have ever really worked that through. Ah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What the it wasn't until you were 25.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I have never I think really worked through my feelings toward girls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Toward a girl toward</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, you know. I haven't worked my feelings to toward maybe toward, toward relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I thought, you know, continuing on but uhm it was and, and that too it was the same thing, you know, like guys would ask me when I went through school, you know, Kiren how come you never date and I would say uhm it would embarrass me. (0:36:04.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always get embarrassed and, and yet in a way ah if it was in a classroom if I was embarrassed talking to a girl always embarrassed uhm but if it was something like ah well high school I always was embarrassed, college too and then, you know, finally I, you know, I met one girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Blew it completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah after that I had no trouble talking to girls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ah </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you have trouble on asking them for a date.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah uhm still, you know, it was still a thing, you know. It was as though, you know, I was putting myself I, I took pride in the fact that I knew a lot of girls liked me and yet I wouldn't ask them out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, wouldn't share myself with anyone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although I don't know how I, I, I the only way I can remember it is that there are a lot of girls I really, you know, uhm thought about and, you know, ah I had it, you know, my fantasy life is still there but uhm and it's weird, you know, it's weird. The only the only females that ah that, that would make uncomfortable were single beautiful girls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Available ones.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well certain, certain other girl, you know, I have a thing about I, I about attractiveness the girl has to be, you know, like she has to be attractive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She has got to be, you know, socially acceptable to everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, in terms of her looks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm (0:38:05.9) now it's weird because with, with married women with a girl who is extremely homely uhm, older women old people generally uhm I don't know about kids I'm not sure about little kids but those kind of, you know, like the ladies aid cycle I have no trouble absolutely no trouble. Any girl I have ever dated except one I have had absolutely no trouble with their parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except I can talk probably better to their parents then to the girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But to the girl uhm, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was touch and go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, oh wow it was ah yeah and in college it was like uhm ah still the same sort of thing like, you know, I knew that I knew I knew that girls would like me but yet I couldn't believe it. In college well I had a flattop I wore glasses when I was in 10th grade I decided well I decided when I was in 9th grade, you know, that I wanted to be a priest and I remember clearly the reason was that there is a need for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I, you know, that's the conscious reason there but there are all kinds of things that I, you know, that I think are, are entered in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, what that means people need to be helped or what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: God needs priests.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Got to have more spaces I mean, you know, in other words, you know the statistics that were always given were that (0:40:00.9) we don't have enough men and we got to fill those damn pulpits so, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Become a priest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they had a test one time with the Sim I don't know if I explained I, I went through the Catholic rigmarole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You go through eight year uhm I don't know what said went ahead uhm and I I'm get fragmented here. Okay, well I studied for the Catholic priesthood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the way you do that is you start ah you go through two years of a junior college and I went to Chicago, Illinois and you go two years of a senior college which is in Hershey, Pennsylvania and went four years and in Chicago, Illinois at a seminary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The third year of which you spend on viceroy studying under a minister.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I spent in Texas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I came back and that's a whole area too of why I, I graduated and I, I went to (inaudible 0:41:00.3) and was a resident counselor the years of graduate work in ah in ah education.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I became a teacher. And ah okay well that, that takes care of that but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never were ordained.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the whole time the whole time it is it's like the Army ah my dad was an Army man. We well maybe I better explain that too. He died with me never knowing him only a legend and ah the legend came to me by a grandmother I saw about once every eight years I'm trying to cover too much gees that's, that's a lot of ah a lot of general knowledge. Well I'll just keep pouring it on. But ah in our household my dad was never mentioned he was, you know, my whole time he was up until my mother and I never said my dad's name from the time I was four.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When we got the telegram saying he died in the war until the time I was 25. (0:42:03.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we were all bond, that his name came up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because a third party kind a intermediated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, anyhow when I was in 9th grade, you know, I, I ah, you know, said I would like to be a priest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the basis of that decision was that ah now all kinds of things are popping up it's really just the way I said that a friend of mine told I had dinner with a friend of mine ah a week ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he said what he thought was in me is a lot of anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That ah he used the word rage ah and just the way I said that uhm the way I use would use my hand uhm, you know, like I'm I pissed because I made, you know, a decision that involved me in eight or nine years of never having to make a decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you decided to go to the to the seminary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh and plus in my senior year I went away from home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, you know, it was it was a ten year process best years of my life ah without ever really have to call myself to account.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you never learned how to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh God no you go into it and ah well my last two years have been mostly the same thing too, that was another thing I was going to mention tonight like I got this great director now in this ah, I don't know do you think I'm do you think I'm running from something right now I'm going all over the place I know that but ah I know it kind a just opens to me a lot of a lot of areas that I really never thought about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:43:57.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what sounds like but a lot</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because things keep popping up and I keep tying it in and I can't keep my mind on one thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, I was just talking with our superintendent tonight and we just opened up this new office in ah it's Department of Children Family Services and uhm I just happened to run into down in the basement and he has got all of these really neat ideas I've never heard of an administration like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like, lie intentionally promoting things like training labs and sensitivity groups and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm encounter groups, stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, with himself involved, you know, involved in a position like that. And, you know, encouraging reading encouraging confidences and encouraging, you know, all of this sort of stuff not just saying it's available but actually encouraging your people to do it. And my feeling about that was great, you know, and I'm all enthused and talking to him but I know God damn well when I go back home I'm not going, you know, I'm not going to do the work I'm going to probably end up in the damn bar because I want to run from there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the reading.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, it requires some kind of, you know, some kind of (inaudible 0:45:08.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Commitment on your part too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah well that's another thing I don't understand like why ah, you know, I can I can rationalize and say okay I'm afraid, you know, I'm afraid to tackle this thing because I might mess up I might fail.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mess up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if you fail.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a good question well what if I failed. The thing there the things that are involved like ah I kind a got it in my head that I don't know it kind a leaves me limp I don't know. (0:46:01.9) Maybe part of it is and this is a guess now it doesn't come from I don't know where but is if lets say if, if teaching is what I want to do lets say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I throw myself into it then I am thereby committing myself to it in some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I commit myself to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know it don't sound right it doesn't right true to me, if I commit myself to it uhm there is the chance that the same thing will happen in regard to the priesthood that I don't think I have ever really felt like ah, you know, really competent at something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I throw myself into the attempt to be competent who is to keep me from going to the bars ah for instance if I would ever want to go back to school or if I, I would really say to this guy, you know, like okay I really would like to work in this I would be willing to set up programs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would be willing to, you know, track down ideas to ah to talk to staff and set up weekend retreats stuff like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when it gets to the problem of what I'm actually going to do at home I have to admit to myself, you know, that something is keeping me from following through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I and that I can say it's, it's a it's a fear, you know, a fear to commit myself to anything ah I haven't committed myself to anything for like about two years other than uhm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A fear that you'll see yourself as incompetent rather than competent, is that what you're talking about. Like you invest yourself in something, you know, really invest yourself and then you find out you're no good. (0:48:02.0)</p>

<p> You have lost out on that investment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum I, I don't know if that if that catches it because I, I think ah I've never thrown myself into anything completely, you know, at least that's the way I figure it. Like the ministry I was the guy that was always in the gym, you know, playing basketball. When the pressure was on I'm good at pressure spots when the pressure is on I can put out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I have to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like if you're ever if I like I admire people with I admire people that are eloquent that</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that, that compliment their eloquence with ah with a good deal of, of basic knowledge about either, either basic knowledge from books or basic knowledge from experience or combination which to me is the best and yet I have never felt I've got to give a talk on Tuesday night to this, this is the first time I have been in a church in about ten months, this ladies aid group about foster children. And I could give the talk I could present the things, you know, but I didn't really feel like they would ask me questions about ah one woman had a had a teenager who was growing up she asked a question about a teenager hell all I could say was, you know, something which is self evident, you know, how do you, you know, how are you going to it was something like hold the reigns without letting it bolt or something here's another guide, you know, really great insight, you know, fine, fine insight but if I would have gained that kind of insight, you know, there is ways it can be done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean to help the woman (inaudible 0:49:59.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right I mean I mean who the hell says that I, you know, got I got to go down to a bar every night which is my, my history for about the last year and a half. Previous to that time I was active in sports it was it's always doing something that I liked to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe, you know, maybe, maybe I hate books, you know, but I buy them, you know I go down to Cracks and Britannos, I'll buy 15 books.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have got a case full of books.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unread.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. But then I got (inaudible 0:50:31.4), okay justify it and stuff where I will read. Like Herman Hess, I read ten in a row by him completely. Ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you get ordained did you say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. When, when I was ah well okay I'll quote Hess when I was uhm I guess the beginning of like awakening for me I'm trying to trace it back to a point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, and by awakening I, I think I kind a mean like ah what is awakening becoming troubled I don't think my conscience ever bothered me until I was 21. The first time I kissed a girl my conscience bothered me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I, I maybe I can't recall uhm why I am going back to that you asked me was I ordained I said no I don't even think I what did I just say. (0:52:02.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said that uhm we were you were going to quote Hess about awakening what did you mean by awakening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah I'm just trying to see how my, my processes are going. Uhm, I guess I thought what you were saying was why wasn't I ordained.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the reason I wasn't ordained is because of an awakening experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then my mind went to uhm was this oh what I was thinking behind that was is this my first awakening experience.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The answer was no, the first one is when you were 21.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Then it was no. Yeah. And then it kind a slipped off back to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was trying to find out how I got from, from what you asked me back to that thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ah I think, you know, I, I, I think I would rather stay with your question because if it really what it's saying is why I didn't get ordained I think. And ah maybe I'll just let my mind go if it if it goes, you know, if goes back to what I call an awakening is like I think really becoming aware of that, you know, that ah that, that in every incidence I didn't really do ah (0:54:00.0) what I knew I should have done because prior to that time I, I cannot ever remember doing anything doing anything wrong okay. Those are the ways I thought. Not, not in terms of being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, but right and wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and wrong. Oh God yes right and wrong was, you know, ah I, you know, I remember in 7th grade once ah a guy it was unbelievable a guy came up in a locker room with one of these damn steel I don't even know why I'm thinking of this damn steel ah bracelets on a real stud kind of guy uhm and for no reason belted me on the arm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really hard, so I, you know, without thinking, you know, I usually don't do this ah I think I grabbed him I never hit him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have only hit one person in my life and that was much later. But ah later in the hallway I came up and wanted to shake his hand because, you know, the Bible says stuff like ah don't let the sun go down in your wrath.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you've got you've got </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make up for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Make amends for it, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was the asshole that hit me for no reason and so I, I had I want to shake hands he said sure but, you know, he twisted my arm so I walked away feeling great. I had, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you had done nothing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this guy is a real scum because he twisted my arm which is, you know, ah but until I was 21 ah well like there is a thing like, you know, forgiveness is one of the words I still I still can kind a understand but to me I think it has always meant at least up until that point something about uhm smooth it over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:55:56.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If there is tension, you got to smooth it over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't want to let that you don't want </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't let it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And that's even like, you know, even this thing with Susie it was still that way too. Ah, I was reacting weirdly but I knew the tension was there and I knew, I knew that probably I would at least mention that, that there is this tension although I have no reason still for understanding it, but I knew I had to say that it was there. Ah, so where do I want to go from here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, well I think we can't go any place from here, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that was a quick hour.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because January I'll be a little better off but it would be it would be up to about a hundred a month so if I quit drinking, you know, I can do it but ah I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe this would be a good way to quit drinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh shoot, you know, is, is it like is it optional to you or, or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is optional well if it's optional I would rather wait for the or do you think like for therapy it would be better twice a week.</p>

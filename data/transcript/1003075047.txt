<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well [PATIENT NAME], how, how have you been feeling since we spoke last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've been feeling fine.  Other than I still am not, I found out what is decreasing my sexual, um, decresion in my sexuality wasn't the pill that you're giving me.  It is the Topamax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It wasn't the, I'll say —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you can look it up.  It is the Topamax is causing it and I'm very depressed about it.  Um, crying almost everyday now.  If not everyday, almost every night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I was wondering if there is anything that you can think of that you can give for my migraines instead of Topamax.  [CRYING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, uh, I really want to help you with anything that I can help you with.  And one of the reasons that we did a way with the Wellbutrin was we thought, we were worried anyway, that it might be affecting your bipolar.  So it really would have more swings in your moods.  Wellbutrin by itself probably isn't responsible for making you have a better libido, but at least it doesn't aggravate it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think what may have happened in addition to how much it bothers you about the sexual problem, it may be that your depression, the, the depressed phase of bipolar is starts coming back a little bit.  And you did say that you had tried lamotrigine or Lamictal before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I haven't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because probably and, and it's not as good, maybe a headache treatment as Topamax may be, and whoever is giving you the Topamax, probably better —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Person to ask that.  But, lamotrigine might substitute for the Topamax and end up helping your depression better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I'm —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can you write that down for me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.  I'm going to write the name of it down and we, this is something that takes a while.  You can't just change over one or the other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got ease off the one and go on the other.  But, I like lamotrigine and it's got generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't have sedation to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't have addicting potential at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not a tranquilizer.  But, the downside to it is, it isn't specifically approved for headaches.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, really neither is Topamax, but we commonly use it that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, it has a potentially fatal rash associated with it.  It's called toxic epidermolysis.  Another name for it is Stevens—Johnson syndrome.  And we think the reason it happens is because people have to gradually go onto it and avoid the build up of the, of the lamotrigine in the blood stream.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What kind, what kind of rash?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you think about a typical rash, you know it turns red and you get blisters and stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This kind of rash the skin comes off, like a burn off and there hasn't been that I know of any deaths in the United States.  But when this was introduced in Germany, was where it came about, they didn't know and it was actually an epilepsy medicine.  They didn't know about this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, the children that were taking it were also taking Depakote.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we discovered that if you give this medicine with Depakote, it far raises the level of the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh no, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus, they just went ahead and gave whatever the dose that they were going to give.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, since they discovered this, what they've done is, just recommended how we introduce it to be very slow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To gradually introduce the medication and the rate of serious rash in the United States has been measured 0.08%.  Now, that's not death.  That means a serious enough rash to require the person to go to the hospital —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To be treated at the hospital.  But, it's treatable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Well, let me tell you what's been going on with me the last few weeks.  You see my legs?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have been breaking out in a rash and they cannot figure out why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you've already had the rash in the first place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm itching all over by back and my skin is coming off of my back for no reason.  They cannot figure out why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, now wouldn't be the time to start Lamictal.  Be, because with us worrying about you having a rash in the first place, we wouldn't start with Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm not saying that it's the only thing we can do, it's just the first thing I thought of when you asked me that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, we have to sort out what's making you have the rash.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I don't believe that Geodon or mirtazapine or lorazepam has been associated with rash.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I would hate to take you off the Geodon right in the middle of you feeling terrible —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whenever the least bit of Geodon protected you from a, from a flare up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'd be willing to try something else instead of the mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we, we didn't, you didn't have the rash when you were taking Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No I didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it could be that we just take you off the mirtazapine and leave the lorazepam and the Geodon the same and then put you back on the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Which one is the mirtazapine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mirtazapine is Remeron.  The dose she takes at nighttime.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Was that what took over the Prozac?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  She's out of that anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So, Wellbutrin and then something else?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Prozac conks out her sex drive.  Now, is it sex drive or sexual response?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sexual response.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In other words, her ability to have a climax?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I don't feel anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The ability to have interest in the first place?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh no.  She does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, good libido?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum, but I can't feel anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That usually is a medication effect.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have everything else except the ability to climax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, not always, but you, and you can talk to the doctor that's giving you the Topamax and see what they think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, my, my first reaction is, yeah, it's probably the medicine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Well, I'm itching and I can't, they said a spider bit me that was the first thing.  Well, first thing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said, "Well, it's a reaction," and he put me on some kind of cream and antibiotic.  This has been like this for almost two weeks now.  And —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We need to start looking at my medicine —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to change one medicine at a time.  We know you didn't have the rash when you were on Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, let's take you off of the mirtazapine because that's the newest one I gave you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And go back to the Wellbutrin and tell [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] I'm want to try working with him on the headache.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's a good point.  You, that started getting better after you ran out of the mirtazapine.  Because you haven't taken it in probably two days.  And it started getting a lot better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could be mirtazapine.  That's entirely possible.  He's right.  It could be a drug reaction.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Remember?  I told you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but it helps me sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  Well, we can look at something else to help —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He's going to get you something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We can look at something else to help you sleep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, that sleeping pill is doing good along with the morphine.  It, it, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You like the flurazepam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It helps me sleep.  It's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We're not going to take you off of that one.  Never was going to take you off of that one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I'm talking about is the mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  The one that took over Prozac.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.  I forgot about that one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  That was that one.  And actually it is —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, and we, and it had, it was [INAUDIBLE] it has.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Exactly.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it entirely could be —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  It has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll write that down as if it is mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you did have a number of drug reactions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, we're going to just take note that we will stop the mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So, what was it?  Was it something in the medicine like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We don't know.  And I know, what to do, when it happens, but I don't know why.  So —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But, they both have things that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and some people have more than others.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So, something in their blood is, just gets off and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Her body for whatever reason is sensitive and we have to be extra careful with what we use.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, she's on a lot of medicine, so that can throw her sensitivity off, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's do this —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I looked everything up when this, after it, it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's right.  He's right that it could be the Topamax causing both things, but if I was guessing, I would like to look at my medicine first.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see if the mirtazapine isn't it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put you back on your Wellbutrin because you didn't have that rash on Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Leave the Geodon, lorazepam, and flurazepam the same.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we'll reassess whether or not we go to Lamictal.  I can send you home with some information to read about Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  And that's the one that, that does the rash?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but we're not even going to think about —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, we just want —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] anything like that while she has a rash.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We want to see if it clears up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And you have some Wellbutrin left in your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't.  I have no Wellbutrin left.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You don't?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll go ahead and refill it.  Do you get your medicine 90 days at a time or a month at a time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A month at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And it's mostly been depressed days over the last month or what would you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Depressed because I can't, because I can't have an orgasm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, because, well, the sexual thing and that too, she feels ugly with her bites and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel, I feel ugly with my bites and I, and —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I tell her there's nothing she can do.  It can't be helped, so, you know, I mean, I tell her I love her and I do my best to keep her spirits up and what not.  You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's about it.  I mean, I feel ugly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I mean there's, there's a few other things, but that's family stuff and that, you know how family can go sometimes.  It gets hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mother in law is causing some problems —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sometimes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And other than that —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's been something though that's happened before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] stressor?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But, it's just something that happened.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, they told me, when the doctor at the ER, when it really got bad, I mean, it was really bad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He told me a spider bit me and —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She got an infection in her butt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He put me on a steroid and put me on a cream and it really did seem to get better with the steroid and the cream.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did he ever have you do that Aveeno oatmeal, that stuff that keeps your itching down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  He didn't, but I'm itching all over my back.  I can't control it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What you ought to do, what you ought to do, because this is just a symptomatic thing —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It isn't [INAUDIBLE] with anything else you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, in the drug store, they have a box.  I think it's beige and blue color.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's called Aveeno oatmeal.  It's not in the food section.  It's in the pharmacy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, look where they have stuff for rashes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what it is, it's a, it makes an emollient, which you pour it in the bath water, you make about four ounces of bath water.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you, and you put it there and it tells you how much to put in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you slosh, after you bathe —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you slosh around —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And pat yourself off and it leaves what's called an emollient.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It leaves a coating on your skin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can do that two or three, four times a day and it really cuts down —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On the itching.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  I'll try that.  Because I'm itching right now as we speak, actually.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, if you think about it, it itches.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I have two questions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um, I know, I know it's hard to answer why do people itch because it's numerous reasons.  But, you know, if you, if you sleep really hard at night and you don't move around a lot, does, it, it blocks off oxygen off at that spot and pores.  And when you get up it opens it up and air gets to it.  Can that irritate it and aggravate it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wouldn't think that would be as significant.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really?  Because [NAME OTHER], her son, does the same thing, but it's when he sweats because his pores are opening up and he starts itching because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Certainly, certainly any kind of skin irritation —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can make you itch.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they taught us that itch is related to pain.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I look at it like obviously your nervous system is telling you something is wrong.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Something is.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something is wrong.  So, so, what we try to do, whenever I see it is take away the things that might —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be irritating your skin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Certainly medicines are well known to do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  My other question is, she gets hiccups really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And it's usually when she eats or drinks and I mean, she could have one bite of food or sip of drink and she'll get bad hiccups.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What causes, what, what, is the hiccup?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You all are asking great questions today.  I, I really don't know why people get hiccups.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really?  Is it something in their thing that's just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We don't know.  We have looked at hiccups over the years and there's people, I don't know if you knew this, that have hiccups everyday.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All day for like months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I did not know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's a miserable —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But then you people do die from hiccups.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know about dying, but you may wish you were dead.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Miserable yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] single moment —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For months.  But, the only treatment that I've ever heard of, and you're never going to believe this, but it's called Thorazine.  That's the only treatment that I've ever heard of.  Of course, I haven't studied that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you know I've been told to eat pickles?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Pickle juice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it actually, it actually has stopped my —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, where was your source, where was your source on that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't know where I heard it from, but I actually drank pickle juice and it actually stopped my, my hiccups.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] mention the cure being worse than the disease.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, we [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, but it actually works.  I actually drank pickle juice and it actually stopped the hiccups.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I can —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't believe it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's the thing.  Obviously, right now —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Old wives tale, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your nervous system is not doing well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have nervousness and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Insomnia.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got itching.  You got hiccups.  You got headaches.  All those things are associated with the nervous system.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what we want to do is whatever we pick, we what to change one thing at the time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't want to change a whole bunch of different things because right now, you got so many symptoms, we don't know —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's going to what?  So, let's start with the simplest thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  And that is your first complaint you said was it really bothers me.  I'm getting depressed because I have a low libido.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or low sexual response.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, let's work on that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And let's see if the other things respond to what I do to that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I have a question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You know those —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't give him another hiccup question.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, no, no.  You know those m, men commercials that help better men's sexual response?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is there something like that for a woman?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that's an excellent question too.  I attended a lecture one time, uh, with the sex —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Expert people and they said we're a ways away from that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We don't really have anything that comes close and those by the way may be placebos.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You tell somebody, oh this is a real strong medicine —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The power of your mind —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Believes it.  Well, I'm really going to be a sexy beast tonight.  You know and so my point though is, we have some, some indication —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That there is placebo response to lots of stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There may be a placebo response to what I'm going to give her with the Wellbutrin.  I can even tell her about it and it still would be a placebo response.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because she has expectations that this is going to help me.  I took it before.  I got depressed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you know what?  This helped me before, so this may make her feel better just knowing that she's taking something already that's helped her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Is it because women are so complex that they —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I really think it's because when women have a limited period of time —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Relative to men that they have a high libido.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, some women as they get older get more libido —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, most of the time, it kind of goes by the wayside as their fertility does.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I got you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you look at, I mean, without going to far out field here, you look at any like biological population.  The hunting season is always during the female —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fertility.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I got you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's because the animals are relatively oblivious to their surroundings —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When they are mating.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It exposes them both to danger.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, the way, I guess the Lord protected us from —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The danger —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is at the time when it really wasn't productive to have intercourse —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That there would be less of it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because once you get past the time it's going to result in procreation —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then, it's just both individuals making it harder to kill when something bad happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, so, I tell people the women's magazines make women feel terribly inadequate.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you read those magazines; you think everybody's having sex all the time.  No they're not.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No they're not.  The average person over time, the sexual intimacy emitted is —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But as long as it's an expression of love, you're not interfering with her ability to express her love to you and be intimate with you and those things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then, I think the two of you all will be able to work this out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  Well, I don't know if this will help.  She only has one ovary.  Is that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, and, and that gets back to the hormonal thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does, does the testosterone production, which men, men predominate creature that has testosterone.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, believe it or not your ovaries also produce a small amount —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh really.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of testosterone too, which they think it's partly responsible for the sexual —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, it could —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Interest.  But, it could be that her hormonal levels could be examined by a doctor and see if there is anything that needs to be done there.  I found though, even when I send people to do that —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very rarely does anything come of it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  Would a female pill, since she only has one ovary help with any kind of hormone?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's better to ask the gynecologist —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Really?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Next time she goes in for a check up and see what they say.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But, I mean it's good to look at to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It doesn't hurt a thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I need to ask you some questions.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you hear any voices other people can't hear?  You're not seeing things any other people can't see?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't feel like hurting yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't done anything to hurt yourself or maybe plan to hurt yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had hopelessness as this has gone along or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You do not believe people are against you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't have any kind of disturbing thoughts of any kind that are out of the ordinary?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know where you are and who you are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not affecting your memory or concentration any of those areas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, you are feeling depressed more days than not —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Since we visited the last time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your anxiety level changed or is it about the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a little higher.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Her depression is too, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those do go hand in hand.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you say that the sleep medicine does help you sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is the best sleep medicine that I've ever been on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No disinhibition?  You're not losing control of yourself and getting agitated —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anger outbursts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Spend too much money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doing things out of control or nothing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, women spend too much money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we all do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, no.  I can't say that.  Wait a minute.  No.  Let's take a step back there.  I, I do, um, have anger bursts.  Um, but I don't let it out.  I sometimes want to let it out, but I don't let it out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I think it's mainly when she's tired or trying to sleep or something, she gets interrupted because —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [NAME OTHER], it's not only that time either.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really, I really hold it in.  There are times that I really want to let it out and I don't let it.  I really, really control myself and I really want to let it out and I don't let it out.  And it really, I end up like, I don't know.  I could, I used to cut myself when I was younger on my arms or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and I haven't done it in quite a while, but the thought has crossed my mind.  Not, to kill myself, but to release, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Release of frustration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, are you having any diabetes symptoms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excessive thirst?  Excessive hunger?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Excessive thirst, I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  We need to, the sugar was perfect.  We need to, let see if I can get [NAME OTHER] to check on, I guess I got a C—peptide, a fasting C—peptide.  Could you check with the lab and see if they ever got that C—peptide test we were waiting on, [PATIENT NAME]?  It's, uh, the medical center lab in [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  All right.  Thanks.  She'll call up and see what it shows.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What does that do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Remember there's two kinds of tests we do.  One is to make sure she is not diabetic.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is a fasting test.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The best we can tell, which she's not getting diabetic.  But, there is a C—peptide, which is a measure of insulin resistance.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is the beginning phase of becoming diabetic.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, of course we want to try to catch it way before it ever happens.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If she was actually diabetic, we'll let [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] take, take a look at things if that was starting to happen.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But anybody that's overweight we worry about them —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Becoming diabetic, so.  But you did have family history for diabetes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I have diabetes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've had it or the people in your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, it cleared up and you don't have the symptoms anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She lost some weight and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Got it under control.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Along with her blood pressure too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  There was no family that had diabetes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mother's diabetic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My grandmother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mother's side or father's side?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Father's side and my mother had it.  And my, my —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Mom's mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mom had it and my father's mother had it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, of the medicines we use of this type, Geodon has one of the least likely chances to bring about diabetes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, we're already on the right one, I think, to protect you against that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, I definitely think it helped as far as your mind going around and around the rest of the thoughts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those type of things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I used to worry about people poisoning me and feeding me food that was poisoned and stuff like that, but I'm not having any of those kind of thoughts or anything like that anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I used to.  I don't know what kind of thoughts those were.  I used to be afraid to say anything to anybody.  I wouldn't used to not eat at all.  Any food, anybody made, I would never eat.  Remember me telling you?  And I used to —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I got down to like 115 pounds, didn't I?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I was looking back to see.  Didn't you tell me you at one point had heard a man's voice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Had the voice saying "jump out of the car" and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that hasn't happen?  You don't have any kind of command, hallucinations?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, that actually happed today to be honest with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You did have one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened on that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I locked the door.  I locked the door on the car and I pulled on the handle after it was locked and I cried.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> When did this happen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Today.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> When?  Because you've been out of the vehicle every time I was out of the vehicle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> After we went to Lowes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We didn't go to Lowes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean after we went to, uh, Academy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, when I was putting the wheelchair up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  When we were on the road.  After we pulled out of the parking lot of Academy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.  I didn't, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We're going to watch and see what happens with the Geodon.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that doesn't mean anything as far as I'm concerned about sometimes people worry that that means I'm going to start doing stuff they don't want to do or it sounds bad to have a thought like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, just because you have a thought, doesn't mean you have to act on it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you recognize that that was abnormal and that was something wrong and you didn't really feel the urge to do that?  Okay.  Well, I, I'm going to help you, [PATIENT NAME].  I'm sorry that this is upsetting you to talk about these things.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, when you get depressed, we got to realize it's been a lot worse than this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know it has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this time you're a lot better on helping us and cooperating with us about, "I'm going to jump into the middle of this and we're going to get things right" like they're supposed to be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Takes time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think you knew it as much before.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think you were aware as much about the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.  [CRYING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Emotional.  That's all right.  Emotional instability and mood swings and what all that means.  Now, are you extra careful about taking Geodon with food?  Remember that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five hundred calories.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty much a sandwich.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes sir.  I do, do that.  I make sure I do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know how the study was, I found out, I just attended a [INAUDIBLE] this week.  You know how they did the study?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They were, they were, had the people ate lots of different kinds of forms of food.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was a Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast.  And so they had enough calories with the Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast was and that was of all the things they had the people eat that helped the absorption best of all.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it wasn't the fat content.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It wasn't the low fat.  It wasn't a great big meal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was 500 calories.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just usually have, um, I usually have pancakes, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eggs, bacon, toast.  You know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something like that and, uh, I guess a juice drink and that was —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I have one piece and that's about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More than 500 calories.  I was pretty impressed when they told us that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can have a real obscure chemistry like state.  I think [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did it, the fellow that wrote that book there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  Right there, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] wrote that little green book there.  That's one of the, he's called a psychopharmacologist.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I really enjoy his lectures.  He's probably one of the most knowledgeable and helpful —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Teachers I've ever had.  And he was the one who discovered that.  He's done a lot of different studies.  As a matter of fact, I think he was responsible for one of the earliest studies on Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, any questions about what our plan is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, sir.  I just say no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to write out the instructions because sometimes when you get upset, it's kind of hard to remember what all we're going to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We're going to write out how we're going to do this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We're going to stop the mirtazapine, and I'm going to write down the name of the Aveeno oatmeal.  You can look at it at the pharmacy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That would be probably at Brookshire's or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any pharmacy has these.  I've seen them.  I looked around myself at times.  [NAME OTHER] got poison ivy one time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  They're readily available everywhere.  Let's see here, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'm going to start keeping a diary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I would.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just don't think sometimes you understand how I feel.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, I can see that because I don't know what you're going through without you telling me.  But I would like to understand how you feel, so I can do my best to make you comfortable.  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And your mom doesn't help.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Hum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And your mom doesn't help.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Well, like they say about mother—in—laws.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any questions about what we're going to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I understand that I'm going to go back on the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  We're going to resume the Wellbutrin.  We're going to stop, in fact, I need to write that and be real clear about it.  Stop mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  She don't have any more of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, just in case.  If you get home and forgot that, I thought I had another medicine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stop mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Leave the lorazepam and Geodon the same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's going to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So [INAUDIBLE] let the pharmacist know that we are stopping it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They won't refill it without me telling them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, [NAME OTHER] will help you if we don't have that test, I'll get it to you when I do.  Because the information on there would be about the, uh, the labs —</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As soon as I get it.  Very good and I look forward to seeing you again.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> All right.</p>

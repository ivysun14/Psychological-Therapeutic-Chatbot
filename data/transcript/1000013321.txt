<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So back to our [all new room] (ph) to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether I want all this to continue or whether I'm looking forward to it to be ended. Since there's three sessions left -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Including today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I'm wondering how to think about them. Oh, after I left here last session I think your compliments to me gave me a kind of self-confidence. I went to a Domino's to redeem some coupons and get some pizzas to bring home and I had to wait for them and I - so I had a beer at the bar, which I would not do alone, and I felt very comfortable. And I recommend the beer there; it's only a dollar and a quarter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had a beer, you sat at the bar alone, and drank it there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, and then I saw a table and I went to the table and I took out my book and I wrote my little summary of the session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to read it to me? (Inaudible at 2:01)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have that, but then I have the list of things I wanted to discuss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I thought maybe you don't like me to read things. So I had this trip and I was thinking how I needed more compliments as a kid and I would have grown up with a lot more feelings about myself better, better feelings. Like I always think, "Well, I don't have enough ego strength," and I always think that if I just felt better about myself I could have done a lot of things with my life and gone ahead to do wonderful things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that my telling you last week that I would miss working with you I opened up that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And my not liking to hear the compliment, because I'm not used to gathering that kind of combination. Still, it works. It works.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though you don't like to hear us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After it's a -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then I was thinking about all the times when I was growing up and sometimes I'd get a compliment, and I wouldn't know how to handle it and I would like criticize myself and say, "Oh, no, it's nothing." But then I learned that all you have to do is say "Thank you," so then it's okay. I'm just going to say "Thank you" and that's the way to handle a compliment. So if you're not comfortable don't make a fool out of yourself showing that you don't know how to handle it. So all you do is say "Thank you." A simple thing like that you have to learn. But then I was thinking my dear old mom didn't shower me with compliments and I think it was the opposite. I used to, when I was a kid at home, throw scraps out to the cats in the backyard and so my mother would call me "Cat Lady." And not in a - I don't know, it wasn't a complete putdown, but it wasn't a positive feat. [4:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She wasn't admiring how kind you were to animals.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. And she used to call me a clumsy mutt. I don't remember being that clumsy but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In Polish, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the word again? Just the word.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A mutt is medved (ph). I think clumsy is kasalafia (ph). So all I remember are the curse words and then that, [kasalafia medved] (ph), so I think I care for all that. So that's what happened to my old ego. </p>

<p>Oh, and then the problem with loss and my theory of not getting involved so that you don't feel any loss. Too bad after my third therapist died and I saw that other therapist, she picked up the pieces, I should have like continued with her and talked out this whole problem. I don't know why I didn't. I didn't realize it would be an important thing to have done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened that you didn't continue with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I guess she wasn't the right replacement. You know, like you don't want a substitute. And I think maybe she was too efficient and maybe she reminded me of my mother. You know, she was too good, although I like perfection and I expect you all to be perfect, so I should have been happy with her being perfect. But I don't know, she didn't draw me in somehow. And I wanted to get together with all the others, other people that were his patients, but I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought about it, you know, since we've spoken about what it must have been like. It was a very odd kind of a wall where you can't share with strong people. [6:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was odd, yeah, yeah. So I was happy to go to his house, sit shiva. And so I went to his house and saw his wife, and they had two small kids, young children. Still, it wasn't as good as getting together with patients. You know, this was the settled, sane part of his life, and I couldn't relate to them as well as I could have to the people with problems that he was seeing. So I guess it was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would have felt less alone in your loss? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, more to share. But I put that all aside, you know. And they don't live with it, it's just they come here and you dig up everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's actually one of the few times, in a way, that I've heard you really say just straight up that you would have preferred to have someone to share it with, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you had a really - it's a very difficult loss and you had no one really to share it with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like you really felt a need, like you wanted to share that with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was that an improvement in my handling phase or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean was that a criticism, or a compliment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Is my wanting to share a variation of what I had been doing? Like it's better than going off and being miserable alone. But I've done that too; you go off and you be miserable alone, but then you have to anyway because... [8:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was just observations that you do tend to make it either a criticism or a compliment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was just wondering if that was like an improved way of reacting, wanting to share. That was - was that good of me to have done and felt that, or that was a normal thing to want to share your loss? So I should have kept going and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did I say that, or did you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said that; I should have kept going into maybe put to rest this idea of loss and avoiding loss and avoiding involvement in order to avoid loss. And so I mean I guess my - not having done that, I just lock myself in a little better in the direction that I was going, in my old, you know, creed: "Don't get involved and look what's going to happen." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You all the more - you don't have reasons to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so - to just continue to be locked into that. But I guess I didn't know at the time that that's what I should have done. I just thought of it last week. But anyhow...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would things be different if you had done that? It seems like you said you should have done that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean like you wished you had done that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because... [9:48]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because. Because. I don't know how things would have been better, but if this was one of my bad habits, a bad mental habit that makes life - that makes me stand apart from life because getting involved will result in pain down the road, so maybe I would have learned to get involved more and enjoy getting involved more instead of just secreting myself into my habits and hobbies and projects. </p>

<p>And I was thinking too all of the things that I keep; I don't want to throw away, I don't want to say goodbye to little things that may have some value. I know a lot of people keep things because they say, "Well, I may have use for this broom handle or this empty bottle or this empty wine bottle." I mean there's whiskey bottles that are so pretty; I don't throw them away. </p>

<p>And so all these things, I can't say goodbye to material things, and when I give things to people I don't want them to discard them. And when I find out that they may have or I don't see something that I gave, I feel very, very bad that they dumped something that I thought was very valuable. So I get into a lot of trouble with my family, giving them things and then sometimes things are returned and that's sort of hard to take too, that they don't want it, after all, although it was used temporarily and then it was returned. [12:15]</p>

<p>Another thing I had - a reason for therapy was to be accepted by others. Like I remember that time when I told my sister - she criticized me for something and I said, "Okay, I'm going to therapy, like I'm going to make myself perfect so you won't have any reason to dislike my behavior." And then I thought, "I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing this so that I can interact with others in a normal way that they do not object to. That's a dumb reason for going to therapy." But that's really, in part, why I'm doing this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're so objectionable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there may be some behavior that doesn't look good or doesn't sit well with others or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you want to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I want to be a more perfect person, for their sake.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So they'll like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you want people to like you more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to be a little bit closer to people, to some people? [13:57]</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, that's one way of getting closer, I guess. You behave in a way that they like and... I guess my giving things to my family, like furniture. Furniture; I'm big on having furniture refinished and giving it to anybody that has just gotten married and they need furniture and I look for things that they might fit into their scheme. But I'm interfering - according to my sister, I'm interfering. Well, according to one niece she liked all the antique stuff that I have, and that's in her old house in New Hampshire. But my sister always says to me every so often, like she did this weekend, "Why don't you fix your own house?" You know, like "Don't impose your style and taste on anyone." She didn't say that, but she says, "Why don't you fix your own house?" I forget what preceded that; probably my offer of something or another.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure if you're doing the right thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you are wanting to help people and get people to like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And instead, it feels like I'm putting a burden on them by them having to say "No, thank you" or "Please don't offer." You know, it's like I'm putting them on the spot. Of course, they will have to say no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it strikes me as being resized, like you don't know, you really don't know, how to get people to like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you try and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not sure how to go about it, you're not sure if you're doing it the right way. [16:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is with my family. Because you know, on the outside you know what society - what kind of behavior expects. You know, you go somewhere, you bring a bottle of wine, or a present for different holidays, or cake. </p>

<p>But yeah, I guess I'm trying to like fit in and mean something to my family, and most of the time I feel unimportant and unnecessary, really unnecessary. And then when things are refused, then I feel really unnecessary. So I don't even feel a closeness or like I'm a part of some special group and I'll always be accepted because we were somehow related by blood, and still, I have to like struggle to make myself feel that I'm part and then have them accept me or make myself feel that they accept me. </p>

<p>Well, like I saw my sister this weekend and she got a call from my brother's wife who said that her son doesn't want the chairs that we delivered to her, to Annie's house. We didn't deliver the chairs directly. It's always a long story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My brother's son and his wife got a house and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, before we go into the long story, tell me what it's like to be talking like this here, saying that "I feel so unnecessary." [18:08] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's it like to really feel unimportant to anyone, unnecessary?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it started when the twins came and I was at a loss as to... I can't say any of this without crying. Well, the twins came and I was six years old. And was I necessary in the face of these two wonderful creatures? And my mother never complimented me on anything, but she did the opposite, so I certainly didn't feel like I was a part of - an integral part of the picture. So I guess I had to find a way to, I don't know, make myself feel loved. [20:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how did you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I ever succeeded. Well, I know I could do that by taking care of the twins and liking them because everybody else did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Being useful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being useful. So that's what I do now; try to be useful. You know, like "Here's these wonderful chairs. They look nice in your yard, sitting on your deck," so I'm useful. And then when they don't want them and they buy a set that they choose, it's like the twins are back. "Here's this other set which is better than the one that you're represented by." So that's why I felt so bad when my sister said, "Oh, they don't want the chairs." And it's not that I didn't check it with them. I checked with the wife who owns the house and I checked with Annie and I described the chairs and I said, "They're bucket seats, they're plastic, they're great for outdoors and..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did your best to make sure that they're plastic and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I know if you butt in and just bring something on people it's not right, but, well, anyway...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And have you got anything to offer other than being useful to other people, other than helping them out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You have to offer something. You can't be - if you were yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did they offer you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: An invitation to visit sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why is that [good about me] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why are they [not top value] (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [22:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's just including me and sitting around the dinner. But sometimes there are other people there so then I don't feel too special.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I suppose I'm wondering that it sounds like everybody else just has value just by existing somehow, like the twins just have value automatically. They're wonderful; I don't know why. I don't know what they did for you that was so wonderful. I mean if they'd do anything for you, that was so wonderful I'm sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I should have a feeling that I'm equal, that I'm just as good as the twins or anybody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, should or shouldn't, I don't know, but it feels like you don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. You have to get that - you have to learn that somewhere. It has to be poured into you, the fact that you are of some value.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how would you know now if other people in fact do like you and value you? How would you even know it? Because if it's a matter of people show you that they like you by taking the gifts that you give them, you could be in trouble, because people may not appreciate the gift, right? Or they like might like it or this might be the wrong chairs or they might change their mind. I'm not so sure that that means that they don't like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean it has nothing to do with knowing whether - oh, wait, that's  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm saying that you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not the means by which to learn whether people like you or not, by their accepting your gifts. [24:16]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think so. I mean - because that's what you're telling me, isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I interpret it as saying, "Oh yes, they do like me, because they accepted something and they're using it and they appreciate it so..." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah yeah, doesn't that mean that they like your gift?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and not me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's on my mind here is that last week when I was trying to tell you that I will miss you and I do like you and I have spent a lot of time thinking about you when we're not here. And I'm thinking about how hard it was for you to really believe that, I think, or to accept that. I'm wondering if you even know if a person likes you or not. I mean would you have known if I don't tell you? How do you think I feel about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you get to know if someone doesn't like you; you know, the cues from people's behavior. And I guess in a therapy session it helps if the people like each other if they're to get anything done, so I know you didn't dislike me. I guess there's some middle ground that I should have grown into, you know, like not worrying about whether people dislike me and not worrying about getting their approval. You know, there's some sort of middle ground where you don't care and you're happy no matter what, which way the wind is blowing. [26:35]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where you like yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess if you like yourself that's all you need. You could live without having anyone else like you. You're just secure in yourself and that's like a great foundation. I could do anything from there and talk to anyone and like anyone or dislike anyone. I wish I knew what that felt like. Well, the feeling of when I had that beer, it wasn't quite that feeling; that I liked myself and I could interact anywhere and not care whether I was sitting in a bar alone. But it was more like - it was just like a peaceful, quiet, unconcerned feeling. Although I was aware of people around me and I'm thinking, "Those two guys are eating, this guy's smoking, and I don't know, is he looking at me or does he think I'm going to start a conversation, or should I move over there or..." And then I moved and sat down with this book without caring that I was writing in public. [28:24] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You weren't so concerned?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't concerned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About what people might think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, which I usually am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt more comfortable doing that. That all you really wanted to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Means that it was a nice feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was good. Other nice feelings I've had was going back on the subway and not hating everyone there and just sitting down and saying, "Okay, who cares what everybody's doing and who cares what they look like and who cares for whatever what." I just sort of put them all out of my mind or didn't make my mind dwell on any kind of criticizing of people around me, which I'm often aware of being like tense and disliking and "Let me get out of here, we'll move out of the city, look at all these people." That's the usual feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact, more calm or content.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but sometimes I leave here and feel overwhelmed and washed over and like at the bottom of a sea, a sea of discontent, but like not active discontent. Just like I'm lying at the bottom of the sea and everything is just on top and I just don't care and I'm just not able to do anything. [30:28]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it was different last week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What made it different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you were saying some positive things about me so I figured it was the compliments; that I had some boosting, a booster shot, to my ego.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It matters a lot to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I couldn't turn that into criticism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You tried.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I tried.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You tried. Are you trying to dismiss it in the sessions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm saying that I don't like to hear the good things about myself and it makes me uncomfortable and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I persisted?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something happened that you weren't able to dismiss, or maybe you decided not to. Maybe you took the chance of not dismissing it to see how that would feel. Because actually now that I remember how good you are at dismissing things and criticizing yourself and turning compliments into criticisms, I bet you you could have done it if you wanted to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you took a risk in doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm glad it helped you feel better for last week for a while. I guess I'm wondering what it's like now to be down to three sessions when maybe you're starting to take risks and really let me in, really allow the connection between us to be there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feel like more risk taking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels like "Well, good, there's only three sessions. I don't have to go through any more of this," and at the same time I'm feeling that, "Gosh, there's so many things that I wanted to talk about still and..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about the first part first, the part that feels good there's only three sessions, "That I don't have to go through that." Go through what exactly? [34:23]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go through feeling positive about you. You know the more you talk and the more you get involved, the more getting into an area that I want to withdraw from. It's like a quicksand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The closer you get?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feelings, feelings that it's like quicksand. Yeah, the closer you get, the more panicky I get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's dangerous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're swallowed up by the quicksand, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've been locking myself out of this kind of involvement all these past years. You know, I haven't been involved, even with Todd. You know, you just go along all neatly, tied into yourself, and not reaching out and not making connections and not feeling things. It's better that way. [36:15]</p>

<p>Then you come here, and all that careful structuring is going down the quicksand and I'm on a whole 'nother play  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's scary. </p>

<p>PATIENT: - which I don't know much about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just know that involvement will equal loss.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean that's what I learned, so that's how I operate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must be just terrifying because you're not used to it and you do everything you can to avoid it, and usually of course you're very successful at avoiding a kind of a deep connection in some way where you feel vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't even have friends that I'm connected with. I mean like I practice the opposite; have everything casual and not involved. And they're fine that you could talk to people and show an interest in their lives and be friendly and still not get involved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's better that way. [37:56]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Why to me now] (ph). This must be so scary, because like you say, all you feel and you can expect out of this is more pain in the end, because you know if you allow yourself to be connected to me and allow me to be important to you and then you're going to lose me, and in fact, even know you're going to lose me very soon...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what makes it so bad. So I got into this and I figure, "Well, okay, I'm going to blubber through the last three sessions and then I'll go back to the way things were, because I don't see any miracles happening or about to happen."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does anything about it feel good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About having to come here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About having allowed yourself to get so connected to me and to be so moving (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: About having to feel vulnerable? I guess I made myself vulnerable to feelings that I usually keep at bay until there's anything to feel good about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, or more specifically as well, does anything feel good about the fact that we're - we've gotten close? [40:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking about other times I've gotten close and they all ended, and it was good at the time, but it just seems that that's the nature of things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's a loss?</p>

<p>PATIENT: As always. And you just - like they say, you have to be strong, so you have to accept the fact that you make an adjustment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the kind of thing [like to lose me] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking of, well, I'll have Tuesdays free.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'll think about you now and then, but I'll go about my business, trying to solve things. This weekend downtown is having a flea market and we're going to sell there. It's getting to be a pain in the neck, tired of it, but this will be the last year, I hope. I just have a lot of things I'll be doing. [42:23]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll keep busy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you'll be busy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still look sad though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm just wondering how you will feel you would have helped me, how you helped me, because you want to do that, that's your goal, and I just wonder how do you feel about this experimental 30 days?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where is that question coming from? Are you wondering how I felt too? Ashley?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wondering how what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you wondering how it felt too, if that were...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I'm wondering if you think it has helped me or whether you think there was some success in this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if I think there was, then there was?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not so sure I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if you think there was, you'll feel good, and if you think there wasn't, will you feel you'll fail, or what? I just wonder, you know, objectively, how this will all seem, just how this all rates. [44:17]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wonder if I care, that does it matter to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you'll care about succeeding. You know, you care about doing your job properly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about whether I care about - you're smiling. You're right, you know what I'm going to say, don't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just waiting for a smile.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is such strange creature, this relationship. It's your job, but you'll have to care. You have to like me. I have to like you. I have to feel bad that it's ending. You know, I don't know what to make of all this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to like me and you don't have to feel bad that it's ending. You might [even like us] (ph). And I don't have - I mean how can I force myself to like someone, you know? I don't have to like you. It's not in the therapist's rule book, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well, you can still help people without liking them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's just that you can't make yourself like people. It's not humanly possible, really. I mean you can maybe work (ph) some of their better qualities, but in the end isn't it just a matter of whether you do...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember one kid I didn't like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus she was an antagonist; she antagonized people. But I guess you always tend to like someone who's crying in your office, number one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes them more likeable? Really? [46:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I was self-assured and self-centered and I came here with - feeling superior and, "Hey, help me Therapist, here's what I need. Now this is what I expect you to do." Oh, you know, if I had an attitude while needing therapy, you wouldn't like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might be surprised.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then that person wouldn't care. That kind of person wouldn't care. But if you're needy, well, that's how I felt with the kids in school. You know, if they were like scared, especially on their first day. Well, there's certain qualities in people that you react positively to and you react with liking and you want to help and you feel sad for the person and you want to do what you can. And of course kids crying will get all kinds of attention and help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, we need to end. But I want to say to you before you go that I don't like you just because you cry and because you'll defer to my authority so often. That's not the only thing you have to offer here. You're a very intelligent, decent person. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's what you'd like. [48:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you have a great sense of humor, and many other qualities. It's not - I don't want you to think that all we have to offer is kind of dependency or differential attitudes like telling me that I'm the expert and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, right. Like surgeons don't necessarily like their patients because they need to be cut open?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. You have a lot of wonderful qualities.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So I don't have to give people gifts, just give them my wonderful qualities. Okay. Did I get my full time with you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it's 50 minutes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Forty-five. It's supposed to be 45.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Forty-five? It used to be 50, years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now it's 45? Just like those candy bars that are shrinking. Those candy bars have gotten smaller.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is, right? Just like candy bars.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Okay, see you next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>
